In 1906 , Upton Sinclair published his classic book The Jungle , awakening America ’s consciousness to the horrors of corruption in the U.S. meatpacking industry with the story of Chicago ’s stockyards .
The Jungle so shook the American people ’s confidence in how their meat and food was processed , that President Roosevelt created the Food and Drug Administration to quell public outcry .
Fast - forward a hundred odd years later and all evidence points to the fact that we are living in an era of food crisis that rivals the turn of the last century .
Regretfully , America ’s modern food system has become – The Jungle 2.0 .
Indeed , there have been prodigious grumblings from Washington , D.C. , over food safety issues in the past months .
Thanks to the current peanut butter fiasco from the now bankrupt Peanut Corporation of America , our nation is once again in the throes of a record food safety recall , signaling that we need a serious overhaul of our nation ’s food safety system and the industrial food model .
America ’s current food system has the potential to create an epidemic food safety crisis much larger than even Sinclair or Teddy Roosevelt could imagine .
For a variety of reasons , including the corrosive influence of agribusiness corporations and lack of government funds , staff and training , we now live in a world where food safety in America is on the verge of facing a collapse similar to that of our recent financial , mortgage and housing industries .

The current crisis is an opportunity for the Obama Administration to make bold change in how this country addresses how our food is grown , raised and processed , tracked , sold , cooked and fed to American consumers .
Like all warnings that have come in the past , it would be easy to bury our collective heads in the sand and once again accept Washington ’s standard approach — throw a band - aid on the system .
But the truth is , we ca n’t afford it .
At least nine people are dead from the latest contamination and over 650 have been sickened .
However , food safety is not only important from a human health standpoint , but also for reasons of commerce .
With over 3,000 products taken off the shelf because a corporation failed to live up to the law , the impact of this recall could total over $ 1 billion .
According to peanut industry estimates , sales have dropped 25 % for a loss of over $ 500 million for the industry .
If consumers lose faith in how America food is grown and processed , they will lose confidence in the companies and brands that have become household names .
This not only hurts the food company , but also harms the small family farmers who grow and raise their food safely and ca n’t absorb the losses like large agribusiness conglomerates .
If the corporations that have helped create and reinforce the current flawed system do n’t care about their customers ’ safety , they should care about their profits .
Simply put , a poor food safety system is bad for business .
Leading food safety advocates are recommending an end to band - aids as usual .
“ What everyone needs to understand is that our country ’s food safety system is deeply dysfunctional .
As evidence , I need merely recite the recent scandals : spinach , pet food , tomatoes , and now peanut butter , ” says author and nutrition and food safety expert Dr. Marion Nestle .
As a former member of the FDA Food Advisory Committee , Nestle understands the root of the problem .
“ The system is fragmented between the FDA and USDA and deals with individual foods , not food systems .
It begins at the packing house , not on the farm .
And the rules that do exist are hardly enforced .
We know what we need to do to produce safe food and it ’s time we did it , ” continued Nestle .
Several proposals are out there to reform the system , including a call for a single food safety agency .
But the real question we must focus on now is WHO will be appointed to do the actual work .
The ability to reform a system starts not only with ideas or policy or even problems , but also with personnel .
Who is hired for the job matters as much , if not more than , the policy proposal going forward , which is something that large corporations have understood from the beginning and is why we are in this current mess .
So the first place to begin reforming the system is by choosing the right person for the job , which is why Food Democracy Now ! has advocated from the beginning at the secretary and under secretary levels .
Like President Obama , we agree that it ’s time to close the revolving door between government , corporate lobbyists and the private sector .
And , while we got some good news when President Obama announced Kathleen Merrigan as the next Deputy Secretary of Agriculture , there ’s a lot more work to be done .
The individuals chosen to head of the USDA ’s Food Safety and Inspection Service ( FSIS ) and other food safety positions in this administration need to come from the mindset that food safety begins at the farm level and that it must come before corporate convenience and profit .
They should not have a preexisting bias towards technologies that try to paper over serious flaws in our nation ’s food supply .
Nor should they have served as lobbyists for or executives in large agribusiness corporations that profit from the status quo .
We need candidates with a proven record of objectivity , individuals who have the courage and record to put real teeth into regulation , inspection and enforcement .
The fact is , food safety cannot be legislated or ruled into being if federal inspectors are not properly trained or enough workers are not hired or if farming practices are not fundamentally safe .
Food safety cannot be cloned , genetically modified , implanted with an electronic chip or medicated or irradiated into being .
Nor can food safety be solved by a quotidian reliance on additional technological interventions such as factory farming , excessive use of antibiotics , pesticides , massive slaughter houses and a consolidated non-regional processing system which have all converged to create the current food safety crisis .
Our political leaders need to understand what the grassroots already knows , that reforming the food safety system will come out of reforming agriculture .
The problem has been created by rampant market concentration and consolidation ; the solution is local and regionalized food systems , using sustainable practices that rebuild America ’s rural economies and produce the healthiest , safest food in the world .
Now is time to plant the seeds for a 21st century food system that respects the biology and cycles of nature , that protects family farmers , worker rights , farm animals , rural communities and offers clean , safe and healthy food to American eaters .
We must invest in America and stop speculating with our future by continuing along the same old trajectory that brought us to where we are .
Americans are ready for visionary leadership and creating a real food safety system that works is a good place to start .

DETROIT , April 1 ( Reuters ) - General Motors Corp GM.N has asked for $ 2.6 billion of low interest government loans to support the development of three new hybrid vehicles , according to a business plan update released on Wednesday .
GM ’s loan request , which would help develop two spinoffs from its all - electric Chevrolet Volt , raises to $ 10.3 billion the aid it is seeking under a U.S. Energy Department program designed to support development of fuel - efficient vehicles .
The request for low - interest taxpayer backed loans was made on Monday to the U.S. Treasury Department , GM said .
It was the automaker ’s third request for loans under the program .
It was also the first time GM has confirmed that it intended to move ahead with production of variants of the Volt , a battery - powered car that will carry a small , 1.4 - liter engine as a generator designed to kick in after 40 miles .
( 64 km )
The Volt , which is scheduled to go into production in late 2010 , remains one of the most closely watched upcoming GM vehicles and has been central to the automaker ’s attempt to reinvent itself in the eyes of consumers .
In January , GM showed off a concept version of a Cadillac called the Converj , which was based on the electric - drive system the automaker has developed for the Volt .
GM executives have said the top U.S. automaker plans to use the Volt system in other other models to raise volume and bring down the cost of the lithium - ion batteries the vehicles require .
The White House - appointed autos task force has given GM 60 days to come up with a restructuring plan that cuts costs and debt levels more deeply than the automaker had planned .
It was not immediately clear how that review process might affect GM ’s bid to secure the Department of Energy loans .
President Barack Obama has warned that GM may have to be restructured in bankruptcy if it fails to win sweeping concessions from the United Auto Workers union and bondholders .
Contingency plans for a GM bankruptcy developed by advisers would split the automaker into its more promising assets -- such as electric car technology -- while keeping lower - margin and loss - making operations under court - protection , a person with knowledge of the matter has said .

Pictured :
The hilarious ( and utterly pointless ) horses with hair - extensions
Sometimes things do n't have to have a point - they just have to make you smile .
And these images of horses with hair extensions do just that .
Jockeying for position to be best - in - show , it was up to award winning advertising photographer Julian Wolkenstein to keep the supermodels of the equine world in check .
As you do : Stylist Acacio da Silva and photographer Julian Wolkenstein made Harmony the horse look like a tourist in the Caribbean
Julian hit on the idea of experimenting with horses ' hair during a chat with a fellow advertising pal .
' The idea for these images came from a discussion with a friend who said , ' Hey would n't it be fun to shoot horses with big hair ? ' , ' says Sydney - born Julian , 36 .
' It is important to do personal projects just for fun , not to sell anything , but just to remind you why you make images , but mostly , and simply , to make you smile . '
Acting on the discussion , Julian , who usually works to a specific client brief , decided to explore this personal project to its full potential , resulting in these striking and unforgettable images .
Putting the project into motion , Julian teamed up with prominent hair - stylist Acacio da Silva to whip the horses into shape .
Just for fun :
Misty the horse actually appears to be giving the camera a flirtatious grin as she enjoys her new flowing curls
' Each horse took around four hours to groom , with hair extensions being added by Acacio , and then when they were presented in front of the camera 's and lights they would shake their heads , give a neigh and then ruffle up their hair , ' said Julian - with a somewhat forced grin .
' To get them just right , with their hair all set and standing to attention was a bit of a battle .
' But the horses loved the grooming .
The lights and camera , well , they were less taken with that .'
At first , Julian thought the shoot would be a quick affair .
' We initially thought how hard can this be ?
A couple of hours on each one , ' he said .
Only in Australia : Florence the horse looks demure with her fringe and ginger mane
' Well , we figured out pretty quickly on a test day that it was a major undertaking .
' Apart from casting horses and preparation work which took a few months , each horse took a full day to shoot . '
Even for a seasoned pro , such as Julian , there were hitches to his horse hair project .
' I tend to be drawn to projects where just in trying to describe and trying to explain the concept to all the crew and the people who supplied the horses was fascinating , ' says Julian .
' Most of the time you could see the cogwheels of the mind trying to work it out , trying to visualise it in their own minds , then , a bit of a smile , a chuckle and then the inevitable question - why ?'
Of course , sometimes - as these pictures show - it 's better to live life by asking , why not ?
( CNN ) -- Lance Armstrong could face punishment after being accused by the French anti-doping agency ( AFLD ) of breaking its rules during an unannounced test last month .
Armstrong is under the spotlight over a doping test he gave on March 17 .
According to a statement issued by the AFLD , the 37 - year - old American " did not meet the obligation to remain under the direct and permanent observation " of the tester , taking a 20 - minute shower before giving samples of blood , urine and hair .
Armstrong , who was training in the South of France on March 17 when the alleged breach of the rules took place , has denied any wrongdoing and insisted he merely asked for the identity of the tester to be established .
" I had never heard of labs or governments doing drug testing and I had no idea who this guy was or whether he was telling the truth , " he said in a statement released on the official Web site of his Astana team .
Watch more about the allegations »
" We asked the tester for evidence of his authority .
We looked at his papers but they were far from clear or impressive and we still had significant questions about who he was or for whom he worked . "
Armstrong said he and his team manager Johan Bruyneel and two other people were there when the doping official turned up .
" We told the tester we wanted to check with the UCI to confirm who he was and to make sure he was n't just some French guy with a backpack and some equipment to take my blood and urine . "
The tests subsequently proved negative and Armstrong , who returned to the saddle to bid for an eighth Tour de France title , pulled no punches in his opinion of the French authorities .
" I find it amazing that I 've been tested 24 times without incident and the first test I do in France results in more outrageous allegations and negative leaks to the press , " he added .
Do n't Miss Armstrong recovering from broken collarbone
Armstrong , who has returned to competitive cycling after a three and a half year layoff , has been dogged by allegations of doping despite never failing a test .
He gave vent to his frustrations on his Twitter blow on the day of the March 17 test .
" So I 'm clear -- never complaining about these tests .
Def part of the job .
Feel targeted ?
Of course .
But anything to prove I 'm clean , " he wrote .
But the latest row could derail his chances of lining up in the Tour in July with an spokesman for AFLD telling CNN that the matter was under investigation .
Armstrong is also battling to be fully fit after breaking his collarbone in a race in Spain , recuperating in the United States ahead of a scheduled appearance in the Giro d'Italia next month .
Quoting Barack Obama
SIR – I was disturbed to see that a quote from “ The Audacity of Hope ” was seemingly distorted to support the contention that Barack Obama does not value engagement with Europe ( Lexington , March 14th ) .
You said that President Obama 's book includes a “ reference to the idea that America should ‘ round up the United Kingdom and Togo ' as supporters — and then do as it pleases . ”
In fact , the passage in question makes precisely the opposite point and is worth quoting in full so that readers have the correct context :
Once we get beyond matters of self - defence , though , I 'm convinced that it will almost always be in our strategic interest to act multilaterally rather than unilaterally when we use force around the world .
By this I do not mean that the UN Security Council — a body that in its structure and rules too often appears frozen in a cold war - era time warp — should have a veto over our actions .
Nor do I mean that we round up the United Kingdom and Togo and then do as we please .
Acting multilaterally means doing what George H.W. Bush and his team did in the first Gulf war — engaging in the hard diplomatic work of obtaining most of the world 's support for our actions , and making sure our actions serve to further recognise international norms .
President Obama met Gordon Brown recently for a serious , substantive exchange about how the G20 countries can together restore confidence in the world economy .
Hillary Clinton , on her first trip to Europe as secretary of state , and Joe Biden , the vice - president , during his two visits to Europe , have made it clear that the United States is committed to fully engaging with our European friends and allies on a full range of economic and security challenges .
To suggest otherwise is incorrect , and to distort the president 's words is unworthy of The Economist .

Drugs and legalisation
SIR – We read your leader and briefing on how prohibition has failed to halt the trade in illegal drugs ( “ How to stop the drug wars ” , March 7th ) .
We agree with your assertion that a massive criminal market is an unintended consequence of controlling drugs .
Indeed , the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has called attention to this issue in a recent report to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs .
However , we reach a different conclusion to you and find that legalisation is not the solution .
Drugs are controlled because they are harmful , they are not harmful because they are controlled .
Legalising the use of drugs would be tantamount to losing a portion of every generation to addiction .
Choosing between public health and public security is a false dilemma .
Governments should , and can , do both .
To reduce supply , more resources are needed to eradicate poverty and not just illicit crops .
To reduce demand , more attention should be placed on drug prevention and treatment .
To tackle drug - trafficking , states should use international agreements against organised crime and corruption .
The fact that certain transactions are hard to control does not mean that they should be made legal .
I doubt that The Economist would support the legalisation of paedophilia , human - trafficking or arms - smuggling as “ the least bad solution ” .
Walter Kemp

SIR – You are right to reiterate the case against drug prohibition , but regulation and taxation just will not work .
Opium and cocaine are cheap to grow , high value and low weight , so the hundredfold mark - up to which you refer is almost wholly due to their illegality .
Any conceivable tax would fall far short of equating to a hundredfold mark - up , and would in any case be emasculated by smuggling .
Analogies with alcohol and tobacco are misleading .
Relative to drugs , these are bulky and low value , and neither face anything remotely corresponding to a hundredfold mark - up .
Regulation and taxation are thus fairly straightforward .
The only feasible alternative to prohibition is to take the international drug - trade into public ownership .
It is demand in developed countries that is driving this trade .
Licensed growers should be directly linked to registered users .
Such an approach could be phased , each country moving at its own pace .
Over time , the market share of illicit drugs would be steadily squeezed and trafficker income and profits would drain away .
Jeremy Berkoff
London
SIR – Separating the markets for hard and soft drugs is critical .
As long as cannabis distribution is controlled by organised criminals , consumers of the most popular illicit drug will continue to come into contact with sellers of addictive drugs .
Cannabis should be taxed and regulated like alcohol , only without the ubiquitous advertising .
Robert Sharpe
Policy analyst
Common Sense for Drug Policy
Washington , DC
SIR – The evidence in support of your 20 - year campaign in favour of legalising drugs has become ever more compelling .
In 2000 I argued in your pages that the drug war had failed based on my experience in Colombia in the early 1990s ( Letters , March 18th 2000 ) .
It is striking how much the costs of the drug war have mounted since then .
In Colombia , despite improvements in security and $ 6 billion of American aid , cocaine production continues at roughly the same level and about 3,000 people still die every year because of cocaine - related conflict .
Many ministers and officials will admit in private that current policies have done much more harm than good but are not prepared to speak out because they see no point given entrenched American attitudes or hostile public - opinion .
With the Obama administration showing a willingness to review both domestic and foreign policy this must be the moment to consider seriously the solution The Economist has so persistently proposed .

SIR – You have given up far too soon on the war on drugs .
It worked for Mao in defeating opium , after all .
The strategy is simple : send all drug users to “ re-education ” camps , execute the dealers , and most importantly , do so within the context of an authoritarian and isolated society .
A few more Patriot Acts , plus a healthy dose of protectionism , and we should be just about ready to emulate Mao 's success .

The following letters on drugs appear online only
SIR – As a veteran of the war on drugs , with some 1,000 arrests under my belt , I have witnessed the utter futility of prohibition .
There is no historic evidence that prohibition reduces drug use .
Just about anyone who is going to do drugs uses them , regardless of their legal status .
In fact , it is the notion of a “ forbidden fruit ” and prohibition - created profits that entice both young users and dealers .
Youths report in federal surveys that it is easier for them to buy illegal drugs than beer or cigarettes .
Polls show that very few Americans would try heroin or cocaine if it were legalised tomorrow .
There is no dam of potential drug users being held back by prohibition .
Ending it would remove the violence in the same way that repealing the prohibition on alcohol did .
This would be a pure win -win situation for everyone but drug dealers and terrorists .

SIR – Many illegal drugs , particularly stimulants like crack and ice , often induce violent psychosis in heavy users .
Crack and ice are also hideously addictive , far beyond the imagination of well - meaning people whose opinions about drugs were shaped by smoking a few spliffs in the 1960s .
Using a little willpower just does not cut it anymore .
Four out of five people who try crack , even once , are enslaved to it for the rest of their miserable , stunted lives .
Medical science simply does not know how to help these unfortunates .
The current drug war is a disaster , but any policy that increases availability still further will almost certainly lead to a catastrophic upsurge in random , drug - fuelled violence , as drug - gorging addicts lose their minds in a psychotic orgy of mass destruction .
Eric Worrall
Southampton
SIR – You are misguided in recommending that money saved from enforcing prohibition would be better spent treating addictions .
Drug treatment does little more than enable drug use .
In developed countries , rehab is the gateway to an expanding array of social - welfare and mental - health services that create disincentives for addicts to cut their consumption .
Studies touting the effectiveness of drug treatment have little validity because they are based on self - reports .
Dr Michael Reznicek
Psychiatrist
Spokane , Washington
SIR – Any amount of funds designated for stopping drug - trafficking will never be enough .
The higher investment in policing increases the price of drugs , delivering higher gains to the “ narcos ” .
These market forces will always make investment in policing drugs insufficient .
Mexico needs to reform its law enforcement at all levels , from petty thieves to white - collar corruption .
Nevertheless , America could show its true support by acknowledging its fair share of accountability in drug issues .
Mexico should stop fighting the war on drugs on behalf of the United States .
If America does not want a narco state as a neighbour and second - biggest trading partner , it should fight this war on its own soil .
Ignacio Gallo
Mexico City
SIR – An underestimated impediment to drug legalisation is the addiction of various governmental and law - enforcement agencies to the proceeds from properties seized in the quest to catch drug gangs .
Illicit drugs are a great revenue stream for governments .
Ray Wilfinger
Cary , North Carolina
SIR – Your solution to the drug wars is not at all “ messy ” , but logical and correct .
Ironically , on this side of the Atlantic , it is the free market , get - the - government - off - our - backs crowd that is crowing the loudest to keep drugs in the hands of the gangsters , criminals and warlords .
Condemning someone to the joint for lighting up a joint wo n't stop people from using drugs any more than preaching abstinence will stop people from engaging in sex .

Tackling Kenyan corruption
SIR – Ivan Lewis 's reaction to your review of Michela Wrong 's book on Kenya , “ It 's Our Turn to Eat ” , is tetchy .
The last paragraph of his letter challenges you to offer alternative policies to those pursued by Britain 's Department for International Development ( Mr Lewis 's letter appeared online only on March 12th ) .
Tempting , if you believed DfID would take serious notice .
Mr Lewis might have read the book before reacting to your review .
It contains ideas .
My suggestions would be : expose , campaign and isolate grossly corrupt leaders who have demonstrably damaged Kenya and its people 's interests and well - being ; stand by the whistleblowers when things get tough ; and stand on Jack Straw 's toes to clean up Britain 's own sleazy record of inactivity .

Handel 's handle
SIR – The first thing I learned in a musicology course given by Paul Henry Lang , a distinguished Handel scholar at Columbia University , was how to pronounce the great composer 's name correctly ( “ Georgian splendour ” , March 21st ) .
Omitting the umlaut in texts is bad enough , but forgivable if you do n't have a German keyboard on your computer .
The universal practice of music teachers and radio presenters pronouncing it as “ Handle ” or “ Hahndel ” was considered sacrilege by Professor Lang .
The proper pronunciation ?
“ Hehndel ” , through pursed lips , of course .

Tesla Model S : $ 50,000 Electric Car that Seats Seven
Note : Click for larger images
After months of PR , big claims , and worry over Tesla ’s future , the young company is finally letting us see the specs on their new electric sedan , the Tesla Model S. For a cool $ 50,000 , you ’ll be able to get a very sleek looking sedan that will have a 300 mile range and can do 0 - 60 in 5.5 seconds .
The price is a bit deceptive , because the $ 50 k number includes a $ 7,500 federal tax break .
While that tax break is good to go for any buyer right now , it wo n’t be around forever , and might not be around for long enough for very many people to use it on the Model S .
Also , that price only comes with a 160 - mile battery pack .
For more you can upgrade that range , but do n’t hold your breath if you expect that to be a cheap upgrade !
Seating 7 means that you will have to stuff two kids into rear facing seats in the hatch .
If you do n’t find 6 people to drag around with you , the Model S should be able to haul quite a large amount .

Tesla unveils world ’s first mass - produced , highway - capable EV
Model S sedan has anticipated base price of $ 49,900 , up to 300 - mile range and 45 - minute QuickCharge capability
March 26 , 2009
HAWTHORNE , Calif . – ( BUSINESS WIRE ) - Tesla Motors is now taking orders for the Model S , an all electric family sedan that carries seven people and travels 300 miles per charge .
The Model S , which carries its charger onboard , can be recharged from any 120V , 240V or 480V outlet , with the latter taking only 45 minutes .
By recharging their car while they stop for a meal , drivers can go from LA to New York in approximately the same time as a gasoline car .
Moreover , the floor - mounted battery pack is designed to be changed out in less time than it takes to fill a gas tank , allowing for the possibility of battery - pack swap stations .
The floor - mounted powertrain also results in unparalleled cargo room and versatility , as the volume under the front hood becomes a second trunk .
Combining that with a four - bar linkage hatchback rear trunk and flat folding rear seats , the Model S can accommodate a 50 - inch television , mountain bike * and * surfboard simultaneously .
This packaging efficiency gives the Model S more trunk space than any other sedan on the market and more than most SUVs .
“ Model S does n’t compromise on performance , efficiency or utility — it ’s truly the only car you need , ” said Tesla CEO , Chairman and Product Architect Elon Musk .
“ Tesla is relentlessly driving down the cost of electric vehicle technology , and this is just the first of many mainstream cars we ’re developing . ”
Tesla expects to start Model S production in late 2011 .
The company believes it is close to receiving $ 350 million in federal loans to build the Model S assembly plant in California from the Dept of Energy ’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Program .
Building on Proven Technology
Tesla is the only production automaker already selling highway - capable EVs in North America or Europe .
With 0 - 60 mph in 3.9 seconds , the Roadster outperforms almost all sports cars in its class yet is six times as energy efficient as gas guzzlers and delivers 244 miles per charge .
Tesla has delivered nearly 300 Roadsters , and nearly 1,000 more customers are on the wait list .
Teslas do not require routine oil changes , and they have far fewer moving ( and breakable ) parts than internal combustion engine vehicles .
They qualify for federal and state tax credits , rebates , sales tax exemptions , free parking , commuter - lane passes and other perks .
Model S costs roughly $ 5 to drive 230 miles â€ “ a bargain even if gasoline were $ 1 per gallon .
The anticipated base price of the Model S is $ 49,900 after a federal tax credit of $ 7,500 .
The company has not released options pricing .
Three battery pack choices will offer a range of 160 , 230 or 300 miles per charge .
“ Model S costs half as much as a Roadster , and it ’s a better value than much cheaper cars , ” Musk said .
“ The ownership cost of Model S , if you were to lease and then account for the much lower cost of electricity vs. gasoline at a likely future cost of $ 4 per gallon , is similar to a gasoline car with a sticker price of about $ 35,000 .
I ’m positive this car will be the preferred choice of savvy consumers . ”

Six weeks of political dispute have paralysed the country
The US ambassador to Madagascar has warned the country is heading for civil war after pro-opposition soldiers forced the army chief to resign .
Niels Marquardt said he was concerned and saddened by the Indian Ocean island 's six - week political crisis .
Senegalese President Abdoulaye
Wade has now offered to host peace talks .
Army chief Edmond Rasolofomahandry had on Tuesday given the country 's political rivals 72 hours to end a dispute which has paralysed Madagascar .
But dissident soldiers took over the army HQ and forced him to resign .
" I note with a great deal of concern and a great deal of sadness that Madagascar is - nearly - on the verge of civil war , " said Mr Marquardt .
President Marc Ravalomanana has been involved in a power struggle with opposition leader Andry Rajoelina since mid-January .
At least 100 people have died during opposition protests .
Plans for mediators from a church council to start negotiations on Thursday between the rivals were cancelled .
Mr Rajoelina had earlier said he would boycott the discussions .
His spokesman added that the church leaders lacked credibility and the time was not right for talks .
A statement from Senegal 's presidency said Mr Wade had asked Mr Ravalomanana and Mr Rajoelina to come to Dakar after receiving requests from both sides to mediate .
The Senegalese leader stepped in during a previous political crisis in 2002 , from which Mr Ravalomanana emerged as president .
President 's ' mistakes '
Andre Andriarijaona has now been sworn in as the new army chief , and he indicated his predecessor had been removed to preserve the cohesion of the army .
CRISIS TIMELINE 24 January : Opposition protests begin 26 January : Two protesters shot dead 27 January :
At least 20 bodies found in burnt shop 31 January : Rajoelina says he is in charge of the country 3 February : Rajoelina sacked as the capital 's mayor 7 February : Security forces shoot dead at least 20 protesters 8 March : Section of the army joins opposition 9 March : Rajoelina under UN protection 10 March : Defence minster ousted 11 March : Army chief of staff forced out
Q&A : Madagascar power struggle " Negotiations with the general were completed in the fraternity worthy of the army .
Now all the corps in Madagascar are behind me , and our cohesion has not been affected , " he said .
The AFP news agency reports that only the president would normally appoint an army chief of staff .
On Tuesday , dissident soldiers also forced the defence minister to resign .
President Ravalomanana on Tuesday gave a rare national address , in which he admitted to making mistakes and called for an end to violence after two days of looting in the capital Antananarivo .
The whereabouts of Mr Rajoelina are unclear after a French foreign ministry spokesman said he had left the French embassy in the capital , Antananarivo .
Frederic Desagneaux told AFP that Mr Rajoelina was no longer in the French embassy .
He refused to give further details , directing inquiries to the United Nations .
The UN had said it would offer protection to the opposition leader .
Earlier , hundreds of government supporters had gathered outside the French embassy , demanding that the opposition leader be handed over .
Mr Rajoelina , a 34 - year - old former DJ and Antananarivo mayor , went into hiding last week after the security forces tried to arrest him .

Cancel Christmas - Jesus was born June 17 , say scientists
Researchers tracked the ' Christmas star ' to a reveal the date of Christ 's birth as June 17
It may not be too late to send the presents back , as astronomers have calculated that Christmas should not be celebrated on December 25 - but on June 17 instead .
Researchers tracked the appearance of the ' Christmas star ' , which the Bible states three wise men followed to find Jesus .
Australian stargazer Dave Reneke used complex computer software to chart the exact positions of all celestial bodies and map the night sky as it would have appeared over the Holy Land more than 2,000 years ago .
He discovered that a bright star really did appear over Bethlehem 2,000 years ago - but pinpointed the date of Christ 's birth as June 17 , and not December 25 .
Scientists claim the Christmas star was most likely a magnificent conjunction of the planets Venus and Jupiter , which were so close together they would have shone unusually brightly as a single ' beacon of light ' which appeared suddenly .
Mr Reneke says the wise men probably interpreted it as the sign they had been waiting for , and they followed the ' star ' to Christ 's birthplace in a stable in Bethlehem , as described in the Bible .
Generally accepted research has placed the nativity to somewhere between 3BC and 1AD .
Using the St Matthew 's Gospel as a reference point , Mr Reneke pinpointed the planetary conjunction , which appeared in the constellation of Leo , to the exact date of June 17 in the year 2BC .
Mr Reneke , who is editor of Sky and Space magazine , said : ' We have software that can recreate the night sky exactly as it was at any point in the last several thousand years .
' Venus and Jupiter became very close in the the year 2BC and they would have appeared to be one bright beacon of light .
' We are not saying this was definitely the Christmas star - but it is the strongest explanation for it of any I have seen so far .
' Astronomy is such a precise science , we can plot exactly where the planets were , and it certainly seems this is the fabled Christmas star .
There 's no other explanation that so closely matches the facts we have from the time .
' This could well have been what the three wise men interpreted as a sign .
They could easily have mistaken it for one bright star . '
He added : ' December is an arbitrary date we have accepted but it does n't really mean that is when it happened .
' This is not an attempt to decry religion .
It 's really backing it up as it shows there really was a bright object appearing in the East at the right time .
' Often when we mix science with religion in this kind of forum , it can upset people .
In this case , I think this could serve to reinforce people 's faith . '
Previous theories have speculated that the star was a supernova ( exploding star ) or even a comet .
But Mr Reneke says that by narrowing the date down , the technology has provided the most compelling explanation yet .
A leading theory behind why December 25 was chosen as the date to celebrate Christ 's birth , was that it was selected by the church as it aligned closely with a major pagan festival , which allowed the church to claim a new celebration for Christianity .
However , if the findings are correct , it would mean a change from Christmas cards featuring traditional snowy scenes to sunny beach views in June .
In just a few weeks ' time , Canada 's eastern ice floes will change from a pristine nursery ground for young harp seal pups to a scene of carnage , as the annual commercial seal hunt begins yet again .
The hunt is brutal , unnecessary and wasteful .
Every year more than quarter of a million pups – 98 % under three months old – are clubbed or shot for their fur .
Shortly after the world 's largest marine mammal hunt begins at the end of this month , the European parliament will have a historic opportunity to create a massive setback to the Canadian hunt ( and other commercial hunts in Russia , Namibia , Greenland and Norway ) by banning the import , export and transit of all seal products in Europe .
This move comes in response to widespread condemnation of seal hunting from members of the public in countries across Europe , including the UK .
Last July , the European commission adopted a proposal to ban the trade in seal products from commercial ( as opposed to Inuit subsistence ) hunts .
However , leading animal welfare groups such as the International Fund for Animal Welfare ( IFAW ) have warned that the current proposal is flawed , as it would allow trade in seal products from hunts which in theory did not cause the animals unnecessary suffering .
This is a bureaucratic anomaly , as by its very nature the commercial seal hunt is inherently inhumane .
Seal hunts take place at speed , in remote areas and with little regard for the welfare of the animals .
A 2007 European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) report on seal killing and skinning methods concluded that effective killing does not always occur and that animals suffer pain and distress .
There is no doubt that each country that participates in such hunts would claim to do so in a humane manner .
However it would be far too costly to effectively monitor the hunt to verify whether the sealers comply with humane criteria .
All the evidence shows that a humane standards derogation would be impractical and virtually impossible to enforce .
It is clear to me that an outright ban , with no loopholes , is the only way to prevent products from cruel hunts entering the EU .
As well as sending a clear message to Canada that Europeans want no part in this cruel trade , it would have a significant impact on next years ' hunt .
History shows us the impact Europe 's actions can have on this remote hunt .
In 1983 , the European community banned the trade in skins from newborn harp seals and young hooded seals .
This ban substantially reduced the market for sealskins and thus greatly reduced the scale of the Canadian seal hunt .
However , following subsidies from the Canadian government in the 1990s to reinvigorate the hunt and create new markets for products ( primarily fur garments for the fashion industry and some seal oil ) the annual hunt has increased dramatically .
The sealers now wait a few extra days until the harp seals begin to shed their " whitecoats " before killing them .
These pelts are then legally traded .
A partial ban was not enough to end the cruelty .
This time around we simply cannot afford any loopholes which would allow commercial hunts to continue .
We do n't need seal skins – but seals do .
By voting in favour of a full and comprehensive ban in the European parliament this April , MEPs will help to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of seals from future hunts .
We can help stop the ice turning red .
Footprints in Wood Tell Story of Buddhist Monk ’s Prayers
In a story straight out of Ripley ’s Believe It Or Not , human footprints worn into a wooden floor mark the spot where a 70 - year - old Buddhist monk named Hua Chi , has said his prayers in a temple in Tongren , China , for over twenty years .
More than 1 1/2 inches deep in some places , the prints tell the story of unbelievable prayer frequency , which according to Hua Chi at one point occurred over 3,000 times per day !
Hua Chi admits that due to his age , he was forced to cut back on his prayers , and these days can only manage about 1,000 times a day .
Even by Buddhist standards , which stress living life in a state of meditation and contemplation in order to reach Nirvana , his original rate of 3,000 prayers per day is considered excessive .
Today , hundreds of students visit the monastery which houses the temple bearing the prints in which the soles of the monk ’s feet have become embedded in the floor .
There is little to say , as the message of uninterrupted belief could n’t be very much clearer .
Hua ’s daily routine is simple and never varies .
Before sunrise , he arrives at the temple steps , places his feet in his footprints and bends down to pray .
He then walks all around the temple grounds until it is time to return for more prayers .
“ During the first years I would pray 2,000 to 3,000 times a day .
But I have grown older , so in recent years I have only done around 1,000 each day .
I reconstructed this temple and have prayed and walked around the temple all these times so that after my death my spirit will not suffer , ” said Chi in a recent interview .
Chi is also a doctor in traditional medicine and says he likes doing good and making people feel better , but one can only wonder when he finds the time to practice .

You can't buy a Transit Connect yet , but it 's not stopping Ford from customizing it every which way , including one for the New York Auto Show .
It 's called the Ford Transit Connect Family One Concept .
Ford has shown a lot of Transit Connect concepts in the past , but this is the first eschewing the commercial side for the consumer market .
As the name implies , the Transit Connect Family One Concept is aimed squarely at families .
According to Ford 's design team , its meant for " the coolest mom , " whatever that means .
What we do know is , as you 'd expect , most of the features are aimed at kids .
The rear seats have a kid - friendly entertainment system , door sills you can scribble on ( explain that when junior writes all over Grandpa 's S - Class ) and removable seat covers to make it easier to wash off the never - ending stream of filth kids seem to generate .
There 's also integrated dispensers for hand sanitizer and sun screen , a set of walkie - talkies with charging station , an awning over the rear cargo doors — which have scooters built into them — and stroller storage under the floor .
But not everything is meant for the kids .
Included in the concept is the Ford Work Solutions package ( though re-dubbed " Family Works " in this application ) which allows RFID tagging and sensing in the car .
So , if " the coolest mom " is in a rush , she does n't have to rifle through the junk in the back , she can ask the on - board computer and it scans the area , finds the diaper bag , stroller , Timmy 's Game Boy and whatever else you 've tagged and decided you need to bring along ( the kids themselves , perhaps ) .
It also gets the first non-Fusion Hybrid application of the SmartGauge system , even though it is not itself a hybrid , hey you can still drive efficiently without hybridization .
There 's also the neat blue neon lights and overhead sunlight .
That 's stuff mom's like , right ?
Expect to see the long - named Ford Transit Connect Family One Concept debut on the stands of the New York Auto Show .
UPDATE : We got a first - hand look at the new SmartGauge — here 's our a video of the gauge in use !…
Ford Transit Connect Family One Concept : Smart , Green , Fun for Children , Parents Alike
ANN ARBOR , Mich. , April 3 , 2009 – Ford is listening to the unique wants and needs of families and responds with the Transit Connect Family
One concept – a space that 's all about helping parents and engaging children .
" Transit Connect is a versatile vehicle that can be adapted to a wide variety of applications , " said Mark Fields , Ford 's president of The Americas .
" The Family One concept delivers fun with function .
This fun , cool space is for parents and small children alike , combining fuel efficiency with advanced technologies that can help keep families connected on the go . "
Designed for " the coolest mom "
The Family One concept is based on the Transit Connect , a global Ford platform adaptable to a wide variety of applications , both personal and professional .
This concept vehicle represents
Ford 's first effort in showcasing the versatile Transit Connect for personal use .
" The customers we envisioned when developing the Family One are cosmopolitan parents in their mid-30s with highly refined design sensitivities , " said Ford Designer Chiwei Lee .
" They waited until they were ready for children and see parenthood as adding to their aesthetic portfolio , instead of smashing it . "
Transit Connect has a utilitarian form that offers 135 cubic feet of space on a compact platform , with agile driving dynamics ideally suited to urban driving and tight spaces .
The vibrant color scheme and expansive greenhouse area combine to give the Family One concept friendly visual character and a bright , airy interior space .
" For children , the conceptual intent of the vehicle is to be as engaging and entertaining when parked as it is on the go , " added Lee .
" The Family One easily transitions from functional family mobility to ‘ base camp ' when the coolest mom puts the shift lever into the park position . "
Playful Space
The second - row seats in the concept provide youth passengers with ample room to get comfortable , enjoy projected digital media entertainment on the bulkhead - mounted sunshade screens or look through the expansive windows .
Side rear inner door panels are water - pen friendly and easily wipe clean for the next round of creative inspiration .
Clever , family - friendly features include built - in hand sanitizer and sunscreen dispensers , family walkie - talkie radios that charge when docked , an integrated first - aid kit and cargo door - mounted folding twin scooters .
The storage area beneath the rear floor holds a folding stroller and an integrated awning extends from the open rear cargo doors .
Seat covers are removable , washable and can be changed to redecorate and evolve with changing preferences .
Family Connectivity
The Transit Connect Family
One concept vehicle uses in - dash computer technology to keep a family organized , on - schedule and properly equipped with everything from diaper bags to sporting goods , back packs and homework folders that populate the active family environment .
The Family One concept employs radio frequency identification ( RFID ) technology to keep track of all the items the active family needs to stay organized .
When the driver enters the vehicle with children , the in - dash computer will provide notification that Timmy 's hockey equipment is still in the front hall closet .
Using predictive algorithms to " learn " based on past usage , the system will identify missing musical instruments or homework on the way to school and will remind parents if they have n't packed clubs for a scheduled Saturday golf outing .
The system is designed to be intuitively easy to operate , with minimal menu scrolling and programming .
It also plays a role in safety – adding to peace of mind – as the system integrates with sensors to notify the driver if a child seat is improperly attached or tensioned .
The technology is designed to seamlessly integrate with the parents ' digital lifestyle .
Fun and Fuel Efficient
The Family One concept is powered by a 2.0 - liter I - 4 engine with four - speed overdrive automatic transmission – delivering 22 city and 25 highway miles per gallon – and features SmartGauge™ to help parents drive more efficiently .
Looking forward , the global Transit Connect platform has capability to host any one of several efficient engine alternatives , including EcoBoost™ power and battery electric propulsion .
Transit Connect Family One Concept Offers Fun , Connectivity To Engage Children , Parents ALIKE
Ann Arbor , mich . , April 3 , 2009 – The Ford Transit Connect Family
One concept vehicle combines high - technology features to keep children and parents organized and entertained with simple , clever touches that make family outings more fun .
" The Transit Connect Family One concept showcases futuristic technologies that can help keep busy , active families in the right place , at the right time , with the right stuff , " said Andrew Georgescu , product marketing manager .
" Parents will appreciate Family
One for helping them manage their busy lifestyles , while children consider the vehicle a place of their own . "
In a single day , the Family One can help busy parents by confirming that Timmy 's backpack and homework folder are on board , provide assurance that Josh 's child safety seat is properly installed and that the whole family can have a base camp – with shade – during soccer practice .
Family
One also can provide turn - by - turn directions to a new organic grocery store , coach drivers to maximize fuel economy and entertain a second - row passenger with cartoons while another passenger converts fractions to decimals in a Web - based homework application .
Family Works Connectivity
The Transit Connect Family
One concept employs an innovative in - dash computer with radio frequency identification ( RFID ) technology designed to keep an active children and parents organized , on schedule and properly equipped .
The concept vehicle uses Ford Work Solutions ™ technology as a foundation for family applications for the not - too - distant future .
Ford Work Solutions is an available collection of technologies and industry - first features that provide customers connectivity , flexibility and security to better run key aspects of their business – or their lives – from their Ford vehicle .
It will be available in key Ford vehicles , starting this summer .
The concept 's forward - looking Family Works application uses predictive algorithms , based on learning from past usage , to remind parents of scheduled events and the equipment required for them .
If the system is aware of a regularly scheduled band practice , for instance , it will simplify the process by notifying the driver if the needed musical instrument is not on board .
RFID tags can be affixed to any number of items such as backpacks , homework folders or sports equipment so time and fuel can be saved by avoiding unnecessary trips for forgotten items .
The system synchronizes with a smart phone to integrate with the parents ' digital lifestyle to help with hands - free calling , schedules , reminders and to - do lists , helping parents to be smarter and better prepared .
Safety and peace - of - mind for parents are enhanced , as the system wirelessly communicates with sensors in the child seat , assuring the driver that the unit is secured and the attaching tether is tensioned properly .

You do n't have to love anarchists or even like them to give credit where it 's due – their spectral attendance in the political arena guarantees entertaining fright .
Their pageantry and occasional wit is a positive caution .
And for sure they have been keeping the flame of direct action alight while other movements have been slow to do what movements are supposed to do – move .
But their contribution to the protests radiating across Europe – and yet to ignite our becalmed islands – is less significant that you might think from the panicky preparations for the G20 summit .
Bossnappings are not sprung by hooded urban guerrillas ; egg - throwing at executives is not the work of cuddly crusties .
The demonstrations against mass youth unemployment rustling through Greece may enjoy their support , but they are a mass movement of many origins .
Executives have been kept at work , forced to keep the company of colleagues they 're trying to dump , by French trade unions refusing to take no for an answer .
Executives have been left with egg on their face by Spanish workers , likewise enraged that only the workers are paying the debts of casino capitalism .
These European trade unions are relaxed about reminding everyone that the executives " who sow misery reap fury " .
There is n't a wave of anarchy flooding Europe .
But anarchism – a long and sometimes honourable – component of European radicalism is being encouraged by no less than Tory journalist Max Hastings whose normal hauteur has been broken by a splenetic outburst against Sir Fred Goodwin and the " robber bankers " who , he says , should get their windows broken until they wise up to the way we feel .
He exhorts us to " get the boot in and keep kicking " .
Perhaps Hastings 's violence is so intense because the posse responsible for this crisis number among his cohorts , he knows them , his party emancipated them , and he is taking it personally .
That 's why we should beware the " law and order " rhetoric that is beckoning the G20 protests .
Invoking the threat of anarchists is to misread the zeitgeist signified by Hastings 's call to arms – or rather , feet .
For the first time since the protest against the war on Iraq , an extraordinary national consensus is finding voice .
And for the first time in a generation , the TUC is mobilising .
Uniquely , it is organising a political partnership for the 28 March demonstration that stretches from Oxfam to the Salvation Army , from green to grey power .
There is a silence from its son and heir , the Labour party , because , of course , its leadership is shamelessly culpable .
But we need to beware not only the police but ourselves – the anarchists among us are estranged from the institutions ; that is their ideology and their modus vivendi .
The rest of us , from trade unionists and non-governmental organisations , to reds , greens and blues probably agree with TUC general secretary Brendan Barber that we need to rise to the time , intellectually and ideologically , to produce a fairer and greener world out of this crisis .
He 's right .
The trade unions need to become assertive in the strongest sense – though diminished they are still a mass membership movement , they need to escape from their craven subordination to a government that needs their money but derides their influence .
They need to translate their institutional presence into power .
And for the first time in their history , they need to use their institutional expertise to check out what " fairer , greener globalisation " might mean and to help make it so : by transcending their own borders , by abandoning the short - term , anti-green calculations that have often made trade unions enemies of the environment , and the traditional sexism that made them enemies of equality .
Now is the time for a new social contract – not just the kind of deal negotiated between Labour and the unions in 1974 ( interesting and innovative though it was ) but a historic approach fashioned from a scale of networking , imagination and intervention that we 've not had in Britain in living memory .
So , the question is not – as we might have mused a couple of years ago – if , or when , but how , now ?
The International Emmy Award - winning BBC TV series , Top Gear , is a program about cars .
Though motor vehicles are not normally a topic of concern for me personally , I could not help but sit with my mouth wide open while watching this clip from a 2008 episode filmed in Alabama .
The hosts are presented with the task of sabotaging one another 's cars to see just how much " attention " they can amass .
What ensues next is much more than they planned for .
As the host says before the project begins , there are three religions in this territory :
George Bush
God
Country & Western
Please note that I in no way , mean to insult Alabamians .
I know that stereotyping any one group is dangerous and imprudent ; and that of course , few citizens in the state would respond in this manner .
However , the handful that they do encounter are rather astounding .
The Australian government agency charged with classifying movies and video games has reportedly been hacked in protest of the nation 's controversial ISP - level Internet filtering scheme .
The culprits replaced the website 's introductory text with a comical message which characterizes the government 's censorship program as an attempt to " control and sheepify the nation . "
In the all - important war against pictures of boobies on the Internet , the government of Australia has spared no expense .
In 2006 , after conducting a study which determined that ISP - level filtering was not feasible , the nation spent $ 116 million to develop Internet filtering software that parents could install on computers .
When this software was easily circumvented by children , the government decided to try again with an $ 89 million ISP - level filtering scheme based on a blacklist devised by the Australian Communication and Media Authority ( ACMA ) .
The ambitious filtering plan , which was announced in 2007 at an event hosted by the Australian Christian Lobby and televised live to 700 churches across the country , looked like a costly way to appease conservative voters rather than a practical approach to shielding children from seeing unclad naughty bits .
The filtering scheme is designed to have two tiers , a mandatory level of filtering that blocks " illegal " content and an optional ( opt - out ) level of filtering that blocks content which ACMA has determined is only suitable for an adult audience .
Concerns about the scope of filtering were raised last year following a call by Australia 's conservative Family First party to expand the mandatory tier so that it encompasses legal content .
The filters have consistently been shown to be problematic and suffer from a high volume of false positives .
The government has ignored the issue and has attempted to stifle critics .
The latest embarrassment for the program came when ACMA 's blacklist was published on Wikileaks .
A number of legitimate , non-adult websites — including the website of a dentist — were found on the list alongside links to child pornography distributors .
The government initially denied that the leaked lists were legitimate , but later reversed that claim and acknowledged that some items were erroneously included as a result of technical errors .
The hackers hit the classification board 's website on Thursday and changed the homepage , leaving the message below , captured by the Australian gaming site Atomic MPC :
This is the text of the message inserted by the attackers :
This site contains information about the boards that have the right to CONTROL YOUR FREEDOMZ .
The Classification Board has the right to not just classify content ( the name is an ELABORATE TRICK ) , but also the right to DECIDE WHAT IS AND ISNT APPROPRIATE and BAN CONTENT FROM THE PUBLIC .
We are part of an ELABORATE DECEPTION from CHINA to CONTROL AND SHEEPIFY the NATION , to PROTECT THE CHILDREN .
All opposers must HATE CHILDREN , and therefore must be KILLED WITH A LARGE MELONS during the PROSECUTION PARTIES IN SEPTEMBER .

A JAZZ musician has revealed the “ terrifying ” moment armed police raided his house carrying automatic weapons as part of a major anti-terror operation .
Victor Frederick , 63 , was arrested and strip - searched just yards from his home , just moments after his partner Andrea Heath and their daughter had infra-red sights trained at them and were told they would be shot if they moved .
No charges were ever brought against Mr Frederick .
Yesterday , in a press conference at the Senedd in Cardiff Bay , Plaid Cymru AM Leanne Wood said South Wales Police had serious questions to answer about what she believes could easily have become a Welsh version of the Jean Charles de Menezes tragedy .
The innocent Brazilian was shot dead on a London tube train in 2005 by police who wrongly thought he was a terrorist .
South Wales Police last night insisted its officers had acted “ in good faith based on genuine concerns ” .
But Mr Frederick , who has lived in Cardiff for 35 years and is originally from St Kitts in the West Indies , told how :
police confiscated apparently suspicious items , which included a video of boxer Muhammad Ali and a ceramic urn containing a traditional West Indian drink ;
police interpreted soundproofing equipment and wiring from his musical studio as a potential sign of illicit activity ;
he was followed by a police helicopter flying just above him more than two weeks after last month ’s raid on his house in Holmesdale Road , Grangetown .
Speaking at yesterday ’s press conference , Mr Frederick , who has previously performed with his band at the local police ball , said : “ This was a really terrifying experience .
I can only think that the police received a malicious call suggesting there was some kind of a bomb factory in the recording studio I use with my band , the Cougars .
“ I ’d had a sense that I was under surveillance three days before I was arrested .
On the Saturday I drove up to Radyr ( in North Cardiff ) to do a workshop and I was aware of a car following me .
“ Then there was a strange incident where on the Sunday one of the other guys who uses the studio thought there had been a break - in , but found a note from the police saying they had been in the building .
“ I was stopped by armed police officers as I was very close to my home .
“ They had automatic weapons and were very jumpy .
I was worried they were going to shoot .
I did n’t know what was happening – they just grabbed me and strip searched me in the street .
They told me I was being arrested on suspicion of making explosives , and took me off to Rumney police station , where they held me .
“ Later , when I was being questioned , I was told they had found nothing and they would be letting me go . ”
Ms Heath , 49 , a youth and community worker in Cardiff , said : “ I heard a key in the front door of our home and thought it was Victor returning .
“ I heard some scuffling sound and shouting .
When I opened the door there were four police officers armed with machine guns which had infra-red sights .
“ The whole street had been cordoned off .
I could see Victor in his underpants outside with police training guns on him .
Other officers trained guns on me .
I was told I would be shot if I moved .
It was absolutely terrifying .
“ Our daughter was upstairs .
She told me later that she had a camera and thought about taking pictures of the police activity and commotion .
It ’s awful to think what might have happened if the police had seen a camera flash from the upstairs window and assumed it was a gun . ”
Mr Frederick , who sings and plays bass guitar with his band the Cougars , said : “ I ’ve always had a good relationship with the police and have never been in trouble .
In fact a couple of years ago the band played at a police ball in Bridgend .
“ Of course I accept that the police have to check out tip - offs about terrorist activity , but this was totally over the top .
“ You ’d think they would need something pretty substantial before they mounted a big operation like this .
There were loads of officers involved , many of them armed , and a helicopter over head .
“ This must have been ordered from very high up in the force and we think South Wales Police should give a full explanation about why they decided it was necessary to mount an operation of this scale . ”
Ms Heath said : “ We have decided to make a big fuss about this firstly because we want everyone to know that we are entirely innocent .
Obviously when an operation like this happens , many people will believe the police had a reason to do what they did .
In fact there were no grounds for them to take this action at all .
“ We also want there to be no question of anything like this happening again .
Since the event we have spoken to a community police officer who is responsible for the area where we live .
He told us he knew nothing in advance of what happened .
He also told us he was aware of two other local instances where people had been targeted in the same way as us and nothing had been found .
Before the police do something like this , they should have more than just a tip - off which could be malicious . ”
The couple believe there may have been a racial element to the targeting of Mr Frederick .
White musicians who also use the studio were not the subject of such an operation .
And the list of supposedly suspicious items found by the police at the studio included a reference to an “ ethnic ” container holding a “ colourless odourless liquid found in the fridge ” .
In fact the liquid was a West Indian drink called Mauby , sold in many shops in Cardiff .
Reference was also made to a “ video tape relating to Pakistan ” , when according to Mr Frederick the only video tape in the studio was about the boxing champion Muhammad Ali .
A South Wales Police spokeswoman said : “ South Wales Police received information on suspicious items in a property in Grangetown , Cardiff .
“ On February 17 , armed police officers were deployed as a precaution to ensure the safety of the public and officers and a 63 - year - old man was arrested .
He was later released without charge .
“ South Wales Police accepts Mr Frederick has done nothing wrong , and our officers acted in good faith in response to genuine concerns .
“ South Wales Police has a duty to thoroughly investigate all potentially suspicious incidents in order to protect our communities .
“ We received a letter from Ms Leanne Wood on Monday and are currently considering our response . ”
The Independent Police Complaints Commission confirmed that Tom Davies , its Commissioner for Wales , had received a copy of Ms Wood ’s letter to the Chief Constable .

PEP 237 : Unifying Long Integers and Integers Python 2.x has two integral types : int and long .
The int type is limited to the machine 's " native " word size ( 32 or 64 bit in modern machines ) .
Operations on the int type can overflow and result in OverflowError exceptions ( before Python 2.2 ) .
In contrast , the long type is limited only by the amount of available memory , and could conceptually represent any integer .
The reason for having two integer types is that int is very efficient because it has direct support in hardware and OSs , while the long type is flexible and does n't require the developer to keep tabs on the size of numbers .
But having two types presents several problems when porting compiled Python files or pickled objects across machines with different architectures .
The goal of PEP - 237 is to eventually unify these two concepts , combining them into a single integer type that changes its representation internally to use the more efficient machine integer when possible .
The implementation actually stretched across four different versions : 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 , and is now complete in 3.0 .
Python 2.4 and higher already support auto- promotion of int to long without exceptions or warnings .
Python 3.0 simply eliminated the long type and long literals at the Python level .
If you try to use long in Python 3.0 you will get an error :
>>> long Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " < stdin > " , line 1 , in < module > NameError : name ' long ' is not defined Python 3.0 also removed the L suffix for longs .
Now , an integer is an integer is an integer .
In Python 2.5 this is fine :
>>> 5L 5L But in Python 3.0 it's a syntax error :
>>> 5L File " < stdin > " , line 1 5L ^ SyntaxError : invalid syntax In Python 2.5 the following code generates a long object :
>>> x = 5 ** 88 >>> type(x ) < type ' long ' > >>> x

In
Python 3.0 it's an int :
>>> x = 5 ** 88 >>> type(x ) < class ' int ' > >>> x
32311742677852643549664402033982923967414535582065582275390625 PEP
3127 : Integer Literal Support and Syntax Python has always supported a plethora of radices or bases for integers .
The int ( ) and long ( ) functions in Python 2.5 accept a second argument , which is the base to convert from .
The base can be any integer between 2 and 36 ( inclusive ) :
>>> int ( '000111 ' , 2 ) 7 >>> int( '000111 ' , 1 ) Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " < stdin > " , line 1 , in < module > ValueError : int ( ) base must be >= 2 and <= 36 >>> int ( '000111 ' , 36 ) 1333 TypeError : long ( ) can't convert non-string with explicit base >>> long ( '555555555555555555555555555555555555555 ' , 6 ) 2227915756473955677973140996095L
Python 3.0 preserves this functionality ( although the error message says arg 2 instead of base ) :
>>> int( '0001111 ' , 2 ) 15 >>> int ( ' 5 ' , 36 ) 5 >>> int ( ' 5 ' , 37 ) Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " < stdin > " , line 1 , in < module > ValueError : int ( ) arg 2 must be >= 2 and <= 36 Python 2.5 also supported integer literals in octal and hexadecimal , so whenever an integer was expected you could provide an octal or hexadecimal number instead .
Octal numbers required a leading zero , as in 0123 ; hexadecimal numbers required both a leading zero and the character x or X , as in 0x123 .
Finally , there are two functions called oct ( ) and hex ( ) , each of which takes an integer and returns its string representation in octal or hexadecimal , for example :
>>> 010 8 >>> 010 + 8 16 >>> 0 xa 10 >>> 0 xa + 010 + 2 20 >>> oct ( 20 ) ' 024 ' >>> hex ( 20 ) ' 0x14 '
Python 3.0 maintained all this functionality , but with one small change — the prefix for octal numbers is now a zero and the character o or O as in 0O123 instead of just 0123 .
The original notation with the single leading zero was borrowed from C programming language .
The change reduces the possibility for confusion for developers unfamiliar with C - like languages or with octal numbers .
The expectation of such developers is that leading zeros do n't change the value of numbers .
For example , they might try to use leading zeros for formatting and indentation purposes and unwittingly end up with the wrong numbers .
In addition , Python 3.0 adds a binary literal .
All in all , this break from the C legacy creates a uniform notation for integer literals in bases 2 , 8 , and 16 ( binary , octal , and hexadecimal ) .
The prefixes are 0b , 0o and 0x :
>>> 0b10 2 >>> 0o10 8 >>> 0x10 16 There is also a new bin ( ) function that converts integers to a binary string representation ( analogous to oct ( ) and hex ( ) ) :
>>> bin(5 ) ' 0b101 ' >>> bin( 0x10 ) ' 0b10000 ' >>> bin( 0o10 ) ' 0b1000 '
The oct ( ) function of course uses the new 0o prefix and not the old 0 prefix as in Python 2.5 :
>>> oct ( 12 ) ' 0 o14 '
I feel that this change , while pretty minor in the great scheme of things , is an elegant and clean win -win solution .
It removed an obstacle from the path of new users , it made a clean break from the past ( octal notation in C ) , and it unified the notation for radix literals , which is important when adding the new binary literal .

Applications which emit a notification that prompts for an action ­— something which they only would have done if they explicitly wanted to avoid grabbing focus , since popping up a dialog box is easy enough — will have a modal dialog box pop up and grab the user 's focus while they 're working .
Timeouts are no longer honored .
It so happens that in my application I have an operation which takes 2 minutes to time out ; I would really like my notification to stay on - screen for this entire time .
I can still do this with notify - osd , but in order to do so I have to watch for the " closed " event and constantly create new notifications .
A smoothly animating timer was a much nicer interface than a sequence of bubbles saying " In 30 seconds I will time out .
In 25 seconds I will time out .
In 20 seconds I will time out . "
Yes , I realize that the Ubuntu desktop team will say that I should do something different in this situation , but they 're not designing my application and I do n't like the options they 've suggested .
This would be much less of a problem if the provided notification timeout were n't so distressingly fast .
As a user , by the time I 've realized that a notification has popped up and taken the time to focus my eyes on it , it disappears halfway through my reading its message .
I am a very fast reader , and I 'm pretty sure that there are a lot of people who are never really going to notice any notify - osd bubbles ; they 're so fleeting , they 're just visual noise .
Markup is now silently ignored .
I can't emphasize portions of a notification with a larger font , or provide a hyperlink to the origin of the notification .
Similarly , since actions have been broken , I can't provide an action to jump to what caused the notification .
Notifications have thus become disconnected UI element which tell user something while providing them absolutely no tools to deal with it or respond to it .
For example , when Pidgin tells me that a user has signed on , I can no longer interact with the notification to say " yes , I would like to talk to that person " .
I have to switch windows to the buddy list , locate the person who just signed on , and click on their name , rather than just clicking on the notification itself .
Or , I have to click on the tiny notification - daemon status icon that 's a hard target to hit with my mouse , rather than a big friendly button .
Notifications are now displayed in the upper - right - hand corner of the screen ( where important chrome , like close boxes , search boxes , toolbars , and menus frequently reside ) rather than in the lower - right , where less important application features are traditionally located .
Granted , this is a damned - if - you - do - damned - if - you - do n't situation , because some applications put important action buttons in the lower right , but I have been learning where to position my windows to avoid that area of the screen for years , and now I have to learn new habits .
Notifications can no longer be positioned on screen , relative to either widgets in windows or status icons .
This removes the ability for an application to use notifications to draw attention to a particular area of the screen .
Instead , users must make some connection between the notification bubble and the status icon themselves , perhaps by identifying some common graphical element .
If you 're already using the " icon " area of the notification to display a picture ( such as a person 's portrait ) it 's a bit cramped to also show a copy of the status icon , especially given that the icon will now be squished for you so it 's hard to get a pixel - accurate rendering of the status icon anyway .
Some of these problems are nominally addressed by the new " indicator applet " facility in Jaunty , but ...
The indicator applet and libindicate library appear to be almost completely undocumented ; the " reference manual " looks like it was an auto - generated stub .
The automatically generated API documentation is n't hosted online anywhere .
The python bindings for libindicate are similarly undocumented , and they are n't packaged anywhere , not even a PPA .
They also use autoconf , rather than distutils , for installation , so their build process does n't produce a usable extension module and thus they resist installation anywhere but in /usr .
I tried to read what passes for documentation — the patch to Pidgin 's libnotify plugin that switches it to use libindicate for some things .
I tried it out because I wanted to see if maybe the indicator applet could address some of my concerns , but my misuse of the API caused the indicator applet to instantly segfault .
From what I can tell , you can't just provide an icon and some text , you need to actually create a . desktop file , which means that packaging applications which want to use the indicator applet automatically gets two additional layers of complexity : first , you need to create a . desktop entry , and second , you need to figure out a way to have your application include it during installation .
I have recently been working on some applications that make use of the features provided by notification - daemon .
I installed Jaunty to check out how the much - vaunted new notifications framework works and how it would affect these applications .
I was aware that it sacrificed some features , but I was n't worried .
I am generally a fan of the GNOME philosophy of dropping functionality and configurability when it does n't really serve the user .
I also appreciated the new , more minimal and sleek - looking graphic design of the notifications .
I feel like I need to preface my reactions with an apology .
I really like Ubuntu .
In many ways Jaunty looks really slick , and I 'm generally enthusiastic to upgrade .
But this notifications stuff ?
Wow .
What a disaster .
First , a little background .
I recently started working on two different applications which made heavy use of the notification API .
While I originally thought I 'd need to implement some of the notification features that I wanted on my own , I was pleasantly surprised to discover that notification - daemon provided almost all of them .
I want to present the user with a time - critical notification , one which did n't grab the focus and interrupt their work .
I want to show the user how much time they had to respond , and provide a few different options for responding to certain notifications .
In one application , I 'm implementing a sort of dead - man 's switch , where failing to respond within the time limit also counts as a negative response .
I also want to emphasize certain notifications , and provide hyperlinks to their web - based origin so the user can jump straight into the application at the appropriate point if a notification is interesting .
Some of the notifications I want to generate are notifications of events , some are indications of a change in status of my application ; so sometimes I want to point at a particular status icon and sometimes I wanted to just drop the notification into a queue - hopefully a global queue which would intermix with other notifications .
I was assuming that I 'd need to implement some of these features myself , but to my pleasant surprise notification - daemon handled every single use - case , more or less exactly how I envisioned it working .
I was thrilled .
As part of searching around for " notification " stuff , I learned that Jaunty will have some newer , even cooler notifications stuff , and I was really excited .
Unfortunately , Notify - OSD , the new Ubuntu - specific notification daemon , drops nearly all of these features .
So , I 'm back to square one .
Here are some of the specific things which bothered me about it .
It 's interesting to read the version history for Growl , the OS X notification tool which so clearly provided the visual inspiration for Notify - OSD , and notice that many of the features now being removed ( application level positioning , close buttons on notifications ) are features which wereto later versions of Growl .
The " notification design guidelines " provide some very vague suggestions for ad - hoc mechanisms to work around these regressions .
These suggestions are unhelpful .
I want an API that I can call , not a picture of a window I need to re-create myself .
If the desktop team wants to change the look of my application in the future , I do n't want them to submit a giant pile of patches against it .
Not only are the suggestions not a library , they do n't include sample code , either .
How do I actually create an alert box which does n't take focus , does n't include any window manager controls , but stays above other windows ?
Describing it this way is an invitation for applications to be inconsistent .
My interpretation of this specification will inevitably be different from other application authors .
For example , the specification does n't say anything about compositing , but the window in the screenshot clearly appears to be alpha blended with the background .
It also does n't say anything about WM controls , but some pictures have minimize / close buttons and some do n't .
Some applications will have alpha blending for their notifications , some wo n't .
And since there 's no library here , there 's no reasonable way to consistently control the behavior of many applications .
With these features in libnotify , we have a single uniform queue for users ' attention .
A single point of control which might be adjusted , bugfixed , and tweaked across the desktop as a whole , without writing tons of patches for individual applications .
Notify - OSD even takes advantage of that point of control .
But the suggestions for many of these features is to take control out of a single easily - managed client / server protocol and push it into a bunch of ad - hoc application - specific widgetry .
To add insult to injury , the one place that I do get hard examples of how to do things , on the notification development guidelines page , the Python code samples have yet to be written .
This is a minor nit , as I can definitely figure out what 's going on from the C# code , but it 's endemic of the same systemic problem with the Linux desktop ecosystem that brought us this half - baked replacement for notification - daemon .
Jamie Zawinski identified this problem as the " Cascade of Attention - Deficit Teenagers " , but Canonical demonstrates that you can create this same problem with a medium - size company that employs highly competent , adult engineers .
Notification - daemon is n't perfect .
It could clearly stand to be improved , especially in the face of notification spam .
So please , improve it !
Or , at worst , if upstream is not cooperative , fork it .
I 'm pretty sure that the solution to the rate limiting problem is not " then ... what ? " .
Notify - OSD cuts the gordian knot of notify - spam by only letting you see one thing at a time , but that has its own problems .
Now , to be fair , all these regressions have n't really cost me any work .
I want my applications to be cross-platform , so I was going to have to implement most of this functionality for Windows anyway , using animating borderless windows .
Now I 'm just going to be using my own notification widgetry on Ubuntu as well , rather than elegantly integrating with the platform and providing all of my notification interaction through a familiar UI .
But I 'm sad that the superior notification infrastructure on Linux in general and Ubuntu specifically is no longer something that makes my application easier to write first .
So , beyond this one little screed , I 'm really not going to complain too much .
I 'll implement some of my own ideas for notification , try to come up with some way to be friendly to Notify - OSD in the meanwhile , and I 'll still eventually upgrade all of my computers to jaunty and enjoy the other eye - candy and performance improvements .
This is not too terrible of a price to pay , and I do keep it in perspective .
I also understand that I 'm not the guy who has to make the hard decisions for what goes into Ubuntu or GNOME or whatever .
I understand that sometimes , in order to make an omelette , you have to kill a few people But , if a decision maker for Ubuntuto care about my entirely irrelevant opinion , as both an application developer and heavy user of notification systems , I would say this to them :
You guys have done some great work on Notify - OSD .
It 's a worthy prototype .
In many ways itbetter than notification - daemon : it looks nicer , it makes notifications between applications more consistent .
I can appreciate the uncompromising vision you have for cleaning up the sometimes confusing pile of notifications that users see .
Youpackage Notify - OSD in Jaunty , so that people start using it .
Start updating applications to honor the capabilities that it provides .
But please , and yes , include afor the period of transition .
Write some libraries to support the other use - cases which Notify - OSD right now ignores .
Document and stabilize the indicator applet .
Package the Python bindings , please .
Make it not crash when applications abuse it .
Regardless of this new notification system 's unpolished state , I 'm sure many users will update and start experimenting with Notify - OSD , much as many started with Compiz for years beforebecame the default window manager .
Most users can keep using the regular notification bubbles until Karmic , though .
When Karmic comes along , you 'll have had the time you need to finish the documentation and provide application developers better alternatives to a good notification APIyanking the carpet out from under them .
If this advice is ignored , as I 'm almost sure it will be , it wo n't bother me - notification is hardly the most important API that an OS provides .
The thing that I really hope someone will take away from this is the general theme that platforms should evolve experimental features slowly , and .
Notify - OSD removes a half - dozen features and informally , halfheartedly gestures at some ways you can make your window pop up to address what some of those features used to do .
That 's fine , as a scrappy new competitor to notification - daemon , butas a core part of a major platform .
My real hope is not specifically that Notify - OSD will actually be pulled .
Of course I 'd be happy if it were , but Jaunty going to be released in just a few days .
Again , I feel like I need to qualify these statements : if I 'd really wanted to impact decisions like this I should really be regularly using beta releases .
Not to mention the fact that if I 'd actuallythese hypothetical applications I 'm thinking about , I 'm sure my voice would carry more weight .
My real hope is that you , gentle reader , will take this message , and the next time you are contemplating boiling your favorite ocean , you 'll stop and reflect .
Break down the changes you are planning on into individual , incremental improvements , rather than sweeping , break - everything lateral movement .
Make radical improvements , but make themthe stable facade of a system which is only lifted when the radical improvement is clearly both radicalan improvement .
“ The flip side of this — and I want to make sure this is also clear — we also believe that it is paramount to begin doing everything we said we would do in the campaign , ” Mr. Gibbs said .
“ We know expectations are high .
But disappointment if we did n’t try to do the things that we said we were going to do would be far , far greater than anything else .
People went to the polls and elected Barack Obama because they believed the fact not only that he could do what he said , but that he would try to do what he said . ”
The challenge facing Mr. Obama today is similar to one that faced Bill Clinton in 1992 , the last time a president arrived in Washington with anything approaching the level of excitement Mr. Obama ’s election set off around the country .
As Election Day approached in 1992 , it was apparent from the crowds that Mr. Clinton drew , in their size and their faces , that his supporters expected big things after a campaign in which Mr. Clinton had promised a dramatic revamping in health care coverage and programs for the poor .
At the time , a senior adviser who was traveling with him , Paul Begala , warned Mr. Clinton to add some caveats to his speeches , to avoid voter letdown should it take time to accomplish things as president .
“ I remember talking about this to him in the closing days of the campaign , ” Mr. Begala said .
“ And he started saying , ‘ We did n’t get into this overnight and we ’re not going to get out of it overnight . ’ ”
“ So I remember him talking about it and doing it — and it did n’t have any effect on the citizens , ” Mr. Begala said .
That was one reason , he said , that Democrats lost control of Congress two years later .
A nearly 500 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday was a reminder that Mr. Obama ’s election did not bring the financial crisis to a close , and that the economic downturn could limit his ability to pursue his full agenda right off the bat by demanding an immediate focus on trying to pull the nation out of recession .
And , even if Americans are ready to bear with Mr. Obama as he pursues policy proposals , they may not as readily accept the sort of compromise that legislative accomplishment often requires .

Mam nadzieję , że przekłada prawo .
Opinion
Are we witnessing Sun 's death rattle with both CEO and chairman of the board poised to walk the plank ?
That is highly likely to be the outcome if IBM does not buy Sun .
IBM is thought to be carrying a kind of due diligence on Sun as it ponders buying the company - but is it really thinking about buying Sun ?
If it is n't or if the exploratory look comes to nothing , what happens to Sun ?
What we actually know amounts to very little .
The Wall Street Journal printed a story based on information received that IBM was thinking of buying Sun. IBM said " no comment " as did Sun .
Neither company denied that acquisition talks were taking place .
Then Intel CEO Paul Otellini said Sun had been shopping itself around to several potential purchasers .
Again Sun did not issue a denial .
Crucially Otellini has not denied he said this or altered what it is he said - he believes Sun has been hawking itself around potential purchasers .
What do the WSJ article and the Otellini comment tell us ?
They indicate that Sun 's senior management does n't believe Sun can prosper on its own and needs to be taken over .
The widespread shopping around of Sun by the Schwartz - led management team tells us all that the Schwartz team - and the Sun board - have no faith in Sun 's stand - alone survival prospects .
They do n't see prosperity for Sun and its shareholders in that direction .
That team has been in charge for a few years now and has , intellectually , given up on taking Sun forward on its own .
It has , we are all beginning to realise , failed ; and by implication , Sun is a failing company .
They would n't be trying to sell a successful company , and they would n't be trying to sell a company with good short - tem and mid-term prospects .
They are trying to sell a failing and stalled company .
If IBM , having looked closely at Sun , walks away , that could be a kiss of death .
No one else wants the company , it seems .
Where does that leave Sun 's customers ?
They will have experienced the shock of realising that their supplier could be finished and that it sees its own future in the arms of someone else , a competitor .
Well , if their supplier thinks its future is better if it joins with a competitor such as IBM , then customers could well start thinking the same thing .
We could see - if IBM walks away from Sun , or if there is n't actually a Sun- IBM deal on the table - customers agreeing with what Sun management apparently clearly thinks of the company and its products , and acting on that belief by reducing their dependence on Sun .
We could see usage of SPARC servers steadily falling over the next few years .
Customers could walk away from Solaris and also step away from Sun'sx86 servers .
If Sun managers think the company 's products and strategy are failing , then customers could take the same view and stop using the company 's products .
What other conclusion could they come to ?
Sun 's channel and direct sales teams will have an enormous uphill struggle selling against that sentiment ; they will feel undermined by Sun 's own management .
Many will walk .
STRASBOURG , France , April 4 ( Reuters ) - NATO leaders agreed unanimously on Saturday to appoint Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen as the next head of the alliance after Turkey dropped its objections .
NATO Secretary - General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer told a joint news conference with Rasmussen : " You know that there has been discussion over the past 36 hours , but the fact that we are standing here next to each other means a solution has been found also for the concerns expressed by Turkey , and we all very much agree and are unanimous . "
Rasmussen , whose nomination was controversial because of his handling of a 2006 crisis over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a Danish newspaper , will succeed the Dutch diplomat on Aug.

For those who do n’t know , ‘ Thought for the day ’ is a trite little 3 or 4 minute segue in the Today Programme , the BBC ’s flagship news and current affairs package , which shapes the daily agenda in political journalism and commentary on domestic and international affairs .
‘ Thought for the day ’ basically consists of someone from the church telling everyone how much better their pointless little lives would be if only they ’d filter their every waking moment through rose tinted Jesus glasses .
The one defining feature of ‘ Thought for the day ’ that sets it aside from the rest of the Today Programme , is unless you already believe in such supernatural gobbledegook , it virtually guarantees you ’ll be diving for the controls as soon as it begins , to tune to another station just long enough for it ’s self - satisfied guest presenter to say what they have to say , before tuning back the dial five minutes later , once it ’s over and the real news can kick back in .
I understand the concept of setting a moment in the busy 24 hour news agenda driven world aside for quiet contemplation and that , as a public service broadcaster , the BBC has a duty to provide a space for people of all beliefs to call their own .
But doing so in the same air - time occupied by News and Factual makes a complete mockery of that .
It ’s Pythonesque in it ’s sarcasm , albeit unintentionally so .
iPM , the BBC ’s weekly listener driven magazine show , this week gave a voice , for the first time in the corporation ’s history , to secular humanism in the ‘ Thought for the day ’ slot .
Here ’s what Ariane Sherine had to say …
Special By By Stephen Dohnberg Apr 9 , 2009 in Politics
An active movement is under way in the United States to establish a cabinet level ' Department of Peace and Nonviolence ' .
A 3 day conference in Washington , D.C. revealed a lot about the modern peace movement and the new urgency that surrounds it .
However , since the The legislative wording has evolved over the preceding eight years from the ' Department of Peace ' .
Congressman Kucinich introduced HR808 in 2007 with over 60 co sponsors to create the ' Dept of Peace and Nonviolence ' .
Peace Alliance Logo on Overhead Screen Stephen Dohnberg On March 20 - 23 , the second meeting of the Campaign to Establish a Cabinet Level Dept of Peace met at the Hyatt Regency in Crystal City , Arlington VA .
The location itself felt paradoxical - conference goers met in this location surrounded by the offices of some of the biggest organizations that exist solely to profit from war and unrest : KBR ( Haliburton ) , Lockheed Martin , General Dynamics , and any number of offices of lobbyists that are situated a stone 's throw across the Potomac from the legislative core of the United States .
The national conference meets in off years , since the focus of the Peace Alliance is to engage in workshops , gather information , and to set their sights on their Congressional representatives .
With Congressional elections happening in even numbered years , it gives the organization a chance to assess their new constituent representatives and lobby them in an organized , methodical , and unified fashion - rather than a scatter shot way , which is so often the downfall of activist movements .
By taking advantage of citizen activism and political engagement , this method also allows them to gauge their impact with efficiency and economy .
Over the years , the movement has gained respect for this approach .
2007 's Conference saw a star studded cast of supporters joining citizen activists .
A list of prominent citizens , including Walter Cronkite , Flea ( of the Red Hot Chili Peppers ) , Joaqin Pheonix , Yoko Ono , and Wille Nelson represent but a fraction of public figures who have promoted the movement .
The 2009 conference , while still attended by close to 500 people , was more work intensive by comparison , as described by those I talked to .
Rep Dennis Kucinich - Closing Night of Conference : " this is n't some airy fairy idea ... peace is practical " Stephen Dohnberg
While it is literally impossible to cover the full course of conference events ( visit Some of the speakers included the son of former Baskin - Robbins heir and founder of YES ( The laser - like focus of the organization was revealed in a Sunday afternoon session that almost all of the policy wonks agreed to have been the most useful , revealing that the campaign knows it needs to foster understanding of vast government structures to achieve the success it needs .
Billed as ' Peacebuilding in the Federal Government ' , it clearly showed that the DoP organizers know what they need to understand about the minutiae of federal government
The expert panel , moderated by Wendy Greene , featured Margaret Kho , a designate for the the In essence , they outlined organizations that already perform a function that overlaps with the stated goals of the proposed Dept of Peace and Non Violence , or mirror the same objectives , but are somewhat independent from federal government .
The Community Relations Service , as Irene Kho explained , is a federal body that deals with mediation , training , and technical assistance in areas such as protest organization and police - community relations .
Established in 1964 , the CRS was an outgrowth of the Civil Rights era , and initially dealt with ethnic issues as an agency of the Department of Justice .
Post 9 - 11 , CRS ' areas have expanded to include training for airport security staff and cultural sensitivity when dealing with Arab , Muslim , or Sikh travellers .
Their objective is to intervene before disputes escalate into violence .
But with 10 regional offices , staff has faced such cutbacks that these regional offices throughout the U.S. now barely employs 65 people .
The scope of these cuts leaves one to question the commitment and focus of the federal government and whether it is aware of the tools it already possesses .
One only needs to look back at the immediate 18 years from the Rodney King riots , to Arab " roundups " in the fall of 2001 to question the commitment of resources and focus , and why such a potentially useful organization is so poorly utilized -- under no fault of those staffing the agency .
Kelly pointed to other bodies , " intra government offices " that work as an " arm " for example , The USIP engages in , or funds relevant research projects on violent conflict , its causes , and ways to deal with conflict .
Funded annually through Congress , the USIP has to tread a fine line and this can be a Catch 22 situation for any group .
Obviously , criticism has to be very tempered and one presumes this is also mandated by the foreign policy that exists at the time .
It is an independent agency of the federal government , meaning that it is an executive branch agency of the government and exists outside of the federal executive departments .
Similar agencies include the CIA , the United States Postal Service ( USPS ) , and the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) .
USAID is involved with humanitarian and economic assistance programs in developing countries , and money is allocated by proxy organizations that research a number of criteria before a project is given funds .
But with many of these executive branch agencies , issues of alleged corruption and ideological influence over the years have become sore spots , .especially when multimillion dollar development and aid packages fall into the hands of corrupt regimes .
In the past , the U.S. has looked the other way .
Kelly noted that USAID needs to focus on " small scale civil projects "
This approach would go a long way in assisting USAID 's work , and one presumes would strengthen USAID 's focus on the simple definition of " what America is " .
Shirch of 3D Security was equally eloquent in her assessment of the need for stability globally and pointed out that the lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan would " shape policy for the next hundred plus years " .
The need for new bodies is found in the question " what is the division of labour between peace and security ? "
Operationally , the U.S. still looks to the Army for conflict resolution and civic rebuilding in conflict areas .
It 's a backward operational tactic that in modern times leans on an organization that is not equipped to engage in these operations .
It 's also into this void that the private sector steps .
It 's a linear , Cold War mentality .
With these being but a fraction of the organizations in place to deal with peace in a broader context , she noted that selling the idea of a Cabinet level department would be difficult .
It would not necessarily be a Department of Peace as a solution , but would require a President with a focus and defined idea of what peace achieves .
More money for existing structures , as well as , restored budgets , could do wonders .
The costs of maintaining domestic and international organizations focused on peace - building is a huge prospect , but with the limited time allotted for the panelists , a very concise question emerged .
In essence :
If we took the existing structures off the table , what could be put in place to deal with this very broad spectrum of issues , domestic and international ?
The point being , a Department of Peace would be a massive step toward the " sharing of duties " with the military that even Robert Gates and General Petraeus have called for .
Advocates are moved by the practical simplicity of something that is a preventive measure .
Decades of statistics that show , for example , that a few hundred dollars allocated for a student in a school board budget saves $ 85,000 annually , from the cost of maintaining a prison inmate .
One of the fascinating components of the Conference itself was that it organized conference goers by state .
On the final day , after three days of information workshops , activists converged on the Capitol to meet with their Congressional and Senate representatives or their legislative assistants .
I followed the New York delegation as they traversed the halls of the Cannon and Rayburn buildings and dropped packages off or met with Congressional aides who were receptive and respectful of the organization and effort that these citizens put into participating in the process .
As a reporter , it was something to witness and a story in and of itself - participatory democracy as it should be .
One 's built - in cynicism can be easily allayed by watching these activists from all walks , steel themselves to a task one imagines only for hardened , cigar chomping back slappers .
If there was any question as to the success of their work , on April 7 Congressman Jared Polis ( D - CO ) signed on as the 66th cosponsor .
One could only imagine the stress put on the offices as the California delegation of almost 50 marched into the offices of everyone from Duncan Hunter ( R - CA ) to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
But they did it .
Listening to the stories at the end of the Monday , and the excitement and surprise that many first timers to Washington corridors expressed , was fascinating .
To think , one can walk into the office of someone who is elected and Constitutionally mandated to represent you !
Like the ideas behind the Department of Peace , it all seems so simple , so ... obvious ?!
As Rep Kucinich noted on the closing evening , " peace is practical - this is n't some airy fairy idea " .
By " monetizing peace " a breakthrough has been established .
Although other attempts to establish a Department of Peace , including ones initiated by the Founding Fathers , have been put forward , a bill as comprehensive has n't emerged until now .
With the efforts of DoP activists and 68 co-sponsors , Kucicnich noted that the over 40 million citizens are represented .
The idea of a Department of Peace also placed 2nd in the top 10 ideas of According to official stats , " Department of Peace grassroots activist groups exist in about 300 congressional districts in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico , and Guam "
That does n't include the international movement , including Canada .
The Hamilton chapter has their AGM and conference on the weekend of April 17 .
Nepal has it's own Department of Peace , and in Costa Rica the idea is taken very seriously , with an MA in Peace Studies being offered at the Co sponsor , Rep John Conyers , reminded activists that it took over 15 years for the Martin Luther King Day bill to finally pass legislation .
" There 's way more of us that want to do the right thing " .
If we have a Department of War , why ca n't we have a Department of Peace ? " Rep John Conyers address Peace Alliance Conference :
If we have a Department of War , why ca n't we have a Department of Peace ? "
Stephen Dohnberg As Richard Nixon responded to a similar movement in 1969 , " I consider the Department of State to be a department of peace .
I consider the Department of Defense to be a department of peace , and I can assure you that at the White House Level in the National Security Council that is where we coordinate all of our efforts towards peace .
I think that putting one department over here as a department of peace would tend to indicate that the other departments were engaged in other activities that were not interested in peace . " 40 years of immediate history should make you consider .
Given the current major economic downturn , it 's impossible for one to imagine the U.S federal government engaging in establishing a new Cabinet portfolio of any type .
Particularly one , that on the surface would seem to represent a nation experiencing time for reflection -- something akin to the slight cut in military budgets aka ' the Peace dividend ' after the alleged ' end of the Cold War ' .
However , since the Department of Peace was introduced in 2001 by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich , a growing national and international movement has begun to understand the urgency of " waging peace " .
In defining the idea of a cabinet level organization , modern peace activists have adopted a new perspective .
The legislative wording has evolved over the preceding eight years from the ' Department of Peace ' .
Congressman Kucinich introduced HR808 in 2007 with over 60 co sponsors to create the ' Dept of Peace and Nonviolence ' .
The initiative is not the stereotype of the Sixties , but a sleek , evolved perspective and more defined activist movement that has adopted what FDR referred to as " the science of human relations " .
Within the broadened understanding of relations in a scientific context , peace is not , to paraphrase Ronald Reagan , " the absence of war " , rather the absence of peace is the presence of violence that has a very real impact on the economies of nations .
It is a new perspective on understanding global violence -- internal and external -- that includes racism , poverty , unemployment , illness , crime , environmental disaster and domestic violence , as well as wars between nations .
On March 20 - 23 , the second meeting of the Campaign to Establish a Cabinet Level Dept of Peace met at the Hyatt Regency in Crystal City , Arlington VA .
The location itself felt paradoxical - conference goers met in this location surrounded by the offices of some of the biggest organizations that exist solely to profit from war and unrest : KBR ( Haliburton ) , Lockheed Martin , General Dynamics , and any number of offices of lobbyists that are situated a stone 's throw across the Potomac from the legislative core of the United States .

The 2009 conference , while still attended by close to 500 people , was more work intensive by comparison , as described by those I talked to .
While it is literally impossible to cover the full course of conference events ( visit The PeaceAlliance .
Org for the sessions and workshops ) , a large number of the workshops were educational ( and often moving ) and featured phenomenal speakers well recognized within the movement , with many of these breaking into mainstream consciousness , thanks to their tireless advocacy and the occasional appearance on the Oprah Winfrey show .
Some of the speakers included the son of former Baskin - Robbins heir and founder of YES ( Youth for Environmental Sanity ) Ocean Robbins , whose father sought a different path for himself , or as Ocean said of his father , " he realized there was no need to discover a 32nd flavour ... " .
Azim Khamisa , a Sufi Muslim , whose own son Tariq was killed , a victim of a gang initiation rite .
He now seeks leniency for his son's killer as part of his own peace - building initiative through forgiveness , and Steve Killelea , founder of a modern trade metric known as GPI ( Global Peace Index ) and producer of the documentary ' Soldiers of Peace '
The laser - like focus of the organization was revealed in a Sunday afternoon session that almost all of the policy wonks agreed to have been the most useful , revealing that the campaign knows it needs to foster understanding of vast government structures to achieve the success it needs .
Billed as ' Peacebuilding in the Federal Government ' , it clearly showed that the DoP organizers know what they need to understand about the minutiae of federal government
The expert panel , moderated by Wendy Greene , featured Margaret Kho , a designate for the the Community Relations Service ( CRS ) under the U.S. Dept of Justice , Lorelei Kelly , the National Security Program Director of the American Progressive Caucus Policy Foundation , and Lisa Schirch of 3D Security and Eastern Mennonite University .
In essence , they outlined organizations that already perform a function that overlaps with the stated goals of the proposed Dept of Peace and Non Violence , or mirror the same objectives , but are somewhat independent from federal government .
The Community Relations Service , as Irene Kho explained , is a federal body that deals with mediation , training , and technical assistance in areas such as protest organization and police - community relations .

Kelly pointed to other bodies , " intra government offices " that work as an " arm " for example , the U.S. Institute of Peace , and USAID .
But at this stage , Kelly noted that core of the aims and exercising of such offices relies on what the perception of the U.S. is :
Does the U.S. exist to aid the poor and hungry of the world and export justice and democracy , or do various government bodies exist to create , or force , favourable trade conditions in other countries , thus making it OK to have dictators friendly to the U.S. remain in place ?
The USIP engages in , or funds relevant research projects on violent conflict , its causes , and ways to deal with conflict .
Funded annually through Congress , the USIP has to tread a fine line and this can be a Catch 22 situation for any group .
Obviously , criticism has to be very tempered and one presumes this is also mandated by the foreign policy that exists at the time .
United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) is another body that Kelly presented as an example .
Similar to CIDA ( Canadian International Development Agency ) the mandate of USAID is to " extend a helping hand to those people overseas struggling to make a better life , recover from a disaster or striving to live in a free and democratic country ...
" It is an independent agency of the federal government , meaning that it is an executive branch agency of the government and exists outside of the federal executive departments .
Similar agencies include the CIA , the United States Postal Service ( USPS ) , and the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) .
USAID is involved with humanitarian and economic assistance programs in developing countries , and money is allocated by proxy organizations that research a number of criteria before a project is given funds .

This is a story that moved a lot of human beings this week .
Nari , a dolphin severely wounded by a shark have been protected and escorted by his mate Echo for three days and then led by him to the seaside for help .
Before he was savaged by a three meters Bull Shark , Nari , the 12 - year - old dolphin , usually came for a nightly hand - feeding ritual on the coast of Moreton Island , near Brisbane , together with his other 12 mates .
Marine vets feared he had died when he did not appear at feeding time for days .
However , on Tuesday night Nari reappeared at the beach , looking tired and frail .
He was led in to shore by his mate Echo looking for the help of humans .
Vets and Volunteers immediately captured Nari without any struggle and transferred it to Sea World on the Gold Coast where it underwent surgery for deep wounds and was given antibiotics to prevent infection .
It is recovering under the watchful eye of marine vets and is expected to rejoin the pod and his mate Echo within eight weeks .
Experts suggested that Echo 's sympathy for Nari may stem from an incident in 1996 when Echo was himself attacked by a shark .
Having disappeared the same day as Nari and reappeared at his side
There is no reason to think other than that Echo stayed with Nari for a few days , waiting until Nari was well enough to make it back to the feeding area .
What has thrilled wildlife experts even more is the trust that Nari has appeared to put in the humans who were able to lift him without a struggle into a boat and take him to the mainland to be treated by vets .
'
The injury is quite severe - the bite went right through the skin , flesh and blubber down to the muscle and Nari 's pretty sore .
We 're going to cut out the large piece of flesh that has been ripped by the shark and treat him in a special quarantine pool at Sea World .
Then it will be a case of the wound healing from the inside out .
We 're got high hopes he 'll recover and then we 'll release him back into the wild where we 're sure his friend Echo will be waiting for him . ' said a vet .

Hunter , seeker , killer for hire
Countless enemies stand in the way of the Sith Empire ’s drive for domination .
The Empire spares no expense eliminating these threats , offering massive bounties to employ the galaxy ’s most lethal hunters .
Earning a death mark from the Empire means a life spent in fear , constantly looking over one ’s shoulder .
It ’s never a question if a Bounty Hunter will find you … only when .
Both infamous and anonymous at the same time , Bounty Hunters are far more than mercenaries for hire — they ’re heirs to a professional legacy — an ancient brotherhood with a glorious history .
Tracking elusive targets across multiple star systems requires expertise , especially when the targets can be prominent , powerful , and often prepared for confrontation .
Thrill seekers from all walks of life set out to become Bounty Hunters , but only the most hard - boiled survive in this competitive and deadly business .
The Bounty Hunter ’s path lies along the edge — the stakes are always high — and the path only leads two places , to a life of infamous glory … or to a quick and ignominious death .
Imperial Relations
Though the Empire disapproves of the Bounty Hunters ’ fierce independence , exceptions are made for those who get results .
Few individuals in the galaxy have the gall and the stomach to deliver on the delicate and grim tasks in which Bounty Hunters excel .
Nonetheless , no one is irreplaceable in the Empire , and even the most proficient must repeatedly prove their worth .
In the bounty business , one ’s name is everything , and with each mark a Bounty Hunter takes down , his reputation grows , as does his price .
Affiliations and Loyalties
Bounty Hunters are far from a homogeneous lot — they come from all races and affiliations and each pursues his quarry in his own unique way .
Some Bounty Hunters adhere to the rugged Mandalorian code of honor while others answer only to their own moral compass .
Some work only on behalf of organizations they agree with , while others have no sense of loyalty .
Despite being kindred spirits , fellow Bounty Hunters cannot always be trusted — among the profession ’s most notorious members , competition turns colleagues into the most ruthless of enemies .
Even the Bounty Hunters ’ employers harbor hidden agendas ; the tables are turned quickly when complications arise … and they always do .
Shifting allegiances , unbeatable odds , and deadly showdowns are common in the occurrences in the life of a Bounty Hunter .
Presto , a fast - loading Linux desktop you install from Windows , lives up to its promise of an alternative , speedy boot - up with quick web / email access .
Let 's take a look at how it looks and runs .

Presto is free while in beta , but moves to a $ 20 paid version on April 13 .
In the meantime , head to the Presto download site , grab the file ( or wait until you have time and bandwidth for 483MB ) , and install it like any other Windows application .
Presto is a streamlined , stripped - down version of the Xandros distribution of Linux .
Hardware manufacturers are doing something similar with embedded Linux chips , like Splashtop , but Presto runs on pretty much any x86 - based system .
It was built for boot - up speed , and intends to give laptop users an alternative system to jump into when they really just want to check a site , check their email , or maybe tweak an Office - type file or two without having to wait for everything on their Windows PC to load , and load , and load ...
Advertisement
As you 'll see below , Presto installs itself in the Windows Boot Menu as the non-default choice — though we wish it did n't make it so the Windows default now requires an Enter stroke to load up .
Regardless , from the boot menu shown below , it took Presto just 15.3 seconds to get to a loaded desktop , with the mouse functional , Firefox responding to a click and loading , and the hard drive not under serious crunch .
Windows 7 , despite what Gina found in her tests took about 43.3 seconds to get me to a workable point .
I 'd allow for the fact that my Windows 7 partition has been lived in a bit , with a handful of auto - starting apps and updates having been installed , but Presto is just faster at booting .
And it 's probably faster , and possibly less battery - draining , for doing basic tasks , too .
A very light and swift window manager and file browser are used , there 's not much graphics acceleration or transparency afoot — this thing exists solely to get you into Firefox , or maybe onto Skype or Pidgin , ASAP .
Sure , your thumb drive will be recognized , and Presto can read and write to your Windows NTFS - formatted drive by default , but it 's really about having a small , agile space to do some work in and then save before the battery runs out .
So , let 's check out Presto in action ( click for larger images ) :

After installing Presto from inside Windows , you 'll see a new option at the Windows Boot Menu for Presto , usually listed as the non -default choice .
Advertisement
Surprisingly soon after picking Presto , this is the desktop you land on .
Advertisement
Everything 's pretty much on the sidebar , there 's no right - click options on the desktop , and no taskbar or ability to minimize windows — what you 've got open is what you see .
Windows can be resized , and accessed from a pop-out menu on the left - hand sidebar , or the standard Alt + Tab keyboard action .
It 's either a creative constraint or pain in the rear , depending on how you look at it .
Advertisement
Details on what 's listed on your sidebar upon booting up .
Most are obvious , but the " IM " button launches Pidgin , and the shopping cart icon starts an " Application Store " to install and launch additional apps .
The icons on the sidebar can be moved around , but it 's not apparent ( without some standard Linux text file tweaking ) how to add or delete options .
Advertisement
Need more than just a browser , Pidgin , and Skype ?
The Application Store is where all your non-default apps are stored , and comes pre-loaded with RealPlayer ( seriously ? ) , Adobe PDF reader , and OpenOffice.org .
Advertisement
Hit the " Application Store " icon , and a web page launches to search and browse available apps .
A good number of our favorite Linux apps and utilities are available , like Picasa , AmaroK , and most of the standards in any GNOME or Linux distribution .
Want to change how that boot menu reads , or shorten the timeout limit from a glacial - seeming 30 seconds ?
Check out the How - To Geek 's tips on how to delete , modify , or disable entries on the XP boot menu ( which should work for Vista and 7 , too ) .

Research in Motion , the second - largest maker of smartphones after Nokia , surprised investors on April 2 with strong profits fueled by consumer - oriented , more affordable Blackberry models , and gave a rosy outlook .
Nokia is set to report a sharp fall in January - March profits when it releases quarterly results on April 16 , with strong sales of its cheap touch - screen 5800 smartphone expected to be one of the few bright spots .
“ The 5800 has clearly been a big success and may well prove to be Nokia ’s biggest profit driver in the first half of 2009 , ” Nomura analyst Stuart Jeffrey said in a note .
The focus in the phone market this year has shifted increasingly to smartphones , as operators move subsidies to support consumers buying the feature - packed devices , which can generate more data revenue .
Sales of smartphones such as the Blackberry are expected to rise some 10 - 20 percent , compared with a fall of 10 percent or more in the overall market .
“ The market share of smartphones is taking over from feature phones at an alarming pace , ” said Sean Dalton , general partner at Highland Capital Partners .
The world ’s No 4 handset maker , Sony Ericsson , is the most exposed to the demand for feature phones -- mid-ranged phones focused on key features like cameras or music players -- and the company shocked investors on March 20 .
Sony Ericsson said it would make a steep first - quarter loss , while phone sales would almost halve from the previous quarter , hit by weak demand and retailers cutting inventories .
Sony Ericsson will report on April 17 , LG Electronics on April 21 and Samsung Electronics on April 24 .
CLUNKY IPHONE KILLER ?
Nokia dominates the smartphone market with around a 40 percent share , but has steadily lost ground over the last quarters to new rivals like Apple , which launched its iPhone in 2007 .
JP Morgan said Nokia ’s market share stability in the fourth quarter may suggest its “ smartphone on a budget ” offerings like the 5800 are beginning to resonate with consumers .
“ Even among ( or maybe especially among ) investment bankers we notice a new “ cheap chic ” attitude to consumption , ” JP Morgan analysts said in a research note .
Nokia introduced the 5800 , its first touch screen phone , only late last year , but analysts said the lower price helps it beat iPhone sales in the Middle East , Eastern Europe and Asia , and there has been strong demand also in developed markets .
“ In Britain , Nokia seems to be struggling to meet demand as channels run out of stock on a regular basis , ” said CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber .
Analyst Tero Kuittinen from GC Capital said Nokia could ship more than 2.5 million 5800s in the January - March quarter , matching rough estimates for iPhone shipment volumes .
“ Outside the US market , it is emerging as ‘ the poor man ’s iPhone ’ - a device with clunky and old - fashioned software , but much cheaper price , better camera quality , lower weight and far superior stand - by time , ” he said .
“ In New York or London , consumers do not mind the bad voice quality and battery problems of the iPhone .
In Jakarta or Moscow , consumers are far more performance - and value - oriented , ” Kuittinen said .
As reported earlier Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina called the murder of Matthew Shepard because he was gay , a hoax .

Foxx has since responded to the uproar .
She does n’t express regret — which is common for her ilk — nor apologizes — which almost never happens — she simply backtracks , trying to save her own ass .
“ It has come to my attention that some people have been led to believe that I think the terrible crimes that led to Matthew Shepard ’s death in 1998 were a hoax , ” she said .
“ The term “ hoax ” was a poor choice of words used in the discussion of the hate crimes bill .
Mr. Shepard ’s death was nothing less than a tragedy and those responsible for his death certainly deserved the punishment they received .
“ The larger context of my remarks is important .
I was referring to a 2004 ABC 20/20 report on Mr. Shepard ’s death .
The 20/20 report questioned the motivation of those responsible for Mr. Shepard ’s death .
Referencing this media account may have been a mistake , but if so it was a mistake based on what I believed were reliable accounts . ”
While Judy Shepard has yet to respond to the original remarks , others in Congress have .
From Politico :
“ Matthew Shepard ’s mother was in the gallery yesterday and I believe she was back today — so I ’m sorry she had to be around to hear it , ” said Rep. Steve Cohen ( D - Tenn . ) .
“ It ’s an urban myth …
And I ’d tell her that man did land on the moon and the moon was n’t made out of green cheese . ”
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( D - Fla. ) , who supports the hate crimes bill , stared in disbelief before answering a question about the statement .
“ It ’s just sad the Republican caucus has been reduced such a fringe , ” she said .
“ It ’s sad they would go out of their way to prevent people from getting justice . ”
This is n’t the first time Foxx has put her foot in it .
Two weeks ago she made some racially charged statements on the House floor .
I ’m sorry Virginia , but you are an ignorant , hateful bigot , and you need to immediately apologize for your remarks , especially to Judy Shepard .
And then do us all a favor and walk out the f*cking door and never come back .
And please , please , take Michelle Bachmann with you .
Virginia
Foxx can be contacted via the methods below , and please , show her at least the same amount of respect she showed Judy Shepard .

How fundamental is information ?
This web page is a critical essay that considers how well - defined and fundamental the concept of information is .
The essay has been inspired by an article " What Brings a World into Being ? " by David Berlinski [ Berlinski ] .
The thrust of Berlinski's article is to caution against an information - centric view of the material world .
It has become popular to regard information as the fundamental essence of all things .
As the article says ,
The thesis that the human mind is nothing more than an information - processing device is now widely regarded as a fact .
' Viewed at the most abstract level , ' the science writer George Johnson remarked recently in the New York Times , ' both brains and computers operate the same way by translating phenomena -- sounds , images , and so forth -- into a code that can be stored and manipulated ' .
More generally , the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins has argued that life is itself fundamentally a river of information , an idea that has in large part also motivated the successful effort to decipher the human genome .
Information is even said to encompass the elementary particles .
' All the quarks and electrons in the cosmic wilds , ' Johnson writes , 'are exchanging information each time they interact . '
Information in Shannon communication theory
It is instructive to review the origins of the notion of information : Shannon 's mathematical theory of communication .
The classical derivation of entropy as the measure of information ( see below ) has remarkably nothing to do with meaning .
Shannon himself cautioned against confusing a signal with what it signifies :
The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point .
Frequently the messages have meaning ; that is , they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities .
These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem .
The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages [ Shannon ] .
As Chris Hillman pointed out [ Hillman ]
... " Information " appears in Shannon 's theory only to the degree that the successful communication of information may lead to statistical correlations between the behavior of two systems .
Any such correlation must presumably reflect some common causal influence upon these systems , but communication theory is emphatically not a theory of causal influence ; nor is it a theory of knowledge or meaning .
Rather , it is a purely probabilistic theory concerned with those statistical phenomena which are relevant to the following two fundamental problems , [ of data storage and of transmission of messages over noisy communication channels . ]
Semantic information is ill - defined and subjective
Reading a book requires an understanding of how words weave into sentences .
The sentences furthermore must relate to reader 's prior experience to create a narrative and the meaning .
The language understanding and the prior experience are prerequisites of reading comprehension .
Yet they are not a part of the book .
In fact , understanding of a language is not explained in any book as it is largely unknown .
According to Chomsky and the recent experiments , language understanding is an innate ability , which must be tuned in in the first few years of person 's life .
The same conclusion -- the meaning of a book depends on its reader -- holds for another book , DNA .
DNA is read by cell 's machinery , which is far more complex than the DNA itself .
Without a competent reader DNA means nothing .
A magnetic tape with a code for a tape driver is meaningless without a driver to read it .
It is often said that DNA encodes all that is in a cell .
That is not correct [ Feitelson ] [ Bethell ] .
It is a cell that encodes in its own machinery what it is in the cell .
Combining parents ' DNA does not make an embryo by itself , in a flash of a green light .
The combined DNA must be a part of an egg cell , whose division and specialization make an embryo .
The fist cell that emerged , created or brought in a protean soup some four billion years ago is still alive -- in each of us .
A Jurassic - park -- like experiment to " resurrect " an extinct species can only succeed when there is a close living relative , whose eggs have an ability to interpret the DNA of the past species .
If a Mars explorer finds something that looks like a DNA but is not the DNA , and the explorer finds no live Marsian cell , the chance of resurrecting a Marsian is nil .
Without a reader , a book has no meaning .
It has been determined that a human genome is only twice as complex as that of a fruit fly , and about as complex as the genome of a common weed .
Are humans themselves only twice as complex as a fruit fly ?
The size , in CPU instructions , of a driver for a modern network interface card can be comparable with the size of a tape driver of an old 8 - bit computer .
Does this mean that a modern computer is just as comparable to an old C - 64 ?
Can " information " act by itself , without a material agent ?
The end of Berlinski's article discusses this question .
We have seen that a message in isolation from a messenger and a receiver means nothing .
If understanding of a message always requires a material agent , then information does not have an independent existence , let alone an independent operation .
Logic encoded in a medium ( DNA , a book , a sequence of amino - acids ) cannot be understood given the same logic -- extra logic and an agent are required .
Information is not everything , because it is subjective .
A simple derivation of Shannon entropy
Given below is an elementary derivation for Shannon entropy , the measure of information .
This derivation is different from the one given in Theorem 2 and Appendix 2 of the Shannon paper [ Shannon ] .
The present derivation is somewhat close to the one hinted at in Theorem 4 .
I did it one evening while doing laundry .
Consider a source and a sink connected by a communication channel .
Two events , A and B , happen at the source with a particular rate Rs and with probabilities p and q ( =1 - p ) correspondingly .
A communication channel transmits a symbol X or a symbol Y at a rate Rc .
We want to modulate the stream of X and Y in such a way so to let the sink know what precisely is happening at the source .
Consider a sufficiently large time interval T .
During this time , the channel will carry N symbols from the source to the sink .
At the source , M events will happen , ( M=T * Rs ) : on average , pM of these events will be of type A and the rest , qM , will be of type B . During each time interval T , a particular combination of pM evens A and qM events B happens at the source , and a particular sequence of X and Y symbols of length N is transmitted to the sink .
There are at most 2 ^N distinct N - element sequences of two symbols .
There are choose ( pM out of M ) distinct combinations of pM evens A and qM events B :
choose ( pM out of M ) = M !/( pM ) !/( qM ) ! = ( pM+qM ) !/( pM ) !/( qM ) ! = { using an approximation n! = ( n /e ) ^n which is accurate for big n } ( ( pM+ qM ) / pM ) ^( pM ) * (( pM+ qM ) / qM ) ^( qM ) = ( 1/ p ) ^( pM ) * ( 1/q ) ^( qM ) .
T , we need to send distinct sequences of X and Y symbols for distinct sequences of events A and B .
Hence it must hold ( 1/ p ) ^( pM ) * ( 1/q ) ^( qM ) <= 2 ^N
Thus to guarantee the accurate transmission , the communication channel must at the very least has the capacity Rc / Rs = N / M = - p * log2 ( p ) - q* log2 ( q ) which is the channel capacity required for the most efficient coding , given in Theorem 9 of the Shannon 's paper .
If we want to accurately convey to the sink what happens at the source during the interval , we need to send distinct sequences of X and Y symbols for distinct sequences of events A and B .
Hence it must hold Thus to guarantee the accurate transmission , the communication channel must at the very least has the capacitywhich is the channel capacity required for the most efficient coding , given in Theorem 9 of the Shannon 's paper .
Now we can start drawing over - arching conclusions about information , the measure of information and uncertainty , etc .
But we should remember that at the heart of Shannon 's derivation of entropy is a trivial counting argument , a pigeonhole principle in disguise : to code events without the loss of " information " we need to have at least as many distinct codes as there are distinct event sequences .

Commentary
Feitelson's and Treinin 's article shows that DNA is a rather incomplete code for life .
DNA does not even completely specify a protein .
Special peptides , chaperons , are needed to help fold a newly synthesized protein into the correct form .
Furthermore , DNA has " multiple readings " .
A particular transcription is selected based on the mix of the proteins in the cytoplasm -- the current state of a cell .
" Thus , DNA is only meaningful in a cellular context in which it can express itself and in which there is an iterative , cyclic relationship between the DNA and the context . "
Lastly , not all inheritance is accomplished via DNA .
Prions , infamous for the Mad cow disease , is one example of the DNA - less inheritance .
Inheritance of major cell structures such as membranes and mitochondria occurs without the direct DNA participation .
Membranes , for example , include lipids , which are not coded in DNA .
Lipids are absorbed from food intake .
Even when the building material is protein , protein molecules do not automatically come together to make a cell organell .
Protein molecules are assimilated into the correct locations of the existing structure , e.g. , mitochondria , which thus grows and eventually divides .
This fact implies that the organelles must exist to begin with .
Feitelson's and Treinin 's article concludes ,
A major difficulty with the notion that the DNA contains all the required information is that this information seems useless without the surrounding cellular machinery .
While the DNA contains basic instructions on how to prepare many components of the machinery -- namely , proteins -- it is unlikely to contain full instructions on how to assemble them into supermolecular structures to create a functional cell .
Thus , we are left with the chicken - and - egg problem :
How did this process start ?
This question is actually quite complicated because the feedback cycle is very tight .
Proteins replicate , maintain , and protect the DNA .
We can't create proteins from DNA if we do n't already have proteins to assist in the transcription process as polymerases and to assist the new proteins in folding correctly into their intended 3D configurations as chaperones ....
Much work remains in biology before we will understand these and related issues .
[ O ] ur understanding of the human genome has changed in the most fundamental ways .
The small number of genes -- some 30,000 -- supports the notion that we are not hard wired .
We now know the notion that one gene leads to one protein , and perhaps one disease , is false .
One gene leads to many different protein products that can change dramatically once they are produced .
We know that some of the regions that are not genes may be some of the keys to the complexity that we see in ourselves .
We now know that the environment acting on our biological steps may be as important in making us what we are as our genetic code .

( CNN ) -- " Where is John Galt ? " reads a sign in the back of a vehicle heading down Interstate 85 in Atlanta , Georgia .
Ayn Rand , shown here on a 1999 stamp , is finding new readers thanks to the economic crisis .
The quotation is wrong .
As any reader of Ayn Rand 's " Atlas Shrugged " can attest , the correct line is " Who is John Galt ? " but the point is well taken .
In the midst of the credit crisis and the federal government 's massive bailout plan , the works of Rand , a proponent of a libertarian , free - market philosophy she called Objectivism , are getting new attention .
" If only ' Atlas ' were required reading for every member of Congress and political appointee in the Obama administration .
I 'm confident that we'd get out of the current financial mess a lot faster , " Wall Street Journal columnist Stephen Moore wrote in early January .
It 's obviously getting attention from the general public .
Rand book sales are " going through the roof , " said Yaron Brook , the president of the Ayn Rand Institute .
According to Brook , " Atlas Shrugged , " her most famous novel , has sold more copies in the first four months of 2009 than it did for all of 2008 -- and in 2008 , it sold 200,000 copies .
It 's been in Amazon. com 's top 50 for more than a month .
Not bad for a 1,100 - page doorstop of a book that came out in 1957 , by an author who died in 1982 .
Watch why Rand is so beloved »
" So many people see the parallels with actually what 's going on , with the government taking over the banks , with the government kind of taking over the automobile industry , a president who fires the CEO of a major American corporation .
These are the kind of things that come out of ' Atlas Shrugged , ' " Brook said .
Even Hollywood is said to be interested , which is only fitting , since Rand was once a screenwriter .
But developments have come in fits and starts .
" Godfather " producer Albert S. Ruddy once wanted to make a film and talk of miniseries adaptations emerged in the ' 70s and '90s .
In 2006 , Angelina Jolie was said to have been signed to star as Rand 's heroine , rail magnate Dagny Taggart , and names such as Russell Crowe and Brad Pitt have also been floated .
However , as of early 2009 , the status of the film remains unknown .
" Atlas Shrugged " concerns a group of corporate chieftains and individualists who go on strike in protest of government intervention in business .
Among those trying to figure out what 's happening are Taggart and steel tycoon Hank Rearden .
Eventually they meet John Galt , an engineer who had been elevated to legendary status by " stopping the motor of the world " in encouraging other individualists to drop out , and who delivers the novel 's showstopping 50 - page speech -- an expansive summary of Rand 's philosophy .
Upon the book 's release it divided critics and readers , some of whom praised its message of self - sufficiency .
More , however , disliked Rand 's politics and atheism , not to mention her writing .
" Is it a novel ?
Is it a nightmare ?
Is it Superman -- in the comic - strip or the Nietzschean version ? "
Time magazine asked in its review , adding that Rand 's " philosophy must be read to be disbelieved .
...
She deserves credit at least for imagination ; unfortunately , it is tied to ludicrous naivety . "
But Rand 's book -- which followed 1943's " The Fountainhead , " about a Frank Lloyd Wright - like architect determined to follow his own path -- was a best seller and has continued to be significant .
In 1991 , a Library of Congress / Book - of - the - Month Club survey named it No. 2 among respondents ' most influential books , after the Bible .
Her philosophy of selfishness and her love of pure capitalism ( she used to wear a dollar - sign brooch ) has earned her many followers , particularly on the right .
Rush Limbaugh is a fan ; former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was a Rand acolyte in his younger days and a member of her New York salon .
But Rand critics are equally fervent , questioning her belief in pure free markets .
" What I find so remarkable about it is if capitalism can work on its own without any government regulation , then we would n't be here , " said economist Heather Boushey of the left - leaning Center for American Progress .
Boushey points out that even Greenspan has reversed course , to an extent , in his admiration of laissez - faire economics .
" Those of us who have looked to the self - interest of lending institutions to protect shareholders ' equity -- myself , especially -- are in a state of shocked disbelief , " Greenspan told a congressional hearing in October .
The Rand Institute 's Brook points out that , to Rand , selfishness did not mean disengagement from the world or sociopathy .
" Rational self - interest , egoism , in Ayn Rand 's perception is not being Bernie Madoff , not thinking short - term and satisfying just whims , and cheating and lying and stealing , " he said .
" It is about pursuing what 's truly in your rational , long - term self - interest , figuring out what 's good for you , without exploiting , taking advantage , without stealing from other people , without sacrificing from other people to yourself .
" But also , " he added , " without sacrificing yourself to other people . "
iReport.com : Tribute to favorite book " Atlas Shrugged "
It 's that debate over shared sacrifice that will likely continue to fuel Rand 's critics , as well as her admirers .
At bookstores , it will likely keep cash registers ringing , which could only have made the dollar - sign - wearing author very happy , indeed .
CNN.com 's Todd Leopold contributed to this story .
I grew up in the 70’s and 80’s when parents still told their kids to go outside and play .
My friends and I would spend all day in the yard and when we got hot and sweaty enough we ’d run to the back patio , open the water spigot on the side of the house and get down on our hands and knees so we could get low enough to turn our mouths up for a drink of water that splashed all over our faces and down our necks .
In the evenings I remember seeing my parents shaking their heads as they watched the oil crises in the 1970 ’s unfold on the nightly news .
Gas prices skyrocketed to 73 cents a gallon !
“ Turn it off , ” my mother would say to my dad .
“ Good grief !
The wheel ’s are coming off but they make it sound like the world ’s ending . ”
Like me , as a child you probably hoped for a life that would exceed your dreams but as those dreams collapsed along the way you ’ve simply wished for a soft wing of hope but instead have gotten life in a culture of ungrace .
That ’s not a word but it should be .
If you do n’t know what ungrace is just listen to most people who did n’t vote for any sitting president , watch how fast Hollywood turns on a star who no longer sells at the box office or turn on the news anytime during the day .
Ungrace pulsates in our workplaces , communities , and in the media and tells us that regardless of what has happened we must do better , look better , and make ourselves better .
But to love and accept someone regardless of their flaws and failures is a breath of hope in a world that turns more upside down than right side up .
That is the gift of grace .
It ’s being dirty and smelly and turning your face up under the spigot .
Sometimes the wheels need to come off and you need to get pretty low before you appreciate grace .
The wheels are coming off for my friend Lisa .
She ’s the owner of a beautiful clothing store for women .
She ’s put her heart and soul into the store but then the economy tanked and people ran scared ( even those who still had jobs and owned their homes ) .
Trouble is , she did everything right : paid her mortgage , creditors and bills on time so she does n’t qualify for help .
The wheels are coming off for my friend Jacob .
When he took his vows he never envisioned this animosity , anger or separation .
The wheels are coming off for my friend Gerri .
She finished chemotherapy and is beginning nine weeks of radiation for breast cancer .
It was n’t her dream but she ’s added it to her daily schedule : go to work , get groceries , go to hospital for radiation , do laundry , make dinner .
When we plan our lives no one ever says , “ When I grow up I want to get a divorce , maybe two ! ”
Or , “ When I grow up I want to lose my house , my business and my life savings ! ”
Broken dreams are never part of anyone ’s plan .
We tie our plans up with ribbons and bows and aim for the mountain top but end up in the valley .
In Finding Grace ( St. Martin ’s Press , March 2009 ) I relate a story of walking with my second grade class to the library when a sixth grader spit on me .
He did n’t intend to spit on me but I was fortunate enough to be the one to pass at that exact moment .
My teacher Mrs. Brewer cleaned me up but when I looked down at my maroon polyester blend turtleneck I could see the white tissue particles clinging to where the snot had been .
“ He blindsided you , ” Mrs. Brewer said .
“ That ’s how it goes sometimes . ”
At some point , life blindsides us with something far greater than a giant loogie .
The diagnosis , abuse , foreclosure , broken marriage , death , or financial collapse brings us to our knees and though we try to clean ourselves up the best we know how we ’re still left with the stain of it all .
“ That ’s how it goes sometimes . ”
True .
But is n’t there more ?
The beauty of grace says yes .
There ’s more love after the infidelity , more joy after the diagnosis and more life after the financial ruin .
Chris Gardner , the bestselling author of The Pursuit of Happyness was once asked how he and his son were able to overcome the shame of homelessness .
Gardner said , “ We were homeless , not hopeless ! ”
Chris knew he was living on the streets but he was still living .
That ’s grace .
Grace is always present and always near but it ’s easy to miss — things are n’t always as they appear .
I just returned from Winnipeg where The Christmas Hope is being filmed in a house .
In previous months the homeowner fell off a ladder and broke several ribs .
During x-rays it was discovered that he had cancer .
That break - up , closed door to a job , or fall from a ladder may not be as devastating as you think but an act of grace that will save your life and help you discover higher dreams .
In a country of excess we suffer from a deficit of grace .
In the last few months I ’ve watched two stories on the news of men losing their jobs then killing their entire families and themselves .
In another story a man lost his job after twenty years .
“ It ’s heart wrenching , ” he said .
“ But I still have my family and we ’re all together . ”
That ’s the hope of grace speaking and it beats the alternative any day .
Last week my friend Lisa liquidated merchandise and said , “ It kills me to close this store but I know God still has a plan for me . ”
That ’s grace at the end of a shattered dream .
My friend Miriam ’s husband was devastated over their loss of money in the stock market .
“ How much do we have left ? ” she asked .
Embracing and recognizing what is left is grace at the end of an economically depressed rope .
There is life - altering power in that .
I once attended several Alcoholics Anonymous meetings for research .
A man said , “ I was a drunk for fifteen years .
I lost my wife and son because she could n’t take it anymore .
One day I woke up and said , ‘ What the hell am I doing ?
I need to live . ' ”
For fifteen years the noise of his life drown out the voice that said he was worthy , needed and loved but then came the day that he finally heard it .
That wake - up call to life is a gift from God .
With what strength that man had left he turned his face up toward that spigot of grace and let it splash all over him .
Finding grace in a culture of ungrace seems an impossible task but it is present , it is real and it is an indomitable gift that has the power to change your life .
It does come with one condition , though — like any gift you have to reach out and take it .

TAIPEI ( Reuters ) - A 4 - year - old boy has won the use of an uninhabited tropical island , with white sand beaches and clear turquoise waters , in a Taiwan lottery aimed at boosting spending during an economic downturn .
Officials said Yeh Chien - wei , who won the prize at Thursday ’s draw , will get exclusive rights to the tiny plot in the Taiwan Strait from May through September .
Penghu County , an offshore archipelago , will provide food , drinks , water and electricity to the boy .
He has been quoted in local media saying he wants to play in the sea .
“ Penghu has a lot of islands , and that one has water and electricity , so someone can really enjoy it , ” said county economic promotion official Lu Yan -chang , explaining why use of the island , which also has a cabin , was offered as a prize .
Counties elsewhere in Taiwan have offered cars , houses and other prizes to encourage locals to spend consumer vouchers worth T$ 3,600 ( $ 103 ) that the government gave to every citizen in January to encourage spending to help boost the sagging economy .
Penghu , which comprises 64 islands , is known for its beautiful beaches and water sports .
According to the terms of the prize , the boy and up to seven family members can visit the island five times , for trips that last a maximum of three days .
Israel 's Health Ministry has renamed swine flu " Mexico flu " to avoid giving offence to Jews , who can not eat pork .
Israel is one of the countries on high alert for swine flu after two local citizens returned from Mexico with possible symptoms of the disease .
But because pigs are considered unclean and Jewish dietary laws forbids the consumption of pork , the Israeli government has renamed the disease " Mexico flu " .
The ultra-orthodox Deputy Health Minister Yakov Litzman says it is unlikely either of the two men affected have contracted the disease , but Israeli authorities are well prepared to handle any cases .

In the past year , the Goldsmiths have broached the possibilities of deflation in at least four presentations ( parts 27 , 47 , 54 and 56 ) in the context that the present economic deflation pressures are coming precisely from the plutocratic ruling Rothschild Cabal .
But ultimately , the Goldsmiths have allowed that the eventual threat will devolve to a hyperinflationary blow off .
In support of a total deflationary collapse , there have been several scholarly and perceptive articles by different writers .
In the Goldsmiths ( Parts XXVII and XXXXVII ) , I have discussed the excellent work of John Olaques on how the banks receiving the bail out funds are simply not loaning those funds out to the public to cause inflation .
As I noted , these banks are socking the bail out receipts into US treasuries to hold in their vaults .
This process is adding to the deflationary threat .
Then there is the very pessimistic work of the Market Ticker in the Goldsmiths , Parts LIV and LVI .
This source builds a powerful argument for a total deflationary collapse within a year .
If this thing strikes in 2009 , as predicted by the Market Ticker , it will be devastating for America and much of the rest of the world .
Finally , I must mention the very scholarly work of Professor Antal E. Fekete of the San Francisco School of Economics .
He has written some great articles on the subject of inflation versus deflation as published by goldseek.com .
In his very informative and provocative study on the Quantity Theory of Money , Professor Fekete addresses the work of Chicago economist Melchior Palyi and the marginal productivity of debt ( the ratio of additional GDP to additional debt �thus the amount of new GDP contributed by the creation of new debt ) .
He then notes that presently the volume of outstanding debt is rising faster than GDP ( actually since 2006 , the marginal productivity of debt dropped below zero for the first time since 1945 ) .
His conclusion is that the more debt adds nothing to GDP , but causes economic contraction .
Fekete then posits that the present situation is a sign of an imminent economic catastrophe .
I mention the above three studies supporting a deflationary collapse because if any of them or all three of them are correct then a deflationary collapse will soon come and regardless of how much money Washington spends and irrespective of how much the US monetary base is increased by the Fed .
The Contrary View Aside from the above beliefs on a hyper deflationary blow off , there are , of course , a number of procrastinators who opt for a hyperinflationary blow off .
Many of these persons believe that such a collapse will come soon �like maybe this year .
For my part , I too have believed the hyperinflationary threat but I have chosen to follow the thinking of John Olaques , in the Goldsmiths 27 and 47 ; in that the hyperinflationary blow off is being delaying thru the present work of the money changers to deflate things and in the practice of the big banks to sock the expanding US money supply into bonds and notes for holding without allowing these expansions to chase goods and services in the US economy ( thus , it is clear why this increase in debt is not causing any increase in GDP ) .
Hence , my take has been that though there is presently a deflationary push on by the money changers , it is not succeeding in doing much beyond slowing down the rate of inflation .
In this sense , the pending hyperinflationary blow off is being delayed , stalled or deferred till later .
In other words , hyperinflation is on the way ; but the efforts of the money changers are such at present to delay the eventual reality of hyperinflation .
Thus , it �s coming but the timing is later .
For purposes of this Goldsmiths study , I must stick with my prevailing position on this question which is that ultimately hyperinflation will be the catalyst to destroy the economy of the US and much of the rest of the world .
But I May Need to Qualify My Position Slightly I see no reason to totally change my basic position on this question presently .
But the very excellent works of the Market Ticker and Professor Fekete , in the context of my own remarks at the Goldsmiths , parts XXVII and XXXXVII , prompt me to now read a little more caution into the question of when on the coming hyperinflationary blow out .
Professor Fekete�s words are very compelling to open the possibility that indeed we could soon face a hyper deflationary fall brought on because of the expansion of debt which has reached the saturation point where more debt does not produce more GDP .
Of course , based on the work of John Olaques and my own comments in the Goldsmiths , Parts 27 and 47 , it is a given that most of this increasing new debt cannot possibly increase GDP because it is being socked away in the bank vaults of the money changers .
Clearly , as long as the present US monetary profile prevails , there is a contraction under way .
This contraction could conceivably reach the blow out stage as envisioned by the Market Ticker and Professor Fekete .
In other words , if things don�t change fairly soon , we could conceivably have a hyper deflationary fall beyond anything imaginable .
In the Goldsmiths , part 47 , I outlined the basis problem .
The big banks are getting this increase in the money supply and socking it away in their acquisitions and holdings of US bonds , notes and paper .
They are simply not spending it to cause inflation .
Simultaneously , unemployed and needing people are using credit cards to live on .
This means that Americans are incurring more debts which precipitate high usury interest rates of 10 to 20 % per annum .
When one adds the credit card debt load to the already existing payments demanded from most of us for mortgages , car payments , etc , it means that we have a huge debt service load .
This process is demanding that most of us use much of our income to continuously service this debt load .
In this system , the big banks are the total winners as almost all of the people become heavily indebted to the bankers .
The Bottom Line My basic thesis remains intact .
There is no way to avoid the coming eventuality of a hyperinflationary collapse .
In the mean time , pending the arrival of this eventuality , we could have a temporary deflationary fall of a major magnitude ( although I have consistently argued that while the money changers are causing a deflationary fall they want it to be limited or contained and not get out of hand to rile the people up in anarchy and rebellion ) .
I think that if we do face a significant deflationary fall , as is possible , then the politicians will go wild and pass out money on the streets to any and every body .
In other words , the process of bailing out and paying money essentially to the big banks will fall by the wayside as the give aways shift to the man on the street ( right now , the average American has received very little of the bail out funds as most of this give away money has been going to the big banks ; but this focus could change in a deflationary collapse ) .
With too serious of a deflation , even the bankers will get scared of the possibilities of revolution and anarchy in the streets which could get people so mad that they will start hanging money changers , along with politicians .
This is a very dangerous situation that the Rothschild Cabal has set up .
Yet , there is something else on the horizon which clarifies why the Cabal has chosen this path of deflation knowing full well that whether deflation or inflation , they will ultimately rile up the people so much so that internal social problems could force them to get into their private jets and speed off to other countries around the world where they hold passports and have secret bank accounts in place .
Thus , the present bank bail out scheme is designed for them to steal and plunder all of the remaining wealth in the United States .
They are keeping the dollar high in value so that when the time comes , and they must leave the US , they can transfer / convert their dollar assets to things of more permanent value in more stable foreign countries �like hard currencies , gold , silver , real estate ( in certain foreign countries or in valuable US farm land ) , other commodities , etc .
I am sorry to say that the likes of Bernanke , Geithner , the Rothschilds , etc are not stupid people .
Actually , it would be good for the US if they were just dumb .
No , I think they know exactly what they are doing .
This whole process has been carefully thought out .
It is not a random change operation ; though some persons still believe this fairy tale nonsense .
The fat cats are going to plunder and steal the last remaining vestiges of wealth in America .
And when the time comes , they will , if necessary .
save their own hides by fleeing to a safe foreign country of their own choosing .
Those of us remaining in the US will be faced with a collapse�hyper deflationary / hyperinflationary .
Hence , in conclusion , I must allow that maybe the plutocrat imposed deflationary scenario could plunge downward in such a fashion that the thinking of the deflationists will prevail for a season .
But in that case , our politicians will go wild and flood dollars to people on the street so fast and furious that the ultimately predicted hyperinflation will come into being .
As long as the bail out funds have been going to the big banks for them to sock the give aways in US notes / bonds in their bank vaults , it has not caused hyperinflation .
But if and when the give aways start going to the collective American people , hyperinflation will soon be on us .
In terms of whatever laws are in effect to restrict the Fed in its money creating capacity , they all mean little or nothing for two key reasons .
First the Fed is never audited , checked or verified .
Its operations are conducted in secrecy .
Therefore , the Fed can do as it chooses .
And last , if necessary , the President / Congress can amend or change whatever law / rule deemed necessary .
So if the Fed claims that it can�t print money to flood the US streets , the law can be changed .
Even presently , in WWII and on other occasions , the Fed reportedly monetized debt by simply exchanging Federal Reserve Notes with the Treasury for US notes and bonds .
This process has allowed the Fed to greatly increase the money supply without a hitch in comparison with how thing are if the Fed has to use its open market operations to buy notes and bonds on the open market .
Too , since the Fed receives interest income on all of its US notes and bonds ( which is in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars annually ) , it is constantly receiving huge payments from the Treasury which allow it to be able to buy treasuries at random thru its open market operations and undertake other measures to manipulate and control the markets .

Previous Articles
You do n't have to worry about a soft drink spontaneously overflowing its rim or shooting up and out of the straw from which you 're trying to drink .
That 's because soft drinks are nothing like the superfluid helium shown in this video .
Researchers have known for decades that if you cool liquid helium just a few degrees below its boiling point of – 452 degrees Fahrenheit ( –269 degrees Celsius ) it will suddenly be able to do things that other fluids can't , like dribble through molecule - thin cracks , climb up and over the sides of a dish , and remain motionless when its container is spun .
No longer a mere liquid , the helium has become a superfluid — a liquid that flows without friction .
" If you set [ down ] a cup with a liquid circulating around and you come back 10 minutes later , of course it 's stopped moving , " says John Beamish , an experimental physicist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton .
Atoms in the liquid will collide with one another and slow down .
" But if you did that with helium at low temperature and came back a million years later , " he says , " it would still be moving . "
Like plenty of other physics experiments that make you go — " Huh ? " — superfluidity flows from the counterintuitive rules of quantum mechanics .
But unlike other quantum stuff , superfluid helium 's weird behavior is visible to the naked eye .
An early sign of helium 's odd behavior was observed back in 1911 by the Dutch physicist and 1913 Nobel physics laureate Heike Kamerlingh Onnes , a master of refrigeration who was the first to liquefy helium .
Onnes found that helium ( technically , the helium 4 isotope ) began to readily conduct heat below – 455.67 degrees F ( –270.92 degrees C ) , also known as the lambda point .
It was n't until 1938 that the Russian physicist Pyotr Kapitsa and , independently , the British duo of John Allen and Don Misener measured the flow rate of helium below that temperature through a pair of glass disks attached to a plunger and a long , thin glass tube , respectively .
The viscosity was so low that Kapitsa , who won his own Nobel Prize for the work , coined the term " superfluid " to describe it — after " superconductor , " the term for a material that conducts very high electric currents without resistance .
Key to the effect is helium 's unique ability to remain liquid down to absolute zero ( –459.67 degrees F , or – 273.15 degrees C ) , the temperature at which atoms theoretically stop moving .
When most liquids are cooled , the slight attraction between atoms in the fluid finally begins to overcome heat vibrations , and the particles settle into a regular order , namely a solid .
But helium atoms are so light and weakly drawn to one another that even when ordinary atomic motions have quieted , the atoms jiggle with zero - point motion , a slight momentum imparted by the quantum uncertainty principle .
Hence , they never settle into the solid state .
Helium 's liquidity at low temperatures allows it to carry out a transformation called Bose–Einstein condensation , in which individual particles overlap until they behave like one big particle .
Atoms acting in unison do n't behave like individual atoms .
" If you march in unison , you do n't collide with each other , " says Moses Chan , who studies superfluidity at Pennsylvania State University in University Park .
Researchers like to think of superfluid helium as a mixture of two fluids , one normal and one superfluid .
Different experiments bring out the contrasting characters of the two fractions .
The simplest " experiment " is to watch as a container full of liquid helium suddenly springs a leak as it is cooled below the lambda point and the frictionless superfluid fraction begins to pour through microscopic cracks that the normal liquid fraction cannot enter .
( " Super - leaks " have been the bane of scientists working with liquid helium since the early days , Beamish says . )
But stir the same helium like coffee and the normal liquid fraction will resist the motion , imparting viscosity to the superfluid mixture , after all .
As the temperature falls , the superfluid fraction takes up a greater share of the mixture .
In the field 's gold - standard experiment , researchers measure the ratio of the two fractions by placing a sample in a cylindrical metal container suspended by a wire .
When they impart a twist to the wire , the cylinder will rotate one way and then the other .
But only the normal fraction will rotate with the cylinder , because of friction between it and the cylinder walls ; the superfluid portion cuts right through the normal fluid and remains still .
As the superfluid fraction increases , the cylinder rotates faster , as if the cylinder were losing weight ( technically , inertia ) .
Superfluid helium 's dual nature is at work again when it climbs the walls of a container .
( Watch this YouTube video of the effect . )
Any liquid will coat the sides of a dish in which it sits — thanks again to the slight attraction between atoms — but the liquid 's internal friction limits how far the coating may spread .
In superfluid helium , the frictionless film slithers over the whole container , creating a sort of arena through which the superfluid can flow .
If the liquid has somewhere to fall after it climbs out of the dish , it will drip from the bottom of the container until it siphons out all the superfluid pooled above it .
The same principle underlies another famous demonstration in which superfluid rapidly shoots out of an open , heated glass tube packed with fine powder at the bottom .
Called the superfluid fountain , it occurs because the superfluid outside of the tube rushes in to cool down the superfluid that has been warmed by the inside of the tube .
( Allen , the co-discoverer of superfluidity , is said to have discovered the effect after he shined a pocket flashlight onto a glass tube of liquid helium . )
Work on superfluid helium has already netted three Nobel Prizes and may yet garner more .
In 2004 Penn State 's Chan and Eun-Seong Kim rotated a ring full of solid helium at 26 atmospheres of pressure and found that as they cooled the helium below the critical temperature , the rotational frequency increased , just as it does with liquid helium .
Half a dozen laboratories , including Beamish's , are studying the " supersolid " effect , but researchers still are n't sure which elements of the solid would condense into a single Bose–Einstein state .
The trick now is to see if the supersolid can produce the equivalent of super - leaks or other well - known super - effects .
" If other unique properties can be convincingly shown , " Beamish says , " everyone would agree it 's a new phase of matter . "
It ’s very hard to underestimate the global impact of Katsuhiro Otomo ’s film adaptation of his own , epic manga Akira .
It broke box office records when it opened in Japan , and along with Ghibli Oscar winner Spirited Away it is probably the anime film most western ‘ non - fans ’ have seen .
For many of my generation it is a much treasured and personally important film and , without resorting to hyperbole , one that the first viewing of was a life - changing experience , akin to watching Star Wars , 2001 or Blade Runner for the first time .
It did n’t hit the UK until 1991 , and I can still vividly remember trekking to a grimy arthouse cinema in East Oxford with a friend – both of us 17 years old at the time , not quite knowing what to expect , but spurred on by a clip we ’d seen once on TV , that can have been barely two minutes long .
Two minutes of motorbike chases , rioting and cyberpunk Japanese city - scapes .
And equally I can remember us both stumbling out afterward into the cool night air , eyes - wide and speechless , Oxford ’s crumbling , historic architecture fading into unimportance around us .
Sure , we ’d seen some snippets of anime before ; British TV treating us to Battle of the Planets , Speed Racer and whatever Saturday morning shows it deemed suitable for children , but now our minds were open to the potential of animation to depict realistic worlds , mature narratives and action sequences that Hollywood could only dream of .
Things would never be quite the same .
A few months later , I was queuing in my local HMV to buy the limited edition VHS double tape pack – one tape with the subbed version , the other the exclusive Akira Production Report – a precursor of the now ubiquitous DVD extra .
Now , 18 years later , I ’ve just bought the film for a third time , retiring the DVD to the shelf alongside that original , still treasured VHS boxset .
Due to stock problems the Blu-ray still has n’t surfaced here in the UK , so the question is : was importing it worth the cost of importing it from the US ?
As soon as the film ’s opening starts , one thing is clear – this is visually the best presentation of Akira you ’ve ever seen .
I ’d go as far to say it even surpasses the cinema presentation that I originally saw in that seedy , run -down theater .
Every subsequent viewing has always forced you to spot details you never saw before , but this is taken to a new level with the brilliant transfer to HD .
Otomo ’s emotive character designs shine , and the detailed background art looks even more exquisite than before .
Much has been made of this release ’s audio pushing the limits of the BR format , and even without the required cutting edge AV setup to playback the True - HD stream it sounds dazzling .
Both Shoji Yamashiro ‘s mesmerizing score and the audio effects demand you pump the volume as high as you dare .
All said , this is a wonderful package , and a vital purchase not just for anime fans , but anyone wanting to show off the best of what the Blu-ray format can offer .
If i have any reservations at all , it ’s about the lack of extras on the disc .
The collection of Otomo ’s storyboards is a brilliant bonus , granted , but you ca n’t help but feel it would be better enjoyed in a similar format to his fascinating Steamboy Storyboard Book .
And that ’s all there is , apparently due to a lack of space due to the enhanced audio .
Plus Bandai ’s recession - era decision to produce just one disc for all regions has lead to a multitude of language and subtitle tracks being crammed in , undoubtedly not helping the problem .
Still , it ’s a shame not to see the production report again , plus some new , retrospective featurettes and interviews would have rounded out the package nicely .
I ca n’t shake the sneaking suspicion that another , inevitable two disc release will see the light of day before too long .
In preparation for sitting and watching it again , I recently finished re-reading the original , 2000 + page manga again .
It ’s always a slight shock when you realise how much of his intricately woven , action filled plot Otomo had to loose to bring the film in at just over two hours ; Watchmen fans moaning about the cuts from the recent film adaptation would have a stroke if they saw what was done here .
There is enough material to fuel a full 26 episode anime series – something I believe we may see yet , especially as recession facing industry turns to reliable franchises once again .
Major , plot shaping characters from the manga – like Lady Miyako and Kaisuke – are reduced to simple , flitting cameos , while others like Chiyoko are never seen at all .
But it is Otomo ’s story and his adaptation , and he alone understands it ’s nuances , and the themes he was originally trying to convey .
As a result the film stands alone as a perfect story , captivating the audience for every second of it ’s 130 minutes .
It is truly , still , a masterpiece , and this new Blu-ray release – while not perfect – is an essential purchase .
Whether you ’re a die hard fan or a newcomer to anime , pick this up as soon as you can .
Is Richer Greener ?
Jonathan ’s fine post reminds us that some of the gloom - and - doom predictions of people like Paul Ehrlich have proven false , and that it is just as easy to exaggerate the problem of environmental degradation as to neglect it .
But in rereading Tierney ’s column and some of his other work , I realized that Tierney ’s reporting on the environmental Kuznet ’s curve repeatedly makes a serious error .
I do n’t know whether Jonathan has made the same error or not — not explicitly if he did — but it is worth explaining .
As Tierney describes it , the EKC describes a recurrent — but not universal — pattern where increasing wealth in a country is not ( as Ehrlich predicted ) correlated with increasing environmental degradation ; instead , the emission of at least some types of pollutants and activity that causes other forms of environmental degradation flatten out and decline as wealth increases .
Tierney observes this pattern and leaps to the conclusion that we need n’t worry too much about global warming and other pollution problems because eventually the flattening out will occur in these cases as well .
( And , indeed , he cites empirical research that shows a long - term reduction in carbon per unit of energy . )
But as Jonathan ’s examples make clear , the reason for this pattern has nothing to do with the problem of pollution properly understood — as a problem of negative externality .
Consider the example of the saw blades .
A firm that owns a patch of timber rationally switches from thicker to thinner saw blades because thinner saw blades waste less wood .
If demand remains constant , then the firm will destroy fewer trees than in the past .
In this way , technological development reduces what Tierney calls “ environmental impact . ”
But in this example , environmental impact is purely internalized .
When a firm can produce output with a new technology that wastes fewer inputs , it will do so .
Happily for the rest of us , the extra trees may absorb some greenhouse gases , but that was certainly not the goal of the firm .
It just happens that in this particular setting a firm ’s profit - maximizing decision to switch to a new technology benefits other people .
But this example reflects contingency only .
Why would a profit - maximizing firm care about benefiting the rest of us ?
Indeed , it will surely destroy more trees than is optimal from the social standpoint since it does not internalize the full social benefit .
But Tierney is not comparing the current level of forestation with the optimal level ; he is comparing it with a level that existed at an arbitrarily chosen earlier period .
Suppose now that a still newer saw blade technology will be even more efficient for the firm , but the manufacturing process needed to produce it generates loads of greenhouse gases .
The firm will switch to this technology even though the social costs may be greater than the social benefits ( in the form of cheaper wood , more trees , etc. ) .
I can see only two possible explanations for the EKC .
The first is the one I provided in my earlier post : that as people become wealthier , they become more willing to pay for regulation that reduces pollution .
( Wealthier people may also be able to demand and secure better governmental institutions that will reliably translate their preferences into outcomes . )
The second is that , given our system of incomplete property rights that fails to internalize all positive and negative externalities , it is not surprising that technological change sometimes has positive effects on the environment ( a new technology exploits inputs more efficiently , benefiting both the user who needs to pay for fewer inputs and third parties who suffer from less pollution ) , and sometimes has negative effects on the environment ( a new technology benefits a user because it results in more waste being externalized on other parties ) .
Julian Simon won his famous bet with Paul Ehrlich because it turns out that technological development frequently does outpace demand for resources , but Simon never claimed that it follows that we should n’t tax activities that cause pollution — because it does n’t !
It is certainly possible that the first theory applies to carbon use .
Fuels that generate energy alone rather than energy plus a bundle of harmful pollutants will , all else equal , provide greater benefits to those who use them because they get more energy for the buck .
The long - term trend toward greater energy efficiency thus can be attributed , in part or even in whole , to market incentives , which have caused energy users to switch from less efficient ( expensive ) to more efficient ( cheaper ) sources of energy .
But because these energy users care about clean energy only to the extent that it reduces their own costs , and not to the extent that it reduces costs for third parties , this process has occurred too slowly , and so government intervention is warranted .
I fear that people like Tierney have fallen prey to the notorious selection effect .
They are looking for examples where environmental degradation has receded ( forestry ) rather than increased ( the atmospheric commons , the ocean fisheries ) , and then , implicitly , saying that the happy outcomes in the first case mean that we should n’t care about the bad outcomes in the second .
Of course , that is wrong .
Where technological change causes people to use their property rights in a way that benefits rather than harms other people , obviously there is no or little reason for government intervention .
But where it has the opposite effect , there is .
The existence of the first phenomenon does not imply that the second phenomenon does not exist .
A final point .
The phrase “ richer is greener ” may be a reasonable description of the world , but I do n’t think it has any implications for policy .
If some activity produces pollution , the usual prescription is to tax it so that the marginal cost of the activity equals the marginal benefit .
The producer should stop the activity at the point at which an additional unit hurts society more than it helps it .
The “ richer is greener ” slogan may seem to imply that in fact we should n’t tax this activity .
The tax will make us poorer — consumers pay more and shareholders receive less .
If the tax is not imposed , we ’ll be richer and therefore (? ) greener .
But the goal of social policy is not to make us richer but to make us better off , and when we prefer clean air over extra money , then the tax is justified .
The only way I can make sense of the slogan is as a claim that richer people care more about the environment and voluntarily cut back on consumption , buy more green - friendly goods , and so forth ; over the long term , more rich people mean a cleaner environment .
As I noted before , rich people cause more environmental harm than poor people do .
A McMansion uses more energy than a small apartment with leaky windows ; a Prius uses more energy than a seat on a bus .
But even if this claim were true , by hypothesis , the richer people are worse off than they would be if the tax had been imposed — they are actually poorer in a well - being sense as opposed to a monetary sense .
Indeed , if the story about their preferences is true ( and I remain skeptical ) , they will spend a lot of the money they save on taxes by traveling to places with clean air , purchasing oxygen supplies , and so forth , so they may be poorer rather than richer .
I suspect that the story is a lot simpler here .
In countries where people get their act together and manage to create and sustain high - quality institutions , these institutions ( functioning court systems , non-corrupt legislatures , and so forth ) adopt socially beneficial policies — including policies that both enable people to accumulate wealth and constrain activities that cause environmental harm .
Al - Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded more than 80 times
The CIA 's use of waterboarding to interrogate terrorism suspects was approved by Condoleezza Rice as early as 2002 , a senate report reveals .
As national security adviser , Ms Rice consented to the harsh interrogation of al - Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaydah , the Senate Intelligence Committee found .
Memos released last week show that he and another key detainee were subjected to waterboarding 266 times .
Former Vice - President Dick Cheney has said the techniques produced results .
The latest details were revealed in a timeline of the CIA 's interrogation programme produced by the US Senate Intelligence Committee .
It shows Ms Rice and other top Bush administration officials were first briefed about " alternative interrogation methods , including waterboarding " , in May 2002 .
BUSH -ERA INTERROGATION
Waterboarding : Aimed at simulating sensation of drowning .
Used on alleged 9/11 planner Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Insect : Harmless insect to be placed with suspect in ' confinement box ' , suspect to be told the insect would sting .
Approved for Abu Zubaydah , but not used Walling : Detainee slammed repeatedly into false wall to create sound and shock Sleep deprivation : Detainee shackled standing up .
Used often , once for 180 hours
Q&A : Waterboarding
The CIA is reported to have wanted to use the techniques to interrogate Abu Zubaydah , who was captured in Pakistan in March 2002 .
In a meeting with the then - CIA Director George Tenet in July 2002 , Ms Rice " advised that the CIA could proceed with its proposed interrogation " of Zubaydah , subject to Justice Department approval , the report says .
A year later , the CIA briefed officials including Ms Rice , Mr Cheney and Attorney General John Ashcroft on the use of waterboarding and other methods .
The officials " reaffirmed that the CIA programme was lawful and reflected administration policy " , the Senate report says .
CIA memos released by President Barack Obama 's administration last week revealed that Zubaydah was waterboarded at least 83 times and self - confessed 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammad 183 times .
Other interrogation methods mentioned in the memos include week - long sleep deprivation , forced nudity and the use of painful positions .
Former Vice - President Dick Cheney has called for the release of additional documents that he said would show what the techniques yielded .
Earlier this week , President Obama left open the possibility of prosecuting officials behind the CIA 's harsh interrogation techniques , saying it would be up to the attorney general to prosecute .
He had been criticised by human rights groups and UN officials after saying , when the memos were released , that CIA personnel working from Bush administration legal opinions would not face prosecution .

UPDATE # 2 : Swine Flu in Mexico - Timeline of Events
UPDATE --
I was thinking about this very thing while typing up this post , and then promptly forgot to add it in .
I 'll let AMERICAblog do that for me :
GOP is filibustering the confirmation of the Secretary of HHS in the midst of swine flu preparations -- I was thinking about this very thing while typing up this post , and then promptly forgot to add it in .
I 'll let AMERICAblog do that for me :
Mirror , mirror on the wall , who are the most shortsighted , destructive , self - serving know - nothings of all :
When House Appropriations Committee chairman David Obey , the Wisconsin Democrat who has long championed investment in pandemic preparation , included roughly $ 900 million for that purpose in this year 's emergency stimulus bill , he was ridiculed by conservative operatives and congressional Republicans .
Obey and other advocates for the spending argued , correctly , that a pandemic hitting in the midst of an economic downturn could turn a recession into something far worse [...]
The current swine flu outbreak is not a pandemic , and there is reason to hope that it can be contained . [...]
On Sunday , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced that a national " public health emergency " had been declatred .
( Notably , the second question at the White House press conference on the emergency had to do with the potential impact on the economic recovery . ) [...]
Rove dismissed Obey 's proposals as " disturbing " and " laden with new spending programs . "
He said the congressman was peddling a plan based on " deeply flawed assumptions . "
Like what ?
Rove specifically complained that Obey 's proposal included " $ 462 million for the Centers for Disease Control , and $ 900 million for pandemic flu preparations . "
We interrupt our regularly scheduled blot post to bring you breaking news .
We have found the source of the swine flu outbreak :
Now back to our blog post already in progress :
The attack on pandemic preparation became so central to the GOP strategies that AP reported in February : " Republicans , meanwhile , plan to push for broader and deeper tax cuts , to trim major spending provisions that support Democrats ' longer - term policy goals , and to try to knock out what they consider questionable spending items , such as $ 870 million to combat the flu and $ 400 million to slow the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases . "
Famously , Maine Senator Susan Collins , the supposedly moderate Republican who demanded cuts in health care spending in exchange for her support of a watered - down version of the stimulus , fumed about the pandemic funding : " Does it belong in this bill ?
Should we have $ 870 million in this bill No , we should not . "
Yes , we should have .
Even now , Collins continues to use her official website to highlight the fact that she led the fight to strip the pandemic preparedness money out of the Senate 's version of the stimulus measure .
We 'll be right back after this short break , brought to you by Maine 's burgeoning dry cleaning industry :
Now , back to our post :
The Republicans essentially succeeded .
The Senate version of the stimulus plan included no money whatsoever for pandemic preparedness . [...]
[ S ] tate and local governments , and the emergency services that would necessarily be on the frontlines in any effort to contain a pandemic , got nothing .[...]
No serious player in Washington has been unaware of the fears with regard to a flu pandemic .
They have been well - publicized and well - discussed . [...]
And it is important to point out that no serious player in Washington could have been unaware of the threat that a pandemic -- or even the fear of one -- would pose to economic renewal . [...]
But they bet that they would be able to score their political points without any consequences .
Senate Democratic leaders bowed to Collins in the process of crafting their chamber 's version of the stimulus . [...]
Collins played politics with public health , and the economic recovery .
That makes her about as bad a player as you will find in a town full of bad players .
But Senate Democrats bent to her demands .
That makes them , at the very least , complicit in the weakening of what needed to be a muscular plan . [...]
There is , however , a hero on the House side .
Throughout the process , David Obey battled to get Congress to recognize that a pandemic would threaten not just public health but a fragile economic recovery .
Thank you for joining us .
Tune in again next week when we discover that despite Donald Rumsfeld 's stake in Tamiflu , he has been foolish enough to maintain his relationship with a Mexican pig named Karlos Rovero , and , to his surprise and dismay , contracted a nasty case of the swine flu .
G'night folks !

I had a column about how A - Rod was n’t going to be charged with anything but that Phelps probably was – but apparently the local sheriff – after 8 arrests – thought better of wasting to many resources .
This image was inspired in part by this blog post by Timothy Egan at the New York Times .
Egan initially focused on those who did n’t get away with youthful indiscretions :
At least one in five people in state prisons are doing time for drug offenses .
What must they think , rotting away in musty cells , hearing a president or a celebrity athlete dismiss their mistakes with the hoary line of young and stupid ?
… Phelps seemed contrite in trotting out his young and stupid defense .
“ I ’m 23 years old and despite the successes I ’ve had in the pool , I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way , ” he said .
More like youthful and appropriate .
I have a hard time going after him for taking a hit of pot after he spent most of his life as a robo- athlete …
But this passage ’s appropriate savaging of A - Rod is what inspired the above image :
A - Rod will likely face no legal consequences , nothing from the the toothless barons of baseball .
Phelps took his hit for recreation .
Rodriguez did his drug to cheat the game and himself .
He lied about it .
And then he blamed it all on his age and pressure to perform because of his oversized contract .
His punishment will come from the Bronx fans , brutal in their daily assessments , people who know that if they put a syringe in their arm while working with heavy equipment nobody will cut them a young - and - stupid break .

Lois Draegin was an editor at TV Guide before she got laid off — now she has an internship to help her build internet skills .
That 's admirable !
But the internship 's kind of awful .
We should know !
Draegin , who is 55 , is now an intern at Liz Smith - publishing older women 's site Wowowowowowowow.com .
Her boss is 24 .
We find that inspiring — someone who reached the top of the publishing profession , got laid off , and , with no trace of entitlement or snobbishness , put her head down and took a shitty internship to learn new skills to build her career back up again .
It 's nice !
But as you can see , the internet has already eaten any shred of editorial dignity she had left :
Arriving before 8 one day , her immediate task was to look for story ideas and mash together information from other websites into a brief news item for the " Wow Watch " column .
Finding topics was easy enough — Draegin fits WOW 's demographic and instinctively understands the interests of its savvy readers .
But she repeatedly had to check her gut instincts against that all - important tool — Google Trends — to make sure her ideas would attract readers to the website .
That morning , she chose to put yet another angle on a story about the California mother of octuplets who has been omnipresent on the Web .
Draegin quickly cranked out four paragraphs emphasizing that the " octomom " had decided to give all eight babies the same middle name — Angel .
Keep trucking , Lois ; there 's still quite a ways to fall on the internet .

All the talk in markets is of a possible slowdown in the rate of decline .
The reason why share prices around the world have been rising in the past few days is not that there is evidence of economic recovery - but rather that the pace of deterioration may have been decelerating .
Think of it as what happens when you touch down in a plane and the pilot turns on the thrust reversers at full pelt - the plane stops before it overshoots the runway ( barring mechanical failure ) .
The pilots of the global economy have been gradually increasing the force ( and noise ) of thrust - reversal in recent months : monetary and fiscal authorities have cut the cost of credit , pumped money into the system , rebuilt banks ' balance sheets and stimulated the economy .
That amounts to many trillions of dollars of economic force .
There may be more to do - but it 's bound to have an effect .
Now , since it was a collapse in the availability of credit that pushed the world into the worst economic conditions since the 1930s , an improvement in the supply of credit would be ( for most people ) an encouraging sign .
In that context , the Bank of England 's last credit conditions survey - which was published on Thursday but was drowned out by G20 mania - may turn out to be significant .
The survey claimed that in the first quarter of this year there had been a slight increase in the availability of loans to companies and a less - than - expected reduction in the supply of unsecured credit to households and small businesses - although the supply of mortgages shrank again .
Perhaps more relevantly , credit conditions were expected to improve in the coming three months : credit will remain tight , but not quite as tight as it has been .
It could be the first cuckoo ( sorry for mixing my metaphors ) .
And there may be other cuckoo - ish noises ; there 's been contradictory data on what 's happening in the housing market in the UK - whose underlying message may be that prices are n't dropping as quickly as they were - and a less - than - expected fall in US motorcar sales ( though today 's news on car sales in Britain is dismal ) .
I am being parochial , and economic stats from around the world remain pretty dire .
But here 's the paradox .
It 's impossible to prove that we 've heard the first cuckoo in spring .
However that may not be the disaster it seems .
What matters - to an extent - is what investors think they 've heard .
Confused ?
The point - which I 've been making for some time - is that there is an inextricable link between asset prices and the supply of credit ( and between the supply of credit and economic prospects in general ) .
Or to put it another way , a pre-condition of economic recovery is that asset prices have to stabilise and then rise in a sustained way .
For asset prices to rise , investors ' appetite for risk has to increase - which would happen as and when they see portents of better times ahead .
And if - for example - property prices then bounced even a little , banks would have a bit more confidence when lending , because collateral would not be seen as inexorably shrinking .
A similar virtuous process stems from a generalised rise in share prices .
And that 's a trend we have been seeing from Tokyo to Wall Street to London .
If share prices rise , including the share prices of banks ( as has been happening ) , then it becomes much more of a realistic prospect for companies - including banks - to raise the equity capital they need .
That in turn both reduces the demand for emergency lines of credit and increases the willingness of banks to lend .
Against that background , the strong demand for HSBC's £ 12.5 bn of new shares has to be seen as a very good thing .
None of which is to say that even if we 've heard the cuckoo that it could n't yet be wiped out by yet another malevolent storm .
And I 've bored you rigid with my fears about the huge challenges we 'll face , even after the recession has ended in a technical sense .
That said , it would be mean - spirited not to take pleasure from the thought that we might have heard a cuckoo .
Worst of financial crisis yet to come : IMF chief economist Adam Dupont
Published : Saturday November 22 , 2008
Print This Email This ZURICH , Switzerland ( AFP ) 
The IMF 's chief economist has warned that the global financial crisis is set to worsen and that the situation will not improve until 2010 , a report said Saturday .
Olivier Blanchard also warned that the institution does not have the funds to solve every economic problem .
" The worst is yet to come , " Blanchard said in an interview with the Finanz und Wirtschaft newspaper , adding that " a lot of time is needed before the situation becomes normal . "
He said economic growth would not kick in until 2010 and it will take another year before the global financial situation became normal again .
The International Monetary Fund on Friday promised to help Latvia deal with its economic crisis after it assisted Iceland , Hungary , Ukraine , Serbia and Pakistan .
But Blanchard said the IMF was not able to solve all financial issues , in particular problems of liquidity .
Withdrawals of capital leading to problems of liquidity " can be so significant that the IMF alone cannot counter them , " he said , adding that massive withdrawals of investments from emerging countries could represent " hundreds of billions of dollars .
" We do not have this money .
We never had it , " he said .
The IMF had spent a fifth of its 250 billion dollar ( 200 billion euro ) fund in the last two weeks , Blanchard added .
He also urged central banks around the world to cut interest rates , after the Swiss National Bank made a surprise one percentage point rate cut Thursday .
The central banks " should lower interest rates to as close to zero as possible , " he said .
Conspiracy theorists — 9/11 deniers , moon - landing paranoiacs , Cassandras of the New World Order — are the holy fools of our age .
Things are not what they seem , they preach to us daily from their street corners and Web sites , and try as we might to ignore them , we can't help but soak up their toxic paranoia and narcissism in our best sellers and blockbusters .
Pop culture has always had plots and conspiracies , of course — the first blockbuster was the white - supremacist epic Birth of a Nation , whose major theme was the secret agenda behind Southern Reconstruction .
Back then conspiracy theory was a shocking device ; today it 's a marketing tool .
This month Angels and Demons will be released , the latest installment of the conspiracy - themed global franchise spawned by Dan Brown 's The Da Vinci Code .
While Da Vinci starred Opus Dei , a Catholic organization whose secret , unstated mission is to suppress the knowledge that Jesus had kids with Mary Magdalene , Angels and Demons takes on the Illuminati , a secular secret society that supposedly exists to impose Enlightenment on the world against its will .
As far as Brown and his readers are concerned , it does n't matter what purpose any given secret society serves — religion or atheism , the church or its opposite — just so long as there 's a conspiracy .
The hunger that Brown 's books feed is not a hatred of one group or another but the fantasy that someone , whoever it may be , is running the show from behind the scenes .
The rumor circulating about his next book , putatively titled The Solomon Key , is that it 's about the Freemasons .
Maybe Mel Gibson will get lucky and Brown will then move on to the Jews .
Brown 's most bankable decision — and one mimicked by a string of best - selling imitators like and Steve Berry — was to avoid the mistake of overcomplication , making paranoid delusions of hidden power , which are usually esoteric and elaborate , simple enough that anyone with a grade - six education could understand them .
The old adage that nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people needs a caveat :
Wide audiences can desire more difficulty , more confusion , more stripping away of the expected and apparent , but only for a while .
The appeal of a show like Lost , at least at the beginning , was the feeling that nothing is ever what it seems .
What is this island ?
Who are " the Others " ?
Why is Michael shooting Ana Lucia and Libby and then himself in the arm ?
The sensation of assumptions collapsing drove the show .
Now Lost has collapsed under its own endless collapsing , its record - low ratings a symptom of intellectual exhaustion .
The paradox here is that while our appetite for bite - sized conspiracies in pop culture has never been stronger , our rejection of conspiracies in reality has never been more thorough .
The Anti-Defamation League reported recently that the number of people who believe that the Jews control Hollywood is at a record low , down to 22 percent from nearly 50 percent in 1964 .
Spike Lee may say that one of the levees in New Orleans was blown up by the government to intentionally flood the Ninth Ward , but nobody pays attention to it .
When the pope decided to rehabilitate members of the Society of Saint Pius X , he no doubt regarded the matter as a minor doctrinal question of little interest to anyone but theologians or historians of schism .
Then the shitstorm landed .
Bishop Richard Williamson , the most insane of the bunch , has a gift for boiling down conspiracy theories to their most basic : " The Jews created the Holocaust . "
The Twin Towers , he says , " were professionally demolished by a series of demolition charges from the top to the bottom of the towers . "
Who does he think he is : some Oscar - winning French starlet ?
Any profession of belief in a conspiracy has become , automatically , a sign of dangerous delusion .
Napoleon said that you should never ascribe to malice what can adequately be explained by incompetence , and the one positive legacy of the Bush years is that no one can sensibly believe in a " vast right - wing conspiracy " anymore .
When they wheeled away Dick Cheney after Obama 's inauguration , he was a Strangelovian symbol of all that is cruel and vicious , but who could say he ran the world ?
Who could still believe that Bush was capable enough to conspire ?
He could barely speak in complete sentences .
The world is falling apart around us , and we are repulsed and attracted in equal measure by the idea of secret workings behind the collapse :
We crave having someone to blame but recognize that our craving is fantastic .
So we cower in conspiratorial delusions that we know can not be true .
If only there were a conspiracy , pop culture screams , if only there were a secret mechanism holding everything together .
" Human kind cannot bear very much reality , " T. S. Eliot wrote .
The reality we can't bear to look at , however , is n't hidden groups of powerful men controlling everything but the more terrifying truth that there are no hidden groups of powerful men controlling everything .
It 's our deepest form of escapism to imagine a world in which we are powerless , because it excuses our selfishness .
The real nightmare is that no one is to blame for the state of the world but ourselves .
Barack Obama has called for a new era of personal responsibility , seeking with the mighty arsenal of his celebrity to alter the mass dream we have fashioned for ourselves .
From the beginning , his wife told anyone who would listen that her husband could n't solve the country 's or the world 's problems , which is a hell of a way to run a presidential campaign .
But the fad for conspiracy has n't waned since he returned an aura of intelligent control to the White House .
Which just goes to prove him right :
No one can rid us of our lazy , self - indulgent fantasies , not even the most admired and powerful man in the world .
Fixing ourselves , for once , has to be on us .

Matilda Gifford claims police were willing to pay her for information on protest groups
Politicians stepped in when Matilda Gifford revealed that she was approached by officers claiming to be from Strathclyde Police a few weeks after she was arrested in a protest at Aberdeen Airport in March .
Liberal Democrats , Labour and the Scottish Green Party called on ministers to clarify the role of police and ensure their actions were appropriate .
Ms Gifford said she had felt " intimidated " by the experience , which she made public in a series of recordings handed to the Guardian newspaper .
" The main thing about getting this story out was to warn other activists .
Other people have been offered money or intimidated like me , " she said .
" We 're not to be intimidated , we must continue to do what we do with a clean conscience .
After being scared by these people , I wanted to go public so that I can feel safe . "
The 24 - year - old said police told her that they have a network of informants inside protest organisations , which they tried to persuade her to join .
In meetings at a Glasgow police station , which she recorded , and later in a cafe , they offered her financial rewards for information on Plane Stupid .
Strathclyde Police Assistant Chief Constable George Hamilton said the force had " a responsibility to gather intelligence " .
He added : " Officers from Strathclyde Police have been in contact with a number of protesters who were involved with the Plane Stupid protests , including Aberdeen Airport .
The purpose of this contact has been to ensure that any future protest activity is carried out within the law and in a manner which respects the rights of all concerned . "
The revelations were described as a " storm in a teacup " by John O'Connor , a former commander of Scotland Yard 's Flying Squad , who told the BBC : " The police do n't just sit in their ivory tower and expect the phone to ring and be given intelligence information .
They go out actively to gather it . "
Friday afternoon , Glenn Beck pushed his tea bag parties with one of the nuttiest nuts I 've ever seen on television : a fictional Thomas Paine , exhorting American's to rebel against their government .
It 's the kind of thing you have to see to believe , but at the same time , it 's practically torture to sit through it .
So we got the idea of annotating the bizarre monologue using captions , and within a matter of hours , a new feature for DKTV was born : annotated video .
Please keep in mind that this is till in the experimental stage , and your feedback is most welcome .
☻ ☺ Unicode Humor ☺ ☻
Like a lot of Unicode engineers , Jim would occasionally take his wife with him on his foreign travels .
On their last trip to China , his wife became enamored of calligraphy and Chinese characters .
In fact , at one point while having lunch in a simple Chinese restaurant , she noticed an especially beautiful rendering of a few characters on a handwritten luncheon menu .
She discreetly tucked the menu in her purse .
Being an avid knitter and skilled at designing intricate patterns , within a few months she had produced a stunning white sweater with the same Chinese symbols hand - stitched down the front .
She received compliments galore whenever she wore it .
She was also quite excited to wear it to the next Unicode Conference dinner event .
The sweater seemed to attract a lot of interest and many more compliments .
She knew the Unicode experts would really appreciate her attention to the styling of the Chinese characters .
After dinner another Unicode engineer came up to Jim 's wife and asked where she got the symbols .
He then wanted to know if she knew what they meant .
" I'm afraid to ask , but tell me anyway . " she said .
Even she had to laugh when he told her their meaning .
" This is a cheap dish - - but good . "
Two Unicode engineers are married to each other .
They decided they needed to use " a code " to indicate that they wanted to have sex without letting their children in on it .
Working with characters and letters all day , they decided on a related , if old - fashioned word : " typewriter . "
One day the husband told his five year old daughter , " Go tell your mommy that daddy needs to type a letter . "
The child told her mom what her dad said and her mother responded , " Tell your daddy that he can't type a letter right now because there 's a red ribbon in the typewriter . "
The child went back to tell her father what mommy had said .
A few days later the mom told the daughter , " Tell daddy that he can type that letter now . "
The child told her father , and then returned to her mother and announced , " Daddy said never mind with the typewriter , he already wrote the letter by hand . "
A virile , young Unicode engineer was relaxing at his favorite bar , when he managed to attract a spectacular young blonde .
Things progressed to the point where he invited her back to his apartment , and after some small talk , they retired to his bedroom and made love .
After a pleasant interlude , he asked with a smile , " So ... you finish ? "
She paused for a second , frowned , and replied , " No . "
Surprised , the young man reached for her and the lovemaking resumed .
This time she thrashes about wildly and there are screams of passion .
The love making ends , and again , the young man smiles , And again he asks , " You finish ? "
And again , after a short pause , she returns his smile , cuddles closer to him , and softly says , " No . "
Stunned , but damned if this woman is going to outlast him , the young man reaches for the woman yet again .
Using the last of his strength , he barely manages it , but they climax simultaneously , screaming , bucking , clawing and ripping the bed sheets .
The exhausted man falls onto his back , gasping .
Barely able to turn his head , he looks into her eyes , smiles proudly , and asks again , " You finish ? "
Barely able to speak , she whispers in his ear ...... " No! I Norwegian ! "
Two internationalization engineers are attending a Unicode conference .
Amidst all the learning and idea exchange , they make plans for amusement in the evening .
One says to the other , " Hey , I know a couple girls in the area .
How about we make a booty call ? "
The second engineer replies " Big-endian or Little- endian ? "
A grade school teacher was asking his pupils what their parents did for a living .
" Tim , you be first .
What does your mother do ? "
Tim stood up and proudly said , " She 's a doctor . "
" That 's wonderful .
How about you , Amy ? "
Amy shyly stood up , scuffed her feet and said , " My father is a mailman . "
" Thank you , Amy " said the teacher .
" What does your parent do , Billy ? "
Billy proudly stood up and announced , " My daddy plays piano in a whorehouse . "
The teacher was shocked and went to Billy 's house and rang the bell .
Billy 's father answered the door .
The teacher explained what his son had said and demanded an explanation .
Billy 's dad said , " I 'm actually an internationalization engineer specializing in collation and normalization with multibyte and 16 - bit Unicode called UTF - 8 and UTF - 16 .
How can I explain a thing like that to a seven - year - old ? "
A married couple is driving down the interstate doing 55 mph .
The Unicode engineer is behind the wheel .
His wife looks over at him .
" Honey , I know we 've been married for 15 years , but , I want a divorce . "
The Unicode engineer says nothing , but slowly increases speed to 60 mph .
" I do n't want you to try to talk me out of it , because I 've been having an affair with your best friend , and he 's a better lover than you . "
Again the Unicode engineer stays quiet and just speeds up as his anger increases .
" I want the house also . "
Again the Unicode engineer speeds up , and now is doing 75 mph .
" I want the kids too . "
The Unicode engineer just keeps driving faster and faster ; now he 's up to 85 mph .
" And I want the car , the checking account , and all the credit cards . "
The Unicode engineer slowly starts to veer toward a bridge overpass piling as the speedometer reaches 90 mph .
" You 're taking this incredibly calmly , " the wife says .
" Is n't there anything that you want ? "
" No , I have everything I need . "
" What 's that ? "
" The airbag . "
Here are some limericks in honor of IUC21 being held in Ireland .
An Ode to UAX # 15 , NFC , NFD , NFKC , and NFKD .
A large group went to Dublin , a consortium .
They had more and more characters , ad nauseum ,
Too many to draw and transform ,
They needed to establish a norm ,
They could n't agree and so had four of them .

An Ode to UTR #6 SCSU
There was an old lady that lived in a shoe .
Housed so many characters , she did n't know what to do .
But she compressed and encoded
and then shifted and mode'd
And now its called UTR 6 or SCSU .

Down is Up ?
‘ Wait wait , my controls are n’t inverted , where ’s the options ’ , a refrain commonly heard amongst gamers .
The invert check box has become pretty much statutory for any first person shooter of the last five years .
This little incongruous setting enables you to press down to look up or vi ca versa .
We can imagine the day that the feature was first discovered by users , possibly in SNES Starfox , and a whole section of the gaming public suddenly raised their game .
Once discovered there was no going back for these gamers , it became so engrained in their playing psyche that any game without it became almost unplayable .
Now the debate rages as to which makes more sense “ up is down , down is up ” or “ up is up , down is down ” .
While much of the rhetoric of these discussions is based on which makes more sense instinctively , we suggest that this is more a question of consciousness and interaction .
The question is where does the player put their consciousness in relation to the controller .
What part of their body is the joypad controlling , their arm , their head ; and how is this control translated to that body part .
Behind :
If the player feels they are controlling movement from behind their head with joypad , they are likely to find an inverted control scheme works best for them .
Pulling back on their stick therefore tilts their head up and should move the play field up .
.
In front :
If the player feels they are controlling movement in front of their head , they are likely to find a non-inverted control scheme works best for them .
Pulling back on their stick therefore pulls their head down from the front and should move the play field down .
There are many things that can affect where the player subconsciously locates themselves .
It could be that an extroverted player is used to interacting in an open and forthright manner may feel they were controlling the game world from in front of themselves .
Similarly an introverted player who is more reserved and withdrawn may feel they were controlling the game from a safe distance behind themselves .
It could also be that those used to scientific work were used to manipulating theories in their heads and therefore controlling environments from behind themselves .
Similarly , those used to artistic work may be more used to working with material in front of themselves .
These hypotheses are now becoming muddied , or maybe just more complex , by the introduction of different control schemes .
Interactions now involve more than a simple thumb movement .
Touch and gesture are being introduced to provide players with more imersive experiences .
This inevitably affects where the player positions themselves in relation to the action on screen .
Although these control schemes are still in their youthful exuberant stage and will take some time to mature , they seem to have the general affect of pulling the player ’s consciousness forward , into the game .
If this is true , we would expect to see a trend away from inverted control schemes as the player increasingly considers themselves as part of what is going on in the game environment .
The arrest of 114 people on suspicion of conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass at Ratcliffe - on - Soar power station , near Nottingham , is extremely worrying and may be regarded as further indication of a style of policing that has developed under this appalling government and is undermining the values and needs of a free society .
The local Labour MP Alan Simpson has today raised concerns about whether the action was proportionate .
" The scale of it makes people think we are dealing with a major terrorist incident , " he said .
" We understand there were 200 officers involved and my instinctive reaction to that is to say , well there must be something to do with plans to blow something up , to commit a major disruption of society .
My worry is that what we are talking about , in practice , [ is ] something much smaller . "
Simpson , who is generally regarded as a good thing and is giving up his seat at the next election because he decided that Westminster politics is incapable of listening to the demands for more radical action on the environment , could have gone a lot further .
Let us be clear that the people arrested yesterday , who have all now been released on bail , have manifestly not committed any crime of trespass .
Second , they possess inalienable rights to assembly and protest .
Needless to say the Human Rights
Act , which I increasingly view as a well - meaning old dear with fewer teeth that my late Aunt Agnes , does not protect people 's rights in these situations and so the police are allowed to get away with a pre-emptive strike .
No doubt the Nottingham operation benefited from information provided by forward intelligence teams and the monitoring of people 's telephone calls and emails .
How far should this activity go ?
Earlier this year I linked to a story in which police in Brighton were reported to be filming those leaving a climate change meeting at cafe in the town .
There are suggestions that police have planted informers on the inside of environmental organisations .
Both are unacceptable in a free society .
All this is of acute importance for climate change campaigners , who Simpson must regard as essential in the drive to find quicker and more fundamental solutions to Britain 's record of pollution , but there is another principle here which is of such vital significance that I cannot believe it is not pointed out in every editorial of every quality newspaper .
If we allow the police to extend pre-emptive actions from the fight against terrorism into all areas of policing we will end up with a situation where it is enough for the police to suspect someone of merely harbouring intention before making an arrest .
As the Independent says this morning , we have good reason to suspect the accounts given by police to justify recent actions .
The operation in Nottingham over the weekend should be scrutinised at every level to make sure that we are not , inch by inch , entering a period in which intelligence - gathering operations effectively bring to an end free assembly and protest , and allow the idea that the police can read and prosecute people 's intentions .
Under the rules of the match that the company has negotiated with the “ Jeopardy ! ” producers , the computer will not have to emulate all human qualities .
It will receive questions as electronic text .
The human contestants will both see the text of each question and hear it spoken by the show ’s host , Alex Trebek .
The computer will respond with a synthesized voice to answer questions and to choose follow - up categories .
I.B.M. researchers said they planned to move a Blue Gene supercomputer to Los Angeles for the contest .
To approximate the dimensions of the challenge faced by the human contestants , the computer will not be connected to the Internet , but will make its answers based on text that it has “ read , ” or processed and indexed , before the show .
There is some skepticism among researchers in the field about the effort .
“ To me it seems more like a demonstration than a grand challenge , ” said Peter Norvig , a computer scientist who is director of research at Google .
“ This will explore lots of different capabilities , but it wo n’t change the way the field works . ”
The I.B.M. researchers and “ Jeopardy ! ” producers said they were considering what form their cybercontestant would take and what gender it would assume .
One possibility would be to use an animated avatar that would appear on a computer display .
“ We ’ve only begun to talk about it , ” said Harry Friedman , the executive producer of “ Jeopardy ! ”
“ We all agree that it should n’t look like Robby the Robot . ”
Mr. Friedman added that they were also thinking about whom the human contestants should be and were considering inviting Ken Jennings , the “ Jeopardy ! ” contestant who won 74 consecutive times and collected $ 2.52 million in 2004 .
I.B.M. will not reveal precisely how large the system ’s internal database would be .
The actual amount of information could be a significant fraction of the Web now indexed by Google , but artificial intelligence researchers said that having access to more information would not be the most significant key to improving the system ’s performance .
Socrates talked .
The assumption behind his approach to philosophy , and the approaches of millions of people since , is that moral thinking is mostly a matter of reason and deliberation :
Think through moral problems .
Find a just principle .
Apply it .
One problem with this kind of approach to morality , as Michael Gazzaniga writes in his 2008 book , “ Human , ” is that “ it has been hard to find any correlation between moral reasoning and proactive moral behavior , such as helping other people .
In fact , in most studies , none has been found . ”
Today , many psychologists , cognitive scientists and even philosophers embrace a different view of morality .
In this view , moral thinking is more like aesthetics .
As we look around the world , we are constantly evaluating what we see .
Seeing and evaluating are not two separate processes .
They are linked and basically simultaneous .
As Steven Quartz of the California Institute of Technology said during a recent discussion of ethics sponsored by the John Templeton Foundation , “ Our brain is computing value at every fraction of a second .
Everything that we look at , we form an implicit preference .
Some of those make it into our awareness ; some of them remain at the level of our unconscious , but ... what our brain is for , what our brain has evolved for , is to find what is of value in our environment . ”
It began calmly enough with a march down the high street after midday prayers at the mosque .
Palestinian villagers were surrounded by dozens of foreigners singing and waving flags .
They turned and headed out to the olive - tree fields and up towards the broad path of Israel 's West Bank barrier .
There , behind a concrete hilltop bunker , the Israeli soldiers looked down on them .
The crowd approached the barrier , still singing .
One man flew a paper kite shaped as a plane .
" This land is a closed military zone , " an Israeli soldier shouted in flawless Arabic over a loudspeaker .
" You are not allowed near the wall . "
Then the soldiers fired a barrage of teargas .
It has been like this every Friday in the village of Bil'in for more than four years – the most persistent popular demonstration against Israel 's vast steel and concrete barrier .
It is a protest founded on non-violence that is spreading to other West Bank villages .
But it has become increasingly dangerous .
On April 17 , on the hillside at Bil'in , a Palestinian named Basem Abu Rahmeh , 31 , was shot with a high - velocity Israeli teargas canister that sliced a hole into his chest , caused massive internal bleeding and quickly killed him .
Video footage shot by another demonstrator shows he was unarmed , many metres from the barrier and posing no threat to the soldiers .
The Israeli military said it faced a " violent and illegal riot " and is investigating .
On Friday the demonstrators at Bil'in wore Rameh 's image on T - shirts and carried it on posters .
Last month another demonstrator , an American named Tristan Anderson , 38 , was hit in the head by an identical high - velocity teargas canister in a protest against the barrier at the nearby village of Na'alin .
He was severely injured , losing the sight in his right eye and suffering brain damage .
" To shoot peaceful demonstrators is really horrifying to us , " said his mother , Nancy .
Friday 's demonstration lasted around three hours .
The crowd repeatedly surged towards the fence , then retreated under clouds of teargas .
The military sounded a constant , high - pitched siren , interspersed with warnings in Arabic and Hebrew : " Go back .
You with the flag , go back " and , incongruously , in English : " You are entering a naval vessel exclusion zone .
Reverse course immediately . "
The Bil 'in demonstration was always intended to be non-violent , although on Friday , as is often the case , there were half a dozen younger , angrier men lobbing stones at the soldiers with slingshots .
The Israeli military , for its part , fires teargas , stun grenades , rubber - coated bullets and sometimes live ammunition at the crowd .
There have long been Palestinian advocates of non-violence , but they were drowned out by the militancy of the second intifada , the uprising that began in late 2000 and erupted into waves of appalling suicide bombings .
Eyad Burnat , 36 , has spent long hours in discussions with the young men of Bil'in , a small village of fewer than 2,000 , convincing them of the merits of " civil grassroots resistance " .
" Of course it gets more difficult when someone is killed , " said Burnat , who heads the demonstration .
" But we 've faced these problems in the past .
We 've had more than 60 people arrested and still they go back to non-violence .
We 've made a strategic decision . "
Some , like the moderate Palestinian MP Mustafa Barghouti , hope this might be the start of a broader movement throughout Palestinian society .
" It is a spark that is spreading , " he said in Bil'in .
" It gives an alternative to the useless negotiations and to those who say only violence can help . "
But it is not so much that all the young men of the village are converted to the peaceful cause , rather that they respect and follow their elders .
" I personally do n't believe in non-violent resistance , " said Nayef al - Khatib , 21 , an accountancy student .
" They 've taken our land by force so we should take it back from them by force . "
The barrier at Bil 'in cuts off the village from more than half its agricultural land and has allowed the continuing expansion of Jewish settlements , including the vast , ultra-Orthodox settlement of Modiin Illit , even though all settlements on occupied land are illegal under international law .
The international court of justice said in a 2004 advisory opinion that the barrier was illegal where it crossed into the West Bank , and even Israel 's supreme court ruled nearly two years ago that the route at Bil 'in did not conform to any " security - military reasons " and must be changed .
But it has not been moved .
Like most of the men in the village , Nayef al - Khatib has spent time in jail .
He was arrested aged 17 for demonstrating and spent a year behind bars , taking his final year of high school from his prison cell .
That jail term means he cannot now obtain a permit to travel to Jerusalem or across to Jordan and is often held for hours at Israeli military checkpoints inside the West Bank .
" But it was an honour for me .
Now I 'm like the older men , " he said .
Some of those older men are influential .
Ahmad al - Khatib , 32 , was once a member of the al - Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigade , a prominent militant group , and was jailed for a year for transporting weapons .
Now he is committed to non-violence , even objecting to the stone throwers .
" I do n't apologise for what I did , but I 'm not going back to it , " he said .
" We are an occupied nation according to international law and we have the right to resist , though that does n't mean I support suicide bombers .
But I do n't want to resist all my life . "
He argues that a non-violent strategy brings fewer Palestinian casualties .
" I have no problem dying to get back my land , but I 'd say to hell with my land if it just brought back our martyr who died last week .
The life of a human being is more important than the land itself . "
Often the most sensitive issue for the villagers has not been whether to take up arms , but whether to accept in their midst so many foreigners , and in particular so many Israeli demonstrators .
Ahmad al - Khatib said it was the " most disputed question " and that many feared the Israelis were spying on them until they saw they , too , were being injured and arrested .
One of the first Israelis to join the Bil 'in protest in its earliest days was Jonathan Pollack , 27 , an activist and member of Anarchists Against the Wall who lives in Jaffa , just south of Tel Aviv .
Although they warmly welcome him now , it was tense at first .
" I 'm still not one of their own and I do n't pretend to be , " he said .
Unlike most other joint peace initiatives , in this case the Israelis are in the minority and in the background .
" I think it is very important that the struggle is Palestinian - led and that the colonial power relations are knowingly reversed , " said Pollack .
Some are taking antidepressants .
Others developed heart problems .
One was diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder .
Ralph Scala 's neighbours described yesterday how his unrelenting campaign of harassment and intimidation turned their once tranquil Junction neighbourhood into a living hell .
" I have endured anxiety , countless sleepless nights and extreme trauma as I continually worried about my family 's safety , " said Maria Bolotta , whose widowed 87 - year - old mother lives in a semi- detached house on Quebec Ave. , adjoining the one occupied by Scala 's family .
" In the middle of the night I would get calls from my mother crying that she was startled from her sleep by loud bangs behind her bed , " said Bolotta as she read her victim impact statement
" I had to go and calm her down when she found her property littered with dog refuse , dead squirrels , cats , mice and even a skunk deliberately left behind to frighten her , " Bolotta told Scala 's sentencing hearing .
" It became impossible for me to spend quality time with her or to enjoy her property with her because of the horrible skeletons , fake camera , pitchforks , and tombs bearing her name that we had to face when we went outside . "
Bolotta 's daughter bore the brunt of Scala 's hatred , she said .
She suffers from anxiety and phobias – and has dropped out of university – after being involved in two court cases against Scala and his father .
After Scala , 36 , and Felice Scala , 62 , were arrested last July the neighbourhood had a street party to celebrate , she said .
It was the end of years of slashed tires , broken windows and threats , many carried out by local youths paid by Ralph Scala .
Felice Scala was arrested yesterday in the courthouse , where he was attending his son's hearing , and charged with criminal harassment and breaching his bail after he was seen riding a bus in his neighbourhood the day before .
He is to have a bail hearing today .
His trial , on four charges related to his son's , starts in June .
Yesterday , Justice Kathleen Caldwell sentenced Ralph Scala to the eight months , 17 days he has served already , crediting him for time served at the rate of two for one .
He was to be released from the Don Jail last night , said his lawyer , Gordon Goldman .
The judge put Scala on probation for three years , ordering him to stay away from an area bounded by Bloor St. , St. Clair Ave. W. , Lansdowne Ave. and Jane St .
She ordered him to get counselling , pay restitution to the victims and perform 200 hours of community service .
Scala has to stay away from at least 26 people .
" You have terrorized your neighbours over many months , if not years , " she said .

Scala made a muffled apology for his crimes , but Caldwell said she could not tell if it was genuine .
She did , however , credit him for pleading guilty to 49 charges , including mischief , criminal harassment and threatening , some of which would have been hard for the Crown to prove .
Caldwell said that in her 20 years in the criminal justice system , she has seen many neighbour disputes .
" But I have never seen one approaching this magnitude . "
In Bolotta 's victim - impact statement , she said she nearly suffered a serous injury cutting her mother 's grass when she discovered 22 sharpened bicycle spokes embedded in the lawn .
" They were designed to be picked up by the lawn mower and to fly out and harm anyone who happened to be in their path . "
Karen Hoffman told the court she was robbed of the joy of being a new mother by her neighbour 's threatening behaviour .
" On top of losing my appetite for months , I also lost sleep . "
The family 's car tires were slashed five times in three months .
Ruth Yeoman told the judge she was afraid to walk anywhere in her Junction neighbourhood .
" I had the summer from hell .
My doctor diagnosed me with post - traumatic stress disorder and prescribed medicine for sleep .
I 'm still taking it . "
After the sentencing , Yeoman said she was glad the justice system took the crime seriously and that the judge warned Scala if he steps over the line just once he will " be treated like the criminal he is . "
Bolotta said the result does n't make up for the anxiety the victims suffered , but it was just .
She is still apprehensive , she added , about what will happen when Scala 's probation order barring him from the neighbourhood expires in three years .
A recently published study in the Journal of Affective Disorders found that clinicians are less likely to suggest a diagnosis of bipolar disorder if the patient is described as having recently fallen in love , even if they are reported to have all the necessary symptoms .
I notice that Katy Perry addressed exactly this issue in her global pop hit Hot N’ Cold .
You ’re hot then you ’re cold
You ’re yes then you ’re no
You ’re in and you ’re out
You ’re up and you ’re down Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Perry clearly demonstrates that she ’s not subject to this particular diagnostic bias as she is able to recognise that the patient has fallen in love , but also qualifies for a diagnosis of bipolar based solely on presenting features .

Avi Lewis interviews former Deputy Secretary of State for Aljazeera English :
Armitage admits :
1 . He and his boss Colin Powell lost a major battle within the Bush administration on whether the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war applied to guerrillas captured during the “ war on terror . ”
2 . That the Bush administration engaged in torture in the form of waterboarding , though he denied that he had sure knowledge of this practice at the time he was in office
3 . That he probably should have resigned , but hung on for fear of how bad policy could get if he and others were not there to fight the battles
4 . He says that the US Senate should have known about the torture , calls them “ AWOL , ” and implies that there will be no investigation of Bush crimes against humanity because such a process would implicate the senators themselves , as at the very least having been derelict in their duty to advise and consent .
( I wonder if he is also implying that some Democratic senators knew about the waterboarding and remained silent , so that they will not now launch a prosecution ? )
Armitage was one of three officials , including Karl Rove and Irv Lewis Libby , who revealed to US reporters that Valerie Plame was a covert operative in the CIA .
Plame is the wife of Ambassador Joseph Wilson , who was the first to publicly undermine the Bush claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction , which was used to justify the war .
Armitage was also involved in the Iran - Contra scandal .
A Spanish judge is considering an indictment of former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and several other Bush administration officials for having sanctioned torture at Guantanamo Bay .
In breaking news Thursday morning , it was announced in Spain that the government prosecutor has advised the judge to drop the case ; apparently he still has the discretion to continue .
The others who would likely be indicted if the case went forward , according to Scott Horton , are “ Federal Appeals Court Judge and former Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee , University of California law professor and former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo , former Defense Department general counsel and current Chevron lawyer William J. Haynes II , Vice President Cheney ’s former chief of staff David Addington , and former Undersecretary of Defense Douglas J. Feith . ”
Armitage ’s revelation that he and his boss “ lost ” a battle to preserve a commitment to the Geneva Conventions in Washington in this period seems likely to me to become part of the Spanish prosecution .
Japanese officers were tried for war crimes after World War II by the United States for having engaged in waterboarding .
It has been suggested that the six implicated Bush administration officials would , in case of formal indictmen , no longer be able safely travel to Europe , because judges claiming universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity might well order their arrest , as happened to former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet .

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has confirmed that the agency is investigating NUTRO pet food , following a series of unexplained illnesses and deaths .
Consumers have been complaining for more than two years that their pets have become ill after eating NUTRO products ; many have recovered when they were switched to other foods .
The company has steadfastly denied that its food is to blame .
Until now , the FDA has been mum about whether it was actively investigating the company .
Today , the FDAs Division of Freedom of Information confirmed the agency has an ongoing investigation into NUTRO — and said that investigation could be criminal or civil in nature .
The office did not elaborate on the nature or focus of that investigation .
The investigation came to light when the FDA denied a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request by ConsumerAffairs.com seeking a list of complaints and lab results the agency has collected regarding NUTRO pet food .
The agency denied the request and said that releasing the information could hamper prospective or ongoing action by law enforcement .
The document ( s ) constitute record (s ) compiled for law enforcement purposes , the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings , wrote the FDAs George A. Strait , Jr. , assistant commissioner for public affairs .
Another pet food company , Menu Foods , said in a recent financial filing that the FDA had commenced a criminal investigation to determine whether Menu violated the Food , Drug , & Cosmetic Act .
The company noted that additional actions or investigations may arise in the future .
It did not mention any other pet food companies .
Menu last year settled a $ 24 million lawsuit that grew from the largest pet food recall in U.S. history .
NUTRO , which has extensive international operations , was acquired in 2007 by Mars , Inc. , the privately - held Virginia - based food products company .
Mars was fined a record 4.5 million ( about US $ 5.8 million ) last year by the German Federal Cartel Office ( FCO ) for not observing the required waiting period before closing the transaction .
Mars had been by far the leading provider of cat and dog food in Germany prior to the merger .
Under pressure from the German regulators , Mars divested NUTRO 's Austrian and German businesses .
Worrisome trend
ConsumerAffairs.com filed its Freedom of Information request for NUTRO records last year after we uncovered a worrisome trend among dogs and cats across the country .
An analysis of our complaints revealed that scores of pets from California to South Carolina had experienced sudden and recurring bouts of diarrhea , vomiting , and other digestive problems .
The only common denominator among those dogs and cats was NUTRO pet food .
In nearly every case , we also learned the pets conditions improved once their owners stopped feeding them NUTRO pet food .
ConsumerAffairs.com continues to receive complaints about NUTRO from dog and cat owners nationwide .
In the past year , weve received nearly 500 complaints from pet owners who say their dogs or cats suddenly became ill after eat NUTRO .
The problems these pets have experienced are similar : vomiting , diarrhea , and other digestive issues .
Most of the complaints mirror one received last week from Linda P. of New Baltimore , Michigan .
For three years , I have been feeding my dog NUTRO Natural Choice Lamb Meal & Rice Formula Small Bites Dry Dog Food , she said .
The last bag I bought , I notice the food color was lighter than in the past .
Me being who I am , I believed there was a changed in formula for the better .
My Dachshund / Lab became ill , vomiting food chunks and yellow bile as well .
We took him to the vet and I have been feeding him homemade chicken and rice and antibiotics and he is on the mend .
She adds :
How can so many dogs get sick and nothing be done ?
Today I will start mixing his homemade food with a different brand of dry food .
I never want anyone else to go through , what appears to be many , the same situation as our dogs .
It will be a week or two before Im sure my dog is okay .
NUTRO denies it
NUTRO defends its products and insists its food is safe .
Many NUTRO customers also tout the food , saying their pets have had no problems .
And veterinarians say several factors can cause gastrointestinal problems in dogs and cats , including changes in diet , newly developed sensitivities to pet foods , and viral infections .
But pet owners who contact us on a nearly daily basis are convinced something is wrong with NUTROs food .
And they say its no coincidence that so many dogs and cats have become sick — with the same symptoms — after eating various flavors of that pet food .
NUTRO makes dogs sick , says Erin of Encino , California .
It is a fact and Im outraged that nobody is taking it off the shelf .
Erin says her three - year - old Puggle was a healthy active dog until she started eating NUTRO Natural Choice Lamb Meal & Rice Formula and NUTRO Max Beef & Rice Dinner Chunks in Gravy :
After about two weeks of this food , she became sick .
( She was ) constipated for a few days , then had diarrhea , and finally vomiting and was always extremely thirsty .
The last straw was her laying lethargic on the couch with white gums .
Thats when Erin rushed her dog to the vet .
The vet said she had allergies , prescribed an antibiotic and cortisone and gave me a bag of Science Diet .
I feed her the Science Diet in place of NUTRO because it was free , and she was fine within a week .
Erin , however , says she made the mistake of switching her dog back to NUTRO after the Science Diet was gone .
She again had constipation , followed by horrible diarrhea , and finally vomiting yellow bile and white gums , Erin told us .
There is no way that all these stories are just coincidences ( not ) if my dog is fine when she isnt eating NUTRO and when she is eating it , shes horribly sick .
I have switched her back to Science Diet and all her symptoms are gone and her appetite has returned to normal .
Another California pet owner says her dog also became ill after eating NUTRO pet food .
My husband and I purchased NUTRO chicken and rice small bites for our two Chihuahuas , says Jessica of Larkspur .
After about five days , our six - year - old male Chihuahua became lethargic , groaned a lot , developed a fever , was not excited to go on walks , and lost excitement for anything that used to bring him joy .
My husband began to suspect it was the new food as he had only developed these symptoms after eating NUTRO .
He has always been a healthy and active Chihuahua .
The couple took the dog to their vet , who ran tests but couldnt pinpoint the problem .
He was given antibiotics and we are crossing our fingers they work .
Our Chihuahua can barely walk , he is groaning in pain , and is extremely depressed .
Across the country , a longtime NUTRO pet owner in Pennsylvania told us her dog suddenly became ill after eating the food .
I had been feeding my dog NUTRO for years , says Amy D. of Webster , Pennsylvania .
I started feeding her NUTRO for sensitive stomachs about 6 months ago .
At first everything seemed fine .
Then my dog , who never urinated in my house , started having accidents ( frequently ) .
She needed to go out constantly and would squat repeatedly , come in , and ask to go right back out .
I took her to the vet and began treatment for bladder infection .
Upon finishing treatment it started all over again .
Amys vet discovered crystals in the dogs urine , which also had a high PH balance .
The vet put the dog on another medication .
In the meantime other than the restless pacing to go outside , she seemed disinterested and lethargic , Amy says .
Then she began having extremely loose bowel movements ( an awful bright yellow ) in the house .
Amy launched her own investigation and discovered the scores of complaints about NUTRO on ConsumerAffairs.com .
I could n't believe my eyes .
Could it really be the dog food I had trusted so much making my beloved pet ill ?
I immediately threw away all my NUTRO dog food .
Amy is now feeding her dog another brand of pet food .
And Im thrilled to say she is her old self again .
She no longer has to take any medicines and has no more accidents or uncontrollable urges .
Thanks to this Web site and everyone who took the time to file a complaint , I have my healthy happy dog back .
Not a fluke ?
A pet owner in New York told us his puppy had the same experience as Amys dog after eating NUTRO .
And hes convinced its not a fluke .
We got our dog two weeks ago and our puppy was healthy when we got her , says Manny of Fresh Meadows , New York .
She started eating NUTRO Natural Choice for puppies , since it was recommended by a friend of ours .
A week later , she started squatting to urinate , but only small drops or none at all came out .
When she can urinate , it is frequent , in small amounts , and contains blood .
Manny took his puppy to the vet , who prescribed amoxicillin .
She received a sonogram , culture test , and urinalysis test .
The results showed that she may have a stone in her bladder .
The blood in her urine is caused by the stone scraping the bladder walls .
The urinalysis test showed that she had a high PH balance .
I do n't think it is a coincidence that I have the same exact problem as Amy , adds Manny .
I wonder if something is wrong NUTRO pet food again .
Our puppy is still sick .
Our investigation into the complaints weve received about NUTRO pet food has also revealed :
• Six dogs unexpectedly died — or were euthanized — in 2008 after eating NUTRO pet food .
Those dogs include two Italian Greyhounds in Indiana , a Beagle / Whippet mix in Pennsylvania , two German Shepherd puppies in North Carolina , and a Doberman Pinscher in Texas ;
• The FDA investigated the April 2008 deaths of two Italian Greyhounds dogs in Indiana .
The FDA tested samples of the NUTRO food those dogs ate , but did not find any toxins .
An autopsy indicated the dogs died from antifreeze poisoning .
The dogs owner doesnt believe those results , saying there is no antifreeze around her home .
No one has tested the NUTRO food the other dogs ate before they died ;
• Two Italian Greyhounds at a military base in Italy became sick after eating NUTRO food .
The dogs owner told us she hopes the FDA is investigating NUTRO and urged the agency to move quickly .
It is hard to tell how many people at overseas military bases are feeding this ( food ) to their dogs and possibly killing them , says Michelle M. who bought her dogs NUTRO food at the bases commissary .
• A pet nutrition specialist for NUTRO told us shes heard complaints about the companys food making dogs and cats sick .
She reported those concerns to her supervisor , but said they were ignored .
She later resigned .
Some pet owners , however , tell us NUTRO is the only brand of food their dogs and cats can eat .
My Shar - peis are the most sensitive dogs I have ever owned , says Allison R. of Nampa , Indiana .
On the wrong food their hair falls out , their eyes weep and their ears get nasty .
It takes me a good 3 months of only NUTRO dog food in order to reverse the affects of the other food .
I have found that the senior diet is what works best , not sure why , but it seems to keep my Shar - Peis looking healthy .
A Tennessee pet owner also defends NUTRO pet food — and warns consumers not to jump to conclusions based on Internet complaints .
I feed all of my dogs and cats Nutro products and they are just as healthy as they have ever been , says Brenda of Springfield , Tennessee .
They have healthy shiny coats and their stools are firm .
Gradual transition
Brenda also had some advice to pet owners switching brands of food .
Do a gradual transition from the old food , she said .
If you dont , your dog will likely experience these issues .
Not every bout of diarrhea , constipation , bladder infection , liver and kidney failure and loss of excitement to go on walks should be attributed to food .
Your first responsibility as a pet owner should be to take your dog to the vet before you blame anyone .
Do your research and do n't let any Web site diagnose your pet .
NUTRO has repeatedly insisted its food is 100 percent safe and meets all standards set by FDA , the U.S Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) and the Association of American Feed Control Officials ( AAFCO ) .
A spokeswoman said all NUTRO products are tested for melamine , molds , toxins and other bacteria .
And she called the complaints weve received isolated reports of inaccurate information posted online .
The company , however , set up a special a section on its
Web site in response to the issues and concerns raised in our stories .
NUTRO said it takes all customer complaints seriously and encouraged pet owners with concerns about the food to contact the company at 1-800-833-5330 .
During our investigation , weve also contacted veterinarians about the problems pet owners say their dogs and cats have experienced after eating NUTRO .
Theyve said its not uncommon for pets to have sudden bouts of vomiting , diarrhea , and other gastrointestinal problems .
They also said a number of factors — pet food , stress , or a viral infection — could be the culprit .
We also asked Dr. Steven Hansen , a veterinary toxicologist with the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( ASPCA ) , to review some of our NUTRO complaints , in an effort to find out why so many pets have become sick — or even died — after eating NUTRO food .
Unfortunately the cases are not consistent and appear to be anecdotal with no real definitive diagnostic findings , Dr. Hansen told us .
Without any consistent trends in findings we can not do anything any further .
This does appear to us to be a situation where bad things happen , but they are not likely food - related .
Hansen , however , said consumers who suspect NUTROs food is a factor in their pets illnesses should have their animals examined by a veterinarian and document the problems .
I would also recommend that if they suspect the food is the problem , they should take a freezer bag full of it — along with the label information that has the products name and lot numbers — to their vet , he told us .
If the vet suspects the food is the cause , the vet should then contact the company and FDA .
If theres a problem , we need to document it and get supporting lab results .
Owners anxious
The arguments back and forth do n't mean much to anxious pet owners , who say its about time some federal agency investigated NUTRO and its products .
After so many complaints , how can this dog food still be on the market for consumers to purchase and feed to their dogs ?
Andrea G. of Sicklerville , New Jersey asked us .
I have been feeding my Dachshund NUTRO Ultra dry dog food for many months .
Suddenly , 10 days ago , he started vomiting yellow bile 1 - 2 times daily .
It makes me sick to think that I might be the one responsible for my dog 's vomiting by feeding him this food .
I can only hope that something is done , very soon , to prevent other pets from becoming ill .
Revealed :
The two - wheeled electric car that will ' never crash '
Traffic congestion , road accidents and vehicles with four wheels could soon become a thing of the past if executives at an ailing U.S. car giant get their way .
General Motors have teamed up with electric scooter maker Segway to develop a two - wheeled , two - seat electric vehicle designed to be a fast , safe , inexpensive and clean alternative to traditional cars for cities across the world .
The Personal Urban Mobility and Accessibility , or PUMA , project also would involve a vast communications network that would allow vehicles to interact with each other , regulate the flow of traffic and prevent crashes from happening .
A design sketch of the Project PUMA prototype , being developed by General Motors and Segway
The prototype runs on a lithium - ion battery and uses Segway 's two - wheel balancing technology , along with dual electric motors .
It 's designed to reach speeds of up to 35 mph and can run 35 miles on a single charge .
The companies did not release a projected cost for the vehicle , but said ideally its total operating cost - including purchase price , insurance , maintenance and fuel - would be about one - third of that of the average traditional vehicle .
Larry Burns , GM 's vice president of research and development , and strategic planning , said the project is part of Detroit - based GM 's effort to remake itself as a purveyor of fuel - efficient vehicles .
If Hummer took GM to the large - vehicle extreme , Burns said , the PUMA takes GM to the other .
The electric protoype is taken for a test drive around New York
Ideally , the vehicles would also be part of a communications network that through the use of transponder and GPS technology would allow them to drive themselves .
The vehicles would automatically avoid obstacles such as pedestrians and other cars and therefore never crash , Burns said .
As a result , the PUMA vehicles would not need air bags or other traditional safety devices and include safety belts for ' comfort purposes ' only , he said .
Though the technology and its goals may seem like something out of science fiction , Burns said nothing new needs to be invented for it to become a reality .
' At this point , it 's merely a business decision , ' he said .
Burns added that while putting that kind of communications infrastructure in place may still be a ways off for many American cities , the automaker is looking for a place , such as a college campus , where the vehicles could be put to use and grab a foothold in the market .
The prototype PUMA features four smaller wheels to help stabilise the vehicle
There 's no timeline for production , Burns said .
The ambitious announcement also comes at a time when GM 's future is hanging by a thread after receiving billions of dollars in federal aid and is in the midst of a vast restructuring that could still lead to a filing for bankruptcy protection .
Meanwhile , the ongoing recession has resulted in some of the lowest industrywide vehicle sales in more than a quarter century .
But Burns argued that some of the most revolutionary ideas have been born out of tough economic times .
The Obama Administration has engineered a triple setback for the U.S. peace movement and the millions of Americans who opposed the Bush Administration ’s unjust , illegal , immoral wars .
In the last two weeks of February , President Barack Obama — upon whom so many peace supporters had counted to change Washington ’s commitment to wars and militarism — delivered these three blows to his antiwar constituency :
1. By ordering 17,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan Feb. 17 , President Obama is continuing and expanding George W. Bush ’s war .
It ’s Obama ’s war now , and it ’s getting much bigger .
2 . By declaring Feb. 27 that up to 50,000 U.S. soldiers would remain in Iraq after “ combat brigades ” departed , President Obama is continuing the war in a country that remains a tragic victim of the Bush Administration ’s aggression and which has taken the lives of over a million Iraqi civilians and has made refugees of 4.5 million people .
3 . By announcing Feb. 26 that his projected 2010 Pentagon budget was to be even higher than budgets sought by the Bush Administration , President Obama was signaling that his commitment to the U.S. bloated war machine — even at a time of serious economic recession — was not to be questioned .
Whether or not Obama ’s actions will revive the peace movement is another matter .
Antiwar activism during the election year was minimal .
And now that a Democrat is in the White House it may be further reduced , since most peace backers voted for Obama .
The movement ’s strength will be tested at the demonstrations in Washington , San Francisco , Los Angeles and other cities on the sixth anniversary of the Iraq war March 21 .
Two recent Washington Post / ABC
News public opinion polls provide contradictory and disturbing results .
In the January poll , 61 % opposed any increase in U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan , and only 34 % thought an increase was required .
But a month later in the Feb. 26 poll , ABC News reported that “ Nearly two - thirds of Americans [ 64 % ] support Barack Obama ’s decision to send 17,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan — despite substantial skepticism on whether the war there has been worth fighting . ”
Only half the respondents in the new poll believed the war “ was worth ” fighting , yet a substantial majority backed the deployment .
The biggest support for Obama ’s move came from Republicans , 77 % .
Democrats , who had been the most opposed in January , were 63 % in favor .
About 60 % of independents were in favor as well .
Among those “ strongly in favor ” Republicans were 52 % and Democrats , 35 % .
“ Among liberal Democrats it ’s just 29 % , ” ABC News revealed .
The additional 17,000 troops will bring U.S. forces up to 55,000 in Afghanistan .
This is opposed by the people of Afghanistan .
In a recent poll of Afghan opinion by ABC , BBC and ARD ( the German news consortium ) , only 18 % approved of sending more foreign troops , and 44 % wanted the existing number lowered .
The new troops will be added as combat brigades are transferred from Iraq .
The Pentagon still wants another 13,000 at some point .
In addition there are 23,000 troops from eight NATO countries , largely in non-combat assignments .
Secretary of Defense Gates , with negligible success , has been pressuring NATO to send more troops .
Many peace groups were critical of Obama ’s Afghan surge .
CODEPINK Women for Peace declared Feb. 19 it “ is heartbroken and discouraged by the deployment , ” saying it brought “ a screeching halt to his rhetoric for change and moving our country in a new direction . ”
In a statement Feb. 28 , the ANSWER antiwar coalition declared : “ President Obama decided not to challenge the [ Bush Administration ’s ] fundamental strategic orientation in the region .
That explains why he kept the Bush team — Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , and Generals Petraeus and Odierno — on the job to oversee and manage the Iraq occupation .
They will also manage the widening U.S. war in Afghanistan and the aerial assaults on Pakistan .
There have been over 30 U.S. bombing attacks in Pakistan in the last two months . ”
On Feb. 18 the UFPJ coalition stated that “ military escalation will only exacerbate the horrors that now plague the region and that this escalation is not the answer for Afghanistan and it is not in the interests of the United States . ”
One of the most descriptive critiques was from Justin Raimondo , the libertarian editor of Antiwar.com , who wrote in an article titled “ The Silence of the Liberals ” : “ Antiwar voters who cast their ballots for Obama have succeeded in rolling the stone all the way up a rather steep hill , only to see it fall down the other side — and we are right back where we started .
The next hill is called Afghanistan , and beyond that is yet another : Pakistan . ”
Progressive war correspondent Patrick Cockburn , writing in The Independent ( UK ) Feb. 26 , declared : “ It is difficult to believe that the Obama administration is going to make as many crass errors as its predecessor ….
The reinforced US military presence in Afghanistan risks provoking a backlash in which religion combines with nationalism to oppose foreign intervention . ”
At this stage there are 142,000 U.S. troops in Iraq , and all but 50,000 or so will withdraw within 19 months , three months later than Obama pledged .
In late February administration sources disclosed how many troops were scheduled to remain in Iraq , much to the consternation of Congressional Democratic leaders who were astonished by the high number .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid , joined by New York Sen. Charles Schumer , Washington State ’s Sen. Patty Murray , Wisconsin ’s Sen. Russell Feingold , among others , all expressed the view that the number was too high .
Sen .
John McCain , the defeated Republican presidential aspirant , supported the size of the “ residual ” force .
He said Feb. 27 that Obama ’s plan “ can keep us on the right path in Iraq .
I worry , however , about statements made by a number of our colleagues indicating that , for reasons wholly apart from the requirement to secure our aims in Iraq , we should aim at a troop presence much lower than 50,000 . ”
All U.S. troops are supposed to leave Iraq before 2012 under the withdrawal arrangement between former President Bush and Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki that was approved a few months ago — but that ’s nearly three years from now and anything can happen .
Top American generals , led by Petraeus and Odierno , are known to believe that U.S. forces should remain in Iraq past Dec. 31 , 2011 .
The arrangement can be changed if the Iraqi government “ requests ” that American forces remain , and this is entirely possible .
A number of leading Iraqi politicians , well aware that they owe their power to Uncle Sam ’s intervention , are said to prefer a longer occupation .
The overwhelming majority of the Iraqi people , of course , have opposed the American presence throughout Bush ’s , and now Obama ’s , war .
President Obama chose to make public his withdrawal plans during a speech to 2,000 Marines at Camp Lejeune , NC , Feb. 27 .
He said the troops that remain in Iraq would be engaged in training , equipping and advising the Iraqi security forces , but administration sources indicated that some would engage in combat operations .
Obama lavishly praised the troops as he has done before .
Last month , as he prepared to assume command of an Armed Forces engaged in two illegal wars foisted on the world by the neoconservative imperialists of the Bush Administration , Obama declared : “ Our troops represent the best America has to offer , ” an unfortunate incentive to the growth of a warrior culture in America .
And to his Marine audience Obama made the following remark that turns history on its head :
“ We sent our troops to Iraq to do away with Saddam Hussein ’s regime — and you got the job done .
We kept our troops in Iraq to help establish a sovereign government and you got the job done .
And we will leave the Iraqi people with a hard - earned opportunity to live a better life – that is your achievement ; that is the prospect that you have made possible . ”
The ANSWER coalition correctly noted that Obama “ made Bush ’s invasion sound like a liberating act and congratulated the troops . ' ”
We wo n’t go into the real causes of the war and occupation here , but in terms of the “ better life ” given to the Iraqis , here ’s how Robert Dreyfuss describes the situation in Iraq today in the March 9 issue of The Nation : “ Key political actors on all sides remain bolstered by paramilitary armies .
Unemployment is vast , and basic services — electricity , water , trash collection , healthcare — are intermittent or nonexistent .
The army and police are infiltrated by militias , and their loyalty is suspect .
Baghdad is a bewildering maze of blast walls and sealed - off enclaves surrounding the fortress - like Green Zone , and the city is reeling from years of brutal ethnic cleansing .
The provincial capitals are rife with intrigue , and many of them — Kirkuk , Mosul , Baquba and Basra , for instance — are perched at the brink of civil strife .
And the elections themselves , in which millions of voters were disenfranchised , were deeply flawed . ”
Life in pre-war Iraq was hard — U.S. - UN sanctions killed over a million people between 1991 - 2003 — but it was better than what has happened to that country during the devastating U.S. invasion and occupation .
The Obama Administration ’s provisional Pentagon budget for fiscal 2010 , which starts Oct. 1 , was included in a 10 - year general budget projection released by the White House Feb. 26 .
This preliminary war budget ( a complete proposal will be made in April ) increases “ defense ” spending by 4 % over Bush ’s budget for 2009 .
In addition , President Obama is requesting a supplementary appropriation of $ 75.5 billion to finance the three wars in Iraq , Afghanistan and “ on terrorism ” until the end of September this year , and $ 130 billion “ to support ongoing overseas contingency operations , while increasing efforts in Afghanistan and drawing down troops from Iraq responsibly . ”
Including the war costs , defense spending amounts to $ 664 billion , $ 10 billion more than 2009 .
These figures , however , are totally misleading — not in the allocations just listed but in the war money that is hidden in other sectors of the budget .
All told , the war budget exceeds $ 1 trillion in 2010 , as we explain in part 2 of our article on The Recession below .
Despite unlimited financing , the Pentagon has lost the war in Iraq .
When the world ’s greatest military juggernaut is fought to a stalemate by an erratic irregular force of perhaps 20,000 effectives , it is a defeat that cannot be covered up — at least by history — through a cosmetic “ surge ” consisting of equal parts violence and bribery .
But the Obama Administration seems committed to a clear victory in Afghanistan ( as were the British and Russians of previous eras , much to their chagrin ) .
In the Department of Defense budget proposal the monies are to facilitate “ achieving U.S. objectives in Afghanistan , ” and those objectives of necessity include wiping out the military humiliation in Iraq .
Some of the war budget will go toward increasing the Army and Marines troop strength by a total of 90,000 new recruits .
Recruitment , for the first time in years , has been successful in the last few months because of the recession .
So many young people cannot find jobs that they are lining up to join the military .
The budget also includes another pay increase for the Armed Forces , of about 3 % .
Eventually , Obama is going to make the gesture of nominally reducing the overstuffed military budget , mainly concentrating on cutting some of the obsolete Cold War - type big - ticket items .
He had been expected to do so upon taking office , but evidently saw the need to prove his militarist credentials to the Pentagon , Congressional Republicans , and the pro-war sector of American opinion .
In time he will have to make some cuts , probably explaining it is a concession to the staggering economy .
Since taking office , President Obama has shown the back of his hand to the U.S. antiwar movement , which consists in large majority of Democratic Party voters .
Expanding the Afghan war , keeping troops many years longer in Iraq , and increasing war spending is exactly what those voters did n’t want .
It ’s certainly not the “ change ” they believed in .
If the Obama supporters who genuinely opposed Bush ’s wars now become silent or reduce their antiwar activities because a Democrat is in the White House , our peace movement , and the humanitarian cause it represents — already weakened since the “ surge ” — is headed for very difficult times indeed .
And without that movement the political pressure for peace will quickly dissipate .
Thanks to my funny , literary pal , Jason B. Jones , today , I 'm visiting lovely , warm Connecticut to do some talks and whatnot at CCSU .
I mention it because I 'd started typing this little post mid-way through the long eastbound flight that delivered me here from three fun ( but very long ) days doing a comedy thing with You Look Nice Today and Jordan , Jesse , Go ! over on that other , top - left , edge of our nation .
So , I was tired .
Really tired .
The kind of tired where your wallet hurts your butt , and coffee tastes weird , and you try super - hard to sleep , but -- well -- you 're just too tired to sleep .
And , I was fine with all that .
Who can complain about being sleepy from hanging out with Adam and Scott ?
Exactly .
Except .
The lady in the seat directly behind me was having grave problems with her " mud room . "
Big mud room problems .
I know this because she talked about it for several hours in excruciating detail .
I 'll spare you the nuts and bolts of the numerous and surprising ways that the room in which wealthy persons remove their shoes might contribute to causing a carefully - coiffed , 60 - year - old woman to come unglued over " priorities . "
Suffice to say , fixing this problem was a " high priority " for her .
So , she said , repeatedly , as I shifted my wallet , let my coffee go cold , and balled the little blue pillow under my neck .
" Priority !
Mud room ! "
I audibly mumbled , just loud enough to be heard exactly one row back .
Priority .
Man , that 's a tough word .
Because , depending on who you talk to , most people say " prioritizing " is either a giant problem , an underused skill , or a " Get out of Jail Free " card .
Me ?
I think priorities are simple to understand precisely because their influence is so staggeringly clear and unavoidable to behold , then act upon .
Ready for this one ?
A priority is observed , not manufactured or assigned .
Otherwise , it 's necessarily not a priority .
Got that ?
You can't " prioritize " a list of 20 tasks any more than you can " uniqueify " 20 objects by " uniqueness , " or " pregnantitze " 20 women by " pregnantness . "
Each of those words means something .
An item is either unique or it is not .
A woman is either pregnant or she is not .
An item is either the priority or it is not .
One - bit .
Mutually exclusive .
One ring to rule them all .
Why all the fussiness , Mr. Fussy ?
When most people say , " prioritize , " I think they really mean to say , " force - rank " -- to assign n items one and only one position between " 1 " and " n . "
Right ?
So , yes , there 's one " # 1 " and one " # 7 , " et cetera .
But that 's not " priority , " and that 's why you probably have at least one task on your version of a to - do list that has been " HIGH PRIORITY !!! " for more than a month .
Kind of unique .
Sort of pregnant .
" High " priority .
This is why I say priorities can only be observed .
In my book , a priority is not simply a good idea ; it 's a condition of reality that , when observed , causes you to reject every other thing in the universe -- real , imagined , or prospective -- in order to ensure that things related to the priority stay alive .
Even though their influence informs every decision we make on the most tactical level , thinking about priorities happens at a strategic , " why am I here ? " level .
Right ?
Maybe ?
Disagree ?
Pretty sure you can make priorities like biscuits or shuffle them around like Monopoly pieces ?
Got news for you , Jack : if it moves , it 's not a priority .
It 's just a thing you have n't done yet .
Making something a BIG RED TOP TOP BIG HIGHEST #1 PRIORITY changes nothing but text styling .
If it were really important , it 'd already be done .
Period .
Think about it .
Example .
When my daughter falls down and screams , I do n't ask her to wait while I grab a list to determine which of seven notional levels of " priority " I should assign to her need for instantaneous care and affection .
Everything stops , and she gets taken care of .
Conversely -- and this is really the important part -- everything else in the universe can wait .
Related example .
You ever had a loved one -- especially a very young relative -- pass away unexpectedly ?
Brutal .
What did you do when you found out ?
Did you " re- prioritize " your day and move a few things around ?
Or did you drop everything and join his or her loved ones in taking care of what needed to be taken care of ?
You just saw what needed to be done and likely had no compunction about telling everybody at work they 'd either have to wait or move on without you .
And , let 's be clear : this is not all about " urgency . "
Yes , an injured child and a grieving family need help now in a way that an M&A discussion or a CPR class may not .
But , again .
It 's not a question of order or shuffling .
It 's a question of brutally honest decision - making and constantly saying , " No , I have another thing to take care of . "
Day One Buddhism .
Because , once you see what 's really there -- once you know about an idea or a thing or a person or whatever that you 'd reject 10,000 other things to protect and nurture -- you 've found your priority .
And , consequently , you 've discovered a bunch of other things that are n't allowed to be priorities any more .
Even in spirit .
Because , if you are n't rejecting or dumping things every single day , you do n't know your priority .
You 're making things up .
If you think you have 35 priorities , then yes : you also think you have 35 arms .
Is it any wonder you 're feeling awkward and unsure ?
Maybe a mud room is a priority .
I think more likely it was this lady 's emotional obsession .
If I were the sort of person who coached people on these things , I 'd ask her what piece of information she needed to get moving on the " mud room " project , then get it , do it , and move on .
That said , dozens of thousands of feet in the air seems like a crummy place to realize a mud room is your " priority , " but I 'm not here to judge .
Much .
What I will tell you is that these ideas about scarcity and mutual exclusivity fly in the face of most " productivity " and " effectiveness " nonsense , and frankly , they make most people bristle .
Big time .
When I tell someone who 's making 10 times the salary I 'll ever make that it 's literally impossible to have seven priorities , they look at me like I 'm the biggest , dumbest hippie in the world .
Sheesh , right ?
For the Cult of Priority folks , two things :
First , ask yourself why any " high priority " item has remained unresolved in your life for more than 60 seconds .
Why is n't it done completely ?
Have you ever " re-assigned " " priority " to some task ?
Really ?
Because that sounds more like procrastination than management , let alone " effective " action and decisive execution .
Sounds more to me like getting paid $ 10,000,000 a year to re-arrange your spice rack -- then wondering why your company , marriage , and back porch are all crumbling under your " prioritization . "
Sounds like maybe you 're just feeling crummy about not understanding your job and your life .
Once you know a tree is falling on you , you do n't take a meeting to drill down on strategies viz .
arboreal exit strategies .
You just run .
Also , number two -- and this is a biggie -- I 'm staggered whenever a Director - level or higher executive claims they have 3 , 5 , 7 , or 27 " priorities . "
Because , at that level , your entire career is defined by the unbelievably great ideas that you reject .
Painfully giant , wonderful , terrific opportunities that you simply do n't have the capacity to address without screwing up the real priority .
No , no , no , no , sorry , later , nope , forget it , later , no , no , no .
Because only babies and crazy people get to pretend that reality actually changes when you close your eyes and hum .
And , reality is the thing that priorities hang on .
If you think you can change it by taxonomies and meetings , you still have only two arms , only now you 're also screwed .
So , if a mud room , or a crying toddler , or a CPR class , or even a short note from an old friend turns up on your radar screen today , do n't ask yourself whether it's a " priority . "
Ask yourself what you must not do in order to make sure it gets taken care of .
Once you see and accept real priorities , the rest just turns on the mechanics of fearless completion .
I 'd been dreading writing up what happened at the last GDC panel I attended , and not because it was boring to sit through .
Advertisement
Far from it – BioWare showed off a couple Mass Effect 2 videos with combat and cut scenes ; two journalists I admire almost got in a fight about the illicit recording of said videos ; and I got to use the panel as a case study to present to my ethics professor .
Long story short : there was drama ; and until the drama died down , I was hesitant to do the write - up .
Advertisement
But it 's dead now , so here 's the rundown of the last GDC panel I attended :
Unlike the development of the first Mass Effect , BioWare has changed tactics to identify problems ( like long elevator rides ) earlier in the development process .
To pull this off , the devs make sure each level they design is always playable throughout the creation cycle .
Playable , not pretty .
That first video we saw starts off with nothing but an ME1 character model dropped into a white room with lines marking where stuff should go .
This looks like what other developers call a " white box " level – except this is way more detailed with actual pop -up dialogue boxes to tell the player what plot points are going on where .
Advertisement
Most of the level changing goes on during this phase and then they move on to phase two where they add collision and combat and even music ( because to BioWare , music relates to fun and if you can't see the fun by phase two , it 's time to go back to the drawing board ) .
They also do a first pass of dialogue to screen for cheesiness and text errors .
Phases three and four are all about making it fun .
Combat is upgraded to " silver " and then " gold " such that you could actually kill somebody and it would look right .
The dialogue gets sent off for voice recording and when it's all in place , they move on to stage five , which is : " Can you feel the awesome ? "
Advertisement
By keeping the levels playable at all times in development , BioWare saved themselves a lot of pain and suffering in the long run .
They even sent the entire ME2 team home with a playable build over their Christmas break so they could play through it on their holiday .
That extra step alone showed them that their endgame was boring ; they chucked it when they came back from the break and started over .
The last video shown at the panel was a cut scene from phases one to four ( it sounds like phase five has n't been completed on any of the levels yet ) .
In this cinematic , Serena drops you off on a bridge and explains that you 've got to go to the second tower and cross to the penthouse to kill … somebody .
The whole thing was out of context , but it sounds like there 's actually two separate baddies Shepard has to deal with : somebody called Nassans ( not sure on the spelling – I was sitting way too far back to read the subtitles ) and this assassin person who may or may not be in the penthouse .

The lesson GDC goers were supposed to leave the panel with was this :
Do only the work that you have to do and do it in the right order .
Then they talked about business models for developers – and that part was definitely boring .
But it looks like Mass Effect 2 will be anything but .
Karl Rove criticized President Obama 's proposed budget this morning on ABC's This Week .
" He 's now going to add more debt in the first 20 months and 11 days than was incurred in 2 wars , 9/11 and the previous administration , " argued Rove .
John Amato :
Greenberg hit the Conservatives over their failed handling of government which has all Americans suspicious of government as an institution , but that 's been their mantra since Reagan .
Greenberg : The Conservatives ' unbelievable poor performance and regrettably the last president 's handling of government ( Rove ) has indeed reduced people 's confidence to handle problems .
You 're absolutely right , they are right to do so .
But what he 's done is changed the rules of the game ...
Not intimidated by Rove , Katrina vanden Heuvel shot back ,
" It 's laughable for you to talk about fiscal responsibility from someone who helped plunge this nation into trillion dollars of debt through tax cuts for the very rich and a war we never should have fought .
Starving the beast , starving the government has been a Republican role in terms of government and therefore , when George asks why government has n't functioned , ( it 's because ) people have not seen the role of government in improving the conditions of their lives in decades . "
Being lectured by Karl Rove over the deficit or anything else regarding this country is pretty sickening to witness .
With Rove in charge , we 've had the Wall Street meltdown as well as the ultimate illustration of what happens when conservatives rule :
The response to Hurricane Katrina .
Rove rejects Limbaugh 's call of socialism as a talking point , but backs that flame - throwing rhetoric with all his heart .
He 's the master of slimy tactics as his own political record informs us .
Rove looked flat and out of his element .
Karl is n't as effective without Bill O'Reilly or Sean Hannity by his side .
I wonder why ?
And George Will 's baseball analogies fall flat as usual .
Japanese Cat Cafes
Times are tough with the recession , and Japan , being one of the hardest hit by the economic situation , has all the right ideas .
Imagine a cafe in which you can simply walk in , pay a small fee of $ 5 to $ 8 USD for an hour of typical cafe relaxation - but with a ton of cats lounging around with you .
Japan can be a lonely , emotionally void place to live for some .
Cat cafes are simply a relief to loneliness for some .
Being in the company of twenty or so cats can work wonders for de-stressing .
Owning pets can significantly increase your lifespan and quality of life , and I 'd imagine spending an hour with them at your leisure could have similar effects [ source ] .
Despite tough economic times , the Japanese still like to have fun .
Japan 's Cat Cafes are providing people quite a unique service - and they are popping up all over the place !
At Ja La La Cafe in Tokyo ( Akihabara district ) , you can rent out a selection of 12 professional cats .
If cats are n't your fancy , you may have the option to rent out a cute bunny rabbit , or even a beetle .
For some reason , these cat cafes are most appealing to single men in their 30's .
This could be due to frequent business trips and having no time to buy their own pets to accomodate their busy lifestyles .
There are more than 150 licensed companies in Tokyo to rent / hire out animals of all varieties , dogs being the most popular .
Basically , this is an awesome system for the companies that own these dogs - people pay money to walk them , play with them , and exercise them .
It 's truly a win - win - win situation , the company makes a small profit , the dogs are happy for the attention , and the people renting them out get a little slice of the feeling of owning a pet .
Kaori , a waitress , usually spends her sunday afternoons with a Labrador .
She enjoys taking her rental companion for walks in the park , or snuggling in front of the TV in her apartment - " When I look into his eyes , I think he 's my dog , " She explains , " But when I take him back to the shop , he runs away from me and starts wagging his tail when he sees the next customer .
That 's when I know he 's only a rental dog .
" All of these creative new businesses usually have the same ideas in mind : happy customers , happy pets .
Enjoy some delicious tea or coffee in the cafes , read a magazine , or simply relax and pet a cat in your lap .
It 's all possible here in Japan , so keep your eyes peeled for them if you ever travel to Japan !
Funny cats , funnier fightsA busy cat cafe with more cats than people :
Feel free to play with any or all of the cute felines :
Human ear cells vital for hearing have for the first time been created in the lab , and could eventually yield new treatments for hearing loss .
Such cells have been created before from mice , but the new cells will reveal more about how human hearing works .
“ We believe these are the first from humans , ” says Marcelo Rivolta of the University of Sheffield , UK and head of the team presenting its findings on Monday in Oxford at a conference on stem cells .
“ Stem cell therapy for hearing loss is still some years away , but this research is incredibly promising and opens up exciting possibilities , ” says Ralph Holme , director of biomedical research at the UK Royal National Institute for Deaf People , which co-funded the research with Deafness Research UK .

The team grew the cells from cochlear stem cells they ’d isolated from fetuses following abortions , with the full consent of the women involved .
Timing is everything
Rivolta explained that such stem cells only exist for a short time , 9 to 11 weeks into a pregnancy , and then cease to be produced thereafter .
“ That ’s why deafness is permanent , because we do n’t have the stem cells to replace damaged cells in the ear , ” says Rivolta , whose team ’s results will appear in the May issue of the journal Stem Cells .
“ So we went to the fetal cochlea just before the fetal cells started to mature and differentiate into other cells , ” he explained .
From the extracted material , Rivolta ’s team successfully isolated human fetal auditory stem cells and grew them in the lab .
After exposing the cells to various recipes of nutrients and growth factors , the team found one cocktail that changed the stem cells into human auditory hair - like cells .
When mature , these grow fine hairs that bend in response to sound energy , generating electrical signals .
A second recipe turned the stem cells into auditory neurons , the cells which receive signals from the hair cells and transmit them to the brain , which translates the messages into recognisable sound .
Noise damage
Hair cells are especially delicate , but once they ’re lost through damaging exposure to excessive noise , for example , they ’re irreplaceable , limiting the scope for treatment .
Now that these two types of cells can be made in the lab , researchers can study how they grow and work , and devise new ways to regenerate or repair them .
They can also use the cells to screen for drugs and chemicals that cause hearing loss by damaging them .
“ These cells are for us a model system , ” says Rivolta .
“ They are as we can get to human development , so by studying them we can learn how to handle them , and how they function . ”
Although the hair cells created do n’t have the trademark hairs , they are otherwise identical to hair cells in shape , in electrical activity and in the molecules they carry on their surfaces .
Rivolta is confident that with further research , they can be produced with the accompanying hairs .
And to avoid having to obtain material from fetuses in future , the team have begun a project to try and make the required ear cells from embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) , the cells from embryos capable of developing into all 200 tissues of the body .
“ We can take the information we now have to ESCs , to see if we can produce firstly auditory stem cells , then hair cells and auditory neurons , ” he told New Scientist .
“ It demonstrates that what our group has found in mice is generally applicable to humans , which is certainly another step in the direction of learning to control hair cell generation from a renewable source , ” says Stefan Heller of Stanford University in California , and head of a team which in 2003 produced hair cells in mice .
“ Being able to do this with human cells is an advantage and the strength of this study , ” says Heller , “ but this does not mean that a cure for hearing loss is around the corner , unfortunately . ”

Advertisement France will walk away from this week 's G20 summit if its demands for stricter financial regulation are not met , the finance minister has told the BBC .
Christine Lagarde told Hardtalk that President Nicolas Sarkozy would not sign any agreement if he felt " the deliverables are not there " .
Strengthening financial regulation will be one of the key issues at the G20 .
France wants a stronger global financial regulator than the US and the UK would like .
If France were to leave the summit , it would be a blow to both UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown and US President Barack Obama .
Both men have spoken of their high hopes for the meeting to stimulate international recovery .
" Leaders meeting in London must supply the oxygen of confidence to today 's global economy and give people in all of our countries renewed hope for the future , " Mr Brown said .
President Obama is due to arrive in London for the summit later .
It will be his first visit to Europe since he became president .
' Moral boundaries '
The prime minister also called for the " values that we celebrate in everyday life " to be brought to the financial markets .
G20 LONDON SUMMIT
World leaders will meet later this week in London to discuss measures to tackle the downturn .
See our in - depth guide to the G20 summit .
The G20 countries are Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , Mexico , Russia , Saudi Arabia , South Africa , South Korea , Turkey , the UK , the US and the EU .
" I believe that unsupervised globalisation of our financial markets did not only cross national boundaries , it crossed moral boundaries too , " Mr Brown said .
He was speaking at a gathering of religious leaders in St Paul 's Cathedral with the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd .
Mr Rudd warned that the global economic crisis was having a devastating effect on developing countries .
" This is the unseen cost of the crisis , the invisible face of the global recession , " he said .
" But in conscience and for people of conscience we cannot stand idly by . "
Cracks emerging ?
However , splits among other world leaders on how to tackle the economic crisis have also begun to emerge in other areas .
European countries , in particular , are resisting calls to commit to spending more this year and next .
President Sarkozy has previously spoken out against " Anglo - Saxon " economies , as has the prime minister of Luxembourg , Jean - Claude Juncker .
" This crisis started in the United States .
The Anglo - Saxon world has always refused to add the dose of regulation which financial markets , the international financial system needed , " Mr Juncker said last week .
The European Commission President , Jose Manuel Barroso , denied that there were any splits within the EU itself .
" In the last European summit we have agreed on a common position , a very ambitious position , " he told the BBC .
" I will be happy if I see all our partners with the same level of ambition . "
' Absolutely determined '
However , there have also been expressions of optimism .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is reported to have said that chances were high that agreements - for example , to regulate hedge funds - would be reached .
And in spite of her walkout threat , Ms Lagarde was eager to stress that the G20 leaders agree on a range of important issues .
" I am absolutely determined , and President Sarkozy has said it loud and clear , that we actually eradicate non-cooperative centres and tax havens , " she said .
" I know that Chancellor Merkel is very much on that line , I know that Gordon Brown has said that old tax havens have nothing to do with this new world .
" Well , we need to deliver on that and we need to be extremely united and strong . "

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- Rules makers adopted guidelines Thursday that give financial firms more latitude in applying so - called mark - to - market accounting , just in time for what is shaping up as another tough earnings season .
The Financial Accounting Standards Board , the private sector body that sets U.S. bookkeeping rules , moved Thursday to adopt a rule that makes clear that firms need not write down the value of their assets based on so - called distressed sales of similar assets by other banks .
FASB members discussed the change earlier Thursday morning and reached an agreement on the new rule .
The decision , which will apply to the numbers banks report for the first quarter ended earlier this week , comes amid pressure from Congress over the supposed role of mark - to - market accounting in the financial crisis .
Numerous legislators called on the FASB in hearings last month to ease so - called fair value rules to ensure that banks are n't being forced to take excessive writedowns at a time of economic stress .
Just days later , the five - member FASB put the proposal up for comment .
Members of Congress and some bankers have been sharply critical of what they call the FASB 's foot - dragging on the fair value issue .
But David Larsen , a managing director at valuation consultant Duff & Phelps , said last month that the release of the current FASB proposal amounted to " the second - quickest issuance of accounting guidance in history . "
The rule changes come just as big U.S. banks are preparing to issue their first - quarter results .
Analysts are expecting another rough quarter for big institutions such as Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) , as a soaring unemployment rate and tumbling house prices should translate into higher loan losses .
The new FASB rules could help boost banks ' earnings by making it clear that institutions can account for mortgage - backed securities and other assets based on their internal estimates of cash flow and other factors , rather than relying on sales prices in largely inactive markets .
But observers such as Larsen note that the latest guidelines only confirm what careful readers of the FASB 's fair value rules have known all along , that fire sales are n't meant to be the main determinant of value .
Thus , if the banks have been following the rules as intended all along , there could be little effect on the earnings .
The FASB , which sets the guidelines under the aegis of the Securities and Exchange Commission , on Thursday also tweaked the rules for how banks may account for securities such as bonds that are n't expected to be repaid in full , but whose market value has been depressed as markets have grown less liquid .
Under the new rules , these so - called " other - than - temporary " impairments will be divided into two buckets , one that reflects the expected credit losses tied to a security and another that accounts for other declines in value , which may be tied to market uncertainty .
Shares of the big banks rose sharply on the news Thursday , as the broader market rallied on the backdrop of plans for increased global funding for the International Monetary Fund .
Bank of America and Citi , two of the most troubled banks , were each up nearly 10 % in mid-morning trading .
The moves Thursday represent the latest twist in the long - running struggle between accounting rules makers and foes of fair value accounting .
The latter , led by the likes of former bank regulator Bill Isaac and onetime Federal Reserve official Bob McTeer , argue the fair value rules have deepened the economic crisis by reducing bank capital and constraining lending .
They have called for the rules to be completely repealed .
But proponents of fair value rules champion the transparency they provide to investors and say changing the rules would n't solve problems that are mostly driven by a collapse of underwriting standards during the credit boom .
Larsen , for one , likens a move away from fair value accounting to " taking the freshness date off the milk bottles .
Does it really address the real problem ? "
This article is from the March / April 2009 issue of Dollars & Sense : Real World Economics available at http://www.dollarsandsense.org
This article is from the March / April 2009 issue of Dollars & Sense magazine .
Dear Dr. Dollar : I learned in my economics classes that in a market economy , problems tend to be self - correcting : when a recession starts , demand weakens ; then prices drop , people and firms start to buy more and the economy picks up again .
So why do n’t we see this kind of self - correction now ?
Why does it seem as if things are getting worse and worse ?
— Corina Chio , Los Angeles , Calif .
Life , it turns out , is more complicated than the way it is presented in many economics classes .
“ More complicated ” means different .
One of the key differences between reality and the standard fare of some economics classes is that the standard fare does not take sufficient account of the time lapses between one event and another .
These time lapses do n’t simply mean that adjustments take longer ; they mean that the nature of those adjustments can be very different from what one learns in class .
When demand weakens , prices do tend to drop , but they do n’t drop immediately .
So , for example , when demand weakens and people buy fewer cars , candy , cardigans , and computers , the prices of these goods do n’t fall right away .
But , facing the fall - off in purchases , the firms that make these products cut back on production and lay off workers .
So demand falls further because the unemployed have less money to buy all these products .
In this situation , things can get worse and worse instead of being turned around by the falling prices .
Which way things go is not automatic , but depends on the seriousness of the initial fall - off in demand and the speed with which that fall - off occurs .
A further problem with the simplistic analysis presented in some classes is that people ’s buying decisions are based on expectations about the future as well as on current prices .
If auto dealers try to get me to buy a new car by lowering the price , I am not likely to respond positively if I think I may well lose my job soon and be unable to make the monthly payments .
And if my main use for a car is to get to and from work , my expectation of lack of work will make me even less likely to buy a new car regardless of the price .
Firms behave similarly .
Why should a firm hire more labor or invest in new plants and equipment if the firm expects that people will be cutting back on demand for the firm ’s products ?
Even if interest rates and the prices of labor and raw materials are all falling , firms are unlikely to expand operations if they do not think the demand will be there .
Indeed , it is precisely the falling prices that signal to firms that a recession is developing — which means that demand will not be there .
Worse : as prices fall , both consumers and firms are likely to delay purchases , expecting that things will be even cheaper if they wait .
But by waiting ( i.e. , by not spending ) they create even more downward pressure .
So falling prices ( deflation ) can make things worse , not better .
And even worse still : because consumers and firms act quite rationally in this manner — cutting back expenditures because they expect things to get worse — things do get worse !
When each firm and consumer acts rationally in response to negative expectations , as a group they tend to insure that those negative expectations will become reality .
Individual rationality and social rationality come in conflict with one another .
This phenomenon is often referred to as “ the paradox of thrift . ”
People respond to the situation by being thrifty , doing what is good for them individually .
But the outcome for society as a whole is bad .
Under these circumstances , there is a need for collective action — that is , government action .
This collective action — this government action — will be most effective when it takes the form of deficit spending .
And this is exactly what is meant when people talk about a “ stimulus package . ”
By engaging in deficit spending the government is increasing demand more by its spending than it is reducing demand through taxes .
The difference is made up by borrowing , and the “ stimulus ” is greatest when the borrowed money would not have been spent — and it would not have been spent precisely because the private firms and individuals who have the money ( the money the government is borrowing ) also have poor expectations about the future .
Not every economic downturn gets worse and worse .
There can be a process of self - correction .
But when a serious downturn develops — as is the case right now — self - correction is not going to solve our problems .
The collective action that we can take through government is essential to avoid economic disaster .

« Back to Ask Dr. Dollar
I ’m not just talking about the $ 600 billion or so already committed under the TARP .
There are also the huge credit lines extended by the Federal Reserve ; large - scale lending by Federal Home Loan Banks ; the taxpayer - financed payoffs of A.I.G. contracts ; the vast expansion of F.D.I.C. guarantees ; and , more broadly , the implicit backing provided to every financial firm considered too big , or too strategic , to fail .
One can argue that it ’s necessary to rescue Wall Street to protect the economy as a whole  and in fact I agree .
But given all that taxpayer money on the line , financial firms should be acting like public utilities , not returning to the practices and paychecks of 2007 .
Furthermore , paying vast sums to wheeler - dealers is n’t just outrageous ; it ’s dangerous .
Why , after all , did bankers take such huge risks ?
Because success  or even the temporary appearance of success  offered such gigantic rewards : even executives who blew up their companies could and did walk away with hundreds of millions .
Now we ’re seeing similar rewards offered to people who can play their risky games with federal backing .
So what ’s going on here ?
Why are paychecks heading for the stratosphere again ?
Claims that firms have to pay these salaries to retain their best people are n’t plausible : with employment in the financial sector plunging , where are those people going to go ?
No , the real reason financial firms are paying big again is simply because they can .
They ’re making money again ( although not as much as they claim ) , and why not ?
After all , they can borrow cheaply , thanks to all those federal guarantees , and lend at much higher rates .
So it ’s eat , drink and be merry , for tomorrow you may be regulated .
Or maybe not .
There ’s a palpable sense in the financial press that the storm has passed : stocks are up , the economy ’s nose - dive may be leveling off , and the Obama administration will probably let the bankers off with nothing more than a few stern speeches .
Rightly or wrongly , the bankers seem to believe that a return to business as usual is just around the corner .
We can only hope that our leaders prove them wrong , and carry through with real reform .
In 2008 , overpaid bankers taking big risks with other people ’s money brought the world economy to its knees .
The last thing we need is to give them a chance to do it all over again .

When I first heard about the impending launch of the DiggBar , I was annoyed more than anything else .
The Digg team has a longstanding tradition of sneering at sites that mimic the functionality of their site while claiming themselves to be innovators in the space ( though they themselves evolved from Del.icio.us and Slashdot ) .
With that in mind , the idea of Digg so blatantly copying StumbleUpon 's recent jump from a browser - based toolbar to an iframe toolbar felt hypocritical ( heck even Reddit has had a toolbar for a while now ) .
Now that the toolbar has been released to the public , however , it turns that this is n't just a simple toolbar , this is one of the best decisions Digg has made in a very long time .
What The Diggbar Is
The Diggbar is essentially an iframed toolbar that allows you to interact with content on Digg without actually having to visiting the site .
The bar shows up at the top of the page you 're viewing , followed by the full presentation of the destination site right below .
The toolbar also lets you create short - urls for stories and share them with your friends ( to do so , simply add digg.com / before any url and voila ! ) .
The functionality of the DiggBar is very straightforward and the interface is easy to understand and simple to use .
You can do almost everything with the toolbar that you can do with a story on Digg along with a bit more .
You can see the current vote count ( and vote on the story ) , read the Digg headline ( and see the actual headline and content below ) , you can see the current comment count ( and read the one top comment , one latest comment , and one most controversial comment ) , bury stories , see related stories and more stories from the same source , share the story via Facebook , Twitter , Email , and Digg shouts , and finally click the random button to go to another random story .
If you 've had enough of the toolbar , simply click x from the top right - hand corner and it disappears .
The toolbar is quite elegant and non-intrusive and handles the functionality well .
It takes up enough room to be effective , but not enough to get in the way .
The first half ( comments , burying , related stories , and more from same source ) are handled via a sliding mechanism , while the sharing is handled via a pop-up that takes you to the site of your choice ( for example , Twitter ) with the title and DiggBar short - url already filled in .
In fact some subtleties of the toolbar actually surprised me .
For example , clicking on a related story or another story from the same source via the DiggBar does n't take you to the Digg page for the selected story , rather it takes you directly to the destination site , DiggBar intact .
Furthermore ( and even better ) clicking any story from the Digg homepage takes you to the destination site , but now with the DiggBar appearing up top , just in case the destination site does n't have a Digg button installed .
If you have n't seen it yet , here 's Kevin Rose 's demo :
A few omissions from the toolbar : while you can read three comments ( one from each , top , latest , and controversial ) , you can't read more via the toolbar and you can't submit your own comment via the toolbar either , for that you 'll have to visit the website .
Both of these functions would make perfect sense since you 're already on the destination site , why go back to Digg for further interaction ?
Additionally , there are no timestamps on the content so you can't tell whether the content is fresh or weeks old .
The silliest omission by far , in my opinion , is that the iframe toolbar does n't automatically appear when you open a link via Digg.com .
What The Diggbar Is Not
The Diggbar is definitely not a competitor to the StumbleUpon browser toolbar and it is definitely not a replacement for the larger Digg experience .
In its current state the DiggBar lets you interact with a specific link on Digg ( and / or shorten links ) and share it with others , and jump randomly from one promoted Digg story to another .
There are no social features in the toolbar and the recommendation engine is unfortunately absent .
In contrast the StumbleUpon browser toolbar takes advantage of its collaborative filtering system to display stories that you are most likely to enjoy ( not just popular stories ) and allows you to select what specific type of content you would like to see ( media type and category ) and even select specific users and sites to Stumble through .
Ultimately , while the DiggBar is no alternative for the larger social experience of Digg and wont be replacing the StumbleUpon social content discovery toolbar , it is certainly better than the StumbleUpon and Reddit iframe toolbars and is a welcome addition to the Digg offsite experience and will certainly make sharing content easier and more pervasive .
Digg 's Smartest Move In Years
While on the surface the DiggBar is an incremental upgrade ( to the largely useless Digg Firefox toolbar and a logical next step , if you dig further you will realize that this is probably one of the best strategic business decisions Digg has made in the past four years .
Digg 's core business is aggregating shared links and facilitating conversations around those links along with some light social networking .
However , because the site itself presents a large barrier to entry for any enthusiasts ( i.e. newcomers hardly get to play the field ) it makes sense that people new to social media would prefer to congregate elsewhere to share and discuss content - for example , on Twitter .
As one of the most popular users on Twitter , Kevin Rose has been acutely aware of both Twitter 's potential and the microblogging site 's massive growth over the past year .
And after the failure of Pownce , he understands the first to market advantage that has made Twitter the undisputed and unstoppable leader in the space .
Furthermore , as anyone who spends time on Twitter knows , a substantial percentage of activity that goes on in people 's twitterstreams is simply sharing links - a feature that competes directly with the core business of Digg .
In fact , the hardliner position the website has taken against some of its most active users ( and even banning quite a few of them ) has sent many of them to Twitter where they have amassed tens of thousands of followers with whom they continue to share links and discuss them , replicating the same experience they used to have on Digg without any penalties .
Of course tweetmeme - like services that aggregate performance of links based on retweets ( the buttons and votes end up looking surprisingly like votes on Digg ) definitely help make the situation worse for Digg .
The Perfect Tool For The Twitter Era
Add to that Twitter 's meteoric growth and 140 character limit and you very quickly begin to understand why Digg needs to have a presence on content being shared off their site ( particularly on Twitter , and even Facebook ) without being intrusive ( i.e. iframe toolbar rather than a fullblown intermediary Digg link ) and why this link needs to be a short -url .
Link sharing is big business and a large part of the market 's growth is taking place outside of traditional " digg - like " social news sites ( i.e. microblogging and social networking ) and it's about time they woke up to that realization .
If you had the option to use one of the more traditional url - shortners when sharing a one of your links , or using DiggBar ( with the latter having the potential of getting your content submitted , reshared , and promoted on Digg , to the tune of tens of thousands of users ) , which would you pick ?
But that 's not all , sure they want to be a part of the content sharing happening off their site , but url - shortners are big business on their own , with bit.ly reportedly worth $ 8 million .
And of course we can't forget that this is also a preemptive strike against StumbleUpon who is also planning to release their own url - shortner .
Best of all , it takes very little in terms of resources to run a url - shortner .
All in all , while the DiggBar is certainly an improvement for the end - user , with one release , Digg is positioning themselves in the center of some of the hottest growth markets at the moment and at the same time protecting their core function of content sharing by taking a little focus off the destination site .
As usage of the DiggBar increases , they 'll piggyback on content sharing via social networks and microblogging sites as well as corner a very nice chunk of the url - shortner market while increasing the engagement on Digg , without even having people visit the destination site .

There was another echo with the past yesterday when newspapers were briefed that the Home Secretary 's marriage was in trouble , not least because of the pressures caused by spending so much time away from home – the one in the constituency that is .
Tessa Jowell , the Olympics minister , announced the separation from her husband David Mills as news of criminal charges against him and her closed involvement in his finances emerged .
The sympathy generated by her separation was thought to have saved her Cabinet post .

MEXICO CITY , April 14 ( Reuters ) - Fast food giant Burger King apologized on Tuesday for an advertisement featuring a squat Mexican draped in his country ’s flag next to a tall American cowboy and said it would change the campaign .
Mexico ’s ambassador to Spain said posters released in Europe for Burger King ’s new Tex - Mex style “ Texican whopper , ” a cheeseburger with chile and spicy mayonnaise , inappropriately displayed the Mexican flag , whose image is protected under national law .
The ambassador wrote a letter complaining to Burger King and requested the ad campaign be discontinued .
Burger King BKC.N said the ads were meant to show a mixture of influences from the southwestern United States and Mexico , not to poke fun at Mexican culture , but said it would replace them " as soon as commercially possible . "
“ Burger King Corporation has made the decision to revise the Texican Whopper advertising creative out of respect for the Mexican culture and its people , ” it said in a statement .
“ The existing campaign falls fully within the legal parameters of the United Kingdom and Spain where the commercials are being aired and were not intended to offend anyone , ” the company added .
A TV version of the ad shows the strapping cowboy and the pint - sized Mexican wrestler -- nicknamed “ Just a Little Bit ” -- living together as roommates .
At one point , the American lifts up the Mexican to help him put a trophy on a high shelf .
Mexico was involved in another controversial ad campaign last year when Absolut vodka posted billboard ads in Mexico with an early 19th century map showing chunks of the United States as part of Mexico .
The campaign angered many U.S. citizens and was later dropped .

The State of New York Division of Cemeteries has sent out “ Mass Fatality forms ” to cemeteries in that state to collect data about their ability to deal with the high volume of casualties that would occur if their were a flu pandemic or other disaster .
The form letter that this office received was dated April 4 , 2007 [ pdf ] , so clearly preparation for such disasters has been ongoing for some time .
Along with other data , cemeterians were asked in this survey :
“ Should a prolonged mass fatality disaster or pandemic flu occur in your community would your cemetery be able to provide temporary or permanent internment space for a significant number of disaster or flu deaths in additional to your current burial services ? ”
Cemetery owners were also asked to detail the business structure and capacity of their facilities , including proximity to roads , train lines and airfields .
The Division of Cemeteries requested data to calculate the number of acres that could be made available “ at 950 graves per acre . ”
It is clear that emergency and disaster forces are being mobilized at the state and federal level .
There is no data to predict what disasters could come– forces of nature , false - flag attacks , biological attacks / flu outbreaks , quarantines etc .
However , a pattern of data including news items , reports , photos and tips have all pointed to an incremental gearing up for a cataclysmic situation that includes mass casualties .
Whether it is half a million plastic coffin liners videotaped at a truck depot , or massive expansion at dozens of cemeteries across the country or FEMA and Homeland Security agents preparing for an avian bird flu outbreak , it is clear that government agencies are expecting something to happen and their agencies are expanding in accordance .
As this site reported yesterday , a number of incidents have demonstrated a federal preoccupation with a mass casualty incident– and it started before 9/11 ever happened .

The state of Colorado issued an executive order in 2000 asserting its authority to bury victims in mass graves and / or cremate bodies under emergency situations .
Jim Erickson of The Rocky Mountain News reported February 8 , 2003 that :
The state of Colorado could seize antibiotics , cremate disease - ridden corpses
and , under extreme circumstances , dig mass graves under executive orders
drafted for use in the event of a bioterrorism attack .
D.H. Williams reported in February on an Indiana county municipal official who received detailed requests from FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security in regards to locations for mass graves , preparations for regional refugees , preparations for economic collapse and budget cuts under a GM collapse , as well as the locations of major installations , emergency assets and more .
The official , speaking in this recording , says that he became concerned about the intentions of the FEMA and DHS officials after repeated meetings where scenarios were discussed that included a bird flu outbreak as well as fires , floods and earthquakes .
The authorities that be have warned in their white papers that United States could face rioting ; financial collapse seems very possible ; and now it is clear that preparations include widespread death and emergency conditions .

Stop motion animation is one of the hottest areas of film - making today .
Stop motion is an animation art through which one can spring life in inanimate things and do the unnatural .
It works by shooting a single frame of an object , then moving the object slightly , and then shooting another frame .
When the film runs continuously in a film projector , or other video playback system , the illusion of fluid motion is created and the objects appear to move by themselves .
This is similar to the animation of cartoons , but using real objects instead of drawings .
Well , how can you make use of stop motion in web design ?
Some design agencies integrate stop motion in their showreels , some may use it to present a product or a service .
The main advantage of the technique is that it really looks different , unusual and therefore memorable .
In technical terms , stop motion consists of many forms according to techniques used to create , animate and film it - pixilation , cutout animation , time - lapse , clay animation and many more .
Stop motion animation is time - consuming , repetitive process which requires patience .
Below we present over 50 amazing examples of stop motion videos , a tribute to hard work of animators , artists and creative folks .

Who does n't love that great song " Mahna Mahna " from Sesame Street ?
As funny as it is earwormy , as adorable as it is cool , the song appeals to each generation anew and never gets tiring .
But guess what ?
Neither Sesame Street nor The Muppet Show can take credit for discovering the song .
Penned by the Italian film composer Piero Umiliani ( if you have n't heard of him , it 's okay , " Mahna Mahna " is all he 's really known for ) , " Mah NÃ Mah NÃ " as it was originally called in Italian , was first used in the 1968 pseudo - documentary Svezia , Inferno e Paradiso — a film composed of a series of short , soft - focus type segments about — strapped into your parachutes ? — sexuality in Sweden !
( Hence the paradise and hell , I guess . )
Check out the ( pg - 13 ) clip below for the original scene underscored with the original Umiliani arrangement .
Sesame Street used it a year later in an episode that was premiered in 1969 , then on the Ed Sullivan show later the same year , and again on The Muppet Show in 1977 .
The original arrangement ( " Mah NÃ Mah NÃ " ) was a huge hit in ' 68 and ' 69 and made it all the way to # 55 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 .
It also hit the charts again across the pond in ' 77 , making it all the way to # 8 in the UK .
In the original Italian version , the song makes about as much sense , lyrically , as it does in English , which is to say , nonsense .
If you want to compare the above version to the Muppet version , or just want to feel nostalgic , here 's the latter :
Iranian leader :
We 'd support an Israeli - Palestianian peace agreement Muriel Kane
Published : Sunday April 26 , 2009
Print This Email This Israel 's new hardline prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , insists that he will not consider peace talks with the Palestinians until the US has taken action to curb Iran 's nuclear and regional ambitions .
This has been seen as a serious stumbling block to President Obama 's belief that progress on Israeli - Palestinian talks must come first and will provide him with increased leverage over Iran .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , however , may have thrown a wild card into the stalemate on Sunday when he told ABC's George Stephanopoulos that he would be fine with supporting any peace agreement the Palestinians might reach with Israel .
" If the Palestinian people negotiate an agreement with Israel and the Palestinian people vote and support that agreement , a two state solution , will Iran support it ?
" Stephanopoulos asked ?
" Nobody should interfere , " Ahmadinejad replied .
" Allow the Palestinian people to decide for themselves , whatever they decide .
It is the right of all human beings . "
" But if they choose a two state solution , if they choose to recognize Israel 's existence , Iran will as well ?
" Stephanopoulos pursued .
To that , Ahmadinejad replied , " Let me approach this from another perspective .
If the Palestinians decide that the Zionist regime needs to leave all Palestinian lands , would the American administration accept their decision ?
Will they accept this Palestinian point of view ?
" Whatever decision they take is fine with us , " he emphasized .
" We are not going to determine anything .
Whatever decision they take , we will support that . "
Ahmadinejad had used very similar language last September in an interview with Amy Goodman for Democracy Now !
When asked then if he would support a two - state solution , he replied , " Wherever people decide , we will respect it .
I mean , its very much in correspondence with our proposal to allow Palestinian people to decide through free referendums . "
Stephanopoulos began Sunday 's interview by pointing to the now - famous photograph of President Obama shaking hands with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and asking Ahmadinejad if he would like to see a similar picture of himself with Obama .
" Well , we are calling for peace and security for all , " Ahmadinejad replied .
" We would like international relations to be based on justice and friendship .
Wherever a hostile relationship turns into friendship , that would make us happy . "
He added , however , " You need to appreciate that the American administration , 29 years ago , unilaterally cut its relations with Iran .
...
Now they say that we have given up that enmity .
That 's fine .
...
But an administration which , up until yesterday , was saying that I 'm going to kill you , and today says that I 'm not going to kill you -- is that sufficient ? "
" We are always ready to talk with no preconditions , " Ahmadinejad insisted .
" We welcome change .
We are praying to the Almighty for that .
And we will help to bring change about . "

Few things on Earth are spookier than viruses .
The very name virus , from the Latin word for " poisonous slime , " speaks to our lowly regard for them .
Their anatomy is equally dubious : loose , tiny envelopes of molecules — protein - coated DNA or RNA — that inhabit some netherworld between life and non-life .
Viruses do not have cell membranes , as bacteria do ; they are not even cells .
They seem most lifelike only when they invade and co-opt the machinery of living cells in order to make more of themselves , often killing their hosts in the process .
Their efficiency at doing so ranks them among the most fearsome killers : Ebola virus , HIV , smallpox , flu .
Yet they go untouched by antibiotics , having nothing really biotic about them .
Bernard La Scola peers into an electron microscope in his laboratory in Marseille , France .
| Jörg Brockmann
The existence of viruses was first surmised just over a century ago by Dutch botanist Martinus Beijerinck .
He mashed up disease - riddled tobacco leaves and then passed the juicy pulp through a porcelain filter fine enough to trap everything down to the tiniest bacteria .
When even that filtered fluid infected other plants , a world still acclimating to Louis Pasteur 's germ theory now had an even tinier class of pathogens to contemplate .
Here were entities so wraith - like that they remained unseen until 1935 , when scientists armed with the newly invented electron microscope managed to take a picture of the " poison " lurking in Beijerinck 's slime , today known as tobacco mosaic virus .
Less an organism than a jumbled collection of biochemical shards , the virus eventually yielded Wendell M. Stanley , the leader of the research team that exposed it , a Nobel Prize in chemistry rather than biology .
The discovery also set off an intense scientific and philosophical debate that still rages :
What exactly is a virus ?
Can it properly be described as alive ?
" ' Life ' and ' living ' are words that the scientist has borrowed from the plain man , " the British virologist Norman Pirie wrote at the time .
" Now , however , systems are being discovered and studied which are neither obviously living nor obviously dead , and it is necessary to define these words or else give up using them and coin others . "
Seventy years later , the challenge continues to haunt science .
So " other " are viruses that we 're still trying to corral them with new metaphors : microzombies , pirates of the cell , submicroscopic hijackers .
But even the more restrained characterizations betray a long - standing prejudice .
Most biologists typically recognize three official branches of life : the eukaryotes , which are organisms whose cells have a nucleus ; bacteria , the single - celled organisms that may or may not possess a nucleus ; and archaea , an ancient line of microbes without nuclei that may make up as much as a third of all life on Earth ( See" Will the Methane Bubble Burst ? "
Discover , March 2004 ) .
Viruses , being dependent on these organisms to host them , are viewed as evolutionary latecomers : genomic scraps that fell out onto the floor back when life was assembling itself into more complex arrangements .
Bacteriologist Bernard La Scola first identified Mimivirus , the largest known virus , in 2003 .
Although Mimi infects only amoebas , many of its kin pose a direct threat to humans .

The sheer prevalence of viruses , however , is forcing a reconsideration about how these entities fit into the biological world .
Researchers have characterized some 4,000 viruses , from several dozen distinct families .
Yet that is a tiny fraction of the number of viruses on Earth .
In the last two years , J. Craig Venter , the geneticist who decoded the human genome , has circled the globe in his sailboat and sampled ocean water every couple of hundred miles .
Each time he dipped a container overboard , he discovered millions of new viruses — so many that he increased the number of known genes 10 - fold .
Although we tend to think of viruses only in terms of the damage they do , a broader and more benign picture is emerging .
Scientists estimate that they have discovered and documented less than 1 percent of all the living things on the planet .
But for every organism in that unidentified 99 percent , at least 10 times as many unknown viruses are thought to exist — the vast majority of which are harmless to life and yet integral to it .
Now , with the recent discovery of a truly monstrous virus , scientists are again casting about for how best to characterize these spectral life - forms .
The new virus , officially known as Mimivirus ( because it mimics a bacterium ) , is a creature " so bizarre , " as The London Telegraph described it , " and unlike anything else seen by scientists . . . that . . . it could qualify for a new domain in the tree of life . "
Indeed , Mimivirus is so much more genetically complex than all previously known viruses , not to mention a number of bacteria , that it seems to call for a dramatic redrawing of the tree of life .
" This thing shows that some viruses are organisms that have an ancestor that was much more complex than they are now , " says Didier Raoult , one of the leaders of the research team at the Mediterranean University in Marseille , France , that identified the virus .
" We have a lot of evidence with Mimivirus that the virus phylum is at least as oldas the other branches of life and that viruses were involved very early on in the evolutionary emergence of life . "
That represents a radical change in thinking about life 's origins : Viruses , long thought to be biology 's hitchhikers , turn out to have been biology 's formative force .
This is striking news , especially at a moment when the basic facts of origins and evolution seem to have fallen under a shroud .
In the discussions of intelligent design , one hears a yearning for an old - fashioned creation story , in which some singular , inchoate entity stepped in to give rise to complex life - forms — humans in particular .
Now the viruses appear to present a creation story of their own : a stirring , topsy - turvy , and decidedly unintelligent design wherein life arose more by reckless accident than original intent , through an accumulation of genetic accounting errors committed by hordes of mindless , microscopic replication machines .
Our descent from apes is the least of it .
With the discovery of Mimi , scientists are close to ascribing to viruses the last role that anyone would have conceived for them : that of life 's prime mover .
The green hallways of the second - floor Rickettsia Unit at the Mediterranean University constitute what might be called an archive of agony .
Stored there on freezer shelves behind a series of locked lab doors is an array of bacterial pathogens that have been caught and identified by the unit 's crack detectives over the years .
Rickettsia , the microbe that causes such diseases as typhus and Rocky Mountain spotted fever , resides there alongside many others , from Salmonella to strains of Legionella , a bacterium that causes a severe pneumonia - like disease in humans and was first identified following an outbreak at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia in 1976 .
In the early spring of 2003 , amid the familiar cast of microbial villains , Bernard La Scola , a bacteriologist at the unit , came upon something that none of his colleagues had ever seen .
Focusing his electron microscope on a sample of what he assumed would prove to be an elusive new strain of Legionella , La Scola found himself staring instead at a viral monster .
" I went , ' Whoa , ' " he recalls .
On his computer he brings up an image , magnified 200,000 times , of the creature : a bug-eyed , hexagonal smurf with a head of electrified hair .
That 's but one of its looks .
In three - dimensional imaging it appears more like a soccer ball .
La Scola recognized both shapes as classically viral .
Viruses seem to crave such crystal - like geometry , which is one of many reasons they 've been thought of as more chemical than biological .
" I'm a bacteriologist , " he says .
" I do n't think in terms of viruses , but this thing was way too big for that .
So I called a friend of mine in the faculty of virology , and he came and looked at it and said , ' Oh , yes , it is a virus , but the size . . . ' "
While there is some evidence to suggest that it may have once caused a type of pneumonia in humans , Mimivirus now seems to infect only amoebas .
Until its positive identification in 2003 , it was known as Bradfordcoccus and falsely suspected as the cause of a 1992 pneumonia outbreak in the West Yorkshire mill town of Bradford , England .
That was where Mimivirus was first found , hiding inside an amoeba at the base of an industrial cooling tower .
Cooling towers — along with evaporative condensers , riparian soil , tap water , showerheads , and treated sewage — are all hangouts of Legionella .
And amoebas , as Timothy Rowbotham , a former disease detective with Britain 's Public Health Laboratory Service , discovered back in 1992 , are an ideal tool for collecting Legionella .
In the ongoing to and fro between the world 's microbes , amoebas are a nearly indomitable foe , gobbling up nearly everything in their path .
Legionella , however , turns the tables on amoebas , rendering them both a food source and a perfect lab culture for microbe hunters .
Rowbotham was unable to identify a number of the samples he collected in 1992 , and he stored the mystery cultures in his lab freezer for future research .
When budget cuts forced the closure of his lab in 1998 , he had the presence of mind to call around and ask fellow scientists if they would be interested in any of the critters in his fridge .
He had recently met Didier Raoult , he recalls , " and when I told him on the phone about the cooling tower cultures , he said he'd love those systems . "
A student of Rowbotham 's who had just accepted a postdoc position in Raoult 's lab in Marseille took the samples south with him .
Four new strains of Legionella would eventually be drawn out and identified at Raoult 's lab , along with new bacteria closely related to Chlamydia , parasitic bacteria that , like Legionella , cause a variety of diseases .
One last sample , however , defied all methods of examination for more than a year and a half , until La Scola turned his high - powered scope on the last Bradford holdout : Mimivirus .
In addition to its signature viral shape , Mimi exhibited what is known as an eclipse phase , a bit of telltale viral creepiness recognizable to any fan of sci - fi horror movies .
When a virus penetrates a cell , it disappears inside the nucleus for four to eight hours , giving the outward appearance of complete normalcy .
Then the viral particles that the cell has been coerced into making suddenly burst forth , shattering the host .
Still , it was n't until Raoult sought the assistance of Jean - Michel Claverie , a bioinformatics specialist at the Institute of Structural Biology and Microbiology in Marseille , that the true weirdness and wonder of their monster was revealed .
At about a half - millionth of a meter across , Mimi is one of the few viruses visible under a standard light microscope .
Its genome weighs in at a whopping 1.2 million letters : at least 10 times larger than atypical virus 's ; nearly triple the size of that of its largest viral counterpart , canary pox , in the smallpox family ; and larger than the genomes of 20 or more parasitic bacteria .
Moreover , within Mimi 's outsize helping of genetic material , Claverie found genes for such things as the translation of proteins , DNA repair enzymes , and other types of protein .
Those functions were thought to be the exclusive province of more complex cellular organisms .
The boundary between viruses and complex bacteria had become officially blurred .
" We already had very large viral genomes in the database before Mimivirus , " says Claverie .
" But before we saw that the virus and bacteria groups could overlap , we never asked ourselves why some large viruses had , for example , 300 genes , while the typical virus only needs 10 .
Then we see Mimi , with over 1,000 genes , and we 're thinking we hav ea problem with our whole concept of viruses . "
Viruses come in all shapes , sizes , and degrees of sturdiness , and with all manner of strategies for getting at the cellular machinery they lack .
Some batter - ram their way through the outer cell membrane .
Some meld their membranes with a cell 's and then suddenly revolve , like those faux bookcases in the movies , into the sacred chamber .
Still others gain entry by disguising themselves as the sort of free - floating molecules that our cells routinely gobble up .
The manner of replication varies , too , depending on the virus 's genetic identity .
DNA viruses like smallpox , herpes , and now Mimivirus tend to be larger and more sophisticated genetically .
They can exist for centuries outside a host and can afford to be more restrained when replicating inside one , making reliable , relatively error - free copies of themselves by hijacking the formula common to all life .
DNA makes a slight variant of itself known as RNA , which directs the production of the specific proteins of which all complex life - forms are composed .
So - called RNA viruses are rogues : smaller , fast - replicating shape - shifters , descended from a time that evolutionary biologists refer to as the RNA world , back near the base of life 's tree , before today 's DNA - based organisms evolved .
RNA viruses can direct the copying of their own proteins without using DNA — a shortcut that generates both more copies and more errors , or mutations .
Although such activity might get you fired in the business world , in biology , mutations can offer a leg up .
During unstable times — when environmental conditions shift or humans develop a successful vaccine — RNA viruses have the resiliency to adapt , outflank , and reemerge .
Influenza is the best known continuously morphing RNA virus .
HIV is a particularly insidious RNA virus , known as a retrovirus because once inside the cell nucleus it reverses the DNA formula : a single strand of RNA manufactures its own double strand of viral DNA .
That viral DNA is then directly spliced into the host cell 's DNA and passed along with the cell 's natural replication process .
There is even a newly discovered category of subviral agents known as viroids : naked snippets of RNA that lack even an outer protein coat and do n't encode for anything .
They are devoid of genes entirely , and yet they replicate and cause illness once inside a host .
And then there are deeply derivative entities called satellites , metaviruses that can replicate only within a virus that is already busy inside a host .
Whatever neat conceptions and categorizations we develop , viruses have always found a way to poke holes in them .
Scientists long assumed , for example , that viruses could only be made of DNA or RNA .
Then in the late 1990s , a number of viruses were found to contain both .
Retroviruses , meanwhile , were long thought to infect only animals .
The only seemingly safe assumptions were that viruses will always be smaller in both physical size and genomic content than the simplest bacteria and that viruses had to have evolved after those same cellular organisms , on which their parasitism depends .
Now the discovery of Mimivirus has rendered even these two viral paradigms questionable .
What Claverie calls " the final click " came after comparative analysis of Mimi's DNA with that of other organisms in life 's three domains : the eukaryotes , bacteria , and archaea .
Mimi , it turns out , belongs to its own distinct and extremely ancient lineage of large DNA viruses .
Moreover , certain signature Mimi genes , such as those that code for the production of the soccer - ball shape of its capsid ( an outer protein coat common to all viruses ) , have been conserved in viruses that infect organisms from all three of the domains , particularly in eukaryotes .
The implications of that finding are truly radical : that Mimi , or a Mimi - like ancestor , emerged prior to the three other domains and played a key role in inventing the very cells of which humans and all complex cellular life - forms are made .
It is a difficult concept to get one 's head around .
Parasites , to us , are derivative , necessarily descendant from the biological entities they depend on for life .
But simple does not always mean less evolved .
Mimi's outsize complement of genes — so large that the virus is tantalizingly close to being an independent organism — suggest to many scientists that Mimivirus underwent reductive evolution early on and shed some of its genome , including the genes necessary to replicate on its own .
" With Mimi , we 've captured by chance a picture of an organism that was undergoing such a reduction , evolving toward fewer genes , " says Claverie .
" This guy just retained more ancestral features than others .
" Biologists , Claverie says , can no longer view viruses as random assemblages of genes .
" We have to confer to these guys a nobility , a genealogy .
Not only a genealogy .
They are very ancestral , and their ancestors are at least contemporary with ours and those of all present - day life - forms .
Mimi is like the missing link . "
With the aid of advanced gene sequencing , comparative DNA analysis , and endless cross-referencing of the genomes of organisms from the three — or perhaps four — domains of life , a fuller concept of viruses and their role in evolution has begun to coalesce .
In the mere year and a half since Bradfordcoccus 's true identity was revealed , more genetically distinct and extremely ancient viruses have been found .
All of them lead scientists to the same conclusion : Evolution 's archvillain looks more and more like its vital and formative force .
Even as Darwinism has come under attack from the theology of the intelligent design movement , scientists have never been closer to divining life 's origins .
With DNA evidence as solid as that used to convict criminals , researchers can trace the shared genetic lineage of life 's different branches back to the very base of the tree , some 4 billion years ago , when the interaction between primordial bacteria and viruses culminated in the " mother cell , " the common ancestor of all life on Earth .
Although the remoteness and complexity of those events makes them difficult to piece together , viruses like Mimi are emerging as the key players in the picture .
" We are now able to draw a tree of life for the first time that includes viruses as their own branch , " says Patrick Forterre , a molecular biologist at the University of Paris - Sud .
Last July Forterre held a weeklong conference in Les Treilles , France , where two dozen of the world 's leading microbiologists , cell biologists , and evolutionary biologists met to discuss " The Origin of the Nucleus . "
The nucleus , the command - and - control center of the eukaryotic cell , is ultimately what distinguishes a human from a bacterium .
For eons prior to the emergence of the nucleated cell , life on Earth was essentially slime : vast , directionless mats of single - celled bacteria and archaea .
With no nucleus to further modify and craft gene expression and protein translation , life thrived but literally could not get hold of itself , could not assume new shapes or diversify .
How the first nucleus came to be is a question that has intrigued scientists ever since Scottish botanist Robert Brown first detected a cell nucleus while peering at orchids under a microscope one day in 1824 .
The discovery of Mimivirus lends weight to one of the more compelling theories discussed at Les Treilles .
Back when the three domains of life were emerging , a large DNA virus very much like Mimi may have made its way inside a bacterium or an archaean and , rather than killing it , harmlessly persisted there .
The eukaryotic cell nucleus and large , complex DNA viruses like Mimi share a compelling number of biological traits .
They both replicate in the cell cytoplasm , and on doing so , each uses the same machinery within the cytoplasm to form a new membrane around itself .
They both have certain enzymes for capping messenger RNA , and they both have linear chromosomes rather than the circular ones typically found in a bacterium .
" If this is true , " Forterre has said of the viral - nucleus hypothesis , " then we are all basically descended from viruses . "
Claverie says , " That 's quite a big jump in our thinking about viruses — to go from their not even being organisms to being all life 's ancestor . "
Some scientists go a step further .
They believe that viruses played a role even earlier in the evolutionary mix .
The precise order in which the three domains of life evolved — whether , say , the eukaryotes emerged before or after the archaea and bacteria — is a much - debated subject .
So is the identity of the progenitor of those different domains , the so - called last universal common ancestor , or LUCA , as it was dubbed by Forterre at the first Les Treilles conference in 1996 .
" I 'm probably one who has asserted most sternly that LUCA was viral , " says Luis Villarreal , the director of the Center for Virus Research at the University of California at Irvine .
" The genes and gene functions suggest that we 're dealing with one of the earliest and oldest forms of life .
Mimivirus really stretches our sense of scale of what a virus can be . "
But just how far can that scale be stretched ?
David Prangishvili , a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and a colleague with Forterre in studying viruses that infect archaea , now thinks that viruses swam in the primordial soup prior to the emergence of cellular life of any kind and only later became dependent on cells .
Forterre is less convinced .
" It is difficult for me to imagine , " he says .
" You need to have some type of closed system to be sure that the different reactants of the metabolism , or different mechanisms , can interact with each other and also have a kind of Darwinian evolution .
You need to have individuals .
I think there was an RNA world prior to the DNA world , when you had a lot of RNA cells .
Maybe viruses originated at the time of the RNA cell .
You need to have a cell to even obtain a virus . "
Yet to virologists like Prangishvili and Villarreal , the concept of viruses as the primordial soup 's first built - in stirrers seems to align perfectly with their nature : high creative replication , genetic reproduction , and sorting of gene fragments , not to mention their eerie biochemical straddle between life and non life .
" I think what confuses people is their assumption that parasites are only damaging things , " says Villarreal .
" How do you get creation and complexity out of them ?
You do because they persist , and to do that you have to take on all comers .
You come up with inventions that prevent you from being displaced .
It 's no surprise that the number - one - selling software on the planet these days claims to be ' antiviral . ' "
Information , whether biological or industrial , is passed along by replication .
Create a new word - processing file and copy it : that 's replication .
But any replication process is susceptible to errors , which in turn can generate novelty .
And novelty , especially in harsh , shifting conditions like those that prevailed on the newly formed Earth , is often an advantage :
Some new life - forms will adapt better to the environment .
To the utter abhorrence of the proponents of intelligent design , there is a certain randomness to evolution .
Some viruses , like Ebola or the new avian influenza , are basically runaway replicators , effectively burning their own life bridges in the process .
But the majority , as Villarreal puts it , strive " to persist , not make a lot . "
Those that do persist eventually become both stable within , and staples of , evolution .
The overwhelming majority of viruses are not harmful to their hosts .
Each of us is infected with a huge array of viruses .
The human genome , considered as a mass , contains more retrovirus sequences than actual genes .
" They 're not doing anything , " says Villarreal .
" They 're just persisting .
And they were around long before humans evolved .
The better part of the human genome is composed of viral DNA .
That 's true of nearly all eukaryotes , and the more complicated the organisms , the more of those sequences you have .
We are n't sure exactly what they all do , but they are part of our genetic identity , this stuff we dismiss as junk .
' Junk ' and ' parasite ' are both words that will get you into a fight if you use them improperly .
And yet they are where all life 's creativity lies — its very origins . "
What was the very first bit of life 's biochemical code , and where did it come from ?
It may be no surprise to learn that viruses figure ever more prominently into this line of speculation .
Some researchers go so far as to suggest that the very first life on Earth could have arrived in the form of a viral shard from afar , perhaps conveyed in the pore of a meteorite .
" Well , I used to laugh at the idea , " says Mark Young , a Montana State University biologist who leads a research team that gathers new archaeal viruses from superhot aquatic environments in Yellowstone National Park and other places around the world .
" But I would n't say it 's absurd anymore .
I think it has to at least be kept in the portfolio of the discussion . "
Where researchers do agree is that a nearly immeasurable array of viruses remain to be discovered on this planet .
A growing number of virologists and biologists are out to catalog them .
Both Claverie 's and Raoult 's labs have already begun searching for more viruses like Mimivirus .
Among the most likely sites are algae , the ocean , and of course , cooling towers .
Claverie says he sees no good reason why there can't be viruses bigger than Mimi .
" I 'm hoping Mimi is n't the only one of its kind on Earth , " he says , " especially since that cooling tower in Bradford has been destroyed .
But it can't be the only one .
That would be ridiculously lucky for it to have just fallen into our lap . "
Meanwhile , Young has been finding new archaeal viruses every time he looks for them .
Asked why Mimivirus had n't been discovered sooner , he says it may come down to the simple fact that we just have n't been looking .
" We have n't even begun to scratch the surface .
The numbers are mind - boggling .
If you put every virus particle on Earth together in a row , they would form a line 10 million light - years long .
People , even most biologists , do n't have a clue .
The general public thinks genetic diversity is us and birds and plants and animals and that viruses are just HIV and the flu .
But most of the genetic material on this planet is viruses .
No question about it .
They and their ability to interact with organisms and move genetic material around are the major players in driving speciation , in determining how organisms even become what they are . "
We have been looking for our designer in all the wrong places .
It seems we owe our existence to viruses , the least of semi-living forms , and about the only thing they have in common with any sort of theological prime mover is their omnipresence and invisibility .
Once again , viruses have altered the way that we view them and , by extension , ourselves .
As it turns out , they are not the little breakaway shards of our biology — we are , of theirs .
Meditation has been practiced for centuries , as a way to calm the soul and bring about inner peace .
According to a new study in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , there is now evidence that a specific method of meditation may temporarily boost our visuospatial abilities ( for example , the ability to retain an image in visual memory for a long time ) .
That is , the meditation allows practitioners to access a heightened state of visual - spatial awareness that lasts for a limited period of time .
Normally when we see something , it is kept in our visual short - term memory for only a brief amount of time ( images will begin to fade in a matter of seconds ) .
However , there have been reports of Buddhist monks who have exceptional imagery skills and are able to maintain complex images in their visual short - term memory for minutes , and sometimes even hours .
Led by psychologist Maria Kozhevnikov of George Mason University , a team of researchers investigated the effects of different styles of Buddhist meditation on visuospatial skills .
The researchers focused on two styles of meditation : Deity Yoga ( DY ) and Open Presence ( OP ) .
During DY meditation , the practitioner focuses intently on an image of deity and his or her entourage .
This requires coming up with an immensely detailed , three - dimensional image of the deity , and also focusing on the deity 's emotions and environment .
In contrast , practitioners of OP meditation believe that pure awareness cannot be achieved by focusing on a specific image and therefore , they attempt to evenly distribute their attention while meditating , without dwelling on or analyzing any experiences , images , or thoughts that may arise .
In these experiments , experienced DY or OP meditation practitioners along with nonmeditators participated in two types of visuospatial tasks , testing mental rotation abilities ( e.g. , being able to mentally rotate a 3 - D structure ) and visual memory ( e.g. , being shown an image , retaining it in memory and then having to identify it among a number of other , related images ) .
All of the participants completed the tasks , meditators meditated for 20 minutes , while others rested or performed non-meditative acitivities , and then completed a second round of the tasks .
The results revealed that all of the participants performed similarly on the initial set of tests , suggesting that meditation does not result in an overall , long - lasting improvement of visuospatial abilities .
However , following the meditation period , practitioners of the DY style of meditation showed a dramatic improvement on both the mental rotation task and the visual memory task compared to OP practitioners and controls .
These results indicate that DY meditation allows practitioners to access greater levels of visuospatial memory resources , compared to when they are not meditating .
The authors state that this finding " has many implications for therapy , treatment of memory loss , and mental training . "
Although , they conclude , future studies will need to examine if these results are specific to DY meditation , or if these effects can also occur using other visual meditation techniques .
A Drayton Valley woman who was on an exchange trip with a local Rotary Club has been kidnapped in Nigeria .
Ross Tyson , the District Governor of Rotary International , says Julie Mulligan was kidnapped while in Nigeria on Thursday .
She and four other Canadians went to Nigeria for a Rotary Club exchange program .
Tyson says the four others who were with Mulligan were rushed out of the region following her abduction .
" Our concern , our biggest concern , is Julie at this point and we 'll make decisions pursuant to that , " he said .
Mulligan , a married mother of two , was taking part in a group study program , something Tyson says the Rotary Club has been doing for decades .
The woman 's employer , Sunlife Financial confirms that Julie Mulligan was kidnapped .
However , they say she was not on a company business trip at the time .
Lisa Monette , a spokesperson with the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade , says that they are in touch with local authorities in Nigeria " with a view to securing release of the Canadian national . "
They confirm a Canadian is missing and presumed kidnapped in Nigeria , but they wo n't confirm her identity .
CTV
News spoke to Mulligan 's family members , but they say they have no comment at this time .

Office Christmas Tree : Modelling in xLights
Time to catch up on my blogging plans for this project before moving on to the next one .
The next step in the process was to create a model of my Christmas tree in xLights so that xLights knows how it looks , then create some simple sequences to be run when the status of builds in Jenkins changes .
The Big Thaw
The Arctic ’s permafrost contains twice as much carbon as the atmosphere .
But as global temperatures rise , the frozen ground is melting fast and releasing greenhouse gases .
Are we trapped in a deadly cycle ?
Keep Radio Free for Listeners
For nearly a century , local radio stations have been providing listeners with the music they love and artists a platform to share their music with fans .
And when disaster strikes , listeners turn to their local stations first for emergency updates to keep safe .
No doubt , local radio stations are the pulse of our communities  but their future is in jeopardy .
Big foreign - owned record labels are asking Congress to tax radio simply for airing and promoting artists ' music .
This means less music for you and fewer jobs for your community .
A performance tax would financially cripple local stations , potentially forcing some stations off the air .
It would also reduce the amount of music played on stations and harm new artists trying to start their careers .
If you 're one of the 272 million listeners who turn to radio each week to get the news , information and music you want for free , find out how you can help .
LA PLATA .-
Fue la primera vez que Santiago Gori , taxista desde hace 31 años en esta ciudad , encontró en su vehículo 130 mil pesos y , pese a que su condición económica no es la mejor que pudiera tener , sin dudarlo los devolvió a su dueño .
El miércoles , a las 20.30 , un matrimonio subió a su automóvil y le pidió que lo llevara a la intersección de 48 y 3 .
Una vez que lo pasajeros se bajaron en un lugar que el conductor no observó , una cuadra después del destino inicial , Gori continuó su recorrida por las calles platenses sin notar que en el asiento trasero había quedado una peque ña mochila .
Fue la siguiente usuaria la que le advirtió que ese equipaje estaba allí olvidado .
Cuando el conductor lo revisó se encontró con fajas de dólares y pesos que , después se enteraría , sumaban 130 mil pesos .
Primero se asustó , según contó a LA NACION , pero luego , reconociendo que ese dinero no era suyo y poniéndose en el lugar de quien lo había perdido , revisó la mochila y allí encontró un documento de identidad con una dirección local .
Acompañado de su esposa y del más pequeño de sus hijos se acercó al lugar , que finalmente era la del primo de Carlos Tuniriello , el propietario del dinero .
Se comunicó con él telefónicamente , facilitado por el familiar , porque ya estaba haciendo la denuncia del extravío en la comisaría 1 a. de La Plata .
" Cuando lo llamé se quedó en silencio , como temeroso " , recordó Gori , aunque ya en la seccional le dijo que " era un santo " y tanto él como el comisario le agradecieron por el gesto de honestidad que había tenido .
Según le comentó Tuniriello , ese dinero provenía de la venta de una propiedad .
El taxista , vecino de Los Hornos , trabaja todos los días , desde los 18 años , en dos lugares distintos para llevar adelante la economía de su familia y la construcción de su propia vivienda .
Al principio , complementaba su labor en el taxi con la conducción de un colectivo de línea .
Aunque es muy frecuente que la gente olvide billeteras , contó , nunca le había pasado de hallar tanta cantidad .
Por estos días , Gori trabaja paralelamente en el Sindicato de Camioneros platense .
Pese a que el Código Civil , en su artículo 2533 , reconoce que el que encuentra una cosa perdida tiene derecho a una recompensa por ese hallazgo , a Gori no le importó no haber recibido una suma de dinero en gratitud .
" Le juro que esa noche dormí tranquilo " , le dijo a la cronista .
NLTK vs MontyLingua Part of Speech Taggers
This is a comparison of the part of speech taggers available in python .
As far as I know , these are the most prominent python taggers .
Let me know if you think another tagger should be added to the comparison .
MontyLingua includes several natural language processing ( NLP ) tools .
The ones that I used in this comparison were the stemmer , tagger , and sentence tokenizer .
The Natural Language Toolkit ( NLTK ) is another set of python tools for natural language processing .
It has a much greater breadth of tools than MontyLingua .
It has taggers , parsers , tokenizers , chunkers , and stemmers .
It usually has a few different implementations of each providing different options to their users .
In the case of stemmers , they have the Punkt and WordNet stemmers .
Both of these tools are written to aid in NLP using Python .
Taggers
For those that do n’t know , a tagger is a NLP tool that will mark the part of speech of a word .
Example :
Input : “ A dog walks ”
Output : “ A / DT dog / NN walks / VB Z ”
The meanings of the tokens after the / can be found here .
For NLTK , I ’m comparing the built - in tagger to MontyLingua .
I did n’t do any training at all and just called nltk.tag.pos_tag ( ) .
I used the taggers mostly as is , with some slight modifications .
I added a RegExp tagger in front of the NLTK tagger , and make the default tagger the backoff tagger .
It will mark A , An , and The as DT always .
It was annoying and messing up my results to have them marked as NNP .
They were capitalized , and I suppose the tagger thought they were either initials or proper names .
MontyLingua on the other hand was always marking “ US ” as a pronoun .
This was a problem when scanning sentences that said “ US Pint ” or “ US Gallon . ”
I look at the word before “ US ” and see if it ’s an article , if it is I allow it to continue being processed .
Neither tagger is perfect , but it becomes clear that one may be better than the other for my use - case .
It may be different for yours .
I ’m scanning sentences from the web .
Stemmers
A stemmer is a tool that will take a word with a suffix attached to it , and return the ‘ stem ’ or base word of it .
Example :
Input : dogs
Output : dog
While neither stemmer is perfect , they both do a decent job .
MontyLingua is more inclined to take the ‘ S ’ off the end of something , and the NLTK WordNetLemmatizer does n’t always take it off .
‘ Cows ’ is an example of a word the WordNetLemmatizer will not stem to ‘ Cow ’ but MontyLingua will .
On the other hand , MontyLingua is more likely to take the ‘ S ’ off the end of an acronym , and I wrote code to correct that in some cases .
If a word is less than 4 characters or all consonants , I do n’t run it on the MontyLingua stemmer .
The all consonants is to catch some acronyms .
While using MontyLingua on a specific part of speech it ’s important to specify whether it ’s a noun or a verb with the ‘ pos ’ parameter .
Since I ’m only stemming nouns , I used pos= ’ noun ’ .
Results
The first results do n’t only reflect a change in taggers , but changes in the stemmer and sentence tokenizer also .
I did another comparison using the MontyLingua tagger with the NLTK stemmer and sentence tokenizer for comparison .
A phrase found by one algorithm and not by another is shown first .
They both were able to find some words that were not found by the other .
Hits is the number of times a phrase comes up , it is displayed only if there is a discrepancy .
If MontyLingua and NLTK both found a phrase but found it a different number of times , that is reflected there .
The first numbers are totals for every discrepancy summed .
There is also a graph below showing how many of each difference there is .
For example there were 157 times that there was a discrepancy of 1 hit and MontyLingua came out on top .
There were 78 times the number of hits were different by 1 and NLTK had more .
An interesting one is there was one time MontyLingua had one word with 40 hits more than NLTK .
That word was elephant .

At the end of the day , I ’ll be using the MontyLingua toolchain with some slight modifications I ’ve made ( mentioned above ) .
I ’m definitely still using NLTK , just for different tasks .
NLTK has a great and easy to use regexp chunker that I ’ll continue to use .
Again , a tagger ’s performace can vary greatly based on the data used to train and test it .
I was testing them on about 12,000 webpages I downloaded and looking for specific phrases .
On a different data set NLTK may turn out to be better .
We asked hundreds of people how much they like being caressed on various parts of their body , and how exciting it is to touch different places on their lovers .
Their answers , a total of 33,871 ratings covering 707 points on male and female bodies , provide a collective portrait of desire .

About our method
Image from sciam.com
I do n’t want to die , and being an atheist I have to engage in far more contortions than the average person to convince myself that I can avoid this fate .
But I do n’t think avoiding death is that much of a stretch .
I think in the not - too - distant future , people under 40 or so , with the financial means to buy something along the lines of an expensive home , have a good chance of living forever .
This will happen by the simple process of mapping and transferring the contents of the human brain to an electronic form , and then back into another body ( or maybe that ’ll be old - school by then ) 1 .
I do n’t mean to diminish the difficulty of doing this , but given how quickly we ’re making advances in understanding the brain , combined with our computational achievements , I ’d say this is entirely feasible within the next 25 - 50 years .
So here ’s how this would play out : you ’re upper middle class in 30 years ( say you ’re around 65 , like I will be ) and your body is breaking down .
You go into your friendly regional LifeLease Inc. location and you start the process of getting a body swap .
You basically pay for two pieces : the new body , and the transfer of your brain ’s information , i.e. your identity .
Some may say , “ Well , that ’d just be a copy of you , not the real you . ”
Perhaps , but that ’s the case for you today vs. yesterday as well .
Our memories are our identity , and our memories are constantly overwritten , destroyed , and modified from one time to the next .
So , quite literally , you are not the same person you were yesterday .
From moment to moment , day to day , and year to year , you are an altered copy of who you used to be .
We consider this normal , and in time the transfer of our identities ( even with some loss ) will be considered normal as well .
So , once the system becomes mature , and barring major problems with the fidelity of the transfer , a bit of loss is n’t going to be a major issue .
Your new self wo n’t really care .
The changes will simply be a bit of uniqueness added to the package .
They ’ll probably have “ fill in ” packs available anyway –for those pesky dark spots .
It ’s really not that fantastic , if you consider what we ’re already able to do .
The real problem is going to be the ethics around the replacement bodies , not the ability to download and transfer the identity information .
Anyway , to all you fellow atheists out there : chin up .
We accept that our identities reside within our brains , so all we have to do is survive long enough to see science develop the ability to download them and transfer them to other bodies .
Then we can live forever .
We do n’t need no steenkin’ god to achieve immortality . ::

CANNABIS CULTURE –
How the human race enhanced the cannabis plant … and how it returned the favor .
“ Whatever THC ’s original purpose may have been , as soon as a certain primate with a gift for experiment and horticulture stumbled on its psychoactive properties , the plant ’s evolution embarked on a new trajectory , guided from then on by that primate and his desires . ” – Michael Pollan , The Botany of Desire [ 1 ]
“ Coevolution ” is a concept described by Darwin [ 2 ] but first fleshed - out and defined in 1964 by insect scientist ( entomologist ) Paul Ehrlich and botanist Peter Raven , in their paper “ Butterflies and plants : a study in coevolution ” . [ 3 ]
Put simply , coevolution is where two different living species help each other adapt and evolve by influencing each other .
Can one argue that this is occurring between cannabis and humans ?
Certainly , the partnership has been good for cannabis .
Once confined to central Asia , cannabis has been distributed by humans to all four corners of the globe .
Different cannabis species have developed due to human selection for industrial , nutritional or medicinal traits .
Cannabis has become a stronger , more diverse , more adaptive and more widely - cultivated plant as a result of it ’s relationship with us . [ 4 ]
Can the same thing be said for humans ?
What has the plant done for us ?
Hemp seeds do happen to be the best food in the world for humans . [ 5 ]
Nice of cannabis to evolve into a plant which produces seeds that contain all the essential fatty acids required for complete human health in the exact ratios required by humans .
Coincidence ?
Or was the plant trying to get our attention somehow ?
Also worth mentioning : cannabis may have been our first rope and fabric [ 6 ] , our first “ true ” paper [ 7 ] , and one of our first medicines . [ 8 ]
The list of physical and mental medicinal actions that cannabis is involved in is a long one , and would take many pages to properly outline it ’s entire scope .
Suffice to say cannabis medicines may replace up to half of all synthetic medicines when fully researched . [ 9 ]
Then there ’s that cannabis high .
Truth be told , the economic and social desires to understand and obtain this high was a major impetus for the creation of Cannabis Culture Magazine .
To a certain extent , it is the insights gathered during these moments of highness that have most deeply effected human culture .
As psychonaut / poet Allen Ginsberg put it ; “ the vast majority all over the world … adjust to the strangely familiar sensation of time slowdown , and explore this new space through natural curiosity , report that it ’s a useful area of mind - consciousness to be familiar with ” . [ 10 ]
Without attempting to list everything , what are some of the results of the insights found during the “ time - slow cannabis high ” [ 11 ] on human mental and cultural evolution ?
On the less controversial side of things : pot-smoking piano players in the whorehouses of Storyville in New Orleans brought the world Jazz music . [ 12 ]
Most , if not all of , the decent rock and reggae music after 1965 was composed while the artists were high – and probably over half of the best rap music . [ 13 ]
The best comedy of the last twenty or thirty years ?
Potheads . [ 14 ]
The personal computer and much of the decent software in this world ?
Potheads . [ 15 ]
The best writers and poets ?
Potheads . [ 16 ]
And I think it ’s safe to say a very large percentage of professional athletes – especially NBA and Snowboarding athletes – had their professional performances enhanced when high – or by what they had learned while high . [ 17 ]
But let ’s also speak more controversially : there is strong evidence Shakespeare [ 18 ] and Jesus [ 19 ] were also really , really high .
The evidence for Jesus was that the holy “ Christ / Messiah ” anointing oil that was used during his baptism and for the healing miracles and duties of him and his apostles .
The evidence for Shakespeare was that his pipes were full of cannabis resins .
In fact , its fair to say that cannabis has had a profound effect on the minds of those behind many religions [ 20 ] and much of modern theater – which now also embraces Hollywood . [ 21 ]
Say what you want about the benefits and drawbacks of religion and Hollywood , but you have to admit that the insight - filled “ time - slow cannabis high ” has been part of the process of human cultural evolution .
Religion has brought us the Golden Rule .
Hollywood brought us “ They Live ” , “ Brazil ” , and “ Blade Runner ” .
Ultimately , humans have benefited from both relationships .
At the risk of endorsing animal experiments , which I almost always find completely useless in being able to tell anything relevant about human behavior ( not to mention cruel ) , there has been a notable discovery from animal experiments regarding the cannabinoid receptors which may shed some light on the “ insight ” side of the high .
In an article titled “ Evaluation of CB1 receptor knockout mice in the Morris water maze ” by Varvel and Lichtman [ 22 ] , scientists took mice that had their cannabinoid receptors genetically “ knocked out ” – “ knockout mice ” – and put them in a tank of water with a small platform , comparing their performance in finding this platform with mice which still had their cannabinoid receptors .
As it turns out , the regular mice could learn to search out the platform when it was moved but the knockout mice could only learn where the platform was once .
The knockouts could not relearn it ’s new position when the platform was moved .
This means that cannabinoid receptors have something vital to do with memory and problem solving .
Dr. Robert Melamede has reflected on the water maze experiments and suggests there are FLPs and BLPs – Forward Looking People and Backward Looking People – the BLP ’s missing out on some cannabinoid - related brain activity .
Perhaps the BLP brains do n’t produce enough cannabinoids on their own .
According to Dr. Melamede , the extremely backward - thinking people such outgoing president Bush are the human equivalent of knockout mice . [ 23 ]
Perhaps if there was more pot smoking and less drinking going on in the White House , there would be less war and monopoly capitalism and more sustainable growth and wealth - sharing .
You never know until you try .
Hopefully , this “ knockout mice drown – CB1 receptors are important ” info will empower scientists to stop drowning rodents and turn their attention to the study of well - cannabinized human subjects in their natural setting – like an Easy Star All - Stars concert or something .
Maybe the researchers just need to smoke a bit more pot in order to become “ forward - looking ” enough to see how inhuman , insufficient and wasteful animal testing ultimately is .
Clearly , the huge bibliography of anecdotal evidence outlined above of humans using cannabis in natural settings points towards much insight and creativity gained from cannabis use .
Combined with all the evidence of the medical , nutritional and industrial uses , it can be said that humans have benefited much from cannabis , and it has benefited much from us .
This is a “ win-win ” form of coevolution known as “ mutualistic symbiosis ” .
Other questions then arise : how far back does this relationship go ?
And where is it headed ?
Gardens Long Ago
Our fathers planted gardens long ago …
Whose fruits we reap with joy today ;
Their labor constitutes a debt we owe …
Which to our heirs we must repay ;
For all crops sown in any land …
Are destined for a future man .
Arab Poet – Nizami
There are no cannabis fossils on record . [ 24 ]
Cannabis probably arrived on planet earth about 34 million years ago , an estimate based upon the seven shared parasites with Cannabis ’s “ sister group ” the Urticaceae ( nettle ) family and the lack of any shared parasites with cannabis ’s “ cousin ” the Moraceae ( mulberry / fig ) family . [ 25 ]
The first cannabis farmers ?
Nobody knows that for sure .
What we do know is that there is evidence of cannabis pressed into pottery from 12,000 years ago from Taiwan – at the beginning of the Neolithic era ( the age of farming ) .
In a footnote to his 1977 book “ The Dragons of Eden – Speculations on the Origin of Human Intelligence ” , Carl Sagan pointed out that cannabis is the only crop of the Pygmies , and posited that “ It would be wryly interesting if in human history the cultivation of marijuana led generally to the invention of agriculture , and thereby to civilization . ”
We also know that as early as 1.75 million years ago Homo erectus migrated into Asia , where cannabis is thought to originate . [ 26 ]
Some time between 1.8 million and 1 million years ago early humans learned to control fire . [ 27 ]
Did they sit around hemp fires and get a whiff of that cannabis smoke while they “ chewed the fat ” from a recent hunt ?
Is this how we invented language ?
It ’s even possible that earlier primates or mammals went after the cannabis seeds and then began distributing a few of the unchewed seeds in nice neat little piles of fertilizer a day ’s worth of travel away .
I am told that human feces makes poor fertilizer … maybe ape droppings fertilizer is better ?
In his book “ Intoxication ” , Author Ronald K. Siegel records cannabis self - administration by different animals .
Mice , rats and birds would get intoxicated in the process of obtaining hemp seeds .
Monkeys have been observed snacking on the top leaves of plants in South American pot farms . [ 28 ]
Endocannabinoids , the things that your body produces to get you high , are a lot older than humans .
They are found in primates , mammals birds , amphibians , fish , sea urchins , molluscs , leeches and the Hydra vulgaris – a primitive water creature that never ages .
Scientists estimate the first endocannabinoids are over 600 million years old . [ 29 ]
There is a theory – the “ vestigial receptor hypothesis ” , that states that the proto cannabinoid receptor evolved in primitive organisms before the division of animals and plants – about a billion years ago . [ 30 ]
It ’s an obvious over - simplification , but it ’s quite possible that a nettle - like plant had a mutation which reactivated it ’s cannabinoid genes and began to ooze THC , which intoxicated and confused animal threats , allowing the mutant plant to survive pests .
It ’s intoxication may have eventually attracted other animal which the mutant plant hitched a ride with , making the proto - cannabis plant more able to spread it ’s seed around .
Over millions of years plants have mutated and evolved to have shapes and petals and smells and fruits and nectar , all of which have acted as enticements and rewards for their animal partners .
There is even an ant - fungi relationship where the ants take care of the fungus and the fungus helps break down the ant ’s food . [ 31 ]
The cannabis - human relationship is just like the bee - flower relationship or the ant - fungus relationship – a pair of fauna and flora helping each other out – except in our case it ’s a bit more complex .
The future of human - cannabis coevolution
“ Obama supports the rights of states and local governments to make this choice — though he believes medical marijuana should be subject to [ U.S. Food and Drug Administration ] regulation like other drugs , ” LaBolt said .
He said the FDA should consider how marijuana is regulated under federal law , while leaving states free to chart their own course . ” – Jacub Sullum [ 32 ]
While a few of the more insane and powerful amongst us want cannabis eliminated from planet earth , more than half of us humans respect , enjoy and revere this plant and appreciate what it has to offer – including , hopefully , the new US President .
With any luck cannabis is here to stay … at least in some form .
What is ahead for the evolution of cannabis ?
Our influence on the plant is increasing more and more each day as new breeders seek out different traits .
Expect more breakthroughs in breeding for traits we value – such as specific tastes , smells , colors and of course physical and mental effects .
Breeding for different effects holds great potential for increasing cannabis ’s value to us .
I expect some day soon we will all be able to walk into any cannabis compassion club or cafe and select from strains named “ Munchies ” , “ Giggles ” , “ Pain - B - Gone ” , “ Sleep ” , “ Wake Up ” , “ 20 minuteOrgasm ” and the ever - popular “ Fantasia - On - The - Big - Screen ” .
And what is ahead for human evolution ?
The medicinal and nutritional advantages to the human race provided by cannabis are massive .
If it was reintroduced into our diets and medicine cabinets to it ’s full potential , it could very well help humans evolve into a stronger and more physically and mentally healthy race of beings .
If we humans can overcome the monopolists who control our government and succeed in defeating the monopoly of cannabis production and distribution outside AND within our own community , there might be millions of jobs of cannabis farming , cannabis gardening , cannabis breeding and cannabis retailing that will open up to people of modest means .
Other profitable botanical medicines may also be re-examined for their utility , and increase number of people working within the emerging herbal health - care and soft - drug tourism economies .
Cannabis could very well help humans evolve beyond poverty .
The economic potential of cannabis could be further expanded by realizing cannabis is the best fuel crop in the world for ethanol production .
Some estimate that legal hemp ethanol would cost 15 cents per liter or 50 cents per gallon at the pump ! [ 33 ]
Cannabis even grows in sand ! [ 34 ]
The fact it can grow almost anywhere will increase the areas we can grow fuel in and help us reclaim desert regions for food and fuel production .
If cannabis was no longer over - regulated , it could easily compete with and replace the oil - spill causing , oil - war causing , climate - change causing fossil fuels – not to mention making up a large percentage of the sustainable lubrication oils , varnishes , vegi-plastics , pressed fiber board and concrete building materials of the future .
This would go a long way in helping humans … not just to evolve , but to survive .
Finally , an end to the drug war and an honest evaluation of it ’s racist and monopolistic origins may help humans evolve past the point of using scapegoating as a method of social control .
Evolving from “ Homo Sapien Beat - eachother - uppus ” to “ Homo Sapien learn - to - share - the - stuffus ” is quite possibly the greatest evolutionary step we could ever make .
It ’s certainly now or never .
Lacking the massive amount of data needed to be able to call cannabis our “ co-evolutionary partner in mutualistic symbiosis ” , ancient humans simply referred to it as “ the tree of life ” and left it at that .
Whatever we call it , we must re-legalize this plant and learn to share it now , while a slightly saner type of human is at the helm of the free world .
We must not let this opportunity pass , allowing some other anti-cannabis and / or pro-monopolist president to regain the White House and continue a war on our coevolutionary plant partner .
We must not let the cannabis war threaten to bring our own evolution to a painful halt .
And we must not let the drug war act upon us as a form of “ unnatural selection ” , choosing only the most obedient , dull and misinformed to provide us with the future generation , leaving the forward - looking people to rot in jail , suffer the indignity of “ treatment ” for their intelligent preferences , and / or languish in artificial , tyrant - imposed poverty .

Once again as before trying to legislate by press release and blog posting , the TSA has asserted that it has the general law - enforcement authority to detain would - be airline passengers , seize their possessions , and compel them to answer questions — for reasons entirely unrelated to aviation or security , and even when it cannot articulate any probable cause for a belief that any law has been violated .
These new assertions come in response to an incident in which a passenger attempted to bring a locked metal cash box as part of their carry - on baggage on a domestic flight .
Since the box was opaque to x-rays , the TSA staff at the checkpoint at Lambert Airport in St. Louis asked the traveler to open the box so that they could check whether it contained any prohibited or dangerous items , and took him into a private room to do so .
So far , OK .
Commenters in the TSA blog , including jewel dealers , point out that many types of valuables must be carried on ( because they are exempt from airline liability if placed in checked baggage ) and that they do n’t want them inspected in public , where other people might learn what they are carrying .
In the back room , the traveler unlocked the box , and the TSA agents verified that it contained only cash ( approximately $ 4,700 ) , checks , and other documents .
No weapons or explosives , and nothing even arguably prohibited , dangerous , contraband , or illegal .
That should have been the end of the screening .
Instead of letting the traveler go on through the checkpoint , however , the TSA then called the local police .
It ’s unclear if the TSA actually detained the traveler or kept custody of his cash box and its contents while waiting for the police , or if he could have left the airport ( with or without his money and checks ) before the police arrived , but it ’s clear that they would n’t have allowed him to continue past the checkpoint to his flight .
Once the police arrived , the police and the TSA together informed the traveler that he was under detention and not free to leave , and interrogated the traveler about his employment , the reasons for his trip to St. Louis , the ownership and source of the money and checks ( which in fact were the proceeds from a political event , which thus contained information protected by the First Amendment about acts of assembly and association by the writers of the checks ) , and other issues unquestionably unrelated to weapons , explosives , or aviation security .
The traveler responded to each of these questions , calmly and politely , by asking , “ Am I required by law to answer that question ? ”
None of the TSA staff or police would answer this question , nor have they subsequently done so .
Instead , they told him that possession of cash and failing to answer their questions was “ suspicious ” , and threatened to keep him under detention and “ take him downtown ” to be questioned further by the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) .
After about 25 minutes , and after some conversation out of his hearing between the agents and an unidentified person in plain clothes , the traveler was told he was free to go .
He made his plane , with his cash box and its contents .
We know all this because the traveler , Steve Bierfeldt , covertly recorded all but the start of the incident on his iPhone .
There ’s more about the incident , including interviews with Mr. Bierfeldt , in these reports from Fox News and the Washington Times .
And in case you are wondering , the incident occurred in Missouri , where the law permits any party to a converstion to record it , even without the knowledge or consent of the other party or parties .
But the worst thing is n’t what the TSA did , but what it has subsequently claimed it has the right to do , and to compel would - be travelers to do .
According to the TSA blog :
Movements of large amounts of cash through the checkpoint may be investigated by law enforcement authorities if criminal activity is suspected .
As a general rule , passengers are required to cooperate with the screening process .
Cooperation may involve answering questions about their property , including why they are carrying a large sum of cash .
A passenger who refuses to answer questions may be referred to appropriate authorities for further inquiry .
In effect , the TSA is now claiming that they have general authority to :
Conduct searches not limited to a search for weapons , explosives , or dangerous items .
( This is implicit in the failure to desist from the search once it had been confirmed that the cash box contained only cash , checks , and documents , not weapons , explosives , or any items that could conceivably pose any danger to aviation . )
Detain would - be travelers , and / or prevent them from proceeding through checkpoints , even in the absence of any evidence whatsoever of a danger to aviation .
Compel travelers , as a condition of passage through the TSA checkpoint and travel by common carrier , to answer questions , apparently without limit and including questions clearly unrelated to aviation security .
Carrying cash in any amount , we should say from the start , is entirely legal .
There is a Federal law against carrying ( 1 ) more than $ 10,000 ( the police and / or TSA continued to detain Mr. Bierfeldt after counting the $ 4700 in his possession ) ( 2 ) across the US border in or out of the country ( Mr. Bierfeldt had a boarding pass for , and was attempting to board , a domestic flight ) , ( 3 ) without having declared it on a specified form to the Department of the Treasury ( which the TSA and police had no way to know if Mr. Bierfeldt had done , did n’t ask him about , and gave no indication that they had tried to find out ) .
In any event , this law is not policed or enforced by the DEA or the TSA .
What about the TSA ’s claim that “ As a general rule , passengers are required to cooperate with the screening process .
Cooperation may involve answering questions ” ?
In fact , there is no such “ rule ” in any publicly - disclosed law or regulation , nor any other law or regulation that gives the TSA general authority , at checkpoints or anywhere else , for warrentless search , detention , or compelled response to interrogation .
With respect to searches and denial of transportation , Federal law at 49 USC 44902 ( a ) allows an airline to refuse to transport :
( 1 ) a passenger who does not consent to a search under section 44901 ( a ) of this title establishing whether the passenger is carrying unlawfully a dangerous weapon , explosive , or other destructive substance ; or ( 2 ) property of a passenger who does not consent to a search of the property establishing whether the property unlawfully contains a dangerous weapon , explosive , or other destructive substance .
In addition , 49 USC 44902 ( b ) authorizes the denial of transportation to anyone or anything “ inimical to safety ” .
Nothing in either of these sections purports to grant any authority for search , to require consent for search , or to authorize denial of tranportation , except on the basis of safety .
There is simply no question that even if — in their incompetence — the TSA agents who called in the police had an erroneous but good - faith belief that there was any law against carrying cash , that had noting to do with safety .
At that moment , they had no authority to detain the traveler or prevent him from continuing through the checkpoint or boarding his flight .
TSA arrest authority derives from 49 USC 44903( d ) ( 2 ) :
[ The ] Secretary of Transportation may authorize an individual who carries out air transportation security duties– ( 2 ) to make arrests without warrant for an offense against the United States committed in the presence of the individual or for a felony under the laws of the United States , if the individual reasonably believes the individual to be arrested has committed or is committing a felony .
( Under the laws creating the TSA and DHS , this and other portions of the authority of the DOT and the Secretary of Transportation were transferred to the TSA , DHS , and the Secretary of Homeland Security . )
Under this section of law , TSA agents only have the authority to detain a traveler if they reasonably believe that the person either has committed a Federal crime in their presence , or has committed or is committing a Federal felony .
For the TSA to claim — as they now have — that the detention was justified , implies that they think ( 1 ) that mere possession of $ 4700 in cash , coupled with the exercise of the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent , actually led the TSA agent (s ) who called the police to believe that Mr. Bierfeldt had committed a Federal felony , or was committing a Federal crime in their presence , and ( 2 ) that such a mistaken belief was nevertheless , depite its falsehood , objectively reasonable .
It ’s conceivable , although unlikely , that the agent (s ) had such a belief .
But such a flagrantly erroneous belief , on the part of TSA officers , about what possessions are legal , and about the right to remain silent and the inferences which may permissably be made from the exercise of that right , cannot and should not be considered “ reasonable ” .
As for TSA authority to compel responses to interrogatories , Federal regulations at 49 CFR 1540.107 require that “ No individual may enter a sterile area or board an aircraft without submitting to the screening and inspection of his or her person and accessible property . ”
But “ submitting ” is a purely passive act , and the language clearly implies that screening is a physical act applied to objects ( “ person and accessible property ” ) .
It would be a strained reading of this regulation , and one that extends it beyond its statutory authority , to read mere “ submisison ” as including an affirmative obligation to respond to interrogatories .
49 CFR 1540.109 sets penalties for “ interfering ” with screening personnel .
But it would be equally strained ( and equally without statutory authority or Constitutionality ) to define the exercise of the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent as “ interference ” subject to legal sanctions , especially if the purported basis for the interrogation was a suspicion of criminal activity .
In issuing this regulation , the TSA specifically stated ( 67 FR 8344 , February 22 , 2002 ) that , “ This rule does not prevent good - faith questions from indivuduals seeking to understand the screening of their persons or their property . ”
Mr. Bierfeldt repeatedly told the officers detaining and interrogating him that he “ did n’t understand the law ” and was seeking their help in understanding whether he was legally obligated to answer their questions .
In upholding this regulation against a First Amendment challenge in 2005 , the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in its decision in Rendon v. TSA ( 424 F.3d 475 ) relied on this statement accompanying the issuance of the regulations , and on the fact that the traveler in that case , unlike Mr. Bierfeldt , had not confined himself to such questioning but had also engaged in “ disruptive ” shouting of expletives .
The issue of TSA interrogations has been an issue since the TSA began its SPOT program , and this is n’t the first time travelers have been required to answer questions from the TSA and / or police ( unrelated to weapons , explosives , or prohibited items ) before the TSA would allow them to exercise their right to travel .
To date , courts reviewing TSA actions have assumed that TSA searches were limited to searches for weapons , explosives , or other threats to avaition security .
Most recently , for example , the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2007 , en banc , that “ the scope of such searches is not limitless .
A particular airport security screening search is constitutionally reasonable provided that it ‘ is no more extensive nor intensive than necessary , in the light of current technology , to detect the presence of weapons or explosives [ ] [ and ] that it is confined in good faith to that purpose . ' ”
( USA v. Aukai , quoting US v. Davis , 9th Cir. 1973 , 482 F.2d at 913 ) .
We are unaware of any case law on the obligation to respond to TSA interrogation ( or police or third - party interrogation ) as a condition of passage through a TSA checkpoint .
We encourage those subjected to these new assertions of broader TSA authority to stand up for their rights .
Particle Physics Is Remarkably Consistent with Genesis
Aided by a supercomputer , an international team of theoretical physicists has recently performed a massive computation that confirmed Einstein ’s famous formula E=mc2 , which states that matter and energy interconvert .
Their research appears in the November 21 , 2008 , edition of the journal Science .
The study set out to provide a stronger theoretical basis for the Standard Model of particle physics .
Part of this model holds that the protons and neutrons inside atomic nuclei are made of quarks and gluons , which are theoretical particles of energy .
The researchers ’ quantitative calculations agreed very closely with the experimental observations that “ more than 99 percent of the mass of ordinary matter comes from protons and neutrons , and in turn about 95 percent of their mass comes from this confined energy . ”
1
Perhaps it is yet unknown what “ confines ” the energy , which thus produces mass , but this phenomenon seems consistent with ICR founder Dr. Henry M. Morris ’ commentary on Genesis 1:2 :
The “ Spirit ” ( Hebrew ruach ) of “ God ” ( Elohim ) proceeded to “ move upon the face of the waters ” ( literally , “ vibrate in the presence of the waters ” ) .
Waves of gravitational energy and waves of electro - magnetic energy began to pulse forth from the great “ Breath ” ( another meaning of ruach ) of God , the Prime Mover of the universe .
The unformed “ earth ” material ( Hebrew eretz ) , as well as the “ waters ” permeating it ( Hebrew shamayim ) quickly coalesced into spherical form under the new force of gravity , and the first material body ( Planet Earth ) had been formed at a point in space .
2
Several points can be drawn from the biblical account of creation .
Matter exists apart from God , as Genesis directly implies .
Matter is not currently being created ( just as the First Law of Thermodynamics states ) , since God ceased creative work on the seventh day .
3
And with this new study , scientists seem to have strong evidence that matter is made of energy , even as God energized His creation as recorded in Genesis 1:2 .
If indeed the Spirit of the Creator was emanating vibrating energy into the primeval universe , then perhaps the material of the universe still consists of that energy .
The investigation of the structure of matter is a valid pursuit within the creationist worldview , and so far no information gleaned from this pursuit has shown anything but concurrence with the Word of the Maker .

The Sudanese president Omer Hassan Al - Bashir said today that his government does not believe that there will be any peace or normalization with Israel .
Sudan official news Agency ( SUNA ) quoted Bashir as saying that “ our convictions that there will be no peace with Israel ” .
“ All these classifications on right wing , extremist right wing and leftist in Israel is nothing but role swapping to serve the Zionist agenda ” Bashir told a delegation of the World Popular Friendship committee .
“ The Arab world is a target of conspiracies and plots to target its resources ” and added that the Palestinian cause “ is the focal Arab issue ’ .
Bashir said his country believes that normalization with Israel “ will weaken the spirit of resistance among the Arab people ” .
Sudan does not recognize the Jewish state but it supported a Saudi proposal calling for normalization in return for lands occupied by Israel during the 1967 war .
The Sudanese information minister Al - Zahawi Malik claimed this week that his government was offered lifting of sanctions and normalization with the Western world in return for recognizing the state of Israel but that his country refused the offer .
Israel forcibly became part of Sudanese politics as hundreds of Darfuri refugees flowed across the Egyptian borders into the Jewish causing an embarrassment for Khartoum and dilemma for Tel Aviv .
The latter however granted some of the Sudanese refugees temporary residency .
The Sudan Liberation Movement ( SLM ) headed by Abdel - Wahid Al - Nur inaugurated an office in Israel and paid a visit to Tel Aviv this year .
Sudanese officials saw this as evidence of Israeli involvement in fueling the six years long Darfur conflict .
Last month it was revealed that Israel launched secret airstrikes inside Sudan against arm smugglers .
Khartoum has maintained silence over the incident saying it is still investigating the alleged and will take appropriate actions after findings are made .
Bashir said Sudan supports resistance forces in Iraq , Lebanon , Afghanistan and Gaza .
He hailed the Palestinian resistance against Israeli forces and determination to free the land from occupation .
Sudan has hosted a number of Palestinian militant groups including Hamas displaying public support to them .
Ironically in 2007 the Los Angeles Times quoting CIA officials said Sudan ’s intelligence is assisting them in spying against the insurgents in Iraq .
Sudan had assembled a network of informants in Iraq providing intelligence on the insurgency .
Some may have been recruited as they traveled through Khartoum .
Sudanese intelligence service has helped the US to attack the Islamic Courts positions in Somalia and to locate Al Qaeda suspects hiding there .

Over the years many hints have emerged that there might be life beyond Earth .
New Scientist looks at 10 of the most hotly - debated discoveries
This boulder - strewn field reaches to the horizon , nearly 2 miles distant from Viking Lander 2 ’s position on Mars ’ Utopian Plain .
Scientists believe the colours of the Martian surface and sky in this photo represent their true colours ( Image : NASA Langley Research Center )
1. 1976 , The Viking Mars landers detect chemical signatures indicative of life
Tests performed on Martian soil samples by NASA ’s Viking landers hinted at chemical evidence of life .
One experiment mixed soil with radioactive - carbon - labelled nutrients and then tested for the production of radioactive methane gas .
The test reported a positive result .
The production of radioactive methane suggested that something in the soil was metabolising the nutrients and producing radioactive gas .
But other experiments on board failed to find any evidence of life , so NASA declared the result a false positive .

Despite that , one of the original scientists – and others who have since re-analysed the data – still stand by the finding .
They argue that the other experiments on board were ill - equipped to search for evidence of the organic molecules – a key indicator of life .
2. 1977 , The unexplained extraterrestrial “ Wow ! ” signal is detected by an Ohio State University radio telescope
In August 1977 an Ohio State University radio telescope detected an unusual pulse of radiation from somewhere near the constellation Sagittarius .
The 37 - second - long signal was so startling that an astronomer monitoring the data scrawled “ Wow ! ” on the telescope ’s printout .
The signal was within the band of radio frequencies where transmissions are internationally banned on Earth .
Furthermore , natural sources of radiation from space usually cover a wider range of frequencies .
As the nearest star in that direction is 220 million light years away , either a massive astronomical event – or intelligent aliens with a very powerful transmitter would have had to have created it .
The signal remains unexplained .
3. 1996 , Martian “ fossils ” are discovered in meteorite ALH84001 from Antarctica
NASA scientists controversially announced in 1996 that they had found what appeared to be fossilised microbes in a potato - shaped lump of Martian rock .
The meteorite was probably blasted off the surface of Mars in a collision , and wandered the solar system for some 15 million years , before plummeting to Antarctica , where it was discovered in 1984 .
Careful analysis revealed that the rock contained organic molecules and tiny specs of the mineral magnetite , sometimes found in Earth bacteria .
Under the electron microscope , NASA researchers also claimed to have spotted signs of “ nanobacteria ” .
But since then much of the evidence has been challenged .
Other experts have suggested that the particles of magnetite were not so similar to those found in bacteria after all , and that contaminants from Earth are the source of the organic molecules .
A 2003 study also showed how crystals that resemble nanobacteria could be grown in the laboratory by chemical processes .
4. 2001 , More rigorous calculations connected to the 1960s “ Drake equation ” suggests that our galaxy may contain hundreds of thousands of life - bearing planets
In 1961 US radio astronomer Frank Drake developed an equation to help estimate the number of planets hosting intelligent life – and capable of communicating with us – in the galaxy .
The Drake equation multiplies together seven factors including : the formation rate of stars like our Sun , the fraction of Earth - like planets and the fraction of those on which life develops .
Many of these figures are open to wide debate , but Drake himself estimates the final number of communicating civilisations in the galaxy to be about 10,000 .
In 2001 , a more rigorous estimate of the number of life - bearing planets in the galaxy – using new data and theories – came up with a figure of hundreds of thousands .
For the first time , the researchers estimated how many planets might lie in the “ habitable zone ” around stars , where water is liquid and photosynthesis possible .
The results suggest that an inhabited Earth - like planet could be as little as a few hundred light years away .
5. 2001 , The red tinge of Jupiter ’s moon Europa proposed to be due to frozen bits of bacteria , which also helps explain the mysterious infrared signal it gives off
Alien microbes might be behind Europa ’s red tinge , suggested NASA researchers in 2001 .
Though the surface is mostly ice , data shows it reflects infrared radiation in an odd manner .
That suggests that something – magnesium salts perhaps – are binding it together .
But no one has been able to come up with the right combination of compounds to make sense of the data .
Intriguingly , the infrared spectra of some Earthly bacteria – those that thrive in extreme conditions – fits the data at least as well as magnesium salts .
Plus , some are red and brown in colour , perhaps explaining the moon ’s ruddy complexion .
Though bacteria might find it difficult to survive in the scant atmosphere and - 170 °C surface temperature of Europa , they might survive in the warmer liquid interior .
Geological activity could then spew them out periodically to be flash frozen on the surface .
6. 2002 , Russian scientists argue that a mysterious radiation - proof species of microbe may have evolved on Mars
In 2002 Russian astrobiologists claimed that super - hardy Deinococcus radiourans evolved on Mars .
The microbe can survive several thousand times the radiation dose that would kill a human .
The Russians zapped a population of the bacteria with enough radiation to kill 99.9 % , allowed the survivors to repopulate , before repeating the cycle .
After 44 rounds it took 50 times the original dose of radiation .
They calculated that it would take many thousands of these cycles to make common microbe E.coli as resilient as Deinococcus .
And on Earth it takes between a million and 100 million years to encounter each dose of radiation .
Therefore there just has not been enough time in life ’s 3.8 billion year history on Earth for such resistance to have evolved , they claim .
By contrast , the surface of Mars , unprotected by a dense atmosphere , is bombarded with so much radiation that the bugs could receive the same dose in just a few hundred thousand years .
The researchers argue that Deinococcus ’s ancestors were flung off of Mars by an asteroid and fell to Earth on meteorites .
Other experts remain sceptical .
7. 2002 , Chemical hints of life are found in old data from Venus probes and landers .
Could microbes exist in Venusian clouds ?
Life in Venus ’ clouds may be the best way to explain some curious anomalies in the composition of its atmosphere , claimed University of Texas astrobiologists in 2002 .
They scoured data from NASA ’s Pioneer and Magellan space probes and from Russia ’s Venera Venus - lander missions of the 1970s .
Solar radiation and lightning should be generating masses of carbon monoxide on Venus , yet it is rare , as though something is removing it .
Hydrogen sulphide and sulphur dioxide are both present too .
These readily react together , and are not usually found co-existing , unless some process constantly is churning them out .
Most mysterious is the presence of carbonyl sulphide .
This is only produced by microbes or catalysts on Earth , and not by any other known inorganic process .
The researchers ’ suggested solution to this conundrum is that microbes live in the Venusian atmosphere .
Venus ’s searing hot , acidic surface may be prohibitive to life , but conditions 50 kilometres up in the atmosphere are more hospitable and moist , with a temperature of 70 °C and a pressure similar to Earth .
8. 2003 , Sulphur traces on Jupiter ’s moon Europa may be the waste products of underground bacterial colonies
In 2003 , Italian scientists hypothesised that sulphur traces on Europa might be a sign of alien life .
The compounds were first detected by the Galileo space probe , along with evidence for a volcanically - warmed ocean beneath the moon ’s icy crust .
The sulphur signatures look similar to the waste - products of bacteria , which get locked into the surface ice of lakes in Antarctica on Earth .
The bacteria survive in the water below , and similar bacteria might also thrive below Europa ’s surface , the researchers suggest .
Others experts rejected the idea , suggesting that the sulphur somehow originates from the neighbouring moon
Io , where it is found in abundance .
9. 2004 , Methane in the Martian atmosphere hints at microbial metabolism
In 2004 three groups – using telescopes on Earth and the European Space Agency ’s Mars Express orbiting space probe – independently turned up evidence of methane in the atmosphere .
Nearly all methane in our own atmosphere is produced by bacteria and other life .
Methane could also be generated by volcanism , the thawing of frozen underground deposits , or delivered by comet impacts .
However , the source has to be recent , as the gas is rapidly destroyed on Mars or escapes into space .
In January 2005 , an ESA scientist controversially announced that he had also found evidence of formaldehyde , produced by the oxidation of methane .
If this is proved it will strengthen the case for microbes , as a whopping 2.5 million tonnes of methane per year would be required to create the quantity of formaldehyde postulated to exist .
There are ways to confirm the presence of the gas , but scientists will need to get the equipment to Mars first .
10 . 2004 , A mysterious radio signal is received by the SETI project on three occasions – from the same region of space
In February 2003 , astronomers with the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ( SETI ) project , used a massive telescope in Puerto Rico to re-examine 200 sections of the sky which had all previously yielded unexplained radio signals .
These signals had all disappeared , except for one which had become stronger .
The signal – widely thought to be the best candidate yet for an alien contact – comes from a spot between the constellations Pisces and Aries , where there are no obvious stars or planets .
Curiously , the signal is at one of the frequencies that hydrogen , the most common element , absorbs and emits energy .
Some astronomers believe that this is a very likely frequency at which aliens wishing to be noticed would transmit .
Nevertheless , there is also a good chance the signal is from a never - seen - before natural phenomenon .
For example , an unexplained pulsed radio signal , thought to be artificial in 1967 , turned out to be the first ever sighting of a pulsar .

In the wake of the weekend shooting incident in Oakland , in which four police officers were killed , tough questions are being asked about the relationship between the community and the police department .
The history of antipathy between many Oaklanders and law enforcement authorities is a long one , and currently tensions are once again high .
About 20 bystanders taunted police at the scene of the first shooting that left two motorcycle officers dead Saturday , and Craig 's List had postings asking people to celebrate in the streets if indeed it was announced that the officers had died .
People on cell phones jumped behind a reporter doing a live report at 5 p.m.
Saturday night yelling " F - - k the police ! "
Then , two women attempted to walk under the police line Saturday night at the hospital where all of the officers were taken and where a large crowd of uniformed police and family had gathered .
Their chant ?
" This is pay back for [ BART shooting victim ] Oscar Grant . "
Police quickly moved them back .
Now , many across the country are scratching their heads .
But many current and former Oakland residents can understand the sentiment , even if they do n't approve .
The Black Panther Party was formed back in 1966 specifically to stem violence against the African - American population by the Oakland Police Department .
Unfortunately , many of the demographic and cultural trends that sparked that movement have persisted .
For instance , none of the four officers shot actually lived in Oakland , with starting pay among the highest in California starting at more than $ 70,000 a year .
They patrol a wildly diverse city that is also beset by rampant poverty , with nearly 20 percent under the federal poverty line .
It lends the impression to many that their neighborhoods are patrolled by authorities with no investment in the community beyond crime and punishment .
Of the 45 officer - involved shootings from 2004 to 2008 , 44 were African - American or Hispanic .
However , African - Americans and Hispanics account for only 56 percent of the city 's population according to the 2000 census .
More troubling is that in only 60 percent of the police shootings was a weapon found on the suspect .
And in none of those shootings were any officers reprimanded .
That the incident started with a routine traffic stop may point to another trend that fuels resentment .
In an effort to reduce violent crime , the OPD began going after minor traffic infractions in 2003 in the hope of turning up outstanding warrants , drugs , guns or other more serious crimes .
But neighborhood residents saw it as a way to harass and intimidate a largely black and latino community , arresting many for mostly minor offenses and seizing hundreds of automobiles used to get to work and care for families .
It all adds up to the sense that parts of Oakland have become a permanent war zone pitting the cops against the citizens , regardless of the fact that it pits working people against each other in the struggle to make sense out of senseless violence .

Lawyers for Binyam Mohamed face the incredible prospect of a six - month jail sentence in America after writing a letter to President Obama detailing their client 's allegations of torture by US agents .
The privilege review team – officials from the US department of defence who monitor and censor communication between Guantánamo prisoners and their lawyers – have previously been accused of using their powers to suppress evidence of the abuse and mistreatment of detainees .
Clive Stafford Smith , director of legal charity Reprieve , and his colleague Ahmed Ghappour have been summoned to appear before a Washington court on May 11 after a complaint was made by the privilege review team .
Stafford Smith had written to the president after judges in the UK ruled against the release of US evidence detailing Mohamed 's alleged torture at Guantánamo .
The letter [ PDF ] asked the president to reconsider the US position and urged him to release the evidence into the public domain .
He attached a memo summarising the case because his US security clearance gives him access to the classified material .
In order to comply with classification guidelines , the memo did not identify individual officers by name or specify locations of the abuse .
He and Gappour submitted the memo to the privilege team for clearance but the memo was redacted to just the title , leaving the president unable to read it .
Stafford Smith included the redacted copy of the memo in his letter to illustrate the extent to which it had been censored .
He described it as a " bizarre reality " .
" You , as commander in chief , are being denied access to material that would help prove that crimes have been committed by US personnel .
This decision is being made by the very people who you command . "
The privilege team argue that by releasing the redacted memo Reprieve has breached the rules that govern Guantánamo lawyers and have made a complaint to the court of " unprofessional conduct " .
Stafford Smith described their actions as intimidation , saying the complaint " does n't even specify the rule supposedly breached " .
Nominate your civil liberties villain of the week in the comments below .
The prepared remarks of Lawrence H. Summers , director of the National Economic Council , at the Brookings Institution on the Obama administration ’s response to the economic crisis .
I am glad to be here .
This morning I want to describe our understanding of the root of our current economic crisis , talk about the rationale for the Administration ’s recovery strategy , and connect our longer - term economic strategy to the central objective of sustained and healthy expansion .
Economic downturns historically are of two types .
Most of those in post - World War II - America have been a by - product of the Federal Reserve ’s efforts to control rising inflation .
But an alternative source of recession comes from the spontaneous correction of financial excesses : the bursting of bubbles , de-leveraging in the financial sector , declining asset values , reduced demand , and reduced employment .
Unfortunately , our current situation reflects this latter , rarer kind of recession .
On a global basis , $ 50 trillion dollars in global wealth has been erased over the last 18 months .
This includes $ 7 trillion dollars in US stock market wealth which has vanished , and $ 6 trillion dollars in housing wealth that has been destroyed .
Inevitably , this has led to declining demand , with GDP and employment now shrinking at among the most rapid rates since the second World War.
4.4 million jobs have already been lost and the unemployment rate now exceeds 8 percent .
Our single most important priority is bringing about economic recovery and ensuring that the next economic expansion , unlike it ’s predecessors , is fundamentally sound and not driven by financial excess .
This is essential .
Without robust and sustained economic expansion , we will not achieve any other national goal .
We will not be able to project strength globally or reduce poverty locally .
We will not be able to expand access to higher education or affordable health care .
We will not be able to raise incomes for middle class families or create opportunities for new small businesses to thrive .
And so today , I will explain the rationale behind the President ’s recovery program and our strategy for long - term economic growth .
Hezbollah – the party of God , in Arabic – was notorious throughout the 1980s for being an extremist militant organisation involved in a string of kidnappings targeting westerners in the 1980s .
But since the early 1990s , the Lebanese Shia fundamentalist group has slowly engaged in the Lebanese post - civil war political process , while retaining its military wing , the Islamic Resistance , to fight Israel 's occupation of South Lebanon .
Last Week , the party 's leader , Hassan Nasrallah , announced its candidates for June 's parliamentary elections .
In his slate are three new candidates , including an academic , Ali Fayyad , a PhD holder who runs the party 's think tank , and Nawaf al - Musawi , a French - educated old guard who runs Hezbollah 's external relations .
This " intellectual " slate , as one Lebanese columnist dubbed it , marked yet another change in Hezbollah 's political evolution from a secluded shadowy organisation into a larger party concerned with its public image .
When Hezbollah first contemplated participation in the political process , it had to seek a fatwa – a religious edict – to allow its candidates to participate in " non-Islamic " parliamentary elections ( Lebanon 's parliament is split by constitution into Christian and Muslim halves ) .
Seven candidates – comprised of three clergymen and militant activists – ran on the party 's elections ' slate .
For the first time in Lebanon – a multi-confessional country with a consociational political system – Shia clergy became members of parliament .
In the 1996 elections , Hezbollah brought more changes to its parliamentary bloc ; fewer clergy and more lay activists including an academic .
The clergy were excluded in the last two rounds of elections , allowing new faces to be included , more adept at representing the party 's wider support base .
The salience of Hezbollah 's political divergence from mainstream Lebanese politics dwindled throughout the various phases of its political participation .
Since 2005 , Hezbollah has been represented in two Lebanese cabinets , an engagement once considered forbidden due to the state 's " un -Islamic " nature .
To better put those changes in perspective , political engagement has seen Hezbollah change from a revolutionary party that once believed in establishing an Islamic state in Lebanon , into a political group involved in daily governmental politics , unions , and concerned with its supporters ' demands .
Today , the party , while still mainly defined by its stance in the Israeli - Arab conflict , has a say on variety of issues such as privatisation , economic development in rural areas and subsidising basic services and goods .
Mind you the picture is n't all bright .
The party 's arsenal and militia remain a controversial issue in Lebanon , especially after its use in a mini civil war last May which ended in a political agreement in Doha .
Nevertheless , its engagement in political dialogue with its foes , its alliances with Christian leaders and secular groups – such as the Lebanese Communist party – indicates a significant change from the exclusive revolutionary party that it once was .
Such political engagement – which has recently won the praise of the British government – was bound to change its relationship with yet another Islamist group , not far from Lebanon , Hamas .
Months after Hamas 's victory in the 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections , Israel imprisoned a third of Hamas 's cabinet and dozens of its MPs , including the parliamentary speaker in retaliation at the capture of an Israeli soldier , Gilead Shalit .
This crackdown on the political process and the subsequent events , including the Palestinian infighting , has further radicalised the Islamist group , alienating at times even a close ally like Hezbollah .
During the Gaza conflict last December , al - Aqsa television , part of Hamas 's media network , broadcasted an anti-Hezbollah rant by a Saudi cleric .
After praising Hamas and condemning what he called " the holocaust in Gaza " , he called Hezbollah " the devil 's party " and its leader " Satan " .
He then said that Shias – the religious sect to which Hezbollah belongs – are " the Jews ' donkeys , they ride them during sedition " .
The outburst went on without interruption from Hamas 's TV administrators .
In response , Hezbollah reportedly cut broadcast of al - Aqsa TV via local controllers in Beirut 's southern suburbs , its major support base in Lebanon .
Al - Aqsa TV broadcasted an apology for several days after the war and the issue was eventually resolved ; yet the whole episode was reminiscent of the very first contacts between the two groups , specifically in December 1992 , when Israel exiled 417 Palestinian activists from Hamas and Islamic Jihad movements to the marj al zohoor area in southern Lebanon , then a buffer zone between the Israeli army and Lebanese resistance groups , including Hezbollah .
The latter sent an envoy to meet the exiled activists ; but Hamas initially refused to engage with Hezbollah 's envoy on the grounds that they belonged to a defective Muslim sect , Shia Islam .
Progressing from that , Hamas went on to form alliances with Hezbollah and Iran , as well as engaging with nationalist and non-Muslim groups , and even had a Greek Orthodox Christian candidate on its election ticket .
The Israeli crackdown and the following events altered the course of those changes .
What remains true though is that Hezbollah 's political evolution sets a model for engaging popular Islamist groups in political processes , rather than pursuing a policy of alienation that might prove costly , leading only to further radicalisation in an already volatile region .
In an email to the BitC developer mailing list Jonathon Shapiro announced that he is wrapping up development on BitC .
Some of you will have noticed that I have been conspicuously silent over the
last three or four weeks .
I have spent much of that time airborne , or in
interviews at Google , Microsoft , and DARPA .
After a fair bit of soul - searching , I have decided to accept a fairly senior
position at Microsoft associated with the Midori project .
The current plan
has me starting there at the beginning of August .
This means , among other issues , that we will be wrapping up the BitC
project .
While I will be trying hard to get all of the planned features for
the initial release completed before I depart , that may not turn out to be
possible .
I have asked Microsoft if we can keep the various web sites alive
for archival access and the mailing list , but I should also ask if there is
anyone out there who would be interested to assume more active stewardship
of the BitC project .
I emphasize that unless management at Microsoft
concludes otherwise , I will no longer be able to participate actively in
these discussions .
Also , in the event that MS does not permit archival
maintainence , would somebody be willing to take over hosting the content ?
I have also asked MS for permission to publish papers about BitC on my own
time .
They granted this permission to Swaroop , and I see no reason that they
should decline this , but my position there is a bit more sensitive and they
may see issues that I do not .
In the meantime , I need to get back to packing and hacking .
Best regards ,

A north Phoenix resident will have to wait at least another month to find whether he will go free or possibly pay fines or go to jail for removing signs .
Steven M. Hatfield , 56 , who faces criminal damage and theft charges in connection with the removal of temporary signs for home developments , on Wednesday retained a lawyer who was a given a one - month extension to sort through the case .
City prosecutors filed misdemeanor charges against Hatfield after ALB Industries , a Tempe - based sign company , complained that Hatfield picked up its signs and threw them away , causing them to lose more $ 50,000 since 2007 .
Hatfield , if found guilty , could face up to 120 days in jail , fines or probation .
Hatfield , who retired from IBM , said the home - sale signs were located in the public right - of - way , thus violating state and city laws .
Hatfield believes Arizona residents should enjoy a clean desert landscape and picks up trash on a volunteer basis .
ALB officials did not return calls for a comment Wednesday .
Reed W. King , Hatfield 's attorney , said ALB alleges Hatfield picked up 13 of its signs located on private property on Nov. 8 .
A meeting between city prosecutors , ALB Industries , King and Hatfield is scheduled for April 29 .
King works with Citizens for Improved Sign Enforcement in north - central Phoenix .
Hatfield is " the poster child for what we strongly object to - that is illegal signs , " King said .
The attorney said he created the neighborhood group five years ago when signs besieged the area and after elected officials told the group there was n't much enforcement they could offer .
King said if the group finds signs in a right - of - way it gets in touch with the businesses involved rather than contractors like ALB Industries who post signs .
New studies find exercise makes for better eye health , less chronic pain , stronger bones and can even help prevent some cancer .
Image
It just seems too good to be true .
Study after research study consistently promoting the endless benefits of exercise .
Couch potatoes everywhere are waiting for the other shoe to drop , telling us that all of those scientists were wrong and we should remain as sedentary as possible .
Yet four additional studies released recently each give the same prescription for improving some aspect of your health : exercise .
They add to recent evidence that regular workouts can improve old brains , raise kids ' academic performance and give a brain boost to everyone in between .
Better bones
One study illustrates the effect of exercise on preventing or limiting osteoporosis , which affects more than 200 million people worldwide .
Researchers at the University of Missouri found that while both resistance training ( lifting weights ) and high impact exercise ( running ) both help build needed bone mineral density ( BMD ) , running is the better choice .
" Exercise programs to increase bone strength should be designed using what is known about how bones respond to exercise , " said Pam Hinton , associate professor and lead author .
" Only the skeletal sites that experience increased stress from exercise will become stronger .
High - impact , dynamic , multi- directional activities result in greater gains in bone strength . "
The study was published in the February issue of the Journal of Strength Conditioning .
Less pain
In a related study , exercise seemed to be one of the few successful remedies for those that suffer from low - back pain .
In the February issue of the Spine Journal , University of Washington physicians summarized 20 different clinical trials that promoted different solutions to alleviating pain .
" Strong and consistent evidence finds many popular prevention methods to fail while exercise has a significant impact , both in terms of preventing symptoms and reducing back pain - related work loss , " said Dr. Stanley J. Bigos , professor emeritus of orthopaedic surgery and environmental health .
" Passive interventions such as lumbar belts and shoe inserts do not appear to work . "
Better eye health
Also , vigorous exercise has now been linked with significantly reduced onset of cataracts and age - related macular degeneration .
In the study , detailed in Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science , researchers reviewed the eye health of 41,000 runners over seven years and found that both men and women had significantly lower rates of these two diseases than the general public .
Men who logged more than 5.7 miles per day had a 35 percent lower risk than those that ran less than 1.4 miles per day .
While the correlation is strong , the reason is not clear .
" We know some of the physiological benefits of exercise , and we know about the physiological background of these diseases , so we need to better understand where there 's an overlap , " said Paul Williams , an epidemiologist in the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Life Sciences Division .
Cancer prevention Each year in the U.S. , more 100,000 people are diagnosed with colon cancer .
To see what effect exercise has on lowering this rate , researchers at Washington University and Harvard University combined to review 52 studies over the last 25 years which linked exercise and the incidence of cancer .
Overall , they found that those that exercised the most ( 5 - 6 hours of brisk walking per week ) were 24 percent less likely to develop the disease than those that exercised the least ( less than 30 minutes per week ) .
" The beneficial effect of exercise holds across all sorts of activities , " said lead study author Kathleen Y. Wolin , Sc.D. of Washington University .
" And it holds for both men and women .
There is an ever - growing body of evidence that the behavior choices we make affect our cancer risk .
Physical activity is at the top of the list of ways that you can reduce your risk of colon cancer . "
So , are there any studies out there that link exercise with a negative outcome ?
In a recent study published in the journal Obesity , Dolores Albarracín , professor of psychology at the University of Illinois , did find that people who are shown posters with messages like " join a gym " or " take a walk " actually ate more after viewing these messages than those that saw messages like " make friends . "
" Viewers of the exercise messages ate significantly more ( than their peers , who viewed other types of messages ) , " Albarracín said .
" They ate one - third more when exposed to the exercise ads . "

More Sports Science
Dan Peterson writes about sports science at his site Sports Are 80 Percent Mental .
Last October , Google settled the lawsuit brought against it by book publishers and authors concerning its massive book - scanning project .
The $ 125 million deal gives Google the right to store digital copies of the books , include them in its search results , sell online versions and license its book - scans to libraries .
It also allows millions of " orphan " works ( books still under copyright but whose copyright - holders can't be found ) to be included in Google 's program .
The only obstacle remaining for the settlement to take effect is final court approval .
Given a case of this scope , it 's not too surprising that a number of interested parties might lodge objections or ask for changes .
Nor is it terribly surprising that at least one party nudging its way into the settlement is an internet - issues - oriented group from New York Law School .
But what does raise an eyebrow is the source of New York Law 's funding on this matter : Microsoft .
Microsoft , which lost an anti-trust case of its own in the '90s , has been lobbying to get the government to constrain Google .
The Softies already can claim some part in urging the government to decide to challenge a Google - Yahoo ad partnership project last year ( which became moot when Google bailed on the plan ) .
But the book settlement is a new battleground .
The Court permits objections until May 5 , and will conduct a hearing on June 11 .
In a letter to the court asking permission to file an amicus curiae brief on the settlement , attorney Daniel Kornstein , representing New York Law School ’s Institute for Information Law and
Policy , wrote that the brief would address a number of concerns .
It would also request that the Court " solicit the opinions of the
Anti-trust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission . "
Explaining what the New York Law School brings to the party ,
Kornstein cited its mission " to understand the interplay of law and technology and influence their development to serve democratic values in the digital age ... to extend human knowledge and harness new informational tools to the goals of social justice . "
The Institute , he writes , " is in a position to make a significant contribution to the resolution of the legal issues in dispute by virtue of its recognized scholarly expertise in intellectual property and Internet law . ”
And , oh , by the way , he also discloses that the efforts of " the second oldest independent law school in the United States " is funded in part by Google 's main competitor , Microsoft .
The chief investigator of the New York Law School project is James
Grimmelmann .
In an earlier career phase , associate law professor
Grimmelmann worked as a programmer for Microsoft .
At a conference in
February , Grimmelmann was discussing his views of the book settlement with a policy specialist of his former employer , and the Microsoft exec reminded Grimmelmann that the company has had a continuing interest in funding academic efforts .
On March 11 , Grimmelmann laid out the project in a proposal sent to
Microsoft .
The amicus brief is one four initiatives the Law School will undertake .
The others are a series of white papers , a symposium on the settlement issues , and a website that will act as a hub of activity for those challenging or asking for changes on the settlement .
Grimmelmann proposed that Microsoft 's contribution to fund these efforts should be
$ 50,000 , and he now confirms Microsoft pledged that amount .
Though
Grimmelmann says other contributors may emerge , currently Microsoft is the sole outside funder of New York Law School 's Google Book Settlement
Project .
Microsoft says that its behavior should be viewed in the context of similar academic grants over the years .
" We are funding this like we fund dozens of law projects , " says Tom Rubin , Microsoft 's chief counsel for intellectual property strategy .
" The issues that are implicated in the settlement are important ones .
New York Law School has taken an important position on orphan works and they deserve to be heard . "
Rubin says that as with other instances of Microsoft funding of academic projects , the recipients maintain their independence and are free to reach any conclusions .
He wo n't comment on whether Microsoft itself plans to file an objection to the settlement .
It may be a good investment on Microsoft 's part , but does n't the
Microsoft money taint New York Law School 's efforts ?
" I 'm sure there 's a danger in being perceived as compromised , " says Grimmelmann .
" But I know it 's not affecting our work .
Microsoft is willing to send us money to do good work with our students and we 're happy to take it . "
( Grimmelmann 's own stance on the Google Settlement , first expressed in a blog posting last November , is rather nuanced .
He thinks it 's a positive development , but wants significant change — generally , ones that restrain Google .
He also says that at various times , his positions on issues have been anti-Microsoft as well as anti-Google . )
My conversation with Grimmelmann came just after his session at the
East Coast Foo Camp last weekend , a conference run by O’Reilly Media .
The name of the session was " Hacking the Google Book Settlement . "
Turns out that cleverest hacker here is Microsoft , making an academic grant that may help put some judicial heat on its rival .

Editor 's note :
This story is part of an ongoing series of profiles CNN is doing about economic survival in this time of financial crisis .
Nicole Thompson - Arce poses on her wedding day with her husband , Mathew Arce , and her ex-mother - in - law .
( CNN ) --
Struggling to make ends meet , trying to dig themselves out of debt , Nicole Thompson - Arce and her husband have moved in with her ex-husband .
Together , the unlikely threesome of Omaha , Nebraska , is raising two young daughters from the first marriage .
It 's the kind of situation that has left cable guys howling .
" They 'd never heard anything like this , " Thompson - Arce , 28 , remembered with a laugh .
" And they 're in people 's homes everyday . "
When she and Craig Thompson , 42 , were going through a divorce in 2005 , this was not a deal either of them could have imagined striking .
It was a messy divorce , the kind involving a custody dispute .
But once they ironed out that battle , agreeing to joint custody , Thompson - Arce said they were able to move on and forward .
iReport : Read Thompson - Arce 's post
By the time she married Mathew Arce last July , she said she and her ex were friends .
In fact , they were so close that his mother -- meaning Thompson - Arce 's ex-mother - in - law -- was in ( not just at ) the second wedding ceremony .
Soon after the Florida wedding , the new lovebirds flew into a financial mess .
She had left a job , and as soon as she found another ( a temp position ) , her 22 - year - old husband was fired from his higher - paying gig .

They fell behind in rent .
The bills stacked up .
The credit card debt grew .

What are you cutting from budget ?
A couple months later , Arce , landed a temporary Wal - Mart cashier position , which has since turned into a full - time job .
But finances remained shaky and digging themselves out of debt seemed insurmountable .
Tell us how you 're surviving in this economy
In walked the ex with an offer , just in time for Christmas .
Thompson , an 18 - year bakery employee at Wal - Mart , lives in a three - bedroom , one - bath home .
" I knew they were having money problems , so I just asked them to move in , " he said .
" I figured I 'd get to see my girls , my daughters , more often .
And Nicole said yes right away . "
Besides the economic savings , the benefits are many .
No longer do they have to shuttle Victoria , 7 , and Caitlyn , 6 , between two households .
As a team , they can parent and be on the same page .
Finding a baby sitter is never a problem .
They take turns making meals , which they all share .
Thompson and Arce , who are 20 years apart -- " I had to get the whole spectrum going there , " Thompson - Arce joked -- have become the best of friends , and share a similar sense of humor .
They have tackled home improvement projects , run around together on days they both have off and often hang out at the kitchen table building plastic models .
" We just clicked , " Thompson said .
" When I tell people , ' I 'm living with my ex-wife and her husband , ' I get some really strange looks .
... It 's different .
It 's unusual , but it works . "
The transition has been smooth and great for the kids , Thompson - Arce said .
And for their benefit , irrespective of finances , she thinks it 's a living situation they 'll stick with for at least five to 10 years .
It has , however , taken a little time for the little ones to get the story straight .
Seven - year - old Victoria went back to school after winter break -- and after the whole team had blended under one roof -- and started telling people this : " ' My mommy has two husbands , ' " Thompson - Arce remembered .
" I was like , ' No , honey , do n't tell them that ! ' "
What she and both men hope the girls are learning is that divorced parents can work together and be friends .
" There are so many families that go through divorce and can never let it go , " she said .
" I 'm thankful , and hopefully our situation can help people rethink things because if they have kids , it 's in their best interest to get along . "
One might wonder whether the couple , who 've been married for less than a year , get enough time alone together , given where they 're living .
Thompson - Arce points out that her ex works a shift that sends him to bed at 7 p.m. , so the evenings -- after the kids are asleep -- are for her and her husband to share .

" When they do have a romantic evening , I do n't hear them , so we 're not going there , " Thompson quipped .
" There 's a bathroom between our two bedrooms . "
The ex-husband has n't dated since the divorce .
He said it 's because he 's been focused on work and taking care of the kids .
Thompson - Arce , however , said that she and her husband are forever trying to get Thompson on the dating scene and want him to meet someone special .
Special , and understanding , she would most definitely need to be .
" He 'd have to find a very open - minded woman because we do n't plan on going anywhere anytime soon , " Thompson - Arce said .

Vintage Photographs - Introduction
This section of the website contains 3,900 archive photographs - of battles , politicians , royalty , army commanders , airmen and scientists among many other categories - chiefly taken during wartime .
A number of photographs were also captured in the years leading up to war in 1914 .
Each of the photos was originally published in the many illustrated publications which professed to tell the story of the war while it was underway , with varying degrees of accuracy and sometimes subject to censorship .
Additional photos have been supplied for inclusion by site contributors .

The events surrounding the police in the past 10 days are all too familiar - heavy - handed treatment of innocent bystanders , followed by botched cover-ups .
Meanwhile , Bob Quick 's inadvertent exposure of highly sensitive information follows a tradition of lost discs , while the government demands to collect our personal data to protect us .
The only comic side to the recent sad events is that they were all caught on camera , many of which were owned by the police themselves .
Rough justice or what ?
That makes Quick risking his briefing papers for an anti-terrorist operation being photographed quite extraordinary .
And the behaviour of the police officer attacking Ian Tomlinson from behind even more so .
What could they have presumed would be the reaction of anyone seeing those pictures ?
They must have known cameras were everywhere .
They may have felt safe from criticism because of Section 76 of the Counter - Terrorism Act , which came into force on 16 February .
That makes it an offence to photograph any police officer or member of the armed services in ways that could aid terrorism .
This problematic legislation risks discouraging an ever more precious weapon in holding police accountable when the government gives them powers to treat peaceful demonstrators as a threat not only to order , but to the state itself .
How else to explain the trashing of the Climate Camp earlier this month , just the latest heavy - handed response to environmental protests and other causes .
These include even the green - wellied phalanxes on the Countryside March .
Many of these questionable police actions are taken under anti-terrorism legislation , fuelled by uncritical ministers seemingly unaware of the perverse outcome .
They are undermining the social contract between police and the public that is central to good order : policing by consent .
The risk of terrorism has added emphasis to the police 's long - held sense that any protest threatens law and order .
It means their planning for demos not only includes provision for reasonable behaviour , it is often based on worst - case scenarios .
That too often becomes a self - fulfilling expectation .
Police announcing in advance to protesters at G20 that " we 're up for it " primes officers in riot gear to expect trouble .
If they do n't find it in front of them , they go looking for it - indeed , cause it .
That 's the still unlearnt lesson of so many marches far back in my memory .
Take the Grosvenor Square anti-Vietnam demonstration in 1968 .
Police horses charged a peaceful crowd that had filled the square .
Why ?
I later learnt from an officer on the US embassy steps that anarchists at the front were throwing ball bearings .
Thousands behind them had no knowledge of this , but endured sudden police efforts to clear the square .
I was caught in a group squeezed by a cordon of officers arm in arm - not out of the square but against some railings .
A superintendent was caught with us .
I suggested we'd be crushed unless they released one end of the cordon and let us leave .
They did .
In the 1970s , the Special Patrol Group were used at protests that had got out of hand .
Cooped up for hours in vans , they made trouble worse by lashing out at whoever was around .
Violence was blamed on demonstrators .
Sound familiar ?
The 1980s riots , coupled with heavy policing of the miners ' strike , became a virtual civil war between sections of the public and police .
In battles such as Orgreave and Wapping , police saw themselves as " piggy in the middle " between Thatcher 's wish to crush the unions and belligerent strikers .
But like the G20 , some officers , who behaved normally on their own at home , lost it when in acting in crowds .
The police became the enemy .
Despite years of public order training , when tempers fray , police professionalism is sorely tested .
I saw that close up at the Notting Hill carnival in 1993 .
Things had improved after senior officers realised that using riot police in packed crowds could be counterproductive .
Officers were told to be friendly and non-confrontational .
It worked until it was dark and time to go .
Crowds found the shortest route to Ladbroke Grove tube blocked by a barrier and two officers telling them gruffly to take the long way .
They did n't explain to tired and drunk revellers the route was saved for ambulances .
So some threw bottles .
Cue the riot police to join what was a minor altercation .
Hundreds piled into the nearly empty Portobello Road with shields and batons .
They had spent the hot August day in a school with their uniforms on , watching Rambo .
Their helmets and shields offered ready targets for the bottle throwers - and anonymity in case an odd photographer snapped them .
The trouble with using riot police to act peacefully is that it's a contradiction in terms .
Moreover , the police focus on worst - case scenarios not only makes them more likely , but they also fail to distinguish between the small core of troublemakers who want confrontation and innocent bystanders , such as Ian Tomlinson seems to have been .
It plays into the hands of those who wish to show the heavy hand of the state , including terrorists .
Police are still doing this by " kettling " , confining all who happen to be near the centre of the demonstration for many long hours .
It may limit local damage , but it causes much longer damage to their reputation .
And often the young caught in the kettle will later rise to positions of power on the bench and in parliament .
This heavy - handedness is especially counterproductive .
Not only does it contradict the recent new key performance indicator of increasing public confidence , it also makes it less likely that people will provide useful intelligence against potential terrorism .
Intelligence - led policing is the new mantra .
But intelligence involves more than taking pictures of everyone at a demo and collecting our emails , texts and travel movements on an insecure database .
It requires understanding , sensitivity and discretion , all of which go out the window when the red mist descends .

Citing “ overwhelming ” evidence that marijuana eases pain and anxiety for the chronically ill , medicinal pot advocates told a federal appeals panel Tuesday that the federal government should be stopped from spreading “ false information ” about marijuana .
As was argued in the debate over whether stem cell research should be resumed , Americans for Safe Access cast the Bush administration ’s opposition to any legalized use of marijuana as being shaped by conservative sentiments instead of hard facts .
President Obama has signaled to Cabinet members that science should be guiding government judgments in controversial matters of medicine and technology , not the prevailing political mood .
On Tuesday , however , a government lawyer told three judges of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that the administration was n’t required to explain or retract its statements that marijuana “ has no currently accepted medical use . ”
Marijuana is banned under federal law but is legal for cancer patients and others suffering chronic illnesses in California and a dozen other states .
Safe Access sued the federal government under a law that prohibits it from disseminating inaccurate information .

U.S. Atty .
Gen. Eric
Holder signaled last month that the administration would n’t interfere with medical pot dispensing in states where it is legal as long as users abide by state law .
Since California became the first state to partially legalize medical marijuana 13 years ago , the federal government has prevailed in all challenges to the state ’s practice , including a 2001 U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the federal government ’s right to prosecute offenders .
Safe Access argues that the federal government needs to update its assessment to conform with the reality of marijuana ’s broadening legal use as a pain reliever .
“ The science to support medical marijuana is overwhelming .
It ’s time for the federal government to acknowledge the efficacy of medical marijuana and stop holding science hostage to politics , ” said Steph Sherer , director of Americans for Safe Access .

The group petitioned for revision of the federal judgment in 2004 but was ignored by Bush officials , who also sought and won federal district court dismissal of a 2007 lawsuit filed by Safe Access .
Justice Department lawyer Alisa Klein told the appeals court panel that the government should n’t be forced to defend the accuracy of “ countless pieces of information ” in its massive archives .
U.S. Circuit Court Judge Marsha S. Berzon , an appointee of President Clinton , said the law at issue in the case was “ amazing ” because it did appear to require the government to correct all inaccurate statements , a result she called “ troubling . ”
Despite the positive signals emanating from Washington lately , Alan Morrison , founder of Public Citizen ’s Litigation Group who argued on behalf of Safe Access , said the plaintiffs had n’t expected a government turnaround just yet .
Amid economic turmoil and global crises , he said , medical marijuana “ is well below the radar scope of the Obama administration . ”

How are things going at work ?
While there has plenty written on a wide variety of factors affecting employee well - being -- on everything from management style and organizational structure to the effects of ergonomic furniture and natural lighting -- the " elephant in the room " in our workplaces is something that almost everyone complains about but no one has studied : how much time we spend in meetings .
In the average workplace , there are lots of meetings .
Reports indicate that the average number of meetings at work more than doubled in the second half of the 20th Century and time spent in meetings keeps growing .
While the importance of this change has been largely unnoticed , a new study on the effects of meetings on worker well - being reveals some surprising dynamics behind modern meeting mania , with broad implications for the effects on morale and productivity .
The report , written by a team of researchers led by industrial and organizational psychologist Steven G. Rogelberg from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte , appears in the March issue of the Journal of Applied Psychology .
It describes the first international scientific study ever performed on the effects of meeting time on employee well - being , based on the responses of 980 employees to two work surveys .
One of the report 's findings was that more people actually view meetings as a positive part of the workday than they will admit publicly .
" When speaking publicly , people generally claim that they hate meetings , " said Rogelberg , " but in the surveys you see a different story -- some people 's private sentiments are much more positive .
" It 's an interesting finding because it really helps to explain why we have all these meetings .
And , though they are typically publicly negative , overwhelmingly people say that they want the day to have at least one meeting .
They have to feel like they are accomplishing something positive in their meetings to produce this response , " he said .
The two surveys tested the impact of meetings on employees in two different contexts -- at the end of a specific day and in general , by examining the number of meetings employees had in a typical week .

The study finds that for some individuals meetings function as interruptions and for others they are welcome events .
The effects of meetings on worker well - being is " moderated " by three different factors -- by whether jobs specifically require group work , by whether the meetings were efficiently run , and , perhaps critically , by where the worker falls on the personality scale of her / his " accomplishment striving . "
" People differ on this accomplishment striving personality scale , " Rogelberg explained .
" In general , you can think of people who are high in accomplishment striving are those individuals who are very task - focused , who are very goal - focused , who have goals and objectives for the day that they want to get accomplished .
People who have low accomplishment striving are not slackers , though -- they are just individuals with a much more flexible orientation to work and like to allow the agenda for the day to emerge much more naturally . "
The study finds that people who are high in accomplishment striving are predictably and negatively impacted by meetings , particularly when they are frequent .
Numerous short meetings have a greater impact on their well - being than a few long meetings taking the same amount of time .
However , survey participants who scored low in accomplishment striving were positively impacted by meetings .
They appeared to be welcome events rather than interruptions .
More time in meetings was associated with a greater sense of well - being .
" People who are high in accomplishment striving look at meetings more from the perspective of seeing them as barriers to getting real work done , " Rogelberg said .
" But the others may view meetings as a way to structure their day or a way to network and socialize .
As a result , these people see meetings as a good thing . "
Rogelberg notes that there are some curious social paradigms operating that disguise the dynamic .

" It is socially unacceptable to talk about liking meetings , unless someone else starts talking about it , " he said , explaining why the low accomplishment striving folks do not go public with their preference for meeting .
" And it is also interesting that the people who are high on accomplishment striving are not complaining more the others .
The toll that meetings take seems to be much more subtle .
If you ask these individuals if they are more dissatisfied with the meetings , they do n't report anything different from those who enjoy meetings , " he said .

Here is another quick hack that I wrote a while ago .
It complements the xgoogle library that I published in my previous post with an API for Google Sponsored Links search .
Let me quickly explain why this library is useful , and what the Google Sponsored Links are .
For a typical search , Google shows regular web search results on the left side of the page , and " Sponsored Links " in a column on the right side .
" Sponsored " means the results are pulled from Googe 's advertising network ( Adwords ) .
Here is a screenshot that illustrates the Sponsored Links :
Google Sponsored Links results for search term " security " are in red .
Okay , now why would I need a library to search the Sponsored results ?
Suppose that I am an advertiser on Adwords , and I buy some software related keywords like " video software " .
It is in my interests to know my competitors , their advertisement text , what are they up to , the new players in this niche , and their websites .
Without my library it would be practically impossible to keep track of all the competitors .
There can literally be hundreds of changes per day .
However , with my library it 's now piece of cake to keep track of all the dynamics .
How does the library work ?
The sponsored links library pulls the results from this URL : http://www.google.com/sponsoredlinks.
Here is an example of all the sponsored results for a query " security " :
Sponsored links results for " security " .
The library just grabs page after page , calls BeautifulSoup , and extracts the search result elements .
Elementary .
How to use the library ?
As I mentioned , this library is part of my xgoogle library .
Download and extract it first :
Now , the source file that contains the implementation of this library is " xgoogle/sponsoredlinks.py " .
To use it , do the usual import " from xgoogle.sponsoredlinks import SponsoredLinks , SLError " .
SponsoredLinks is the class that provides the API and SLError is exception class that gets thrown in case of errors , so it 's a good idea to import both .
The SponsoredLinks has a similar interface as the xgoogle . search ( the plain google search module ) .
The constructor of SponsoredLinks takes the keyword you want to search for , and the constructed object has several public methods and properties :
method get_results ( ) - gets a page of results , returning a list of SponsoredLink objects .
It returns an empty list if there are no more results .
- gets a page of results , returning a list of SponsoredLink objects .
It returns an empty list if there are no more results .
property num_results - returns number of search results found .
- returns number of search results found .
property results_per_page - sets / gets the number of results to get per page ( max 100 ) .
The returned SponsoredLink objects have four attributes -- " title " , " desc " , " url " , and " display_url " .
Here is a picture that illustrates what each attribute stands for :
The picture does not show the " display_url " attribute as it's the actual link the result links to ( href of blue link in the pic ) .
Here is an example usage of this library .
It retrieves first 100 Sponsored Links results for keyword " video software " :
from xgoogle.sponsoredlinks import SponsoredLinks , SLError try : sl = SponsoredLinks ( " video software " ) sl.results_per_page = 100 results = sl.get_results ( ) except SLError , e : print " Search failed : %s " % e for result in results : print result.title.encode('utf8 ' ) print result.desc.encode('utf8 ' ) print result.display_url.encode('utf8 ' ) print result.url.encode('utf8 ' ) print

The " food safety " bills in Congress were written by Monsanto , Cargill , Tysons , ADM , etc .
All are associated with the opposite of food safety .
What is this all about then ?
In the simplest terms , organic food and a rebirth of farming were winning .
Not in absolute numbers but in a deep and growing shift by the public toward understanding the connection between their food and their health , between good food and true social pleasures , between their own involvement in food and the improvement in their lives in general , between local food and a burgeoning local economy .
Slow Food was right - limit your food to what comes from your region and from real farmers , and slow down to cook it and linger over it with friends and family , and the world begins to change for the better .
And as we face an unprecedented economic crisis , and it is hard to be sure what has value , one thing that always does is food .
Which is why the corporations are after absolute control over it .
But what obstacles to a complete lock on food do they face ?
All the people in this country who are " banking " on organic farming and urban gardens and most of all , everyone 's deepening pleasure in and increasing involvement with everything about food .
Farmers markets .
Local farmers .
Real milk .
Fresh eggs .
Vegetable stands .
Those are things we not only all want , but things we are actively getting involved in , and things we very much need .
And where they are truly good , they are growing
The international financial corporations which have wreaked havoc around the world with astounding nonsensical " solutions " that are destructive of everyone but them , are brothers to the international agribusiness giants ( Monsanto , Cargill , Tysons , ADM , etc. ) which are just as aggressively after their own form of " taking . "
Just seeds , animals , water , land .
And freedom .
Because human beings are by in large good and by in large incredibly resilient and clever , and left to their own devices - that is , free - they would handle this gargantuan financial stupidity the corporations brought us with NAFTA , CAFTA , GATT and all other globalized schemes ( which they hope to eventually top off with CODEX ) .
How ?
By being productive in real ways and locally .
And farming is the solid ground under that .
Farmers produce something of real value ( something we used to take for granted ) , and from that base , businesses grow up .
Local markets , local food processors , local seed companies , local tool and supply companies , local stores ... and an economy based on reality and something truly good for us , too , begins to grow .
So , look again at what has been exciting us - Farmers markets .
Local farmers .
Real milk .
Fresh eggs .
Vegetable stands . - and realize that they are not only wonderfully healthy but fun and naturally community building .
And more , they are a real economy and deeply democratic - and just at a time we need something that works economically , that supports our democratic rebirth , and that protects food itself and our easy access to it .
And it is all those things that threaten the corporations ... which is why we now have these massive " fake food safety " bills in Congress .
Everything is going under thanks to these fools , and they wish to be there like vultures to make sure that every drop of blood that can be sucked out of our resources and us , is theirs .
To wit , they must get rid of such good and innocent things and yet truly powerful things as :
Farmers markets .
Local farmers .
Real milk .
Fresh eggs .
Vegetable stands .
And how will those who contaminate our country 's food with pesticides , hormones , antibiotics and more , do that ?
Why , by setting standards for " food safety " that are so grotesquely and inappropriately and even cruelly applied to a local , independent farmers and ranchers that there is no way they can manage .
Imagine your being faced with a 100 page IRS form and facing a million dollar a day penalty for screwing up .
That would be in the ball park of the impossible complexity mixed with threat facing our farmers .
Imagine having the government and corporations deciding every single thing you can do and must do in your kitchen and backing that up with the threat of 10 years in prison for screwing up - though you have never made anyone sick , and those corporations have .
Imagine being surveilled 24 hours a day by GPS tracking devices that feed into ... a corporate data bank , one they have now moved out of the country so no one here can have legal access to see what is in it .
Imagine the devil himself - or a whole boardrooms of them , dressed in suits - defining the only safe and healthy food in this country as dangerous and burdening hard working farmers with more work then anyone could bear , while his own , their own , food is so dangerous at this point that in the last 10 years alone , diabetes has gone up 90 % .
And how did they get this far with such a scheme to apply insane industrial standards to every farm in the country ?
Through fear of diseases and of outbreaks of food borne illnesses , both of which they cause themselves .
How it works : Tyson helps Bill Clinton get into office .
Bill Clinton immediately and significantly lowers contamination standards for poultry as a thank you .
And it is such contaminated waste from transnational poultry factories which is now implicated as the source of bird flu push out small farmers
The bills would require such a burdensome complexity of rules , inspections , licensing , fees , and penalties for each farmer who wishes to sell locally - a fruit stand , at a farmers market - no one could manage it
So , if you like farmers markets , local farmers , fresh milk , fresh eggs , vegetables stands , and freedom , let your friends know that it 's all on the line right now with those " fake food safety " bills brought to us with well - planned evil and more of it to come , by Monsanto , Cargill , Tysons , ADM , etc .
Slow Food reminds us of just where we need to be ( and notice how much would help any local economy ) :
Preserving and promoting local and traditional food products , along with their lore and preparation ;
Organizing small - scale processing ( including facilities for slaughtering and short run products ) ;
Organizing celebrations of local cuisine within regions ( for example , the Feast of Fields held in some cities in Canada
Promoting " taste education
Educating consumers about the risks of fast food
Educating citizens about the drawbacks of commercial agribusiness and factory farms
Educating citizens about the risks of monoculture and reliance on too few genomes
Developing various political programs to preserve family farms
Lobbying against government funding of genetic engineering
Lobbying against the use of pesticides
Encouraging ethical buying
But we need to stop these bills first or we are left with no money from the financial bailout and no food from the food stealout .
We need millions to be fighting this .

And below , where Oped News offers a means of writing your local newspaper , take advantage of a chance to vent .
When I testified last year before the House Judiciary Committee ’s Subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights , and Civil Liberties about Bush interrogation policies , Congressman Trent Franks ( R - Ariz . ) stated that former CIA Director Michael Hayden had confirmed that the Bush administration waterboarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , Abu Zabaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashirit for only one minute each .
I told Franks that I did n’t believe that .
Sure enough , one of the newly released torture memos reveals that Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times and Zubaydah was waterboarded 83 times .
One of the 2005 memos written by Bush - era Justice Department official Stephen Bradbury asserted that “ enhanced techniques ” used on Zubaydah yielded the identification of Mohammed and an alleged radioactive bomb plot by Jose Padilla .
But FBI Supervisory Special Agent Ali Soufan , who interrogated Zubaydah from March to June 2002 , wrote in The New York Times that Zubaydah produced that information under traditional interrogation methods , before the harsh techniques were ever used .
Why , then , the relentless waterboarding of these two men ?
It turns out that high Bush officials put heavy pressure on Pentagon interrogators to get Mohammed and Zubaydah to say there was a link between Saddam Hussein and the 9/11 hijackers , in order to justify President Bush ’s illegal and unnecessary invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
That link was never established .
President Obama released the four memos in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by the ACLU .
They describe unimaginably brutal techniques and provide “ legal ” justification for clearly illegal acts of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .
In the face of monumental pressure from the CIA to keep them secret , Obama demonstrated great courage in deciding to make the grotesque memos public .
At the same time , however , in an attempt to pacify the intelligence establishment , Obama said that “ it is our intention to assure those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the Department of Justice that they will not be subject to prosecution . ”
In startlingly clinical and dispassionate terms , the authors of the newly released torture memos describe and then rationalize why the devastating techniques the CIA sought to employ on human beings do not violate the Torture Statute ( 18 U.S.C. sec. 2340 ) .
The memos justify 10 techniques , including banging heads into walls 30 times in a row , prolonged nudity , repeated slapping , dietary manipulation , and dousing with cold water as low as 41 degrees .
They allow shackling detainees in a standing position for 180 hours , sleep deprivation for 11 days , confinement in small dark boxes with insects for hours , and waterboarding .
Moreover , the memos permit many of these techniques to be used in combination for a 30 - day period .
They find that none of these techniques constitute torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .
Waterboarding , admittedly the most serious of the methods , is designed to induce the perception of “ suffocation and incipient panic , i.e. the perception of drowning , ” according to Jay Bybee , the signer of one of the memos .
But although Bybee finds that “ the use of the waterboard constitutes a threat of imminent death , ” he accepts the CIA ’s claim that it does “ not anticipate that any prolonged mental harm would result from the use of the waterboard . ”
One of Bradbury ’s memos requires that a physician be on duty during waterboarding to perform a tracheotomy in case the victim does n’t recover after being returned to an upright position .
As psychologist Jeffrey Kaye points out , the CIA and the Justice Department “ ignored a wealth of other published information ” indicating that victims of waterboarding may suffer dissociative symptoms , changes greater than those in patients undergoing heart surgery , and drops in testosterone to castration levels .
The Torture Statute punishes conduct , or conspiracy to engage in conduct , specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering .
“ Severe mental pain or suffering ” means the prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from either the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering , or from the threat of imminent death .
Bybee asserts that “ if a defendant acts with the good faith belief that his actions will not cause such suffering , he has not acted with specific intent . ”
He makes the novel claim that the presence of personnel with medical training who can stop the interrogation if medically necessary “ indicates that it is not your intent to cause severe physical pain . ”
Bybee , now a federal judge with a lifetime appointment , concludes that waterboarding does not constitute torture under the Torture Statute .
However , he writes , “ we cannot predict with confidence whether a court would agree with this conclusion . ”
Bybee ’s memo explains why the 10 techniques could be used on Abu Zubaydah , who was considered to be a top al - Qaida operative .
“ Zubaydah does not have any pre-existing mental conditions or problems that would make him likely to suffer prolonged mental harm from [ the CIA ’s ] proposed interrogation methods , ” the CIA told Bybee .
Zubaydah was only a low - ranking al - Qaida operative , according to leading FBI counterterrorism expert Dan Coleman , who had advised a top FBI official , “ This guy is insane , certifiable , split personality . ”
This was reported by Ron Suskind in his book “ The One Percent Doctrine . ”
The CIA ’s request to confine Zubaydah in a cramped box with an insect was granted by Bybee , who told the CIA it could place a harmless insect in the box and tell Zubaydah that it would sting him but not kill him .
Even though the CIA knew that Zubaydah had an irrational fear of insects , Bybee found there would be no threat of severe physical pain or suffering if it followed this procedure .
Obama ’s intent to immunize those who violated our laws banning torture and cruel treatment violates the president ’s constitutional duty to “ take care that the laws be faithfully executed . ”
U.S. law prohibits torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and requires that those who subject people to such treatment be prosecuted .
The Convention Against Torture compels us to refer all torture cases for prosecution or extradite the suspect to a country that will undertake a criminal investigation .
Obama has made a political calculation to seek amnesty for the CIA torturers .
However , good - faith reliance on superior orders was rejected as a defense at Nuremberg and in Lt. Willliam L. Calley ’s Vietnam - era trial for the My Lai massacre .
The Torture Convention provides unequivocally that “ an order from a superior officer or a public authority may not be invoked as a justification for torture . ”
There is evidence that the CIA was using the illegal techniques as early as April 2002 , three to four months before one of the memos was written in August 2002 .
That would eliminate “ good - faith ” reliance on Justice Department advice as a defense to prosecution .
The Senate Intelligence Committee revealed that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice approved waterboarding in July 17 , 2002 , “ subject to a determination of legality by the OLC [ Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel ] . ”
She got it two weeks later from Bybee and Justice Department lawyer John Yoo .
Rice , Vice President Dick Cheney , Attorney General John Ashcroft , White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and CIA Director George Tenet reassured the CIA in spring 2003 that the abusive methods were legal .
Obama told AP ’s Jennifer Loven in the Oval Office : “ With respect to those who formulated those legal decisions , I would say that is going to be more of a decision for the Attorney General within the parameters of various laws , and I do n’t want to prejudge that . ”
If Attorney General Eric Holder continues to carry out Obama ’s political agenda by resisting investigations and prosecution , Congress can , and should , authorize the appointment of a special independent prosecutor to do what the law requires .
The president must fulfill his constitutional duty to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed .
Obama said that “ nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . ”
He is wrong .
There is much to gain from upholding the rule of law .
It would make future leaders think twice before they authorize the cruel , illegal treatment of other human beings .

Last week 's conviction of the founders of The Pirate Bay did not shut down the filesharing website .
Instead , it has boosted the ranks of its supporters and raised awareness of an ideological and legal battle for control of how the Internet is used .
The court ruling handed down one - year jail sentences to each of the four men and assessed $ 3.6 million in criminal damages .
The global entertainment giants that brought the case , including Warner Bros. , Fox Movies , Sony Music , and EMI , claimed it as a major victory .
But even as the founders were being sentenced , 10 million Internet users were busy downloading music and movies via their website .
And the verdict has been appealed , meaning that the website may remain unaffected for years – and become a standard - bearer for those who argue for a free flow of media and information over the Internet , unfettered by state and corporate control .
" There is a growing social movement around this issue in Sweden .
It goes beyond filesharing and downloading free music and movies , " says Daniel Johansson , a music and Internet analyst at Stockholm 's Royal Institute of Technology .
" It includes people who are concerned about surveillance laws and who feel the Internet is being developed by governments and corporations instead of the common man .
" The Pirate Bay , " he adds , " has a lot of sympathy right now . "
Within three days of the ruling , the Pirate Party – which campaigns for copyright reform – gained more than 15,000 new members , doubling in size to become the country 's fourth - largest political party .
Several Internet service providers ( ISPs ) , including Telia Sonera , the country 's largest , said they would not block The Pirate Bay website and would no longer keep records of any sites visited using their networks , thereby protecting their customers from potential lawsuits .
Why Sweden ?
Sweden developed a reputation as a haven for online piracy after it invested in high - speed broadband in the late 1990s and its reluctance to tackle filesharing became clear .
The presence of The Pirate Bay , one of the world 's largest , most brazen file - sharing operations – its founders held lectures titled " How To Dismantle A Multibillion Dollar Industry As A Hobby " – made the accusation hard to deny .
Until recently , politicians and police chiefs did little to enforce Internet copyright laws , says Jan Rosén , chairman of the Swedish Copyright Association .
" There was a laissez - faire attitude and the main political parties have been very reluctant to take a stance , " he says .
That stance may be related to the tradition of openness in the country , he says .
" The Internet has been seen as a media that is open and free .
Politicians were reluctant to challenge that view .
But eventually , criticism from overseas became too embarrassing and the government began to act more forcefully . "
Pressure from the global recording industry , as well as the US and Hollywood , led to police raids in 2006 .
The Pirate Bay 's servers were seized , yet the site was back in business within days , using other servers located in the Netherlands .
The ensuing publicity doubled the number of users , which eventually reached about 25 million , including more than 3 million registered members .
Ruling being appealed and resisted
Last week 's ruling was intended to send a strong signal , says Peter Danowsky , the lawyer representing the recording industry association , IFPI , in a case that sought nearly $ 14 million in compensation for lost revenue to artists .
" The Pirate Bay is one of the most devastating operations from a rights - holder 's perspective , not just because of the number of users but also because they are so clearly building and creating [ public ] opinion in favor of filesharing , " he said .
Mr. Danowsky believes the verdict will help turn the tide of public opinion .
" Until now , many disputed whether the website was illegal .
Some compared it to a car manufacturer , which cannot be held responsible if drivers do n't follow traffic rules , " he said .
The Internet providers ' refusal to block the website from their networks is tantamount to " siding with the Pirates , " argues Danowsky , adding that recording studios may consider further lawsuits to force them to act .
Yet as long as an appeal is pending , it is unclear whether they can succeed .
Still , downloaders are facing at least a few more constraints .
Sweden 's Internet battles opened on a wider front earlier this month when a tough new law came into force obliging ISPs to reveal the identities of customers suspected of uploading or downloading illegal content .
The day after the law came into force , Internet traffic dropped by a third , and in the months preceding it , tens of thousands began signing up for anonymizing services that hide computers on the Internet .
The ISPs ' recent decision to stop saving Internet traffic data is a response that will no doubt please many customers .
' A fight for the control of knowledge and culture '
Critics of new Internet legislation reaching statute books across Europe – Ireland recently introduced a " three strikes and you 're out " law , banning repeated copyright offenders from the Internet , and France is debating a similar approach – claim that the measures pose a growing threat to personal integrity and will hamper development of the Internet .
" To find out whether people are downloading copyrighted material , you need to control the Internet and sift through all communications , " says Rick Falkvinge , leader of The Pirate Party , who refers to the verdict as his party 's " ticket to the European Parliament " in next June 's elections .
" The establishment and politicians have declared war against a whole generation , " he says .
" This is a fight for the control of knowledge and culture . "
Magnus Eriksson , a spokesman for the Swedish file sharing lobby group Pirate Bureau , a driving force behind The Pirate Bay , echoes that sentiment .
" The freedom of the Internet is threatened now in a very real way , " he says .
" The danger is that the Internet will be turned into just a marketplace for copyright industries and the whole cultural and economic dynamic will be lost .
" Verdicts like this can scare people off developing new Internet networks and services because , if they contain links to copyrighted files , the owners could wind up in court . "
Daniel Johansson , at Stockholm 's Royal Institute of Technology , says that selling copies of music and movies is outdated in a digital age , and that the future of the entertainment industry lies in selling access over the Internet .
He cites the example of bands such as Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails , which have successfully cut out the middle man and sold their music directly to fans .
Stricter law enforcement may even accelerate moves to new models .
" More people are getting scared of downloading illegally now , and they are signing up for paying online services , " he says .
" We 're at the start of a major format shift that will probably last 10 years .
New legal services are coming online all the time , and verdicts like this will increase pressure on the industry to start working with them and making content available . "
One of the strangest pieces of common syntax in Objective - C is the line self = [ super init ] ; .
Without any explanation , this arrangement raises a few questions .
Does this line set the self value for the instance ?
Is self just a variable like any other ?
If so , why have it at all ?
I 'll address each of these questions and show how the compiler converts uses of self and method invocations .
Converting a method invocation
The first step to understanding the self parameter is to look at how the compiler converts a standard method invocation .
When you type the following :
MyClass * myObject = [ [ MyClass alloc ] initWithString : @ " someString " ] ;
The compiler converts this into function calls that look like this :
class myClass = objc_getClass ( " MyClass " ) ; SEL allocSelector = @selector ( alloc ) ; MyClass * myObject1 = objc_msgSend ( myClass , allocSelector ) ; SEL initSelector = @selector ( initWithString :) ; MyClass * myObject2 = objc_msgSend ( my Object1 , initSelector , @ " someString " ) ;
The compiler has slightly more efficient means of getting the class and SEL values but if you look at assembly code , you will see objc_msgSend calls for every method invocation .
So what is " self " ?
Every method that you declare has two hidden parameters : self and _cmd .
The following method :
- ( id ) initWithString : ( NSString * ) a String ;
is converted by the compiler to the following function call :
id initWithString ( id self , SEL _cmd , NSString * a String ) ;
The reality is that self is simply a hidden parameter on every method .
Like any other parameter , it receives its value from the function invocation .
Yes , _cmd is also a hidden parameter on every method that you can access if you choose .
In reality , there are few uses for the _cmd parameter except in obscure cases .
You can experiment with this by eliminating objc_msgSend and invoking the function for a method directly .
Instead of calling :
[ myObject someMethodWithParameter : someValue ] ;
You can reach your method implementation directly by recreating the work done by objc_msgSend .
SEL methodSelector = @selector ( someMethodWithParameter :) ; IMP someMethodFunction = class_getMethodImplementation ( [ myObject class ] , methodSelector ) ; someMethodFunction ( myObject , methodSelector , someValue ) ;
The only reason why self has a value on the inside of the someMethodWithParameter : implementation is because the pointer myObject is passed as the first parameter into someMethodFunction .
If you pass a different value as this first parameter , then self will have a different value on the inside of the method .
If you pass a value of a different class , you have a good chance of crashing the program .
The following section explains why .
Why have a " self " parameter at all ?
A method needs to know what data to act upon .
The self parameter tells the class the data to act upon and so is essential to object oriented programming .
This statement may seem a little strange , since you can easily implement a method without using the self parameter by name .
The reality is that the compiler uses the self parameter to resolve any reference to an instance variable inside a method .
If you had a class defined like this :
@interface MyClass : NSObject { NSInteger value ; } - ( void ) setValueToZero ; @end
then the method :
- ( void ) setValueToZero { value = 0 ; }
is converted by the compiler into :
void setValueToZero ( id self , SEL _cmd ) { self -> value = 0 ; }
So self is essential for accessing any instance variables , even if you never literally type " self " .
So does self already have a value when init is called ?
If you remember back at the start , I said that the initWithString : part of a typical [ [ MyClass alloc ] initWithString : @" someString " ] invocation is converted into an objc_msgSend call :
MyClass * myObject2 = objc_msgSend ( my Object1 , initSelector , @ " someString " ) ;
So by the time we get to the inside of the method , self already has a value ; its value is myObject1 ( i.e. the allocated object , as returned from the [ MyClass alloc ] call .
This is essential because without it , the super invocation would n't be possible — the self value is used by the compiler to send the invocation :
[ super init ] ;
becomes :
objc_msgSendSuper ( self , @selector ( init ) ) ;
Yes , self already has a value when your initializer starts .
In fact , it is almost guaranteed to be the correct , final value .
So why assign the value returned from [ super init ] to self ?
Looking at a typical initializer method :
- ( id ) initWithString : ( NSString * )
aString { self = [ super init ] ; if ( self ) { instanceString = [ a String retain ] ; } return self ; }
Why do we assign [ super init ] to self here ?
The textbook reason is because [ super init ] is permitted to do one of three things :
Return its own receiver ( the self pointer does n't change ) with inherited instance values initialized .
Return a different object with inherited instance values initialized .
Return nil , indicating failure .
In the first case , the assignment has no effect on self and the instanceString is set on in the original object ( the line instanceString = [ aString retain ] ; could have been the first line of the method and the result would be the same ) .
In the third case , the initialization has failed .
self is set to nil , no further action is taken and nil is returned .
The rationale for assigning to self is associated with the second case : if the returned object is different , we want the :
instanceString = [ a String retain ] ;
which gets converted to
self -> instanceString = [ a String retain ] ;
to act on the correct value , so we have to change the value of self to point to this new object .
It 's almost never required to initialize self
So the rationale for assigning to self is that the [ super init ] could return a different object and should initialize that different object instead of the old ( likely invalid ) object .
The question to consider is then : when would [ super init ] return a different object ?
The answer is that it will return different objects in one of the following situations :
Singleton object ( always returns the singleton instead of any subsequent allocation )
Other unique objects ( [ NSNumber numberWithInteger : 0 ] always returns the global " zero " object )
always returns the global " zero " object )
Class clusters substitute private subclasses when you initialize an instance of the superclass .
Classes which choose to reallocate the same ( or compatible ) class based on parameters passed into the initializer .
In all but the final case , continuing to initialize the returned object if it changes is a mistake — the returned object is already completely initialized and is n't necessary related to your class anymore .
So the list of three things that [ super init ] is permitted to return can now be expanded to four by splitting the " Return a different object " point into two :
Return its own receiver ( the self pointer does n't change ) with inherited instance values initialized .
Return an object of the same class , requiring further initialization .
Return a different object that is already completely initialized .
Return nil , indicating failure .
In this list , we now have two cases ( 2 and 3 ) which are incompatible .
The typical " assign [ super init ] to self " initializer handles cases 1 , 2 and 4 .
An init approach to handle cases 1 , 3 and 4 would actually be :
- ( id ) initWithString : ( NSString * )
aString { id result = [ super init ] ; if ( self == result ) { instanceString = [ a String retain ] ; } return result ; }
So class clusters , singletons and unique objects all use case 3 , putting dozens of Cocoa classes in this category .
I 'm only aware of NSManaged Object that uses case 2 .
Curiously then , while case 3 is overwhelmingly more common , initializers that support 1 , 2 and 4 but are incompatible with case 3 have become the standard .
Conclusion
Update : I have rewritten this conclusion to reflect the fact that I 'm not actually suggesting you should stop using " assign [ super init ] to self " initializers .
Thank you to everyone who invented creative ways to tell me I was wrong about this implication .
You do n't need to assign [ super init ] to self to make most classes work .
In some obscure cases , it is actually the wrong thing to do .
So why do we continue to assign to self ?
It 's the traditional template for an initializer , and although it 's wrong in some cases , it is right in other cases which have been written to expect this approach .
Further to this is the consideration that class clusters and other classes likely to return unrelated or different , fully initialized objects from their init methods are not supposed to be subclassed in a normal way — making code which favors them less relevant .
I will update this post as more news becomes available .
You can read a couple of different play - by - play accounts on the Twitter feeds of journalist Charlotte Eby and Republican Representative Renee Schulte .
It sounds as if leadership conferred for a while before Murphy ruled the resolution out of order .
Iowa Senate Majority leader Mike Gronstal , who refused to let a similar bill come to the Senate floor on Monday , was in the House chamber this morning speaking with House leaders .
Earlier today marriage equality opponents and supporters rallied at the Iowa capitol .
I was n't there , but Charlotte Eby provided the highlights .
Former State Representative Danny Carroll told the crowd that politicians who do n't listen to the word of God should be replaced .
Someone does n't seem to understand the constitution too well .
Unfortunately for Carroll and fortunately for us , the voters of Iowa House district 75 sent him packing in 2006 , and voted him down by a larger margin in his rematch against Eric Palmer last year .
One Iowa is the leading advocacy group for marriage equality in this state .
If you believe in their cause , please kick in a few bucks to support their organizing and education work .
Background :
The bill in question , House Joint Resolution 6 , proposes an amendment to the Iowa constitution stipulating that marriage is between one man and one woman ( here is the text ) .
The co-sponsors of HJR 6 are Republican Dwayne Alons ( not one of the brightest lights in Iowa politics ) and Democrat Dolores Mertz ( the kind of Democrat who votes against good labor bills and buries bills that would reduce pollution from factory farms ) .
The Iowa legislature 's " funnel " date passed in early March .
Under the normal rules of operation , bills that did not clear at least one House or Senate committee by that time were dead for the 2009 session .
UPDATE with more background on the procedure for amending the Iowa Constitution .
The normal amendment process requires that two separately elected Iowa legislatures approve the amendment before it goes on a general - election ballot .
Iowa Senate Majority Leader Mike Gronstal made clear on Monday that he will not allow a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage to come to the Iowa Senate floor .
Democrats hold a 32 - 18 majority in the upper chamber .
Assuming Gronstal holds the line next year as well , Republicans would need to retake the Iowa legislature in 2010 , pass an anti-gay marriage constitutional amendment in 2011 or 2012 , hold the Iowa legislature in 2012 , and pass the constitutional amendment again in 2013 or 2014 before the amendment would go to Iowa voters for approval .
There is another way to amend the Iowa constitution , which I discussed in more detail earlier this week .
Short version : an initiative on calling a Constitutional Convention will appear on the ballot in November 2010 .
If a simple majority of Iowans vote to call a Constitutional Convention , the Iowa legislature would have to draw up rule in 2011 for selecting delegates to that body , and the convention would occur in 2011 .
If any amendments are approved at the convention , they would go to Iowa voters is a special election , most likely to be held in late 2011 or early 2012 .
Iowans would not vote on proposed constitutional amendments as a bloc - - each would appear on the ballot as a separate item and would need a simple majority to pass .
Senate Majority leader Gronstal on Tuesday dared conservatives to push for this option .
From the Des Moines Register :
" I ’m inclined to hope they succeed , if that ’s their strategy , " said Senate Majority Leader Mike Gronstal , who has saluted Friday ’s Iowa Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage .
" There ’s a lot of good , progressive issues that we could pursue : a woman ’s right to choose , guaranteed health care for all Iowa citizens , workers ’ rights — so if there are people that want to help us get to a constitutional convention , that ’s kind of my dream world . "
UPDATE : One Iowa says this is not over yet .
Right - wing extremists are resorting to underhanded tactics in an attempt to undermine legislative leadership and take away the freedom to marry !
While legislative leadership stood firm this morning , extremists are attempting to overthrow the House chair and push an anti-marriage amendment to the floor !
We NEED you to call your Representative in the next hour to firm up our support !
Find your Representative here , then place a call immediately .
House Swithboard : 515-281-3221
Tell them to stand firm with legislative leadership and oppose this distracting and divisive move .
With all the challenges Iowa is facing , it ’s time for our elected officials to get back to work for Iowa families !
PS -
If you do n’t have time to call , please email your legislator now !
Iowans , take action , especially if your House rep is a Democrat .
YET ANOTHER UPDATE : The Des Moines Register explains House Speaker Murphy 's ruling :
Murphy 's ruling today stemmed from the fact that the House cannot suspend rules it has enacted jointly with the Senate .
House members can only suspend their own rules .
The only way to suspend the joint rules is for someone to introduce a resolution in the Rules and Administration Committee .
If it starts in the House , then there ’s a vote in House committee and in the full House .
If it passes , it goes to Senate committee then a vote of the full Senate .
That explains why Senate leader Gronstal was in the House chamber .
The Des Moines Register article also makes clear that House Republicans are n't giving up :
But Republicans hinted that they will make another run at the issue later today .
" We ’ll just let the day unfold , " said House Republican Leader Kraig Paulsen of Hiawatha .
He later added .
" The Legislature has a whole mass of rules and while you can use them sometimes to hide behind , sometimes they work to your advantage in other situations . "
I do n't pretend to know what rules he is referring to , but please tell all your friends in Iowa to contact their House representatives and ask them to respect the Iowa Supreme Court 's decision in Varnum v Brien .
YET ANOTHER UPDATE at 4 pm Central : More drama this afternoon , as Iowa House Republican Chris Rants tried to attach an amendment banning gay marriage to a bill on health care , according to Charlotte Eby .
House Speaker Murphy ruled the amendment out of order , but Rants moved to suspend rules .
Eby said " some Ds " voted with Republicans and named Mertz and Geri Huser , but the motion failed .
I do n't know whether Mertz and Huser were the only Democrats voting with Republicans on that bill .
If we can't defeat Huser in the 2010 primary with all the bad votes she 's cast , I do n't know what to say .
She did n't even have a Republican opponent in 2008 .
I am not giving a penny to the House Democratic leadership fund as long as any money could be spend defending incumbents like Mertz and Huser .
If it 's Sunday then it must be time for another Eurogamer writer to bury you nose - deep in their barren adolescence , pointing at a retro game and braying about it with bleary eyes for a few pages .
This week your hangover has been interrupted by a paean to Duke Nukem 3D , my love for which has recently been rejuvenated by the remarkably slick Good Old Games service and formerly its co-op enabled appearance on Xbox Live .
Despite the heavy snowfalls of retro adulation that blanket the gaming world from time to time , I find that I 've never truly been able to go back .
In the harsh light of the future - times in which we live , the games of yesteryear rarely live up to our what we remember - always turning out to be too easy , too hard , too bland , too repetitive , too brown or simply too well - known for anything other than a cursory sprint through the first level checking that all the health packs are in the same place and that its blood - stained halls have n't fallen into total rack and ruin .
Deep down I always feared this would be the case with Duke .
I rationally feared that any game that numbered the ability to fire a rocket launcher at a cinema screen showing two repeating frames of a porn movie among its greatest moments , or indeed occupy a wanking cubicle complete with grimy dustbin and toilet roll holder , may well have rendered my 15 - year - old self incapable of rational analytical thought .
Thankfully , I need n't have doubted myself - Duke Nukem 3D remains one of the highest watermarks the shooter genre has lapped up against , and in many areas still has n't been bettered to this day .
It also has a secret area that suggests Captain Picard of the USS Enterprise really likes playing with himself .
And aliens on the toilet .
Holoduke - never mind what it offered in gameplay , it was a chance to stand back and admire yourself .
So why does it demand a modern day foray through its red light districts , high - security prisons and very much forgotten ( for a good reason ) bits in space ?
What appealed to me most on my recent playthrough was the simple way levels are designed .
Imagine a top - down map of a modern shooter - lets say FEAR 2 if we fancy an easy target - and it'll invariably look like a sprayed - out can of heavily shadowed silly string .
Look at a Duke 3D map and , in its best levels admittedly , it 'll look like a building , or a street containing various buildings - solid structures with definable and recognisable geography that you 'll learn the intricacies of as if they were real places .
Say what you like about the multi- winged nature of olden - times shooters and their hefty reliance on keycards of various hues , but it 's great to play a game that 's free of the relentless forward push of modern linear FPS games .
Too often in today 's latest and greatest are environments treated as images to whiz past like images poorly superimposed on the car windows of a 1960s cinematic family who are going off on their holidays .
To borrow a phrase from Max Payne , shooters today have a tendency to be ' a linear sequence of scares ' without the balls to just say : ' This level happens in a post office / sushi restaurant / fast food joint / porn studio ( delete where appropriate ) .
It 's a bit like a building in the real world ; some of the doors are locked .
Deal with it .'
Cacodemons , it turns out , have nothing on these guys .
Sort of .
This is why , I feel , the best bits of a game like Call of Duty 4 take place within solid , realistic structures ( the TV studios , the hilltop village , the ship etc . ) .
It 's also the reason that Duke 's second , and more sprawling , episode of space - based shenanigans are so universally forgotten .
So we 've ticked off level design .
Next up : interactivity .
Remember the first level of Prey , the one that promised so much but was followed up with more squelch and farting than anything else ?
You could fiddle with the jukebox , turn taps on and off , watch TV ... it really was a marvel - until the aliens came along and stole the most - part of the interactive joy as well as your ladyfriend .
With far more meagre resources , Duke Nukem 3D even now retains a decent sensation of level fiddlery and manipulation throughout its running time .
If it still feels fresh , so no wonder our badly - haircutted selves were so blown away back in 1996 .
Light switches , urinals , shootable switches , pool tables , strippers , CCTV monitors .
They 're repeated throughout the game , but it 's a mentality that seeped into level design too .
According to the guidebooks , they do it so strenuously that women would very much like to defenestrate the custom .
An NYPD patrolman has been accused of raping an intoxicated female executive after the cop and his partner responded to a 911 call from her cabdriver , who said she needed help getting up to her apartment .
The officers raced to the aid of the woman , who had vomited and was disoriented during the ride home to her East Village apartment on Dec. 7 .
They got her safely in the door and later returned to check on her condition , two law - enforcement sources familiar with the investigation said .
But when they came back a second time , the older of the two cops allegedly assaulted the woman , raping her while his partner stood by , the sources said .
The next day , the woman – a successful business exec who had been out on the town with a group of female colleagues – told a friend about the attack and called the Manhattan District Attorney ’s Office , they said .
Neither cop has been arrested , but both have been put on modified duty .
“ It looks pretty bad for the cops , ” said an NYPD source .
“ It ’s not good for us .
It ’s going to make all of our jobs tougher . ”
Paul Browne , the NYPD spokesman , would not comment on the case , but a police official confirmed that there was “ an active investigation , ” and sources said the two cops were expected to be charged .
But the suspects ’ attorney , Stephen Worth , said , “ The fact that there have been no arrests makes it obvious that the prosecutors have some questions about the veracity of the complainant ’s allegations . ”
The woman underwent a rape exam and investigators meticulously combed her apartment looking for evidence , sources said .
Investigators found surveillance videotape from the accuser ’s building at 13th Street and Avenue A , showing the officers coming and going multiple times on the night of the alleged crime .
They searched the officers ’ station - house lockers , where they found heroin and personal information of other women in the locker of the older cop , the sources said .
Both tested negative for illegal drugs , they said .
The two officers met with prosecutors but came with their lawyers and refused to answer questions , the sources said .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
An American mother of newborn octuplets says she will do a documentary series following her babies until they are 18 years old , but the production company says it is still in “ exclusive negotiations ” for the deal .
California Octuplets mom Nadya Suleman has a new Web site ( www.thenadyasulemanfamily.com) shown in this screenshot taken on February 11 , 2009 .
The site is dedicated to her brood of newborns .
Suleman , 33 , widely criticized for undergoing fertility treatments when she already had six children , has expressed confidence in her ability to care for her brood .
REUTERS/www.thenadyasulemanfamily.com
Nadya Suleman , who gave birth to six boys and two girls in Los Angeles on January 26 , said she would allow a television crew to film her family six times a year .
The babies are only the second known set of octuplets born alive in the United States .
“ It is official .
I ’m going to be doing a show , but it ’s not a reality show , ” Suleman told Life & Style magazine , adding that the series would be made by the British arm of independent production company Eyeworks .
“ What I ’m doing with this TV show is basically creating documentaries about the lives of my children .
It ’s going to be an ongoing thing , and it will follow them from now until they are 18 , ” she said .
Suleman said the show would be aired in Britain and then possibly the United States .
But Eyeworks Chief Executive Officer Reinout Oerlemans said in a statement on Wednesday that the company was still in “ exclusive negotiations ” with Suleman for “ an unscripted format following the life of Nadya and her children . ”
“ Nadya ’s story is a very unique and exciting one that needs to be told in the right manner , ” Oerlemans said .
“ We are confident that we are the right party to tell their story around the world . ”
Suleman became a lightning rod for public ridicule after it was learned that she was a divorced , jobless mother of six living with her parents on government assistance when she became pregnant with octuplets through in vitro fertilization .
Suleman -- nicknamed “ Octomom ” in the U.S. media -- has since moved into a new home with her children and the last of the octuplets was released from the hospital this week .
The Smoking Gun website , www.thesmokinggun.com, reported on Wednesday that Suleman has applied to trademark the name “ Octomom . ”
It posted online an application said to be made by Suleman to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office .
“ The Obama administration ’s actions today , ” Mr. Bond said , “ will do more to endanger families , farmers and workers with new energy taxes and lost jobs than it does to protect the environment . ”
As the E.P.A. begins the process of regulating the climate - altering substances under the Clean Air Act , Congress is writing wide - ranging energy and climate legislation that would alter , combine with or override the actions taken by the agency .
Mr. Obama and Ms. Jackson have said they much prefer that Congress address global warming rather than have the E.P.A. tackle it through administrative action that could be subject to lawsuits .
When the agency announced its finding , Mr. Obama was en route from Mexico City to Trinidad and Tobago for a meeting of Western Hemisphere nations .
The agency made its decision public in a news release and an 133 - page explanation of the scientific and legal basis of its proposed finding .
In 2007 , the Supreme Court , in Massachusetts v. E.P.A. , ordered the agency to determine whether heat - trapping gases harmed the environment and public health .
The case was brought by states and environmental groups to force the E.P.A. to use the Clean Air Act to regulate heat - trapping gases in vehicle emissions .
Agency scientists were virtually unanimous in determining that those gases caused such harm , but top Bush administration officials suppressed their work and took no action .
In his first days in office , Mr. Obama promised to review the case and act quickly if the findings were justified .
The announcement Friday was the fruit of that review .
According to the E.P.A. announcement , the finding was based on rigorous scientific analysis of six gases  carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxide , hydrofluorocarbons , perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride  that have been widely studied by scientists .
The agency said its studies showed that concentrations of the gases were at unprecedented levels as a result of human activity and that it was highly likely that those elevated levels were responsible for an increase in average temperatures and other climate changes .
For several weeks now , we have watched as one idiot Republican spokesman after another has stepped up to the microphone and whined endlessly about how much they do n’t like anything or anyone .
It ’s been embarrassing to say the least .
I guess when you ’ve been kicked in the ass , it ’s difficult to lick your wounds .
And honestly , watching Ann Coulter , Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh lick their wounds is more than my stomach can handle .
But now we have a small group of Democrats who have decided to kiss those same kicked asses .
They want to stop the President ’s agenda .
Really ?
We barely survived 8 years of the Bush / Cheney administration and now we have the opportunity to correct those mistakes and take the country in a new direction .
So what could these Don’t - 0 - crats be thinking ?
From what I can tell , the Obama agenda emphasizes healthcare , education and energy .
I just do n’t understand how anyone can argue those priorities .
Let ’s take them one at a time .
Healthcare .
The argument for fixing healthcare is that it is too expensive and too many people do n’t have insurance .
Seems pretty clear to me .
The argument against it would be that it is too expensive to fix so poor families including children should just suffer and die needlessly .
Hmmm .
If anyone knows Senator Evan Bayh , can you ask him if he enjoys the government sponsored health insurance plan he gets as a Senator ?
Education .
The argument for spending money on education is that the United States has fallen from the best in the world to middle of the pack .
In fact students in the United States now rank behind students in 28 other countries in problem solving , 27 other countries in Math and 21 other countries in Science .
The argument for not prioritizing education is … uhh… hnmm ….
I do n’t know .
Maybe Senator Bayh can hire someone from Korea ( 1 ) , China ( 2 ) , Japan ( 4 ) or even Poland ( 25 ) to solve that problem for us .
Energy .
The argument for prioritizing energy issues and in particular green energy efforts would be our dependency on foriegn oil and climate issues .
The argument against it would be that ExxonMoblile profits in 2008 were $ 45.2 billion .
That is almost enough money to cover the cost of 5 months of the war in Iraq .
I do n’t know Margaret .
I am just so tired of fighting .
I thought this last election meant something but it seems that 16 Democrats have proven me and about 69 million Americans who voted for Obama wrong .
And for goodness sakes , one of these Don’t - O- crats is Joe Lieberman .
Who did n’t see that coming ?
Left ?
Right ?
In the middle ?
Breathing ?
You just do n’t know with that guy .
This Purple Party idea is sounding better and better each day .
Are you represented by one of these 16 Don’t - O - crats ?
If so , I want to know what you think .
Really .
I mean it .
A theory on popular media : the more popular it is , the less the information it provides bears any semblance to accuracy , truth , or scientific fact .
As the audience size grows - meaning that any given topic is going to be far outside the specialty knowledge of nearly all of the audience members - any urge to accuracy is completely subsumed by the need for do and say things that will keep that audience 's fleeting attention .
I think this principle is fairly well illustrated by Oprah and company 's present examination of calorie restriction and some related topics in medical research in the context of enhanced human longevity .
There 's a style to this sort of thing , in which the presenters construct a framework for their article or show that ostensibly bears some semblance to the underlying reality under discussion , but within which a majority of the " facts " provided are simply wrong , chosen for their ability to grasp attention rather than any scientific backing they may have .
Hence for a discussion of longevity , wild and unsupported claims are fair game .
At the present time , the scientific consensus is that human practice of calorie restriction will not greatly enhance maximum longevity , but does greatly improve health and greatly reduce risk of age - related disease .
That is n't as exciting , however , as earlier speculation on attaining 120 year or more life spans , so the more exciting " fact " is what gets aired :
Dr . Oz says calorie restriction is the number one way doctors say we can extend longevity .
" The data that we have in rodents and some larger animals now indicate you can probably extend your life expectancy by up to 50 percent potentially from doing this , " he says .
Freedom of speech bears just as much of an implied caveat emptor for the listener as any other freedom .
Expect people to lie to you ( by omission , laziness , or more direct motives ) when it serves their own self - interest more than telling you the truth - which is the case for almost all popular media serving large audiences .
“ With conventional monetary policy having reached its limit , any further policy stimulus requires a different set of tools . ” ~ Ben Bernanke , April 3 .
I have this mental image of Bernanke and a dozen other Ph.D. - holding economists laboring over a car .
Its hood is up .
It is stalled at the side of the road .
It is about an hour from Yuma , Arizona , the fan belt capital of the world .
Bernanke has a tool kit next to him .
It is filled with brand - new metric tools .
He is working on a used Plymouth .
The problem is , the car they are working on is not their car .
It ’s ours .
In the good old days , the FED ’s tool kit was simple : expand the monetary base , lower the federal funds rate at which banks lend to each other overnight , and issue a press release about the mandate for economic recovery .
It ’s not working any more .
THE ULTIMATE TRAP
The FED has increased the monetary base to such an extent that there is now way to turn back without risking not merely a recession , which we are in , but a depression , which the FED has inflated to avoid .
This is clear to anyone who understands the Austrian theory of the business cycle .
The FED has moved into panic mode .
Yet it has been unsuccessful so far in stemming the tide of recession .
The Federal deficit is now out of control .
When Congress consents to a $ 1.8 trillion deficit , it no longer exercises the power of the purse .
The FED will have to fund whatever the private markets will not fund , which now appears to be whatever foreign investors refuse to fund .
They sold a quarter of a trillion dollars in Treasury debt in February and March .
These debt certificates constituted an increase in supply on the capital markets .
These unexpected sales would have raised Treasury interest rates had the FED not intervened to buy more Treasury debt .
The question of questions now is this .
When banks at last decide that this economy is safe enough to lend into , the excess reserves that they hold at the FED will flow into the economy .
This will put the FED ’s balance sheet into play .
The fractional reserve banking process will take over .
M1 will increase by 100 % .
It will not be offset by a decline in the M1 money multiplier .
The fun will begin .
Bernanke understands this .
He knows what will happen to the money supply unless the FED increases reserve requirements to offset the increase in the monetary base .
The FED can do this , of course .
But then it is back to square 1 : the recession that its increased spending will have overcome will return .
He is in a lobster trap .
He says he can get out .

For the past two years , a team of UCLA Egyptologists , digital modelers , web designers , staff and students has been building a three - dimensional virtual - reality model of the ancient Egyptian religious site known as Karnak , one of the largest temple complexes ever constructed .
The result is Digital Karnak , a high - tech model that runs in real time and allows users to navigate 2,000 years of history at the popular ancient Egyptian tourist site near modern - day Luxor , where generations of pharaohs constructed temples , chapels , obelisks , sphinxes , shrines and other sacred structures beginning in the 20th century B.C .
Developed by UCLA 's Experiential Technologies Center — which has helped pioneer the digital reconstruction of historical sites , including the innovative Rome Reborn , released in 2006 — the Karnak model and a host of additional digital resources are now available for educators , students , scholars and the public to explore for free at http://dlib.etc.ucla.edu/projects/Karnak.
The website features videos from the 3 - D model , instructional resources for educators , a Google Earth version of the model and pages detailing the chronology and construction of individual structures at the temple complex .
The collective resources offer a window onto the incredibly rich architectural , religious , economic , social and political history of ancient Egypt .
" The Digital Karnak project builds upon UCLA 's expertise merging research and multidimensional technologies to inform and preserve knowledge about historic sites , " said project director Diane Favro , a professor in the architecture and urban design department at the UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture .
" This learning platform allows educators and researchers to geo- temporally situate information and thus visualize and interrogate the evolution of Karnak over 2,000 years . "
In recent years , scientists , historians and archaeologists around the world have embraced the 3 - D modeling of cultural heritage sites .
Information technology has permitted them to recreate buildings and monuments that no longer exist or to digitally restore sites that have been damaged by the passage of time .
The results can be used both in research , to test new theories , and in teaching , to take students on virtual tours of historical sites they are studying .
The Experiential Technologies Center ( ETC ) at UCLA , which promotes the critical incorporation of new technologies into research and teaching , has been a leader in this cutting - edge movement , having digitally reconstructed a wide variety of sites of historical and cultural importance in Europe , the Middle East , South America and the Caribbean .
Favro , who directs the ETC , brings her expertise as an architectural and urban historian to these digital cultural - mapping projects , as well as her familiarity with the challenges and impact of large - scale interdisciplinary projects .
Digital Karnak co-director Willeke Wendrich is an associate professor of Egyptian archaeology in the UCLA Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures and director of the Egyptian Lab at the UCLA Cotsen Institute of Archaeology .
She is the editor - in - chief of the UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology , an award - winning digital encyclopedia that has been supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities since 2005 .
She is also a member of the Science Board of Digital Antiquity .
The Digital Karnak project is funded and supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Steinmetz Family of Los Angeles .

You know Brent , it ’s been interesting because Fox News covered these Tea Parties , and we were one of the only organizations to give it any publicity or p.r. prior to the fact that it happened , and it was so under - covered by virtually every news organization .
Why is that ?
Why was it so ignored up until the very last day by virtually everyone .

TEHRAN , March 13 ( Reuters ) - President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad dismissed international sanctions against Iran as a “ childish idea ” on Friday as he officially launched a natural gas project in the Gulf , Iranian media reported .
The comments came a day after U.S. President Barack Obama said he was extending economic sanctions against Tehran as it continued to pose an “ extraordinary threat ” to the national security , foreign policy and economy of the United States .
Obama declared the routine extension of punitive measures imposed by former U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1995 in a public notice on Thursday .
Ahmadinejad said the idea of creating obstacles for Iran ’s development with sanctions was “ a childish idea and a big mistake , ” the official IRNA news agency reported .

This is a little unnerving because it means that these people have hired firms to do robo calling .
To numbers which should be unlisted , as mine is .
Now , the phone call only tried to stimulate awareness of the tea parties .
It did not tell me where to go if I wanted to go to one .
It gave no hint as to what they are about .
( And it was also very annoying because I 've got my own work to do and I do n't like being interrupted to get a phone call from a computer . )
But it does mean that these people are trying to organize ( albeit badly ) even more and are even spending money on their ill - conceived notions .
UPDATE :
I want to let everyone know that I took lostboyjim 's advice and checked to see if my husband put this number in the Do Not Call database ( we married since he did it , so excuse my ignorance ) .
And our number IS in the database , and so I have filed a complaint .
Hopefully others will do the same and some of these people will get in trouble .
I do n't like having to drop what I 'm working on for anything so idiotic .
One of my favorite public art pieces in New York City is probably familiar to anyone who has ever waited in line for the Liberty Island Ferry .
Located on the west side of Battery Park , the American Merchant Mariners ’ Memorial is a haunting tribute to commercial seamen who lost their lives , for whatever reason , on the water .
The memorial , designed by artist Marisol , was based on a true event during World War II , in which a Nazi U - boat attacked an American merchant marine vessel .
While the marines held on to their sinking vessel , the Nazis photographed the victims , then left .
The memorial is directly inspired by one of those photographs .
As you can see above , two men are desperately crying for help while a third tries to pull a victim from the water .
I ca n’t tell you how moving this is at high tide , when the water laps at the man .
There is an unbelievable desperation in the piece , as the man struggles , veins practically bursting out of his arm , to grab hold of the seaman above and salvation as the merciless ocean tries to drag him down .
It ’s all the more disturbing when you read the final line of the memorial ’s plaque : “ Left to the perils of the sea , the survivors later perished . ”
Despite their valiant efforts , they were dead from the start .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
On the same day that Vermont 's House and Senate voted to override GOP Gov. Jim Douglas ' veto of a bill legalizing same - sex marriage in the state , the Washington City Council voted 12- 0 Tuesday in favor of allowing same - sex marriages performed in other states to be recognized in the nation 's capital .
Congress may vote on whether Washington will allow same - sex marriages to be accepted in the nation 's capital .
But nothing is set in stone yet .
The Washington council is expected to hold a final vote on May 5 .
The bill would then go to Mayor Adrian Fenty , a Democrat who supports gay marriage but told WTOP.com Tuesday that he has yet to review the legislation .
If approved , the measure would then encounter its biggest potential hurdle :
It would be sent to Congress for a legislative review and vote , setting up what would amount to a straight up - or - down vote on same - sex marriage .
Because Washington is not a state , its legislation must pass congressional muster .
Some measures approved by overwhelmingly Democratic Washington voters , including a restrictive gun law and a proposal decriminalizing medical marijuana use , have been vetoed by Congress in recent years .
" This is a right that should be enjoyed by all of our citizens , " Council Member Jack Evans , a Democrat , said in an interview with WTOP .
" Today is another major step toward the ultimate goal of all of us living in a city and a country where everyone is treated equally . "
The Human Rights Campaign , the nation 's largest lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender civil rights organization , urged federal lawmakers not to intervene .
" We look forward to the final Council votes , and urge Mayor Fenty to sign this common - sense legislation , " Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese said .
" We also hope that Congress will respect the Council 's votes and will respect the District of Columbia 's choice to provide equal recognition for couples who have legally entered into relationships in other jurisdictions . "
Family Research Council President Tony Perkins on Tuesday condemned the votes in Vermont and Washington .
" Same - sex ' marriage ' is a movement driven by wealthy homosexual activists and a liberal elite determined to destroy not only the institution of marriage , but democracy as well .
Time and again , we see when citizens have the opportunity to vote at the ballot box , they consistently opt to support traditional marriage , " Perkins said .
" The radical left wants to destroy the traditional union of one man and one woman across the country and they will not rest until they do so .
The marriage amendment movement has been many times more successful than the same - sex ' marriage ' movement , " Perkins added .
Washington law currently provides domestic partnerships for lesbian , gay and heterosexual couples .
The partnerships give access to the rights and responsibilities of marriage .
Four states recognize marriage for gay and lesbian couples : Connecticut , Massachusetts , Iowa and Vermont .
Iowa 's recognition of same - sex marriages is slated to begin later this month ; Vermont 's would begin in September .
Conservative blogger Rod Dreher , writing on BeliefNet.com , a Web site that covers spirituality and religion , said the same - sex marriage rulings show the Democratic process at work .
While Dreher is opposed to same - sex marriage , he said if states are going to have it , " Vermont just got it the right way : democratically , through legislative action . "
" A social experiment as radical as same - sex marriage should not be attempted without democratic consensus , " he wrote .
Dreher said he believes the U.S. Supreme Court will ultimately have to rule on same - sex marriages and most likely find them constitutional .

" And that being the case , it might be better for my side if it gets done sooner rather than later .
If done sooner , there might still be enough backlash left in the American people to get a constitutional amendment passed erecting a high barrier or protection around religious institutions , " he said .
For openly gay conservative blogger Andrew Sullivan , the Washington ruling , while preliminary , is " enough reason to celebrate . "
" I have a chance to be legally married in the place I live for eight months of the year .
Now , just think for a minute how many heterosexuals have ever asked themselves this question -- even immigrating to foreign countries , let alone moving from one state to another , " Sullivan wrote on his blog , featured on The Atlantic 's Web site .
" This is enough for me right now .
It has been such a long journey , but we can see the mountaintop now , " he said .

If you ’re an American freethinker who ’s envious of the success of the atheist bus campaign in Europe , this is your chance .
The Freedom from Religion Foundation is launching its own campaign to put pro-atheist messages on buses and trains in America , with six ads already designed that feature quotes from famous freethinkers both historical and modern .
The ads are already up on buses in Madison , and if enough donations come in , the FFRF plans to take the campaign to major cities like New York .
If we ’re going to counter the outsized influence of religious interests in politics and popular culture , we need to fight back and speak out , and with this campaign , you can help .
The FFRF has done fantastic work , both defending church - state separation in court and promoting atheism in the media , and they deserve our support .
Donate today – even just a few dollars , if that ’s all you can afford – and help bring this message of freethought to cities across America !
You can even vote on what the ads should say .
With all that said , I want to add a few words about what our media strategy should be , and what we can hope these ads will accomplish .
There are many people , especially religious fundamentalists , who have n’t grasped what atheists are setting out to achieve .
Their lack of comprehension can clearly be seen in the pro-religion response ads that have run in several cities where atheist messages have aired :
Three separate pro-God advert campaigns on the sides of London buses are set to hit city streets .
Buses adorned with the slogan “ There definitely is a God ” are from the Christian Party , while the Trinitarian Bible Society chose a Biblical verse .
In response to the arrival in Calgary of an international bus ad campaign questioning the existence of God , local pro-religion forces have raised about $ 12,000 to buy ads on eight Calgary Transit buses and two transit trains .
The ads , which will start appearing Monday , will read , “ God cares for everyone … even for those who say He does n’t exist . ”
Two Christian - based groups have purchased advertisements with Washington D.C. Metro buses to counter the atheist “ Why Believe in a God ? ” bus campaign with their own pro-God Christmas ads .
… The pro-God ads will read : “ Why Believe ?
Because I created you and I love you , for goodness ’ sake – GOD . ”
Clearly , these religious groups assume that persuasion is merely a matter of who can speak at greater volume .
If they can “ balance ” atheist ads with an equal number of theist ads , the thinking goes , they will cancel out any impact of the former and ensure that the atheist ad campaign does n’t make any converts .
With traditional ad campaigns this might make sense , but it ’s the wrong paradigm to use here .
As I wrote in my post about the 2008 ARIS , the number of Americans who self - identify as atheist or agnostic has more than doubled , to 3.6 million , since 1990 .
But the number of Americans who are atheists , based on their stated beliefs , is far higher – as high as 12 % of Americans , over 36 million people .
What this shows is that there ’s still a broad gap – tens of millions of Americans – who agree with our position , but have n’t taken the step of formally declaring themselves atheists , much less joining a group like the FFRF .
It is these people whom we can expect to reach with these ads .
For nonbelievers who thought they were alone in the world , we can show them that there is a community that shares their views ; for people who doubt religion but are wary of atheism because of the negative stereotypes spread about us , we can persuade them that being an atheist can be a positive and praiseworthy decision .
Our primary goal , at least in this stage , should n’t be to convert the religious , but to unite nonbelievers and to bring all the loose and drifting atheists into the fold .
These people are eminently reachable , and if we can reach all or even most of them , we ’ll have a formidable platform from which to further promote our message .
By contrast , I doubt the pro-theism bus ads will accomplish much .
Our culture is saturated with religion , and it ’s safe to assume that anyone who wants to join a church has already done so .
They , unlike us , do not have low - hanging fruit to reach .
Their presence is abundantly obvious ; if they want to spend yet more money broadcasting it , let them go ahead !
We can get on with the important work of building a secular community while they train their fire on the wrong target .
Sometimes the truth hurts .
Real estate salesman Jim Klinge does n’t care .
Cruising through the sunny hills of Carlsbad in a massive silver Mercedes - Benz , he looks like any other pitchman of the California dream .
But Klinge , 50 , has become a notorious Internet chronicler of the real estate crash in north San Diego County , where he has lived and worked for decades .
Rather than downplay the greed and excess that caused the region ’s travails , he revels in exposing them .
Advertisement
He surveys the wreckage with a pocket video camera , shooting footage of vacant , once - pricey houses turned into eyesores , voiced over with his deadpan narration .
Then he posts them on his website , at www.bubbleinfo.com.
They ’re shaky , noisy clips full of coarse images and language .
“ Would you spend a million dollars for that house ? ” he says in one video , showing a two - story , boxy wreck with the rushing sound of a freeway in the background .
Why does he do it ?
To sell houses .
Advertisement
Klinge is a real estate broker , has been since 1984 .
He just does n’t act like one .
In the summer of 2005 , Klinge says , he sensed the housing crash coming .
He had been through the real estate downturn in the early 1990s and was wary that the red - hot market could n’t last .
But his real estate industry colleagues continued to declare that home values would keep soaring .
Most agreed with David Lereah , then the chief economist for the National Assn. of Realtors , who finessed the question of the market bubble this way : “ I could think of froth as effervescence rather than some popping of bubbles , ” he told the San Francisco Chronicle in June 2005 .
Advertisement
Klinge heard the same thing from fellow brokers in San Diego .
He felt that such talk emboldened buyers to take on more debt than they could afford and prompted sellers to ask too much for their houses , which would cost them time and money as their homes went unsold .
He started blogging , his first post questioning the 20 % to 30 % annual home price appreciation in some neighborhoods , and arguing that “ sellers have gotten too optimistic and are pricing their houses WAY too high . ”
Nowadays , Klinge said , his blog gets about 2,000 unique visitors per day .
About half his clients now come to him from the blog , Klinge said .
He closed 43 house deals last year , he said , down from the 61 sales and purchases he brokered in his peak year of 2004 , but enough to keep him in business when many agents have quit .
Lately , his videos have been picked up on Calculated Risk , an influential economics blog whose followers include Nobel laureate Paul Krugman .
In one clip , the camera pans across the kitchen of a million - dollar fixer near Interstate 5 .
He pointedly notes the house ’s proximity to the freeway , which he calls the “ De- troit river . ”
There ’s mold under the sink and a foot - sized hole in the drywall just above the floor .
“ December 2006 this house sold for a million dollars , ” he says .
“ Nineteen hundred square feet , built in ’ 78 , right across the freeway .
One million . ”

On the off - chance the real estate agent who sold the place is watching , Klinge puts in a request : “ I want you to put your mai tai down , go grab your shingle and send it in to the DRE [ California Department of Real Estate ] right now .
You do n’t deserve a job , ” he says .
“ Everyone who was on that deal deserves to be fired , even the janitor at the escrow company .
This is embarrassing , $ 1 million .
Right now it ’s listed at $ 575,000 and that ’s probably optimistic . ”
Along with the house wreck videos , the site includes statistics on local home sales totals and price declines .
Klinge has skewered brokers on the blog , calling them names like “ clown ” and “ cherry - picking cheerleader ” for not admitting that the housing market had tumbled .
But he said no one had gotten upset enough to retaliate .
Klinge did n’t start out as the Hunter S. Thompson of real estate .
He used to believe .
In 1987 , just three years into his career , Klinge had set up his own office in La Jolla and was riding the rising real estate market .
He was convinced home prices would keep soaring .
“ Everybody wants to live in La Jolla , ” he said , repeating what he and everyone else were saying then .
Advertisement
Klinge learned the hard way that even chic beach communities go down when the housing market tanks .
“ By the end of 1990 I could not find a buyer .
I had no idea what to do , I had no history or experience ” with a down market , Klinge said , “ like a lot of agents today . ”
He closed his office and became a mortgage broker .
Arranging refinances got him through the 1990s real estate slump , and he returned to home - selling in 1995 .
Klinge said the 1990 real estate downturn made him cautious as home prices skyrocketed in this decade .
“ I never got overly bubbleicious , ” he said .
His blog ’s underlying theme , he said , has been “ You ca n’t forget this is a regular business cycle .
There are ups and downs , and you ’ve got to plan for that . ”
He knew the market was headed for a crash , he said , one day in July 2005 , when he had just come home from a family trip to Disney World and answered the phone .
The woman on the line had seen a house that Klinge was selling .
Advertisement
“ Up until that point , the only thing buyers wanted to know was how much over list they needed to offer .
All of a sudden this lady was being critical of everything , the property , the price .
I hung up the phone and told my wife , ‘ It ’s over , ’ ” he said .
A few weeks later , he started blogging .
His wife , Donna , who helps manage the family brokerage , was nervous .
“ He was really pushing the envelope with the blog , taking people on , naming names , ” she said .
“ I took deep breaths .
I did n’t know how it would turn out . ”
She said she was shocked one day to see a photo on the blog of two young men sitting on the floor of a house with their wrists bound like prisoners .
They had been squatting in a foreclosed house Jim was selling , and he had sneaked up on them as they slept and tied them up with plastic zip ties in a brazen citizen ’s arrest .
But Donna , who began dating Jim when they were at Cal State Fullerton in the early 1980s , had after 20 years of marriage grown accustomed to his provocative style .
So far , he ’s known when to stop pushing , both on the blog and with her and their two daughters , she said .
Advertisement
He also manages to keep things civil with his industry colleagues , a notoriously upbeat lot .
Kris Berg , another San Diego County real estate broker who writes a blog as sweet as Klinge ’s is sour , says Klinge “ is a nice guy , a great guy . ”
Does he offend other real estate brokers ?
Berg said she ’s not heard anything directly , but is sure he must , simply because “ there ’s an inherent danger when you take transparency to that level .
You ’re going to alienate people , ” she said .
Klinge figures that if he alienates some real estate agents but attracts more customers , it ’s all worth it .
Marc Needham , 33 , was a fan of Klinge ’s blog for a year before becoming a client .
He and his wife had looked for a house for a few months in 2007 with another agent but became fed up .
“ We had banks lying to us ; our previous real estate agent lied to us , ” he said .
Advertisement
Needham said the agent and lenders told him the housing market would soon rebound and pushed him to pursue houses he felt he could n’t afford , places he said would have required spending 40 % to 45 % of his income on house payments .
Needham , a Web marketing director for a hospital chain , said he appreciated that Klinge agreed with his view that the housing market was more likely to keep falling than to quickly bounce back .
Represented by Klinge , the Needhams bought a four - bedroom house in Encinitas last year for $ 580,000 .
Needham said his house is probably worth less now , but he expected the decline , and Klinge also helped him avoid properties with problems he did not see .
Klinge recently took a reporter along when he visited a house with Christine Liashek , 29 , a first - time home buyer .
He did more warning than selling .
She was drawn to a cozy , 1960s three - bedroom Carlsbad house with a swimming pool .
It was just the size she and her husband -- they have a dog but no children -- were looking for .
Standing in the living room , Liashek looked to Klinge for his opinion .
Advertisement
“ That was the high school out there , ” Klinge said , nodding his head toward the front door , “ You ’re going to have night football games , people parking here , ” Klinge told her .
“ The baseball field ’s out there too .
You ’ll probably hear the batting practice . ”
Liashek still liked the house enough to ask him to show it to her husband later , which Klinge agreed to do .
Then she asked him about a new home development nearby .
“ I call it Foreclosure Ranch , ” Klinge said .
“ The reputation concerns me .
It ’s probably the worst place in Carlsbad for foreclosures , and it ’ll be hard to shake that , ” he warned .
Liashek and her husband passed on the new development and the house near the high school .
Advertisement
But they ’re still looking with Klinge .
Unlike previous generations of home buyers , who relied on their real estate agents to provide them with lists of homes to view , Liashek finds properties herself on websites such as SDlookup.com , Redfin and ZIP Realty and e-mails Klinge the addresses of houses she ’s interested in .
Klinge will let her know which ones are n’t worth a visit .
“ He ’ll say this one ’s under power lines , that one ’s by the freeway , that one ’s in a bad school district , ” Liashek said .
“ You do not have to waste your time going around in circles with Jim , ” she said .
“ I really appreciate that honesty . ”
But do n’t expect other agents to start bad - mouthing one another ’s houses and tying up teenagers .

Or even , Klinge says , highlighting the risks in a shaky market .
“ They ’re chicken , ” Klinge said .

As close encounters go , the claim by a woman that an alien attempted to seduce her on a country road sounds far - fetched , but files released today reveal that it was considered serious enough for the Ministry of Defence to investigate .
The Norfolk woman who claimed she was approached by a man who said he came from another planet similar to Earth was questioned by the MoD intelligence branch DI55 , whose brief was to investigate credible UFO reports .
She told them that , during their 10 - minute chat , the man said his race was responsible for creating crop circles and explained the importance of contact between humans and his own people .
The woman , whose identity is not revealed in the government 's " X - Files " , was described by officials as " agitated " following the incident in which she " heard a loud buzzing noise behind her , then turned to witness a large , glowing spherical object rise steadily until it disappeared " .
The claims were examined by DI55 ( whose very existence was denied by the government until recently ) and described by an intelligence official as " one of our most unusual UFO reports " .
Other cases include the description of a black inverted boomerang - shaped UFO by two experienced air traffic controllers at Heathrow .
The sighting , from the airport 's control tower on the morning of 17 December 1992 , came a week after numerous witnesses in Louth , Lincolnshire , reported seeing three lights attached to a large , triangular craft .
Today 's release of the MoD documents also sheds light on one of Britain 's most infamous UFO episodes , namely the death of an American air force pilot , Captain William Schaffner , whom conspiracy theorists believe was killed during a high - speed duel with aliens above the North Sea .
On the evening of 8 September 1970 , Schaffner 's RAF Lightning crashed into the sea during a low - level exercise following take - off from RAF Binbrook , Lincolnshire .
Schaffner 's body was never found , which became significant after claims that Schaffner 's plane was scrambled to intercept UFOs .
Although the 28 - year - old 's death continues to be attributed by some internet sites to a secret war between aliens and earthlings , the MoD files contain a previously unreleased summary of the original RAF Board of Inquiry report into the crash , which makes no mention of UFOs .
It concluded that the pilot 's death was a tragic accident .
Dr David Clarke , a lecturer in journalism at Sheffield Hallam University and author of Flying Saucerers : A Social History of UFOlogy , said : " From suspected US Air Force spy planes to Russian rockets burning up in the atmosphere , these new files show the many and varied explanations for UFO reports submitted to the MoD .
Making the material available allows us all to make an informed decision on the mystery of UFOs . "
One of the themes to emerge from these papers is the Aurora spy plane saga , with the files containing a little - known set of colour photographs , apparently taken in the Scottish Highlands , which appear to show a large diamond - shaped UFO shadowed by military jets .
During the 1980s , rumours abounded about a spy plane codenamed Aurora , said to be capable of hypersonic speed .
Although the US authorities denied its existence , alleged sightings frequently made headlines in UFO magazines .
The DI55 papers confirm that officials also believed it was possible that someone was flying an advanced aircraft within UK air space .
The most intriguing incident involving such a craft occurred at 9 pm on 4 August 1990 , at Calvine , a remote hamlet near Pitlochry in Scotland .
According to the brief details released by the MoD , witnesses saw a diamond - shaped UFO hovering for about 10 minutes before it disappeared upwards at high speed .
During the incident , Harrier jump jets were seen making a number of low - level passes .
Colour photographs reveal both the UFO and at least one of the jets .
Former MoD official Nick Pope described the photographs as " one of the most intriguing [ UFO ] cases in the MoD 's files " .
However , Clarke said the papers failed to address long - standing questions over the incident .
He said : " Many questions remain .
Who was the photographer and how can we be sure his story was genuine ?
Why did the Daily Record decide not to publish the photographs in 1990 ?
If they really were taken on the date stated , then why was the MoD unable to trace the origin of the Harriers clearly shown in the print ?
" All we have is the usual rather bland statement that the MoD decided the incident was unexplained , but of no defence significance : case closed . "
At least once a year there 's a maelstrom of posts about a new Ruby implementation with stellar numbers .
These numbers are usually based on very early experimental code , and they are rarely accompanied by information on compatibility .
And of course we love to see crazy performance numbers , so many of us eat this stuff up .
Posting numbers too early is a real disservice to any project , since they almost certainly do n't represent the eventual real - world performance people will see .
It encourages folks to look to the future , but it also marginalizes implementations that already provide both compatibility and performance , and ignores how much work it has taken to get there .
Given how much we like to see numbers , and how thirsty the Ruby community is for " a fastest Ruby " , I do n't know whether this will ever change .
I thought perhaps a discussion about the process of optimizing JRuby might help folks understand what 's involved in building a fast , compatible Ruby implementation , so that these periodic shootouts do n't get blown out of proportion .
Ruby can be fast , certainly even faster than JRuby is today .
But getting there while maintaining compatibility is very difficult .
Performance Optimization , JRuby - style
We begin our exploration by running JRuby in interpreted mode , which is the slowest way you can run JRuby .
We 'll be using the " tak " benchmark , since it 's simple and easy to demonstrate relative performance at each optimization level .
# Takeuchi function performance , tak ( 24 , 16 , 8 )
def tak x , y , z
if y >= x
return z
else
return tak ( tak ( x - 1 , y , z ) ,
tak ( y - 1 , z , x ) ,
tak ( z - 1 , x , y ) )
end
end
require " benchmark "
N = ( ARGV. shift || 1) .to_i
Benchmark.bm do |make|
N.times do
make .
report do
i = 0
while i<10
tak ( 24 , 16 , 8 )
i+=1
end
end
end
end
And here 's our first set of results .
I have provided Ruby 1.8.6 and Ruby 1.9.1 numbers for comparison .

The " server " VM differs from the default " client " VM in that it will optimistically inline code across calls and optimize the resulting code as a single unit .
This obviously allows it to eliminate costly x86 CALL operations , but even more than that it allows optimizing algorithms which span multiple calls .
By default , OpenJDK will attempt to inline up to 9 levels of calls , so long as they 're monomorphic ( only one valid target ) , not too big , and no early assumptions are changed by later code ( like if a monomorphic call goes polymorphic later on ) .
In this case , where we 're not yet compiling Ruby code to JVM bytecode , this inlining is mostly helping JRuby 's interpreter , core classes , and method - call logic .
But already we 're 3 x faster than interpreted JRuby on the client VM .
The next optmization will be to turn on the compiler .
I 've modified JRuby for the next couple runs to * only * compile and not do any additional optimizations .
We 'll discuss those optimizations as I add them back .
JRuby 1.3.0 - dev , compiled ( unoptimized ) , server VM :
➔ jruby -- server -J- Djruby.astInspector.enabled=false bench/bench_tak.rb 5
user system total real
5.436000 0.000000 5.436000 ( 5.376000 )
3.655000 0.000000 3.655000 ( 3.655000 )
3.662000 0.000000 3.662000 ( 3.662000 )
3.683000 0.000000 3.683000 ( 3.683000 )
3.668000 0.000000 3.668000 ( 3.668000 )
By compiling , without doing any additional optimizations , we 're able to improve performance 2 x again .
Because we 're now JITing Ruby code as JVM bytecode , and the JVM eventually JITs JVM bytecode to native code , our Ruby code actually starts to benefit from the JVM 's built - in optimizations .
We 're making better use of the system CPU and not making nearly as many calls as we would from the interpreter ( since the interpreter is basically a long chain of calls for each low - level Ruby operation .
Next , we 'll turn on the simplest and oldest JRuby compiler optimization , " heap scope elimination " .
JRuby 1.3.0 - dev , compiled ( heap scope optz ) , server VM :
➔ jruby -- server bench / bench_tak.rb 5
user system total real
4.014000 0.000000 4.014000 ( 3.942000 )
2.776000 0.000000 2.776000 ( 2.776000 )
2.760000 0.000000 2.760000 ( 2.760000 )
2.769000 0.000000 2.769000 ( 2.769000 )
2.768000 0.000000 2.768000 ( 2.769000 )
The " heap scope elimination " optimization eliminates the use of an in - memory store for local variables .
Instead , when there 's no need for local variables to be accessible outside the context of a given method , they are compiled as Java local variables .
This allows the JVM to put them into CPU registers , making them considerably faster than reading or writing them from / to main memory ( via a cache , but still slower than registers ) .
This also makes JRuby ease up on the JVM 's memory heap , since it no longer has to allocate memory for those scopes on every single call .
This now puts us comfortably faster than Ruby 1.9 , and it represents the set of optimizations you see in JRuby 1.2.0 .
Is this the best we can do ?
No , we can certainly do more , and some such experimental optimizations are actually already underway .
Let 's continue our exploration by turning on another optimization similar to the previous one : " backtrace - only frames " .
JRuby 1.3.0 - dev , compiled ( heap scope + bracktrace frame optz ) , server VM :
➔ jruby -- server -J - Djruby.compile.frameless=true bench/bench_tak.rb 5
user system total real
3.609000 0.000000 3.609000 ( 3.526000 )
2.600000 0.000000 2.600000 ( 2.600000 )
2.602000 0.000000 2.602000 ( 2.602000 )
2.598000 0.000000 2.598000 ( 2.598000 )
2.602000 0.000000 2.602000 ( 2.602000 )
Every Ruby call needs to store information above and beyond local variables .
There 's the current " self " , the current method visibility ( used for defining new methods ) , which class is currently the " current " one , backref and lastline values ( $ ~ and $ _ ) , backtrace information ( caller 's file and line ) , and some other miscellany for handling long jumps ( like return or break in a block ) .
In most cases , this information is not used , and so storing it and pushing / popping it for every call wastes precious time .
In fact , other than backtrace information ( which needs to be present to provide Ruby - like backtrace output ) , we can turn most of the frame data off .
This is where we start to break Ruby a bit , though there are ways around it .
But you can see we get another small boost .
What if we eliminate frames entirely and just use the JVM 's built - in backtrace logic ?
It turns out that having any pushing / popping of frames , even with only backtrace data , still costs us quite a bit of performance .
So let 's try " heap frame elimination " :
JRuby 1.3.0 - dev , compiled ( heap scope + heap frame optz ) , server VM :
➔ jruby -- server -J - Djruby.compile.frameless=true bench/bench_tak.rb 5
user system total real
2.955000 0.000000 2.955000 ( 2.890000 )
1.904000 0.000000 1.904000 ( 1.904000 )
1.843000 0.000000 1.843000 ( 1.843000 )
1.823000 0.000000 1.823000 ( 1.823000 )
1.813000 0.000000 1.813000 ( 1.813000 )
By eliminating frames entirely , we 're a good 33 % faster than the fastest " fully framed " run you 'd get with stock JRuby 1.2.0 .
You 'll notice the command line here is the same ; that 's because we 're venturing into more and more experimental code , and in this case I 've actually forced " frameless " to be " no heap frame " instead of " backtrace - only heap frame " .
And what do we lose with this change ?
We no longer would be able to produce a backtrace containing only Ruby calls , so you 'd see some JRuby internals in the trace , similar to how Rubinius shows Rubinius internals .
But we 're getting respectably fast now .
Next up we 'll turn on some optimizations for math operators .
JRuby 1.3.0 - dev , compiled ( heap scope , heap frame , fastops optz ) , server VM :
➔ jruby -- server -J - Djruby.compile.frameless=true -J-Djruby.compile.fastops=true bench/bench_tak.rb 5
user system total real
2.291000 0.000000 2.291000 ( 2.225000 )
1.335000 0.000000 1.335000 ( 1.335000 )
1.337000 0.000000 1.337000 ( 1.337000 )
1.344000 0.000000 1.344000 ( 1.344000 )
1.346000 0.000000 1.346000 ( 1.346000 )
Most of the time , when calling + or - on an object , we do the full Ruby dynamic dispatch cycle .
Dispatch involves retrieving the target object 's metaclass , querying for a method ( like " + " or " - " ) , and invoking that method with the appropriate arguments .
This works fine for getting us respectable performance , but we want to take things even further .
So JRuby has experimental " fast math " operations to turn most Fixnum math operators into static calls rather than dynamic ones , allowing most math operations to inline directly into the caller .
And what do we lose ?
This version of " fast ops " makes it impossible to override Fixnum# + and friends , since whenever we call + on a Fixnum it 's going straight to the code .
But it gets us another nearly 30 % improvement .
Up to now we 've still also been updating a lot of per- thread information .
For every line , we 're tweaking a per - thread field to say what line number we 're on .
We 're also pinging a set of per - thread fields to handle the unsafe " kill " and " raise " operations on each thread ... basically we 're checking to see if another thread has asked the current one to die or raise an exception .
Let 's turn all that off :
JRuby 1.3.0 - dev , compiled ( heap scope , heap frame , fastops , threadless , positionless optz ) , server VM :
➔ jruby -- server -J - Djruby.compile.frameless=true -J-Djruby.compile.fastops=true -J-Djruby.compile.positionless=true -J-Djruby.compile.threadless=true bench/bench_tak.rb 5
user system total real
2.256000 0.000000 2.256000 ( 2.186000 )
1.304000 0.000000 1.304000 ( 1.304000 )
1.310000 0.000000 1.310000 ( 1.310000 )
1.307000 0.000000 1.307000 ( 1.307000 )
1.301000 0.000000 1.301000 ( 1.301000 )
We get a small but measurable performance boost from this change as well .
The experimental optimizations up to this point ( other than threadless ) comprise the set of options for JRuby 's -- fast option , shipped in 1.2.0 .
The -- fast option additionally tries to statically inspect code to determine whether these optimizations are safe .
For example , if you 're running with -- fast but still access backrefs , we 're going to create a frame for you anyway .
We 're not done yet .
I mentioned earlier the JVM gets some of its best optimizations from its ability to profile and inline code at runtime .
Unfortunately in current JRuby , there 's no way to inline dynamic calls .
There 's too much plumbing involved .
The upcoming " invokedynamic " work in Java 7 will give us an easier path forward , making dynamic calls as natural to the JVM as static calls , but of course we want to support Java 5 and Java 6 for a long time .
So naturally , I have been maintaining an experimental patch that eliminates most of that plumbing and makes dynamic calls inline on Java 5 and Java 6 .
JRuby 1.3.0 - dev , compiled ( " - - fast " , dyncall optz ) , server VM :
➔ jruby -- server -- fast bench / bench_tak.rb 5
user system total real
2.206000 0.000000 2.206000 ( 2.066000 )
1.259000 0.000000 1.259000 ( 1.259000 )
1.258000 0.000000 1.258000 ( 1.258000 )
1.269000 0.000000 1.269000 ( 1.269000 )
1.270000 0.000000 1.270000 ( 1.270000 )
We improve again by a small amount , always edging the performance bar higher and higher .
In this case , we do n't lose compatibility , we lose stability .
The inlining modification breaks method_missing and friends , since I have not yet modified the call pipeline to support both inlining and method_missing .
And there 's still a lot of extra overhead here that can be eliminated .
But in general we 're still mostly Ruby , and even with this change you can run a lot of code .
This represents the current state of JRuby .
I 've taken you all the way from slow , compatible execution , through fast , compatible execution , and all the way to faster , less - compatible execution .
There 's certainly a lot more we can do , and we 're not yet as fast as some of the incomplete experimental Ruby VMs .
But we run Ruby applications , and that 's no small feat .
We will continue making measured steps , always ensuring compatibility first so each release of JRuby is more stable and more complete than the last .
If we do n't immediately leap to the top of the performance heap , there 's always good reasons for it .
Performance Optimization , Duby - style
As a final illustration , I want to show the tak performance for a language that looks like Ruby , and tastes like Ruby , but boasts substantially better performance : Duby .
def tak(x => : fixnum , y => : fixnum , z => : fixnum )
unless y < x
z
else
tak ( tak ( x - 1 , y , z ) ,
tak ( y - 1 , z , x ) ,
tak ( z - 1 , x , y ) )
end
end
puts " Running tak ( 24,16,8 ) 1000 times "
i = 0
while i<1000
tak ( 24 , 16 , 8 )
i+=1
end
This is the Takeuchi function written in Duby .
It looks basically like Ruby , except for the : fixnum type hints in the signature .
Here 's a timing of the above script ( which calls tak the same as before but 1000 times instead of 5 times ) , running on the server JVM :
➔ time jruby - J - server bin/duby examples / tak.duby
Running tak ( 24,16,8 ) 1000 times
real 0m13.657s
user 0m14.529s
sys 0m0.450s
So what you 're seeing here is that Duby can run " tak ( 24,16,8 ) " , the same function we tested in JRuby above , in an average of 0.013 seconds -- nearly two orders of magnitude faster than the fastest JRuby optimizations above and at least an order of magnitude faster than the fastest incomplete , experimental implementations of Ruby .
What does this mean ?
Absolutely nothing , because Duby is not Ruby .
But it shows how fast a Ruby - like language can get , and it shows there 's a lot of runway left for JRuby to optimize .
Be a ( Supportive ) Critic !
So the next time someone posts an article with crazy - awesome performance numbers for a Ruby implementation , by all means applaud the developers and encourage their efforts , since they certainly deserve credit for finding new ways to optimize Ruby .
But then ask yourself and the article 's author how much of Ruby the implementation actually supports , because it makes a big difference .
Update , April 4 : Several people told me I did n't go quite far enough in showing that by breaking Ruby you could get performance .
And after enough cajoling , I was convinced to post one last modification : recursion optimization .
JRuby 1.3.0 - dev , compiled ( " - - fast " , dyncall optz , recursion optz ) , server VM :
➔ jruby -- server -- fast bench / bench_tak.rb 5
user system total real
0.524000 0.000000 0.524000 ( 0.524000 )
0.338000 0.000000 0.338000 ( 0.338000 )
0.325000 0.000000 0.325000 ( 0.325000 )
0.299000 0.000000 0.299000 ( 0.299000 )
0.310000 0.000000 0.310000 ( 0.310000 )
Woah !
What the heck is going on here ?
In this case , JRuby 's compiler has been hacked to turn recursive " functional calls " , i.e. calls to an implicit " self " receiver , into direct calls .
The logic behind this is that if you 're calling the current method from the current method , you 're going to always dispatch back to the same piece of code ... so why do all the dynamic call gymnastics ?
This fits a last piece into the JVM inlining - optimization puzzle , allowing mostly - recursive benchmarks like Takeuchi to inline more of those recursive calls .
What do we lose ?
Well , I 'm not sure yet .
I have n't done enough testing of this optimization to know whether it breaks Ruby in some subtle way .
It may work for 90 % of cases , but fail for an undetectable 10 % .
Or it may be something we can determine statically , or something for which we can add an inexpensive guard .
Until I know , it wo n't go into a release of JRuby , at least not as a default optimization .
But it 's out there , and I believe we 'll find a way .
It is also , incidentally , only a few times slower than a pure Java version of the same benchmark , provided Java is using all boxed numerics too .
The truth is it 's actually very easy to make small snippits of Ruby code run really fast , especially if you optimize for the benchmark .
But is it useful to do so ?
And can we extrapolate eventual production performance from these early numbers ?

Advertisement Barack Obama has declared that the US " is not at war with Islam " , in a major speech during his first visit as president to a mainly Muslim country .
Addressing the Turkish parliament , Mr Obama called for a greater partnership with the Muslim world and said the US would soon launch outreach programmes .
" America 's relationship with the Muslim world cannot and will not be based on opposition to al - Qaeda , " he said .
Mr Obama also said Washington supported Turkey 's efforts to join the EU .
Earlier , at a news conference with his Turkish counterpart , Abdullah Gul , he urged Turkey to help bridge the gap between the Muslim and Western worlds .

' Signals of interest ' to Muslims He said his visit was a " statement about the importance of Turkey , not just to the United States , but to the world " .
The US president began his visit to Turkey on Monday morning by laying a wreath at the tomb of the founder of modern Turkish state , Mustafa Kemal Ataturk , whose " vision and courage " he praised .
He then travelled to the presidential palace in Ankara for talks with President Abdullah Gul , before giving an address to the Turkish Grand National Assembly .
Mr Obama devoted much of his speech to calling for a greater bond between Americans and Muslims , admitting that " the trust that binds us has been strained " .
" Let me say this as clearly as I can : the United States is not and will never be at war with Islam , " he stated .
Mr Obama 's remarks were welcomed by Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan " In fact , our partnership with the Muslim world is critical in rolling back a fringe ideology that people of all faiths reject . "
He said : " The United States has been enriched by Muslim Americans .
Many other Americans have Muslims in their family , or have lived in a Muslim - majority country - I know , because I am one of them . "
" And when people look back on this time , let it be said of America that we extended the hand of friendship , " he said .
" There is an old Turkish proverb : ' You can not put out fire with flames . ' "
BBC North America editor Justin Webb in Ankara says there are some back in the US who wonder if Mr Obama is going too far , but his intention seems clear .
He is on a mission to charm with the hope that in years to come , there is a tangible benefit for America and the world , our correspondent says .
' Crucial ally '
In his speech , Mr Obama said the US considered Turkey a " critical ally " , despite the deterioration of their relations over the war in Iraq .
He said that while they had not always agreed on everything , the two states were stronger when they worked together .
Obama is a seducer , in the nicest possible way of course .
He smiles and refers to himself as Hussein and does all the other things that make Europeans swoon .
Then he has his way .
Or does he ...?

Send us your comments " That is why we must listen to one another , and seek common ground , " he said .
The president also reiterated that the US government strongly supported Turkey 's bid to become a member of the European Union .
" Europe gains by diversity of ethnicity , tradition and faith - it is not diminished by it , " he said to a round of applause from the audience .
" And Turkish membership would broaden and strengthen Europe 's foundation once more . "
The EU agreed to open accession talks with Ankara in 2004 , but in recent years Turkey has made little progress with democratic reforms which would improve its chances of membership , correspondents say .
Later in his address , Mr Obama said the US strongly supported the full normalisation of relations between Turkey and Armenia .
At his earlier news conference with President Gul , he had stood by his 2008 assertion that the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915 constituted " genocide " - without repeating the word .
Several groups have been demonstrating against the visit
The issue remains highly sensitive between the governments of Armenia and Turkey , which denies those killed were victims of systematic genocide , and has prevented normal relations between them for many years .
During his election campaign , Mr Obama said the " Armenian genocide is not an allegation , a personal opinion , or a point of view , but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence " .
After his speech , Mr Obama was due to meet Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
The US leader will then leave Ankara for Istanbul , where he will attend the Alliance of Civilizations forum .

Tom Moyer , one of Portland 's most successful real estate developers , will halt work Monday on his 32 - floor tower now under construction in downtown Portland .
Moyer 's decision to pull 350 workers off the Park Avenue West is a stunning sign that no city , no person and no block is spared from this recession .
Moyer is one of Oregon 's wealthiest developers , and the Park Avenue West is anchored on prime downtown land , in a city that one company ranks as having the country 's second most stable office market .
The building , originally scheduled to open in 2011 , already was more than half leased by a law firm and a Nike store .
In other words , if anyone in this town could get a loan , it would be this guy on this project .
" Construction financing does not exist right now , " said Vanessa Sturgeon , president of TMT Development , Moyer 's company , which is building Park Avenue West .
Moyer 's financial woes show that even though the U.S.
Treasury pumps billions of dollars into banks , that cash is not landing in the hands of the people who need it .
Moyer , who has been in real estate since the 1950s , may be able to withstand the pain .
But at the end of the line , lenders ' reluctance means construction workers may not receive a paycheck , finding it harder to make the mortgage and buy new shoes for their kids .
Even though the banks are under pressure to improve their own health , borrowers remain frustrated by their unwillingness to lend .
" I get a little bit mad about it , " said Bart Eberwein , vice president at Hoffman Construction Co. , general contractor on the project .
" The banks are getting the money , but they 're not lending it out .
Until private lending picks up , we are going to be in a prolonged slump . "
The Park Avenue West was designed to be a new icon in the city skyline , rising 350 feet on a sliver of land along the historic South Park Blocks alignment .
It falls just a few blocks from Moyer 's previous downtown tower , the Fox Tower and the 1000 Broadway building .
Moyer finished the Fox Tower in the teeth of the dot - com bust , but it still became one of Portland 's most notable buildings , attracting high - end retailers .
But this recession is like nothing that 's come before it .
Developers in other cities have stopped midstream on high - rise construction projects .
But in Portland , veteran real estate professionals said they could n't recall any other developer who stopped construction on a high - rise in the last 30 years .
" It seemed like something that happens in other places , " Eberwein said .
Moyer had expected to pay for the construction himself and had kept up payments to his contractors .
Real estate brokers had taken to saying that Park Avenue West would be built by the " Bank of Tom Moyer . "
Moyer owns land throughout the Willamette Valley , and Sturgeon said the company planned to borrow against some of those holdings to fund the Park Avenue West .
But even the " Bank of Tom Moyer " has its limits .
Sturgeon said the book values of Moyer 's other land holdings have fallen .
Plus , lenders have tightened their requirements on loans and cut the amount of debt that borrowers can incur .
In past years , lenders would allow developers like Moyer to borrow up to 75 percent of a property 's value .
Now , it 's 45 percent , Sturgeon said .
" It 's unprecedented , " she said .
At the job site Friday , the concrete , mechanical and iron workers left the site about 3 p.m. with the building 15 percent finished .
It remains just a parking garage , frozen for now about three floors below ground .
Rumors had circled for weeks that work would stop .
But after news broke Friday , workers expressed disbelief -- even after reading the news online .
" If this shuts down now , once we hit street level I 'll be unemployed , " lamented Lance Cabanilla , 46 , a crane bellman .
Cabanilla said he would seek work on a remaining Hoffman project in the South Waterfront district , but he decried the state of the construction industry , which has lost 32,800 jobs since it peaked at 110,800 in August 2007 .
" What 's happening to all the working guys ? " he asked .
Carpenter Steve Callopy said he has no safety net beyond unemployment compensation and does n't see any fresh work on the horizon .
Commercial construction , in particular , seems to have fallen apart .
" Do you see any commercial stuff going on ? " he said .
" I see a lot of commercial ' For Lease ' signs . "
Sturgeon said she expects construction to remain stopped until they can find financing in early 2010 .
They 'll use the time to redesign the building and lop off the top 10 stories that were to be " ultra - luxury " condos .
The condos would have been listed for more than $ 600 per square foot , or about $ 1 million for an average unit of 1,800 square feet .
The Portland office market is getting worse as unemployment rises .
The vacancy rate in the central city office market jumped from 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 10.2 percent in the first quarter of 2009 , according to real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield .
Shorenstein Properties of San Francisco , one of the region 's largest office landlords , is building new office buildings along Lake Oswego 's Kruse Way and in downtown Portland .
The company has n't signed a tenant for either building , though interest seems to be picking up , said Matt Cole , senior vice president of Shorenstein Realty Services .
The Park Avenue West 's primary tenant was to be Stoel Rives , Oregon 's biggest law firm .
Managing partner Wally Van Valkenburg said his firm has n't decided how to respond to the delay , according to a news release .
In the meantime , the visible site behind Nordstrom and between the MAX light - rail tracks will provide a constant reminder of the economy we live in now .

Thoreau never chucked technology at all .
He pretended it did n’t exist .
...
Mother nature did n’t build the cabin in which Thoreau lived .
125,000 generations of human ingenuity made the axes , saws , and mills that allowed men to fell trees and to slice their trunks into boards inexpensively .
A thousand generations of even more techno - lust and techno - innovation went into inventing the wall , the floor , the roof , and the frame of beams and joists that holds a cabin upright .
It 's Earth Day , in case you can't tell by our swanky green Earth logo in the header , and that means people will be thinking about Nature ( the bitch , not the magazine ) and our impact on her .
I did n't say people would be thinking clearly , but they will be thinking .
So instead of shocking and awing you with my dark humor and divine genius , I will instead ask a question ; what kind of science could you do if you got sent back to 10,000 BC ?
I ask because a whole lot of people who are interested in Earth Day are also interested in making us more primitive .
There was once an America where cranky old conservatives wanted society to stay frozen in time or even go backwards .
Progress was the enemy .
More recently , some progressives think progress is the enemy and want to stay frozen in time or even go back .
I am older than most here yet as a young guy in Florida the term ' conservationist ' already meant ' someone who wants things to stay the same as the week they moved here ' so making fun of the wrong sort of pop environmentalism was popular even then .
Unfortunately , most people who regard themselves as environmentalists do n't know much about actually living in the environment .
They regard environmentalism as some kind of Thoreau - inspired bucolic paradise , a big happy love fest where every writes a sequel to " Walden ; or , Life in the Woods " .
As our resident Big Thinker , Howard Bloom
And that 's the downside to retro- environmental thinking .
Those people have no idea what they are talking about .
Starving and freezing and dying were messy business .
They 're instead living in a world where they do n't realize Thoreau had a rich family to support him and all the conveniences of modern life keeping him alive while he wrote his famous book .
So I decided in honor of Earth Day to go back in time and see what scientists and environmentalists would really have been tackling in an all - natural world .
I picked 10,000 B.C. for two reasons ; first , it 's a nice round number and we were solidly coming out of the last Ice Age so there were advancements being made .
Second , I literally just watched a movie called " 10,000 B.C. " , directed by Roland Emmerich , which was better than I thought it would be , science mistakes aside .
In movies , primitive people were always chasing some huge animal or another .
I have news for you .
In 10,000 BC ( the Neolithic period , not the movie ) we spent our days grubbing around for snails and sessile nuts .
In " 10,000 BC " ( the movie , not the Neolithic period ) they were doing all kinds of fun things ; hunting big game and rescuing attractive women from God-Emperor despots .
Maybe those were the Lapps who migrated north as the reindeer herds escaped global warming but I know my people , the Indo - Europeans , at most 50,000 of us total , instead settled into the world we had , being bereft of politicans talking about ' mitigation ' and capping how much we consume .
All the cavegirls in 10,000 BC looked like Camilia Belle .
That meant cold winters , but it left us time to do other things , like paint on rock walls .
Yes , archeologists have gone out of their way to incorporate magic and religion and symbolism into all that but it 's more likely 6 months of winter trapped in a cave made us bored .

But the world is changing a lot during that time .
The Scandinavian ice - cap disappears , giving us Scotland , where my folks will last for many a generation , inventing head - butting and then kicking opponents when they 're on the ground .
The sea level will rise by 50 meters ( take that , " Day After Tomorrow " screenwriters - real life is a lot more devastating than anything you made up ) but vegetation also spreads northward quite a bit , giving us more land to live in .
Scientifically , the advancement seems inconsequential now but , if you were trapped in the wilderness , it would make your jaw drop with its difficulty ; wooden saws that used chipped flint for teeth , increasingly ubiquitous bows and arrows and canoes .
Someone invents pressure flaking , which revolutionizes the utility of tools .

Credit : Government of the Commonwealth of VirginiaHow could it happen ?
Human ingenuity and necessity , that 's how .
As our tribe grows from perhaps 50,000 people in the entire culture to hundreds of thousands among many competing tibes , game becomes scarce .
Do we have leaders start rationing resources and deciding who gets to eat ?
No , prehistoric scientists will instead invent agriculture .
When that happens , families wo n't need to move , so we can settle down and have more kids and grow more food and create a community and then a culture .
Without the science , and then the technology , of 10,000 BC ( the Neolithic period , not the movie ) we would n't have the culture of today , including the people who do n't much like it .
Back to " 10,000 B.C. " ( the movie , not the Neolithic period ) - it 's better than you might expect , mostly because the special effects are spectacular .
It has its flaws , sure , just like stone spears and anthropology and environmentalism but , like all those , it has its good points too .
Environmentalism , for all its zealotry , is still way over in the good category when it comes to improving society ; our economy did not evaporate because we eliminated CFCs or cleaned up our rivers .
And the movie has some interesting action sequences .
So ignore the nets ( did n't exist for thousands of years ) , the domesticated horses ( 5000 years later ) , the metal tools and weapons ( 4000 years later ) , sabre - toothed tigers ( dead for 500,000 years but what movie can be made without them ? ) and no slavery to be forced into .
Okay , ignore everything scientific about the movie but just you try and build your own hut some time .
So I 'll answer my own question .
Who would I be ?
I 'd like to say D'leh , but I was probably TicTic .
(1) That 's just us .
Our cousins of the Russian steppes lived life a little more like we expect , building houses out of mammoth bones - no caves to live in .
The villain in The Highlander was called The Kurgan because they had to be pretty tough to hunt the big game .
How many smelly activists want to give that a try ?

Johan Anderson , Rendering Architect at DICE , revealed some details about the Frostbite Engine , which is the base for the Battlefield games .
At the beginning of the porting progress the developer had to face a cross platform engine ( PC , Xbox 360 , PS3 ) with an exclusive DirectX 10 rendering path that had DX 10.0 and DX 10.1 features .
The actual port of the Engine from DirectX 10 to DirectX 11 was done in three hours said Anderson .
Searching and replacing the relevant parts inside the code required the most time .
Since currently there is no DirectX 11 hardware or appropriate development software , the Frostbite Engine was equipped with a switch inside the compiler that can be changed to DirectX 10 or DirectX 11 .
The developers at DICE are certain that the CPU load during API calls can be reduced noticeably with DirectX 11 drivers .
Among other things the Frostbite DirectX 11 Engine offers HDR texture compression , Compute Shader and hardware tessellation for characters and terrain .
With Battlefield : Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 1943 there are two more games of the Battlefield series are based on the Frostbite Engine .

It is a curiosity , these things which hide from us and call out to us , like someone who knows us all too well .
While we move swiftly their call makes us pick up our pace even more and pretend not to hear them at all .
America is a nation afraid of itself , afraid to slow down out of fear of what we will see .
It is a nation in love with its own image , afraid that the truth will show us to be more than just a liar .

Teabags , fleabags , bailouts , shootouts , shout outs , rain outs or redoubts , do n't you know what it is all about ?
Tis all pyrite , frosting for the cake that the poor shall be allowed to eat .
Maybe you have wondered where I have gotten off to ; perhaps you did n't give it a thought .
Maybe I was on vacation to some far off tropical isle in the warm sun , or maybe on a sabbatical to improve myself through educational opportunity .
Well , maybe .
I have been on a journey to a far away place unknown to most , a land right around the corner from you but a million miles away in a parallel universe .
A place where the ticket is want and the destination is need , and you arrive by not having and you leave when you do .
A shadow world , a twilight existence , a place where people look at you as if you are unreal , because you are .

I am in a place that has become a continual , repetitive nightmare in my life ; I am homeless in America .
Land of the free and home of the do n't give a fuck .
Do n't cry for me Argentina , do it the American way .
Just look away and do n't make eye contact .
I became homeless the first time in my life when I was 17 , when due to my mother 's sudden death my family literally disintegrated in midair .
My siblings and I were too young to help each other so we separated and did what we could for ourselves .
I slept on a couch and in a garage , doing the best I could .
I was young then .
I believed the propaganda , any boy could be President ; anyone could make it in America .
Some do , just as some salmon make it all the way upstream , but if you stop swimming for even a moment you are washed away .
Or maybe you are diverted into a back channel and lost ?
You see , it is not how hard you swim or how swift your fin for it is uphill all the way , and the current is relentless .
At 17 I worked in a tire store and was promoted to manager .
The boss helped me to get my drivers license because he felt sorry for me and did n't want me to back into the tire rack with the customers ' cars again .
When he went out of business I went to another tire store only to be told that I was too young to be a manager .
Now perhaps if I was willing to work again as a tire changer they might consider me in a year or two for management .
Only in America , where once I was too young now I am too old .
I 've worked every week for 27 years without missing a paycheck .
I bought houses and new cars ; I bought into the dream and played the game as it was supposed to be played .
Then , seven years ago , divorce destroyed my family .
The court system raped me and abused all involved , except for the judges and the lawyers .
I learned that all I was really fighting for was an illusion , an illusion fostered by the attorneys as they filled their pockets and shouted their encouragement to me .
I began again and married for kindness , but my job moved away from us .
The times were good and I thought that perhaps the American dream could work for me , too .
Then the economy went sour and my business disappeared .
I looked for jobs , at first picking and choosing fields appropriate for my talents .
Then , not being so selective , I looked for anything that I could find .
During the last round of elections I worked the polls for the primaries and the general elections .
I was promoted to assistant manager but the next elections are 14 months away .
I began looking at everything that was available .
I 've applied as a janitor , house painter , school bus driver , and been turned down for them all .
My resume tells of 20 plus years of experience , but in America that means I am a threat to an employer 's healthcare premiums .
Why should they hire someone older ?
He might hurt himself ; why not hire a kid ?
There are plenty of them and they do n't ask questions .
My father - in - law , the patriarch of a family of know - it - alls , suggested fast food .
His not so subtle comments were not lost on me .
He worked 20 years at a union job without ever joining the union .
His pride did not stop him from reaping the rewards while riding on the back of other 's struggles , so it was his opinion that I should not be so prideful and should let others ride on my back .
That is America after all , kill or be killed .
Ride on someone 's back or let them ride on your back .
Dignity is an option only available on the luxury models .
Because I was self - employed and because I tried for too long to kick start the business , I have no unemployment benefits .
I paid in for 27 years and when I need them I get bubkis !
There is no aide .
There is no government program ; there is nothing .
Land of the free and home of the do n't give a fuck .
These tea baggers are mere tits on a boar hog , useless , meaningless and pointless .
A sugar cookie distraction to make you forget that freedom means that this country owes you nothing .
You 're free to starve and you 're free to die in an alley .
To the millions who have lost homes , families , and marriages it says , fuck off , you 're not my problem .
To the homeless vets dealing with war injuries of conscience and nightmares of the soul it says , you were sick when you went in so you 're not our problem .
To those sleeping in their cars it says move along .
When those cars break down it tows them away and pushes them down further into the next level of Dante 's inferno .
America will send a football star to prison and ruin him financially for animal cruelty but does n't give a thought to where the millions losing their homes and jobs will go .
Some cry it is our own fault because we did n't love Jesus hard enough .
But there is more to this picture than meets the eye .
I am homeless royalty .
I have a warm , dry place to sleep and a toilet .
Of all that I 've lost , I miss my fear the least , for they can't hurt me now .
I see them as they truly are and through a different lens than you .
Loving America is like loving a movie starlet .
You see all the pictures and read all the magazines , but what you are buying is a fabricated image .
While she may blow you kisses into the crowd , she does n't love you .
She does n't know you and she does n't want to know you .
She is a Hollywood harlot and you are a rube , foolishly expecting her to love you back when all she wanted was your money , and when that 's gone it 's time for you to hit the bricks ; to make like cow shit and hit the trail .
After all , she only played your mother in the movie version of your life , so take your freedom and go .
She is nothing but a stone idol and a graven image ; a Madison Avenue ad campaign .
Smoke 'em if you got 'em , gets out ground - in dirt , land of the free and home of the do n't give a fuck !
So keep moving , nothing to see here !
Pick up the pace and look away ; do n't make eye contact or you might lose something carefully crafted for you .
You might lose the image of America .
And if you lose that then you must look at these ugly things as they really are and realize that I am you and you are me .
That we are all one , no matter what Fox News tells you .
Just Released – XROAD G- Map
The first turn - by - turn GPS app for the iPhone was released this week from a company called XROAD .
And to pretty glowing reviews :
The iPhone has unquestionably dominated the mobile phone industry for the past two years .
One of its biggest advantages over other devices is the long list of applications of every variety that can be downloaded to it .
There are “ apps ” for everything from keeping track of your Twitter feed to following your favorite baseball team .
Finally , after nearly two years , a developer has released the first real - time , turn - by - turn navigation application for the iPhone .
XROADS G - Map ( $ 19 ) is clearly the best real - time navigation option for an iPhone right now , but we ran it through the same tests we would a stand - alone TomTom , Garmin or Mio system to see how it fared with the big boys of navigation . …
While there is room for improvement in this product , this is also the first attempt at a real - time turn - by - turn navigation application for the iPhone .
As long as XROADS is willing to follow what other developers have done by offering free updates , this app is sure to take a chunk out of the GPS navigation market .
Wow , that ’s not what I expected for the iPhone ’s first crack at a turn - by - turn GPS app .
Kudos to XROAD .
And at $ 20 , this app is a great deal .
But there are some obvious improvements to be had .
First , and foremost in my mind is voice routing .
When I drive I am usually paying attention to the road and listening to the radio .
I do n’t mind getting interrupted to let me know a turn is coming .
In fact , I expect it .
I ca n’t be expected to be watching the road and a map at the same time .
It ’s not safe or fun .
Also , the lack of street names is tough .
Especially when driving on crowded city streets .
When there are many streets coming up , it is nice to be able to be able to check the street you ’re turning onto before you get there .
And even better , the street before that .
Knocks aside , this looks to be a winner which is hopefully a good sign of things to come .
XROAD did the best they could do for now without using all the hard drive space on the iPhone .
Some small improvements here and there would blow away the competition .
Especially when the competition costs about 10 time more .

Rachel Maddow follows up on her reporting with Mark Danner who obtained a Red Cross report on the torture that occurred at GITMO and made it public at The New York Review of Books .
Rachel asks
Danner whether he 's concerned about the report being made public and if it will affect the Red Cross having access to prisoners in the future .
Mr. Danner felt that the public 's right to know about what happened outweighed that concern .
From the article :
When it comes to torture , it is not what we did but what we are doing .
It is not what happened but what is happening and what will happen .
In our politics , torture is not about whether or not our polity can " let the past be past " — whether or not we can " get beyond it and look forward . "
Torture , for Dick Cheney and for President Bush and a significant portion of the American people , is more than a repugnant series of " procedures " applied to a few hundred prisoners in American custody during the last half - dozen or so years — procedures that are described with chilling and patient particularity in this authoritative report by the International Committee of the Red Cross . [ 2 ]
Torture is more than the specific techniques — the forced nudity , sleep deprivation , long - term standing , and suffocation by water , " among others — that were applied to those fourteen " high - value detainees " and likely many more at the " black site " prisons secretly maintained by the CIA on three continents .
Torture , as the former vice - president 's words suggest , is a critical issue in the present of our politics — and not only because of ongoing investigations by Senate committees , or because of calls for an independent inquiry by congressional leaders , or for a " truth commission " by a leading Senate Democrat , or because of demands for a criminal investigation by the ACLU and other human rights organizations , and now undertaken in Spain , the United Kingdom , and Poland . [ 3 ]
For many in the United States , torture still stands as a marker of political commitment — of a willingness to " do anything to protect the American people , " a manly readiness to know when to abstain from " coddling terrorists " and do what needs to be done .
Torture 's powerful symbolic role , like many ugly , shameful facts , is left unacknowledged and undiscussed .
But that does n't make it any less real .
On the contrary .
Torture is at the heart of the deadly politics of national security .
The former vice - president , as able and ruthless a politician as the country has yet produced , appears convinced of this .
For if torture really was a necessary evil in what Mr. Cheney calls the " tough , mean , dirty , nasty business " of " keeping the country safe , " then it follows that its abolition at the hands of the Obama administration will put the country once more at risk .
It was Barack Obama , after all , who on his first full day as president issued a series of historic executive orders that closed the " black site " secret prisons and halted the use of " enhanced interrogation techniques " that had been practiced there , and that provided that the offshore prison at Guantánamo would be closed within a year .
Drug gang killings in Mexico claimed the lives of more than 6,000 people last year and around 1,000 so far this year .
The drug cartels are fighting both one another for control of trafficking routes into the US , and the police and troops sent to tackle them .
Here , four people living in different parts of Mexico , discuss how the fight against drugs can succeed .
NASSA HANNAN , BUSINESSMAN , TORREON I live in northern Mexico , in one of the drugs and arms smuggling routes .
Mexico has deployed thousands of troops to tackle traffickers
Things have changed dramatically in the last year .
Five people were shot close to our office on Saturday .
There are killings every day .
You can't go out at night anymore , you can't go to restaurants and bars .
Violence is between drug cartels , but it is a problem for innocent people if they get caught in the cross fire .
The security situation is very bad and it is making the lives of ordinary Mexicans an absolute misery .
When a drug trafficking group loses some of its income , they look for other easy options .
So they turn to kidnappings .
Two of my friends were kidnapped - one American and one Dutch .
They paid the ransom and left the country .
The US has to tackle demand and stop money and weapons going to Mexico
This is a big industrial area with many foreign - owned companies .
Many of the foreigners here can't cope anymore and are leaving .
We are thinking of relocating to another part of Mexico and we 'll probably leave in a couple of months .
Our company employs 25 people - what will happen to those people ?
Mexico can't fight them alone .
The US needs to help .
If you go to the border crossing in Juarez , you 'll discover that there is no control on the US end .
Weapons and money are freely coming to the country to fight the military .
The US are the consumer and they do nothing to help us .
The US has to tackle demand and stop money and weapons going to Mexico .
AHIME RAMIREZ , JOURNALIST , MORELIA , MICHOACAN
This city has been strongly affected by the drug violence since September 2008 , when blasts tore through crowds celebrating independence day .
Eight people died .
This week we 've had shootings in broad daylight .
People are now very scared and do n't go out in the streets with the same tranquillity as before .
They rush from the building to the car to minimise the chance of being caught in a shooting .
Tourism has also decreased .
The drug cartels go hand in hand with power
I am a journalist and this fear makes our job more difficult .
It 's hard to speak to people as they become more withdrawn .
I do n't think the US government 's decision to militarise the borders is right .
The US authorities do n't respect Mexican migrants , they consider them a hassle .
Mexicans are already dying while trying to cross the desert , but I think the death toll will be greater if the US forces are involved .
The drug cartels go hand in hand with power .
Unfortunately , drug - related crime is very organised , whereas we , the civil society , are not .
I think the recent protests against violence will not achieve anything , but it is a way for the people to tell our government that we do n't agree with the current situation and need them to take appropriate measures to end the violence .
FERNANDO RIVERA , IT ENGINEER , BAJA CALIFORNIA
Drug trafficking has been present in this region for many years , with the Arellano Felix cartel dominating the trade with the US .
Last year , after important members of this delinquent group were arrested , a power struggle within the group started , which caused many executions and murders in the region .
We are left at the mercy of the drug cartels
Since then , our amazement by their violent expression grows every day .
Decapitations , bodies dissolved in acid , executions - we 've never seen anything like this before .
What worries me most is that the authorities seem to be indifferent to the violence , whether it 's because of complicity or incompetence .
This leaves us at the mercy of the drug cartels .
Only the army has succeeded in the battle against drug trafficking in this country .
This affects the perception of foreign investors and tourists .
The number of tourists here in Baja California is at its lowest in decades , mainly because the US government alerts its citizens about the violence in the region .
The only solution to the problem I can see is to get rid of the corruption within the police and those in power .
Without corruption , drug trafficking will not be on such a large scale .
We , the good citizens , outnumber the drug dealers .
IAN F CAMPBELL , TOURIST WEBSITE EDITOR , COZUMEL I live in a tourist resort , close to Cancun .
Where we are is a completely different country from where the problems are .
There 's been no violence here whatsoever .
The violence is confined to a few border areas and within the drug cartels while the rest of the country is peaceful .
The tourist trade forms an important part of Mexico 's economy
The problem is , you do n't get that impression when watching the news .
The international media 's hysterical approach is having a negative impact on the tourism industry here .
American tourists are cancelling their holidays in Mexico for fear that there is violence everywhere .
In addition , the US has updated its travel advisory asking citizens to be careful when visiting certain areas .
Many US teenagers go to Mexico during the spring holiday and the other day Fox news was saying :
Do n't let your kids go to Mexico , they may never come back !
The media like to sensationalise the news - we had a similar problem a few years ago when there was a hurricane .
This is bad news for many thousands of Mexicans who rely on the tourism industry to feed their families .
The US is getting worried about the drug - related violence here and is beginning to acknowledge that this is not just Mexico 's problem .
But it needs to do more to reduce the demand for consumption and to make sure that its arms do n't cross the border with Mexico .

Police have carried out what is thought to be the biggest pre-emptive raid on environmental campaigners in UK history , arresting 114 people believed to be planning direct action at a coal - fired power station .
The arrests - for conspiracy to commit criminal damage and aggravated trespass - come amid growing concern among campaigners about increased police surveillance and groups being infiltrated by informers .
Nottinghamshire police said the raid on an independent school in Nottingham was made just after midnight this morning .
The force said it seized " specialist equipment " thought to be linked to a planned protest at nearby Ratcliffe - on - Soar power station , a coal plant owned by the utility company E.On .
No group has claimed responsibility for the alleged demonstration .
Experienced campaigners said no group had claimed responsibility for the alleged demonstration because they could face charges of conspiracy and a possible jail sentence .
Activists said emails setting out planned action could be used by police to prove conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass and criminal damage , as could any equipment or documentation found during the arrests , or other evidence of coordinated preparations .
No formal details of the proposed action have been released , but campaign veterans speculated that the demonstrators could have been planning to chain themselves to the conveyor belts taking coal into the power plant in an attempt to stop the turbines when fuel ran out .
The tactic has previously been used by activists at Ratcliffe and another E.
On coal plant , at Kingsnorth in Kent .
The secretive nature of the operation is similar to previous actions organised under the umbrella of the Climate Camp network , a loose affiliation of independently - organised protest groups , but nobody from the movement could be contacted today .
Nottinghamshire police said the 114 people arrested were from across the country .
" In view of specialist equipment recovered by police , those arrested posed a serious threat to the safe running of the site , " police said .
" There were no injuries during the arrests and the police investigation is ongoing . "
Some of those arrested were taken to police cells in Leicestershire and Derbyshire .
E.On issued a statement saying : " We can confirm that Ratcliffe power station was the planned target of an organised protest during the early hours of this morning .
" While we understand that everyone has a right to protest peacefully and lawfully , this was clearly neither of those things so we will be assisting the police with their investigations into what could have been a very dangerous and irresponsible attempt to disrupt an operational power plant . "
The arrests follow a growing number of demonstrations and " direct actions " by campaigners angry at government plans to expand airports and build a new generation of coal - fired power stations with no firm commitment to capture and store the emissions .
As well as chaining themselves to conveyors , protesters have scaled the cooling tower at Kingsnorth , blockaded E.
On offices , protested at events sponsored by the German - owned company , stopped a coal train and invaded or blockaded several airports around the country .
There has also been increasing concern about police tactics .
Last month , a Guardian investigation revealed police were targeting thousands of political campaigners in surveillance operations and storing their details on a database for at least seven years .
Policing of the recent G20 protests has also come under scrutiny after newspaper vendor Ian Tomlinson died following , according to video evidence , was an attack from behind by a police officer .
Some environmental activists said there was a suspicion the arrests in Nottingham followed a tipoff from a police informer inside the campaign group .
Others pointed out that the size of the protest group made it more vulnerable to information leaking out during routine police surveillance .
Shami Chakrabarti , the director of Liberty , said : " In the light of the policing of the G20 protests , people up and down the country will want to be confident that there was evidence of a real conspiracy to commit criminal damage by those arrested and that this was not just an attempt by the police to disrupt perfectly legitimate protest per se . "
Nottingham city councillor David Mellen said the police raided the privately - run Iona School at Sneinton as the result of " an intelligence - led operation " .
He said : " I do n't know whether it was the school itself being used or the car park .
Neighbours reported a lot of noise after midnight .
It seems to have been used as a rendezvous for people from a wide area . "

Last month , Miley Cyrus claimed Radiohead dissed her at the GRAMMY awards , so she has vowed to ruin “ rude , stinky … rock god ” Radiohead .
You can read more about it and even watch a video over at Stereogum .
It looks like Radiohead have finally responded to Cyrus ’ threat by covering her very own Taylor Swift - jockin ’ song , and the lead single from the Hannah Montanna Movie Soundtrack , “ The Climb . ”
Who knew Thom Yorke has such a great sense of humor ?
But I really do love what they did to the song .
I ’m still in complete shock and at a complete loss for words … just listen .

In an interview , a State Department official described the pressure building for a new policy toward Cuba as a “ steamroller ” and said that the administration was “ trying to drive it , rather than get run over by it . ”
The official said any overtures toward Cuba would be made cautiously , allowing Mr. Obama to walk a fine line between those who want to end the embargo and those who see any engagement with Cuba as making concessions to a dictatorship .
The official said that the administration also wanted to be careful to make it clear that its openness to engagement with Cuba did not mean the United States would turn a blind eye to the Cuban government ’s poor record on human rights .
Experts on Cuba said there were good reasons for Mr. Obama ’s caution .
Among them is that the president has a full legislative agenda and does not want opposition by anti-Castro conservatives to interfere with more pressing concerns .
The experts added that it was almost impossible to predict Havana ’s next move and that the Cuban government had a history of shutting the door each time there was any serious move toward improving relations .
Indeed , after the recent Latin American summit meeting , Fidel Castro said that Mr. Obama had misinterpreted comments by President Raúl Castro , his brother , that “ everything ” would be up for discussion .
Carl E. Meacham , who is a senior foreign policy adviser to Senator Richard G. Lugar , Republican of Indiana , and who wrote a report critical of the United States ’ embargo , said : “ We in Washington have to focus on our own objectives , and not on events in Havana .
What we ’re doing is threatening to President Castro , and there will be reaction .
But we have to keep moving forward . ”
The Obama administration has indicated that it would like the Cuban government to stop charging fees on remittances sent to the island , open Cuba to American telecommunications companies and release all political prisoners .
But another State Department official , echoing Mr. Meacham , said the United States would not delay its own efforts while waiting for Havana to make such moves .
“ I do n’t think we want to paint a big red line in the sand to preclude any conversations , ” the official said .
“ We need to begin having conversations . ”
Detecting and reporting unhandled exceptions with SetUnhandledExceptionFilter seemed logical , and , in fact , it worked ... for a while .
Eventually , we started to notice failures that should have been reported as a last - chance exception but were n't .
After much investigation , we discovered that both Direct3D and Flash were installing their own unhandled exception filters !
Worse , they were fighting over it , installing their handlers several times per second !
In practice , this meant our last - chance crash reports were rarely generated , convincing us our crash metrics were better than they were .
( Bad , bad libraries ! )
It 's pretty ridiculous that we had to solve this problem , but , as Avery Lee says , " Just because it is not your fault does not mean it is not your problem . "
The obvious solution is to join the fray , calling SetUnhandledExceptionFilter every frame , right ?
How about we try something a bit more reliable ...
I hate implementing solutions that have obvious flaws .
Thus , we chose to disable ( with code modification ) the SetUnhandledExceptionFilter function immediately after installing our own handler .
When Direct3D and Flash try to call it , their requests will be ignored , leaving our exception handler installed .
Code modification ... is n't that scary ?
With a bit of knowledge and defensive programming , it 's not that bad .
In fact , I 'll show you the code up front :

If this does n't make sense , skip the code and come back ! void lockUnhandledExceptionFilter ( ) { HMODULE kernel32 = LoadLibrary A (" kernel32.dll " ) ; Assert ( kernel32 ) ; if ( FARPROC gpaSetUnhandledExceptionFilter = GetProcAddress ( kernel32 , " SetUnhandledExceptionFilter " ) ) { unsigned char expected_code [ ] = { 0x8B , 0xFF , // mov edi , edi 0x55 , // push ebp 0x8B , 0xEC , // mov ebp , esp } ; // only replace code we expect if ( memcmp( expected_code , gpaSetUnhandledExceptionFilter , sizeof ( expected_code ) ) == 0 ) { unsigned char new_code [ ] = { 0x33 , 0xC0 , // xor eax , eax 0xC2 , 0x04 , 0x00 , // ret 4 } ; BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT( sizeof( expected_code ) == sizeof ( new_code ) ) ; DWORD old_protect ; if ( VirtualProtect ( gpaSetUnhandledExceptionFilter , sizeof ( new_code ) , PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE , &old_protect ) ) { CopyMemory ( gpaSetUnhandledExceptionFilter , new_code , sizeof ( new_code ) ) ; DWORD dummy ; VirtualProtect ( gpaSetUnhandledExceptionFilter , sizeof ( new_code ) , old_protect , & dummy ) ; FlushInstructionCache( GetCurrentProcess ( ) , gpaSetUnhandledExceptionFilter , sizeof ( new_code ) ) ; } } } FreeLibrary ( kernel32 ) ; }
If that 's obvious to you , then great :
We 're hiring !
Otherwise , here is an overview :
Use GetProcAddress to grab the real address of SetUnhandledExceptionFilter .
( If you just type &SetUnhandled Exception Filter you 'll get the relocatable import thunk , not the actual SetUnhandledExceptionFilter function . )
Most Windows functions begin with five bytes of prologue :
mov edi , edi ; 2 bytes for hotpatching support push ebp ; stack frame mov ebp , esp ; stack frame ( con't )
We want to replace those five bytes with return 0 ; .
Remember that __stdcall functions return values in the eax register .
We want to replace the above code with :
xor eax , eax ; eax = 0 ret 4 ; pops 4 bytes ( arg ) and returns
Also five bytes !
How convenient !
Before we replace the prologue , we verify that the first five bytes match our expectations .
( If not , we can't feel comfortable about the effects of the code replacement . )
The VirtualProtect and FlushInstructionCache calls are standard fare for code modification .
After implementing this , it 's worth stepping through the assembly in a debugger to verify that SetUnhandledExceptionFilter no longer has any effect .
( If you really enjoy writing unit tests , it 's definitely possible to unit test the desired behavior .
I 'll leave that as an exercise for the reader . )
Finally , our last - chance exception reporting actually works !
Last week , Philippine President Gloria Macapagal - Arroyo signed an executive order to establish two branches of national youth service .
The programs will include the National Service Corps and the Youth Conservation Corps .
Projects will include cleaning up the environment , planting trees , building parks , teaching , and establishing food banks , and more .
Both new programs will recruit people ages 18 - 24 to commit to two years of service in exchange for a chance to improve their communities , build skills , and earn modest pay .
The National Youth Corps is intended to offer “ unemployed or underemployed skilled [ Filipino ] youth or college graduates a chance to contribute to education and community service programs . ”
The Youth Conservation Corps is intended to connect “ unskilled or less educated [ Filipino ] youth ” with service opportunities in the environment and infrastructure fields .
The YCC will absorb an existing program called OYSTER ( Out of School Youth Serving Towards Economic Resistance ) , which enabled out - of - school youth to receive modest pay in exchange for doing environmental , government infrastructure and road maintenance jobs .
“ During these trying times , the Philippine spirit and commitment to caring should prompt each of us to count our blessings and give back to those who are less fortunate .
Our nation needs us all pulling in the same direction .
Volunteering time , skill and resources is a noble undertaking we should all take seriously , ” Macapagal - Arroyo said .
Please note that these programs are domestic programs for residents of the Philippines ; they are not international volunteer programs for U.S. citizens to take part in .

After trillions in taxpayer debt has been foolishly poured into the bottomless black hole of leftist wealth redistribution programs , under the guise of economic “ stimulus ” or “ stabilization ” legislation , the new “ ONE World ” government running Washington DC announces ; Geithner , Bernanke Call for New Wind - Down Powers After AIG ... and the people still sit silent as they watch Obamanation grow in unbridled power .
Geithner Asks Congress for even Broader Power to Seize private Firms as the average American stumbles through their daily routine as if nothing is happening .
Canada Free Press managing editor Judi McLeod writes
No cheerleader for propping up greenback at G20 summit asking , “ Is the table being set for One World Government rather than speeding the recovery of the worldwide recession at next week ’s G20 London summit ? ”
Obamanation has taken the nation from a trillion in debt to over $ 4 trillion in debt in the first sixty days , with even more federal spending promised , which could put the nation $ 10 trillion in debt before the 2010 mid-term election cycle .
Amnesty for illegals and ACORN led redistricting will make 2010 and beyond a moot point .
Still , beyond the movement to mail tea bags to members of congress or file another legal demand for proof of Obama ’s constitutional eligibility for the office he holds , both of which are like whistling in the breeze , the people remain largely silent .
Threatened with a Soup Line Existence
The American people would never trade personal freedom for the false promise of federally redistributed free - stuff under some ill - fated socialist experiment , unless they were first threatened with a soup line existence .
And so it shall be …
50 % of their life savings and 30 % of their home values have already evaporated into thin air .
National unemployment is driving towards double digits as home foreclosures continue to mound .
With their backs against the wall , confused by a daily diet of media manipulated headlines aimed at scaring the public into submission , convinced that our nation ’s complex woes demand a solution far too complicated for the average peasant to comprehend , the people find themselves in a state of terminal paralysis .
Incompetent Evil in Charge
The same people responsible for the many disasters now surrounding every American household , were elected in 2006 and 2008 to fix what they broke .
Instead of reversing course and placing their faith in the principles of freedom , they are installing more of the same failed entitlement policies that created the problem and they are doing so at a fever pace .
The folks currently in charge of the nation do n’t like anything at all about the nation that once was .
They have a very different vision for America , one based on redistribution of free - stuff , not equal access to freedom .
At the foundation of personal freedom is the right to make your own decisions , invest and risk your own capital , own your own property and keep that which you are willing to work and sacrifice to earn .
It ’s called economic freedom , aka capitalism .
But capitalism is public enemy # 1 in America today , thanks to decades of class warfare and the art of division via social envy , all for purpose of political gain .
Life , Liberty and the right to individually define and pursue Happiness has been replaced with the right of some to take from others against their will , in the name of a greater common good , better defined as the entitlement mentality .
The Change Agents New World Dictionary
Old concepts have been redefined .
Capitalism is now referred to as Fascism .
Personal ambition is now called greed .
Those who seek access to other people ’s rightful earnings are called charitable , and those who demand a right to only that , which they earn , are called greedy .
It is n’t just the words that have new definitions .
The concepts have new meaning as a result .
Words like socialism and communism no longer have a negative connotation attached to them .
Most Americans have no idea what they are anymore , or why they do n’t want to find out the hard way .
The concept of liberal interpretations limits the meaning of words only to one ’s individual imagination .
The Constitution means only what someone imagines it to mean .
If the shoe does n’t quite fit , a new definition will solve the problem .
What are Americans Waiting For ?
I do n’t know what it will take to wake up the average American , but whatever it is , it has n’t happened yet …
The people currently stocking up on food , water , guns and ammo in record numbers , causing shortages in all the above at the retail level , are clearly awake and anticipating something , but what ?
Meet the “ extremists … ”
The people still trying to get a court somewhere in America to hear the arguments concerning the most secretive corrupt president in US history , have been awake for a long time .
Meet the “ birthers … ”
But they continue to have trouble waking anyone else up , including in the so - called halls of justice .
Is it a bankrupt dollar and a new international currency that will get their attention ?
- A North American Union ? - An ACORN Army on their doorstep ?
What will be the final straw that breaks the proverbial camel ’s back ?
I do n’t have the answer …
Frankly , I expected the people to revolt long before now .
Clearly , I had underestimated the depth of apathy and tolerance for anti-American nonsense in the average modern American .
But then , so did our nation ’s founders , whom I ’m certain are rolling over in their graves in disgust by now .
The Silent Consent Continues
Nobody knows for how long or at what expense , but so far , the people remain silent and Washington continues to profitably interpret that silence as broad - based consent .
At this late date , I have no idea what will wake up the average American or how they might react once finally awake and ready to engage in self - governance .
However , I am sure about two things …
When they finally do awake , they are going to be really angry …
And , the anti-American left wo n’t let up until then …
The clock is n’t just ticking .
Time has already run out as of the 2008 election .
Washington DC is currently dismantling America , individual right by individual right , in an unprecedented massive multi-faceted assault on all things American .
If you are not familiar with the Democratic Socialists of America or their legislative branch , the Congressional Progressive Caucus , I strongly suggest that you take time to learn them well .
They are in charge of your nation .
This is who the average American is up against and they are a very well funded and organized enemy of the state .
You will not be able to take your country back without putting these two organizations out of business .
The longer you wait , the tougher the battle , the higher the price .
Clearly , the organizational skills of the average American are equal only to that of the stumbling bumbling Republican Party .
Fragmented , distracted and disorganized , the people are no match for the leftist juggernaut running roughshod in DC .
The people are lost , so they are losing …
The most complex problems require the simplest of solutions .
But the average American is so baffled by a daily diet of elitist B.S. , that they cannot even see daylight …
–
When all else fails , return to the basics !
Here ’s to the average American waking up in time ! -
Good luck !
Last month , Google announced the launch of Google Earth 5.0 – The Ocean , a new feature that enables users of Google Earth to dive beneath the water surface , explore 3D underwater terrain and browse ocean - related content contributed by leaders in ocean science and advocacy .
At the launch event in San Francisco , former vice - president Al Gore said the following to event attendees :
“ With this latest version of Google Earth , you can not only zoom into whatever part of our planetâ€™s surface you wish to examine in closer detail , you can now dive into the worldâ€™s oceans that cover almost three - quarters of the planet and discover new wonders that had not been accessible in previous versions of this magical experience . ”
Opportunity to study world ’s oceans in the context of climate change
At first glance , the ocean feature appears to be not much more than a cool tool .
However , it actually has bigger implications for studying the role of the ocean in the context of climate change .
Ocean researchers , many of whom gathered at the Google Earth 5.0 launch , provided proof of the need to display ocean data in an attempt to educate the public .
To illustrate this CNN , said that researchers at Stanford University and Duke University were eager to show the tracks of shark travels recorded by radio transmission to satellites .
Another showed a Google Earth animation of the gradually shrinking Arctic ice cap over the last 29 years ; a third supplied underwater video of the Red Sea as part of the foundation ’s mission to chronicle the state of coral reefs .
According to Eric Schmidt , the chief executive of Google , the discussion on climate change , typically neglects the world ’s oceans even though about one third of the carbon dioxide that we emit into the atmosphere ends up in the oceans .
Recently , there has been increased awareness about issues such as acid oceans , biodiversity loss in our oceans and the importance of sustainable fishing .
Google Earth 5.0 will serve as a platform not just to witness life in the ocean but also to understand its threats and dangers .
Take a virtual scuba diving trip
The ocean feature is on by default in the newest version of Google Earth .
As users zoom in on the ocean they will see a dynamic water surface , and once they dive beneath the surface they can navigate 3D sea floor terrain .
The feature includes 20 content layers , containing information contributed by the world ’s leading scientists , researchers , and ocean explorers .
These include :
An “ Explore the Ocean ” layer containing photos and videos about ocean hot spots around the world contributed by over 80 individuals and organizations
A National Geographic Magazine geo-quiz and overlays from their new Atlas of the Ocean
Videos from the archives of Jacques Cousteau , featuring never - before - seen footage of historic ocean expeditions
If nothing else , the ocean feature will provide a convenient way for people to go virtual scuba diving to explore life in the under the sea .
Virtual travelers to Hawaii , for example , can examine underwater volcanoes , see videos about the exotic marine life of the region , read about nearby shipwrecks and contribute photos and videos of favorite surf spots .
You can also use the feature to make smart choices about seafood in your area .
The Monterey Bay Aquarium , has used Google Earth to show the location of various types of fish — along with ratings for people about whether they should eat those varieties or substitute others .
Google Earth Takes the Plunge below provides a wonderful video preview of these features .

The largest organism on Earth , and probably the oldest multicellular organism , is named Pando .
Kind of a cutesy name for such an impressive specimen , do n't you think ?
If you were to meet Pando -- which you could easily do , if you paid a visit to Fishlake National Forest in Utah -- it would look like a forest of Quaking Aspen trees .
But if you happened to be equipped to do DNA testing on plant specimens , you would realize that all of the trees were genetically identical .
That 's because they 're all part of the same tree , sharing a common root system .
One tree springs from a seed , long ago , and spreads out roots ; but then more trees erupt from those roots , and the process simply continues .
Individual " trees " might die , but that 's like you or me losing a toenail ; Pando lives on .
It weighs in at over six million kilograms , and is likely more than 80,000 years old ( although it might be much older ) .
I have nothing especially profound to say about Pando , I just think it 's cool .
But when you have arrow - of - time on the brain , everything resonates .
Unlike most other multicellular organisms , there 's no reason why Pando should ever die , absent dramatic external factors .
As long as its environment remains hospitable , Pando could live forever .
Monocellular organisms , of course , do this all the time ; they split into " children " which are genetically identical ( up to mutations ) , so it 's legitimate to say that any given bacterium has lived for many millions of years .
The birth / growth / death cycle is not absolutely necessary to the existence of life -- it 's just useful , if life wants to avoid the very real possibility that the environment does dramatically change for the worse .
Giving birth to children with slightly different genetic makeups -- and then getting out of their way , by dying -- gives the species a fighting chance to adapt and survive in the face of dramatic changes around it .
( Update : some termites have a different strategy . )
Meanwhile , Pando abides .
Good for it .
The Obama administration ( or any administration for that matter ) can be aptly described by the titles of the comedy movie shorts made by The Three Stooges .
The Three Stooges made movie shorts with punnacious titles as parodies .
Every early short featured the slap - happy antics of Moe Howard , Curly Howard , and Larry Fine ( the original team ) , later manned by Shemp Howard , Joe Besser , and Joe DeRita .
The titles of numerous Stooge productions are perfectly applicable to the Obama team .
You would think that they could see 70 years into the future .
Lead off with the double feature " Pest Man Wins " and " Heavenly Daze . "
Going from there , " A Ducking They Did Go " might be paired with " Micro - Phonies . "
" All the World ’s a Stooge " definitely applies .
" Gents in a Jam " might go along with " No Dough Boys " or perhaps " Three Pests in a Mess . "
" Monkey Businessmen , " " Hoofs and Goofs , " and " Mummies Dummies " describe the government circus .
Or , to be more serious , " Disorder in the Court " and " Crime On Their Hands " fit hand in glove .
I especially like this one for the Washington crowd : " Dutiful but Dumb . "
Or this one : " Idiots Deluxe , " after the old Gable movie .
In the same vein , " Blunder Boys " is not bad .
So are " Creeps " and " Scrambled Brains . "
For all conspiracy advocates , I give you " Malice in the Palace . "
Then there is " Bedlam in Paradise " as we are " Gypped in the Penthouse " and " Triple Crossed . "
" Even as IOU " can be paired with " Three Loan Wolves , " or even " Hokus Pokus . " and " Cash is Hash . "
One effort had the threesome " Calling All Curs " instead of the police call " calling all cars . "
This is apt for any new administration that is busy staffing its offices .
Will the administration be " Saved by the Belle ? "
Can someone identify such a female ?
The Obama health care plan will be " From Nurse to Worse . "
It should be " Dunked in the Deep . "
Their short , Yes , We Have No Bonanza , parodied the 1923 tune Yes , We Have No Bananas .
It ’s apt for Obama , who has no bonanza but says " yes " anyway .
As that song told it ,
" There ’s a fruit store on our street It ’s run by a Greek .
And he keeps good things to eat
But you should hear him speak !
" When you ask him anything , he never answers u2018 no ’ .
He just u2018yes ’es you to death , And as he takes your dough , he tells you …
“ Yes !
We have no bananas We have no bananas today !!
We have string beans and onions , cabBAges and scallions
And all kinds of fruit and say We have an old fashioned toMAHto A Long Island poTAHto , but
Yes !
We have no bananas We have no bananas today ! "
Surely we can find among this crew " Three Missing Links . "
It is my earnest wish that we can say to this team : " So Long , Mr. Chumps " or even " Mutts to You . "
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
I had been the scheduled guest today on “ IMportant People ” ( sic ) , an online collaboration between students in a course taught by a colleague and The Buffalo News on Buffalo.com .
“ IMportant People , ” according to a house ad in today ’s News , is “ a weekly lunch hour , live - chat interview series featuring some of Buffalo ’s best and brightest … ” Yep , I had been scheduled to appear today .
My colleague told The News that his class had scheduled a media critic from Scholars and Rogues as a guest .
He invited The News to send a representative to join in as a co-guest .
It would have been a wonderful opportunity for The News — and me — to talk about western New York ’s largest newspaper in the context of the larger turmoil surrounding the industry .
But The News yanked the microphone , er , the keyboard , out of my hands .
The News was offered a guest and a topic in its own online platform that it could use to talk about its own efforts to meet the challenges of the current industry climate .
It could respond directly to readers online — which is precisely what the newspaper industry has to do to survive .
The appearance of a well - spoken representative ( and me ) in its own venue would have been its public relations folks ’ wet dream .
But The News declined the offer .
And nixed the topic — and me .
I do n’t know why ; I did n’t ask my colleague .
The program belongs to The News ; it can do what it damn well pleases .
But it missed an opportunity to speak directly to the online audience and answer this question : “ How is the newspaper going to ensure that it can continue to meet the needs of its readers ? ”
That The News not only refused to talk about this but also waved the students away from the entire topic depicts the newspaper as fearing circumstances in which it might face criticism .
Why would n’t it want to let its readers know how it was coping with the industry crisis ?
Why would it want to pretend like nothing ’s amiss ?
Why does n’t it want the lens of public scrutiny turned on itself ?
It seems the paper is behaving in exactly the way that , if it was a public official , the paper itself would crucify him or her for .
If a newspaper ’s representative was shut out of a public forum by someone else , it would scream “ foul ” in a too - long editorial about freedom of the press , etc .
Perhaps The News was concerned about what I might say to its online audience .
Too bad .
I would have said this :
I ’m proud of how The News has reacted to declining circulation and revenue .
Its Internet operation is done well .
It has resisted pulling reporter Jerry Zremski from his Washington , D.C. , post , allowing News readers unique insights into politics with a western New York context .
I like how The News continues to support exceptional , veteran reporters like Bob McCarthy , Dan Herbeck and Lou Michel .
I like how it has freed Steve Watson to report more on communications and the Internet .
The News has been a better newspaper in the past .
But it remains , still , a good one .
I ’m willing to pay 75 cents for a newsstand copy before heading off for a diner breakfast .
And today , The News ’ online audience will not read that in an online chat .
They ’ll have to come here , to Scholars and Rogues , to read it .
Sustainability needs lots of entrepreneurs .
It needs outside - the - box thinkers and doers to help us find new ways of producing , consuming and being of service to each other .
I ’ll bet that you , yourself , have a talent or idea you ’ve fantasized about making a living at .
I spent 1992 to 2004 as a small business owner , designing and selling journals and cards to natural food stores nationwide , including many Whole Foods accounts .
Wildflowers and mythological figures were my best - selling designs , and handmade paper from recycled materials was my art - medium .
Sometimes I felt joy and fierce vitality over being creatively self - employed , and sometimes I despaired over the financial difficulties involved .
At all times , I would have benefited from the following five tips .
( I ’ll post Part II with the other five tips later this week . )
Find and use mentors who are truly qualified to advise you .
Who is profitably doing what you want to do for a living ?
( The fact they are doing it does not necessarily indicate profit . )
Ask them probing questions about their business and their lessons - learned , and take their answers seriously , even if the truth is not what you want to hear .
Devote yourself to sales and marketing , get someone else to do it – or let go of being in business .
This is a hard one for many .
The entrepreneur may be passionate about the content of the business ( the product or service itself ) , and see getting people to buy it as a separate topic , or even a pesky intrusion to the passion .
The reality is the opposite : sales are your make - or - break .
If you ca n’t embrace that , you have a hobby , not a business .
Do n’t imagine you ’re available for starting a new relationship .
If you ’re already in a stable marriage or other relationship , it will be tested by your emerging business , but may stay intact .
If you are trying to start a new business and new relationship at the same time , they will almost surely sabotage each other .
I suggest these worthy activities belong at different times in a person ’s life .
Do n’t expect family members or friends to help finance your enterprise .
This is your venture , not theirs , and nobody is obligated to share in your risk .
Loans are better characterized as gifts , because repayment is statistically unlikely , and failure to repay can ruin trust and goodwill .
( A viable exception to this rule may be family members who join or expand each others ’ existing legal or medical practices . )
Be willing to be self - employed part - time .
At the least , do n’t expect to make a living in the first two years of your business .
My friend Libby built her therapy practice little by little as she worked full - time at a public agency .
A year later , she was doing both half - time , and a year after that her practice was a thriving , full - time concern and the agency job a distant memory .
She never had to go into debt to be self - employed .
The bottom line is that the human spirit is creative , and being an entrepreneur is a creative endeavor that demands ruthless practicality at the same time .
At its best , it can find solutions to the world ’s problems in ways that nothing else can .
Read on for Part II of Top Ten Tips For Entrpreneurs .

Why is n't somebody helping me ???
“ Life is but a brief moment .
The years go by quickly and old age arrives suddenly before we have an inkling .
People desire so many things and waste their days in vain .
Some yearn for gold , others for power , yet others for glory and a higher station .
But when death ’s moment nears and they look back at their lives they ’ve lived , they realize they ’ve been happy only during those moments when they ’ve loved . ”
- Borje Vahamaki
“ Life is ours to be spent , not to be saved . ”
– D.H. Lawrence
“ Life is no brief candle to me .
It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got a hold of for the moment , and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it onto future generations . ”
– George Bernard Shaw
“ For a long time it seemed to me that real life was about to begin , but there was always some obstacle in the way .
Something had to be got through first , some unfinished business ; time still to be served , a debt to be paid .
Then life would begin .
At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life . ”

Dude This Entry Is Weird – This Is Not Like Your Normal Articles .
What Gives ?
For years ago I have collected quotes that have in some way affected me and changed my life .
I collect them in random places – a professor opening a lecture with one , books and those irritating spam forwards from friends .
I have literally kept some scraps for years in physical folders – clipping from magazines and printed copies .
I have occasionally used these quotes to illustrate my articles .
For a long time , I have saved them , hoping for the right article to insert them into .
When Ali Hale offered to write about motivation when your passion fades , I dug up a quote from a Reader ’s Digest scrap I ’d ripped out over 15 years ago to help drive the point home .
I have now realized that six months have gone by , and due to my hardly using quotes in my writing , I have not shared many of these inspirational quotes about life .
It struck me as I drew a parallel between what I was doing , and another quote I really enjoy :
“ Start living now .
Stop saving the good china for that special occasion .
Stop withholding your love until that special person materializes .
Every day you are alive is a special occasion . ”
– Mary Manin Morrissey
I do not know when the right time will be for many of my favorite quotes .
If I find an appropriate article I will reuse the quotes to illustrate a apoint – but even if I can’t , I still want to share them , else I do a great disservice to you , my readers .
Enjoy , and there will be more to come , perhaps once every couple weeks .
She told the Guardian newspaper : " They wanted to pass it almost like a secret negotiation , " There were lots of things that we wanted to change , but they did n't want to discuss it because Karzai wants to please the Shia before the election . "
The Dalek of the deep : Doctor
Who 's nemesis is found in pond
Volunteer Marc Oakland was stunned when he pulled the head of a Dalek from the murky depths of a pond he was helping to clean .
The 42 - year - old sales executive found part of Doctor Who ’s arch nemesis as he pushed a rake along the surface while wading waist - high in water .
He said : ‘ I ’d just shifted a tree branch with my foot when I noticed something dark and round slowly coming up to the surface .
Excavate !
Excavate !
Volunteer Mark Oakland with the Dalek 's head he dredged up
‘ I got the shock of my life when a dalek head bobbed up right in front of me . ’
His group , who were clearing rubbish near Beaulieu , Hampshire , had already fished out an old table football game , dozens of lager cans and even a muddy skateboard .
But the last thing they were expecting to find was a full size head from one of the Time Lord ’s most feared adversaries complete with its distinctive eye stalk .
‘ It must have been down there for some time because it was covered in mould and water weed , and had quite a bit of damage , ’ said Mr Oakland .
‘ One of the dome lights was smashed , but the eye stalk was intact and the head and neck stayed in one piece as I carefully lifted it out . ’
Who 's this ?
Mr Oakland made the discovery at the pond in Beaulieu , Hampshire
The pitiless Daleks , famed for killing their enemy with a death ray after screeching ‘ exterminate ’ , were taken to the area to film episodes in the 1980s .
Pond warden Tony Brown , 70 , who led the volunteers , said : ‘ We made a very thorough search of the rest of the bottom of the pond and there were definitely no alien remnants lurking .
‘ We ”ve all agreed it best to keep the pond ’s exact location under wraps .
‘ The last thing we want are sci - fi fans descending on the pond frantically seraching for other dalek parts . ’
Mr Brown , who has been helping clear out the area for the past eight years , said : ‘ We ”ve dredged up everything from shopping trolleys , toys , and bicycles .
‘ But this is the first time a dalek ’s appeared .
We have no idea how it ended up in there , or how long ago .
Enemy : Daleks , like above , were taken to the area for filming during the 1980s
‘ The local council collected the rest of the junk we pulled out , but we”ve kept the dalek head and are getting a dalek expert to have a look at it .
‘ After doing some research , we discovered the BBC often took the daleks out on location for filming , and they travelled to Hampshire on at least one occasion in the 1980s , when Colin Baker played the Time Lord .
‘ Jon Pertwee also made a few Doctor Who episodes in the county during the 1970s .
‘ Who knows , this might be the remains of one of the originals from the old TV series .
I ’m told they they were built to last . ’

Pardon me , Toronto , but your sushi manners are atrocious .
Servers cringe when you unwrap your chopsticks and rub them together vigorously like some demented carpenter with a splinter phobia .
Chefs weep when you pick up delicately seasoned bundles of nigiri with chopsticks and dip them rice - side down into an overflowing dish of soy sauce , the colour of which approximates the Don River owing to runoff from vast amounts of wasabi .
It 's not your fault .
The finer points of sushi etiquette are largely unknown outside Japan .
Add to that the fact that there are only 30 or 40 Japanese - trained sushi chefs in the city 's estimated 700 sushi joints , and you begin to grasp the magnitude of the problem .
Chances are the sushi you 've been eating is n't even authentic sushi , particularly if it contains any of the following : avocado , cream cheese , mayonnaise or deep - fried anything .
" Nobody cares about it , " says Keiichi Masuda , owner and chef at Mikado restaurant on Laird Dr. in Leaside , which he opened 31 years ago .
" Only sushi chefs care . "
About five years ago , he gently suggested to a sushi- bar customer that she should n't dip the nigiri into the soy rice - side down , and that she was using too much sauce .
" She got mad and never came back , " says the chef , who serves sea urchin , octopus , squid , barbecued eel , monkfish liver and salmon that he smokes himself over imported Japanese cherrywood .
" That 's why I made the sign . "
The one - page handouts on sushi etiquette are scattered about the restaurant and inserted inside each menu .
Last week , he gave them to kimono - clad beauties to hand out at the Japanese food booth at the Canadian Food and Beverage Show at the Exhibition grounds .
Masuda , a vice - president of the Japanese Restaurant Association of Canada , is polite to the extreme , and suggests his poor English was part of the problem .
" I do n't want to push too many Japanese customs , " says Masuda .
" The main thing is , the customer enjoys my food . "
In our condiment - crazy culture , where food is a canvas to be built upon , adding a puddle of ketchup or a dollop of hot sauce is the norm .
But adding wasabi to the special preparation of soy sauce made by sushi chefs to complement their nigiri is the same thing as adding salt and pepper to a three - star chef 's food without tasting it first .
The North American palate , which craves salt and has become more accustomed to spicy food , conspires to ruin the sushi experience , particularly when it comes to eating nigiri : small , hand - shaped rectangular blocks of seasoned rice topped with raw fish .
The absolute biggest no - no for nigiri is dipping it rice - first into the soy sauce .
That 's because the rice has already been perfumed with a mixture of rice wine vinegar , sugar , salt , a cooking wine called mirin and kombu or seaweed .
The chef wants you to be able to taste all that .
The sushi chef has also packed the rice by hand so that it falls apart when it hits your mouth .
If you dunk it in soy , some stays behind in the dish and makes a soupy mess .
The second biggest insult is to add wasabi to the soy , since the chef has already placed what he deems to be the correct amount for the fish , fatty or lean , on top of the rice .
In some places like Mikado and Hiro Sushi on King St. E. , the chef will have made his own soy - based sauce for the nigiri , infusing it with tamari , mirin and bonito flakes .
You can usually tell if this is the case , because it will be served in small ceramic jugs .
You are meant to pick the nigiri up with your fingers , turn it upside down , gently pass the fish through the sauce and place it on your tongue fish - side down .
Assuming it 's not jumbo - sized , eat it all in one bite .
" The rice is not too sticky so it will break and the aroma comes to the nose , and the wasabi hits the tongue and the soy sauce counteracts the fish smell , " explains Hiro Yoshida , owner and chef of Hiro Sushi , who is also a vice - president of the Japanese Restaurant Association of Canada .
" It 's like creating one world inside your mouth . "
The rules change for maki and sashimi , which are eaten with chopsticks .
It 's even okay to mix wasabi into the soy sauce .
But never , ever eat pickled ginger on top of your sushi .
It 's a palate cleanser to be eaten in between different kinds of fish .

Jazz singer - songwriter Robyn Hayle stopped by Mikado last week to indulge in her weakness for raw fish .
The Toronto resident has been eating sushi for more than 20 years and considers herself an expert .
She stopped eat futomaki , the big vegetarian roll that features omelette and vegetables , because it 's " too plebeian . "
She knows not to eat pickled ginger with sushi , and loves some of the fish Canadians avoid , but did n't know she should dip the nigiri fish - side down into the soy sauce , or that the soy was specially prepared for nigiri .
The next time she ate sushi , she tried it .
" I had a much better experience , " she reports .
" The rice did n't fall apart in the dish . "
Among Japanese chefs , some of whom apprentice for as many as 10 years before they are deemed educated enough to open their own restaurant , customers who know the etiquette and are not turned off by , say , barbecued eel , are called sushi tsu , or connoisseurs .
" There are a lot of customers in this restaurant who are sushi tsu , " says Yoshida . "
My clients , the Canadians , are much better than Japanese people because I educated them . "
Table manners have always been man 's way of imposing order on his chaotic world , part of the drive to be civilized , to put some distance between apes and homo sapiens .
The rules are sometimes arcane to the max in any culture .
Who knows why some of us were taught to switch our fork from right to left hand in order to cut our meat ?
In the same way , some of the Japanese rules are rooted in ancient customs .
So the samurai do n't put more than the first inch of the chopsticks into their mouths .
Japanese chefs are not arguing that you should , too .
Like any chef , they just want you to appreciate their food .
And like the French chef who shrinks in horror from a customer who asks for ketchup for his steak frites , sushi chefs know you would enjoy their food much more if you laid off the soy sauce and wasabi .
Please .

( Thank you very much . )
There are many opinions regarding the Global Warming / Cooling debate , not least of which is the cost to the ' average ' person , the one who works hard to make a better life for themselvs and then have their tax money wasted on loads of scientist who cannot agree on one thing .
Having said that , we are in the mist of a global economy crisis so could someone please explain why we are now spending another 19 million to have a summit for world leaders to agree on nothing ?
Tens of thousands of protesters are taking part in rallies , marches and stunts to coincide with the G20 summit in London .
Campaigners waving flags and placards have braved wet weather to be part of the Put People First march , which comes amid anger at the £ 19 million cost of staging the conference at a time of economic downturn .
Climate change activists , anti-war campaigners , trade unionists , charity workers and students will take part .
Organisers of some of the protests have complained that police briefings have given the impression that the demonstrations will be mounted by anarchists intent on causing trouble .

An ear to the courtroom floor
by Jeremy Hooper
It 's now over .
But if you missed any of today 's Prop 8 hearing , you can listen to the complete set of arguments right here :
9AM - 9:36 AM ( minter , marshall ) :
9:36AM-9:59 AM ( maroko ) :
9:59 AM - 10:18 AM ( stewart ) :
10:18 AM - 10:51 AM ( krueger ) :
10:51 AM - 11:45 AM ( ken starr ) :
11:45 AM - 12:12 PM ( rebuttals ) :
The court has 90 days to either do the right thing or keep Prop 8 .
**SEE ALSO : Want to compare today 's hearing to last year 's winning arguments ?
Well , we have the '08 hearing archived here
**UPDATE : Andy Towle has a roundup of local media coverage .
Your thoughts
It 's great that Kenneth Starr is before the court in defense of prop 8 .
He like the GOP extremists of our day is terribly abrasive and extremist .
I think that the Justices are troubled by this extremism .
His view seems terribly extreme in his view that the majority of the people have almost unchecked right to amend the constitution .
Posted by : Benjamin | Mar 5 , 2009 2:10:16 PM
When Starr was speaking , my video feed crashed several times ...
I wonder if that is ominous ?
Talk about the dark side !
Posted by : Dick Mills | Mar 5 , 2009 3:40:32 PM
So , since they already have their opionions written , and none of this mattered .
I think they will uphold the marriages to November 5 . ... and validate Prop 8 .
So , how a minority can get rights back that are taken away I have no clue .
Stewart was great and should have had all our sides time .
JBrown sent substitute , who was not very good .
Starr was the only one ' comfortable ' in front of the court , but he was not persuasive .
Chief Justice George wants the whole Amendment process in CA changed .
Yesterday preferably .
Posted by : LOrion | Mar 5 , 2009 3:42:04 PM
Any news on when we can expect to actually hear the decision ?
Posted by : RainbowPhoenix | Mar 5 , 2009 4:44:25 PM
The punditocracy seems to have heard the court saying that they will uphold H8 , but not divorce the same - sex couples who were legally married .
I wonder how much of the questioning from the justices is a process of " playing devil 's advocate " rather than a tell of the " true " intent .
On one day you hear George suggest that the primary benefit that we gained from last year 's decision was the fact that we have been classified as a suspect class .
Then , today we hear him asking questions which seem to suggest that that suspect classification is immaterial to the discussion of Prop H8 .
Which makes me wonder how much of his ( and other 's ) questions were more leading ... but I may just be over - analyzing hoping to find the missing pearls in the dog poop .
Posted by : Dick Mills | Mar 5 , 2009 7:03:50 PM
No , Dick , I think you 're right on the money .
I think it 's dangerous to read into the justices every word as if they are speaking their heart and mind .
It is their job to put the arguments through the ringer .
And yes , much of what George had to say does go against some of the wonderful things we have hear dhim say while not in a court setting .
Me , I 'm going to have a glass of wine and breathe .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Mar 5 , 2009 7:07:43 PM
Hey not only that you guys but these justices have to be " prudent " in how they analyze this whole thing being extremely careful to respect precedence , looking at all sides of the issues and striving to be as unbiased as possible as well .
They look at all possible consequences of their decisions over the long run .

Buried in the fine print of many cellphone contracts is a bit about how you can transfer your plan to someone else — and you can find that someone online .
Advertisement
The NY Times reports on Celltradeusa.com and Cellswapper.com , two web services who match up people who want out of their contracts with folks who want in .
Why exactly would you want someone else 's cellphone contract ?
Simple : you can get fairly new devices and accessories , often free , without having to swallow a two - year commitment or pay an activation fee of $ 35 .
This is especially useful to those who are waiting for a new device to hit the market but do not want to spring for a new phone in the meantime .

The two sites charge a service fee , but one that 's a lot less than the penalty for ending your contract prematurely .
Anyone use either swap site to get out or into a cellphone contract ?
Let us know in the comments .

A once - obscure accounting rule that infuriated banks , who blamed it for worsening the financial crisis , was changed Thursday to give banks more discretion in reporting the value of mortgage securities .
The change seems likely to allow banks to report higher profits by assuming that the securities are worth more than anyone is now willing to pay for them .
But critics objected that the change could further damage the credibility of financial institutions by enabling them to avoid recognizing losses from bad loans they have made .
Critics also said that since the rules were changed under heavy political pressure , the move compromised the independence of the organization that did it , the Financial Accounting Standards Board .
During the financial crisis , the market prices of many securities , particularly those backed by subprime home mortgages , have plunged to fractions of their original prices .
That has forced banks to report hundreds of billions of dollars in losses over the last year , because some of those securities must be reported at market value each three months , with the bank showing a profit or loss based on the change .
“ Facebook ’s mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected . ”
That may or may not be Facebook ’s mission .
But at 200 million users , there ’s no denying that the social network has some appeal .
The new Facebook for Good page asks users of the network to share their stories about how Facebook has helped them give back to their communities , effect change or connect with a distant relative .
At the time of writing , there ’s a BBC story on how some teenager was ‘ saved by Facebook ’ , how the platform is being used for distance education , matchmaking , family reunions , and politcal and social mobilisation .
This last bit is very interesting and is why I added Pissu Poona to the list of sites the group features .
While Facebook ’s growth is astounding ( watch this video to see how much it is ) the diffusion of users on the platform and the resulting competition for limited and short - lived interest suggests that it is , no more and no less than any other web based platform , able to translate users to those who will contribute towards humanitarian aid financially .
Even a dollar from every user on Facebook would translate into a budget unimaginable in a lifetime of activism at the grassroots , but how realistic is this ?
On the other hand , is the value of social network in the connections themselves – i.e. not in how much of money FB is able to generate amongst users , but in how much of awareness it can raise , through connections made through its network , on issues , events and processes ?
These are challenging times for defense contractors .
Years of war and a limp economy are putting new pressure on the Pentagon ’s budget ; the military is radically reshaping its arsenal .
So Northrop Grumman ’s technical services wing decided it needed a new promotional video , to hype how important it is to America ’s national security .
The theme : Northrop as a fifth column , within the U.S. military .
" They could be anywhere among us ! " one rattled man screams .
In other words …
Welcome back to the Iron Eagles , our celebration of the awesomely bad videos of the military - industrial complex .
Now , give Northrop credit .
Unlike so many other military marketing flicks , this one is well - produced .
It ’s got a wicked sense of humor and kitsch .
And , if you watch to the end , you will get the message , that Northrop is " in a position to affect the performance of every warfighter the United States has around the world . "
But along the way , Northrop appears to reinforce every Mother Jones stereotype about a defense firm there could be : Unaccountable , omnipresent — and above all , filled with greed .
Take this mini-scene , for example …
EXECUTIVE 1 : Do you realize they have a stake in sixty - five cents out of every defense dollar spent ?
EXECUTIVE 2 : Imagine investor reactions .
EXECUTIVE 3 : The amount of cash involved !

The Inalienable Right of Secession
The Declaration of Independence of the United States of America invokes the self - evident truths that all men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights , that governments are formed to protect these rights and gain their just powers from the consent of the governed , and that when a government becomes abusive of these rights , it is the right — no , it is the duty — of the people to alter or abolish that government .
To say governments were formed to protect the rights of men would be historically incorrect .
Almost all governments were formed by ruthless men exerting their will over others through the use of force .
Some governments , over time , evolved toward the rule of law , perhaps only because their rulers saw that this would sanction their own continued enjoyment of the wealth that they possessed .
In some instances , this evolution involved one or more " revolutions " in which those who were governed were able to better establish the rule of law .
The language of the Declaration should not be construed as an argument about the historical origins of government but , rather , as what would be true and just to an enlightened person , namely , that as persons and as communities of persons , we have the right and the duty to alter or abolish governments that become abusive of our rights .
As Benjamin Franklin once put it , " Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God . "
According to legend , Zeus , the greatest and most terrible of the gods , was supposed to be the god of law , yet he was himself lawless .
When he heard that he would sire a child who would destroy him , he swallowed his wife whole to prevent it .
But the child grew within him and then burst from him fully grown .
This child was Athena , the goddess of victory , liberty , and peace .
And , she did indeed slay her father .
It should be easy to see , in this legend , how the rule of law might be established from a government formed through the use of force .
Now , does a massive increase in taxes , in spending , and in the federal deficit constitute such an abuse of the rights of men as to justify secession under the doctrine of an inherent right to secede ?
I do n't think so .
Ask me about the inherent right to secede when the government starts to restrict our freedom of speech , to shut down the independent media , to confiscate our guns , and to take away our children .
The International Law of Secession
The international law of secession is in the process of emerging at this very time .
The U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights indicates that all people have the right to a country .
A corollary of this is that no people should long be kept in nationless status , e.g. , the Palestinians .
A further corollary of this is that no people should long be kept in any subjugated status , such as by being citizens or subjects of a country from which they are alienated .
Now , as a practical matter , consideration has to be given to whether an identifiable people exist in an identifiable place .
At least , this is the current thinking .
But , if these several elements come together : an identifiable people in an identifiable place that grouse under the subjugation of the larger nation , there is a growing consensus that this people and place can be severed from the larger nation , even by rebellion and with support from outside the larger nation .
East Timor , Eritrea , and the devolutions of the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia ( including the ongoing situation in Kosovo ) illustrate the development of the international law of secession .
Turning to the United States , it is now well established that the country consists of so many " red " ( Republican ) and " blue " ( Democrat ) states , along with a few " purple " ( battleground ) states .
Even in a so - called landslide , like 2008 , only a few states " flip " from Republican to Democrat , and these states go from close Republican to close Democrat .
Furthermore , the whole purpose of elections has become to decide whether Democrats get to raise taxes on Republicans while adjusting the Alternative Minimum Tax so as to minimize the impact on themselves , and whether Democrats get to force acceptance of gay marriage onto Republicans or whether Republicans get to force unwanted pregnancies onto Democrats .
In other words , there no longer is any pretense of federalism in which domestic policy is left to the states of the Union .
Under these conditions , it can be argued that , were either party to fall into permanent minority status , and the other party to establish hegemonic control over the so - called federal government , the people in the other party could be said to be an alienated , identifiable people in an identifiable place , and could assert a right to secede under emerging international law .
The argument for secession under emerging international law might be strongest for Alaska .
Geographically , the place is disjoint from the other states of the Union , making it an identifiable place .
Furthermore , under their state constitution 's explicit right of privacy , possession of small amounts of marijuana is a right ; yet , the so - called federal government imposes the costs of its war on drugs onto the citizens of Alaska .
Furthermore , the people of Alaska have been long frustrated in developing their natural resources because of the opposition by majorities in the " lower 48 . "
Indeed , as a separate nation , Alaska might be the freest place in the world , with zero taxes because of its wealth in natural resources , well - established civil liberties , and a socially tolerant , live - and - let - live attitude among its people .
Following Alaska , states such as Florida and Texas would have the next best arguments for secession under international law , since they are themselves on a seacoast and their secession would not much disrupt the road , transmission wire , pipeline or other infrastructure networks of the other states .
States such as Utah and Kentucky , being landlocked " enclaves , " would have a relatively weak argument .
On the other hand , it would be relatively easy for these states to join with other states that have already seceded or are in the process of seceding , and form a patchwork of independent republics that develop compacts to facilitate interstate travel , commerce , water flow , transmission of electricity , and so forth .
– Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase speaking for the U.S. Supreme Court in White v. Texas " The Constitution , in all its provisions , looks to an indestructible Union , composed of indestructible States . "
US Law of Secession
The US law of secession is thought to have been decided by the US Supreme Court in White v. Texas , following the Civil War .
The actual matter to be decided was relatively insignificant .
The Court used the occasion to issue a very broad decision .
Chief Justice Chase , speaking for the Court , said ,
The union between Texas and the other States was as complete , as perpetual , and as indissoluble as the union between the original States .
There was no place for reconsideration or revocation , except through revolution or through consent of the States .
Notice that the second sentence appears to totally contradict the first sentence .
The first sentence I just quoted invokes words such as " perpetual , " and in so doing may create the impression that the Supreme Court decreed that no state could ever secede from the Union .
But , on careful reading , the relationship between Texas and the other states of the Union is merely " as indissoluble as the union between the original States . "
In other words , Texas , having been a nonoriginal state , has no greater right of secession than do the original states .
As to how states might secede , the second sentence says , " through revolution or through consent of the States . "
As to why a state might secede , either through revolution or through consent , Chief Justice Chase presciently discusses the 9th and 10th Amendments to the US Constitution , which reserve to the states and to the people thereof all powers not expressly granted to the federal government , and that the design of the Union , implicit in the very name " United States , " is the preservation of the states as well as of the Union :
the preservation of the States , and the maintenance of their governments , are as much within the design and care of the Constitution as the preservation of the Union and the maintenance of the National government .
The so - called United States of America ceases to exist when the political majority of the country attempts to rule the entire country as a nation instead of as a federal government .
In such a circumstance , the " indestructible union of indestructible states " of which the Court speaks is already dissolved .
As to whether " Texas " continued as a state and , furthermore , as a state of the United States during the period of rebellion , the Court made clear that it continued as both although certain rights that normally accrue to states of the United States fell into suspension .
Presumably , if Texas had seceded " with the consent of the States , " Texas would have been able to free itself from the Union described as the " United States , " and could have considered joining into another Union described as the " Confederate States . "
Also presumably , if the Confederate States of America had been able to impose their will onto the other states of the United States through force or had been able to induce the other states to consent , Texas and the other states of the Confederate States could have seceded from one Union and joined into another .
But , the outcomes of wars are problematic .
How Do " the States " Consent to Secession ?
The wide - ranging discussion of the Court in White v. Texas contains a lot of intriguing and obtuse comments .
How , for example , do " the States " give consent to the secession of a state ?
The Constitution , as the Court says , does not envision such a thing , and does not provide a process .
What if the legislatures of " the States " sent delegates to a convention that drafted a constitution for a more perfect union , which would take effect for those states that ratified it , providing that at least a two - thirds majority of them did so ?
For those who were not homeschooled , it may be necessary to point out that this was the process through which the Constitution of 1789 was created and through which eleven states seceded from the union provided by the Articles of Confederation , leaving Rhode Island and North Carolina as the only two states in that prior union .
( Those two states eventually also seceded from the prior union , thereupon making it a nullity , and joined into the new union . )
While the Constitution of 1789 required the secession of 9 out of 13 states , does this mean that a supermajority of the states would be necessary for consent ?
It seems to me that a supermajority would not be necessary , but only a simple majority , for a US version of what is called the " Velvet Revolution " in the former Czechoslovakia , now the Czech and Slovak Republics .
In that country , dissolution involved nothing more earth shattering than a bunch of accountants who scurried about the country , totting up the value of the assets of the national government that would fall into the possession of each succeeding government so as to determine how to fairly apportion the national debt to the succeeding governments .
Of course , in that case , both succeeding governments transitioned to membership in the European Union , guaranteeing the free flow of goods , labor and capital between them and the other members of the E.U. , as well as guaranteeing certain civil liberties and democratic processes to the persons in each of the succeeding republics .
Looking at the electoral maps of the United States of recent presidential elections , it appears that the potentially disaffected red states of a socially liberal , economically socialist blue nation constitute a nearly compact , self - contained block from the southeast coast to the Rocky Mountain west , plus Alaska .
Indiana and Ohio appear as two purple states jutting into an otherwise blue Great Lakes region .
New Hampshire is a purple state in a deeply blue New England ( but , being a coastline state , it would not matter much that it was not connected by land to other breakaway states ) .
Contrariwise , Colorado and New Mexico are two purple or blue states in the Rocky Mountain region that might wind up as enclaves of Old America amidst the independent republics of New America .
Of course , once it becomes clear that a majority of the states — and specifically those that are the most productive — are seceding , the remaining states of Old America will have to consider their options .
Would they want to bail out the corporations , the unionized public - school teachers , municipal workers , and the UAW , and the bankrupt states of California and New Jersey , among others , when the burden falls much more heavily onto them ?
A state like Minnesota , with a solid work ethic , which tends to vote Democratic in presidential elections , might think it could do better with New America than with the moochers of Old America .
Even Iowa , where they bury farmers only three feet deep nowadays , so they can still get their hand out , will have to weigh the pros of the ethanol subsidies they receive versus the cons of the taxes they will have to pay to subsidize everybody else .
Possibly , once the rush gets underway , the only " state " that will be left in Old America will be the District of Columbia .

The capital of the Philippines , a grouping of six cities and eighteen municipalities , is technically known as Metro Manila but usually referred to simply as MANILA , home to 10 million people .
Manila will never be a serious tourist destination until the authorities deal with the evils of traffic and pollution ; most tourists are in the capital because they have a day or two to kill either at the beginning or the end of a trip to the rest of the country .
In its favour , Manila has friendly people , some excellent nightlife , a few historical sights that are worth the effort , plus some of the most cavernous shopping malls in Asia .
At first sight , the city may seem clamorous , unkempt and rough around the edges , but what it lacks in architectural sophistication it makes up for with an accessible chaotic charm .
The way to enjoy it is to step into the fray and go with the flow , which is exactly what Manileños have learned to do .
Manila started life as a tiny settlement around the banks of the Pasig River .
The name comes from the words may ( " there is " ) and nilad ( a type of plant that grew near the Pasig ) .
With Spanish colonization , it grew into an important port .
King Philip II of Spain called Manila " Insigne y Siempre Leal Ciudad " ( " Distinguished and Ever Loyal City " ) .
Images of the city in the eighteenth century show grand merchants ' houses and schooners moored in the Pasig .
The area around Binondo , later to become Chinatown , was alive with mercantile activity .
Nineteenth - century travellers arriving in Manila were enchanted .
Manila 's population was 150,000 and there had been one murder in five years .
But this Manila was a doomed city .
At 7 pm on June 3 , 1863 , an earthquake struck and Manila crumbled .
The new Manila that grew in its stead was thoroughly modern , with streetcars , steam trains and American - style public architecture .
This was one of the most elegant and cosmopolitan cities in the Orient , but when the smoke cleared at the end of Japanese occupation in March 1945 , it was once again in ruins , having undergone relentless shelling from American howitzers and been set alight by retreating Japanese troops .
The Battle of Manila lasted 29 days and claimed 100,000 civilian lives .
Rebuilding was slow and plagued by corruption and government inertia .
As a consequence , the city that greets visitors today is one of emotional counterpoints , with areas of extreme poverty encroaching on frothy mansions and soaring glass skyscrapers .
In the days of the Spanish Empire , Manila was Spain ’s seat of power in Asia and the Pacific .
Today , the city and its people are a mish - mash of the East and West .
A string of harsh invasions ( Spain , USA , Japan ) and a history of hardships molded Filipinos into resilient , good - humored and resourceful people , traits that can be seen in their everyday life .
The friendliness of Filipinos translates to good customer service in hotels , businesses and malls .
Most residents speak English , so navigating the city is not a big problem .
These , plus the added purchasing value of the foreign exchange rate , make Manila a great place for guests looking for luxury , pampering and bargains .
‘ Manila ’ really refers to two places : the City of Manila , founded by Spanish conquerors in 1571 by the side of Manila Bay , and the larger Metropolitan Manila ( abbreviated to Metro Manila ) , which encompasses the City of Manila and 17 other cities .
Filipinos use ‘ Manila ’ to mean Metro Manila , while the term Manileño is reserved exclusively for the City of Manila ’s residents .
Manila ’s history is intertwined with its geographic location .
Manila Bay was an ideal port for Spanish ships bearing gold , spices , silk and ceramics ( treasure hunters still seek sunken Manila galleons today ) .
Unfortunately for Manileños , this also attracted a string of invaders .
Spain first conquered Manila in 1571 .
For 300 years , Spain successfully repelled a series of invasion attempts by the Chinese , Dutch and the British .
A Filipino revolutionary force triumphed over the Spanish in 1896 .
But this was shortlived as the USA took over Manila in 1898 .
The city finally got its independence after WWII .
The city is mostly warm and humid , with an average temperature of 27 °C ( 81 °F ) .
It gets cooler in the months of December to February ( down to around 21 °C / 70 °F ) , and warmer to hot during March to May ( up to around 34 °C / 93 °F ) .
The rainy season used to be in June to September , but this has shifted towards September to October , with typhoons often arriving during these months .
Manila has many facets to satisfy different tastes .
History buffs will enjoy the rich heritage of the old Manila city .
The Spanish influence is still evident in the old quarters of the city and in local traditions .
Most Filipinos are Catholic and Manila has numerous old churches , some dating back 300 years .
An exhibit at the National Museum displays sunken treasure from one of the Manila galleons dating back 1600 , discovered by divers only in 1991 .
Food lovers can feast on the diversity of local cuisine , which incorporates the good stuff from Spanish , Indian and Chinese cooking .
For the politically inclined , Metro Manila is the site of the EDSA Revolution , where citizens marched on the streets , notably in EDSA , to end the reign of dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his well - shod wife , Imelda .
People Power Revolution , as it was later called around the world , inspired several other non-violent marches in Nicaragua , Berlin and the former Soviet Union .
Shopaholics will love the malls easily accessible within the metropolis .
Recommended destinations in City of Manila are Intramuros and Fort Santiago ( the old Spanish settlement ) , Santa Cruz ( notably Chinatown ) and Malate ( for its bars ) , the National Museum and the Cultural Center of the Philippines .
For a quick , visual brush - up on Philippine history , the dioramas at the Ayala Museum are highly recommended .
A substantial open green area that showcases Manila at play , 58 - hectare ( 143 - acre ) Rizal Park is one of the largest parks in South - East Asia .
It is also known as Luneta , after the area it replaced .
Its local significance can be gauged by the fact that it is named after Dr José Rizal , the great Philippine anti-colonial fighter and thinker .
He is memorialised in the Diorama of the Martyrdom of Dr José Rizal , which becomes a son et lumière exhibit after sunset , and his remains were interred in the Rizal Monument in 1912 .
The many ornamental gardens include a re-creation of the entire Philippines archipelago in the eastern ponds .
There is also a Japanese Garden , a Chinese Garden , an Orchidarium , a chess plaza and a skating rink .
The museums and public buildings within its precincts include the Museum of the Pilipino People ( see below ) .
In the morning , residents assemble to practice tai chi , Philippine stick - fighting or sundry forms of martial arts , while on most Sundays , there is a free ‘ Concert at the Park ’ in an open - air auditorium .

The original city , founded in 1571 by the Spanish , Intramuros is located on the southern bank of the Pasig River .
Substantial sections of the encircling wall , which was begun in 1590 , remain , including a number of decorated gates .
In fact a poorly defensible site , Intramuros was the location of most major conflicts and invasions to befall the pre-independence Philippines , culminating in the devastating Battle for Manila between the Japanese and Americans in 1945 , in which over 100,000 locals died .
The surviving walls have been restored and many attractive historic buildings still remain within their precincts , while a walk beneath their ramparts gives a colonial experience hard to match in modern Asia .
Free admission .
One of the oldest and most dramatic colonial buildings in the Philippines , Fort Santiago was built to guard the entrance to the Pasig River and dates back , in its oldest sections , to 1571 .
Its most famous prisoner was the national hero , José Rizal , who spent his last days here before his death at the hands of the Spanish in 1896 .
More recent memories of tyranny include the legacy of wartime Japanese occupation , when Philippine freedom fighters suffered and died here .
In another cell block , American POWs were left to be drowned by the rising tide - this was one of the rumoured resting places for the legendary wartime trove of Yamashita ’s Gold and the victims ’ last resting place has been much disturbed by treasure seekers .
The Japanese used Fort Santiago as their final redoubt against American forces and the fort was correspondingly damaged .
It has been rebuilt as a park , with its own resident theater company .
At its heart is the Rizal Shrine , which contains very crypto-Catholic relics of the hero - one of his vertebrae , the first draft of his novel Noli Me Tangere or Touch Me Not ( 1887 ) and the original of his death poem .

The aim is to prevent new sex offences from being committed Sex offenders will be made to take lie detector tests as part of probation conditions when they are freed from prison , the Ministry of Justice says .
A three - year pilot project in East and West Midlands will aim to establish whether polygraph testing should be introduced across England and Wales .
About 25 sex offenders will initially take part , starting on Wednesday .
The idea was first piloted in 2003 with voluntary testing of offenders , which prompted admissions in 80 % of cases .
In that pilot 90 % of probation officers said the testing of offenders was helpful in assessing the risks they pose to the public .
Between 350 and 450 offenders are expected to be tested over the three - year period of the latest pilot scheme .
Those who refuse risk being sent back to prison .
I 'm hoping that this will be an incentive for paedophiles to disclose more information
Claude Knights , Kidscape
Sex offenders will be chosen by their probation officer , who will consult other professionals , to decide whether a polygraph condition should be included in the offender 's licence .
Professor Don Grubin , who will carry out the tests , said the aim of this and other measures was to prevent new sex offences from being committed .
" Disclosures made during polygraph examinations , as well as conclusions drawn from passed or failed examinations , allow probation officers and the police to intervene to reduce risk , " he said .
" Just as important , it is also aimed at enhancing the co-operation of offenders with supervision , helping them to focus on , and avoid , the sorts of behaviours that make re-offending more likely . "
Public confidence Claude Knights , director of the children 's charity Kidscape , said she believed the tests could help to assess risk .
" I 'm hoping that this will be an incentive for paedophiles to disclose more information , which would help us to manage their release more effectively . "
Justice Minister David Hanson said the use of thorough systems to ensure a " high level vigilance " of serious sexual and violent offenders after their release from prison was vital for protecting communities .
The long - expected move had been a commitment of the government , he said , and he was " proud to say that this can now legally happen from Wednesday " .
Each polygraph session will take between 90 minutes and two hours and will consist of three phases .
In a pre-test interview the subject will be told the questions they are to be asked so they can make any relevant disclosures beforehand .
They will then be attached to the polygraph machine and asked the questions .
Thirdly the polygraph operator will interpret the responses and , in a final interview , the subject will be told the results of the test and asked to explain any failures .
Pam Hibbert , assistant director of policy at children 's charity Barnardos , said the tests would " increase public confidence " that sex offenders were complying with supervision , staying away from schools and playgrounds and living and sleeping where they are supposed to .
" It is important however that this is used as part of a package of measures including greater use of satellite tracking . "
She said that would be more " false comfort of Sarah 's Law " , which in four pilot areas allows parents to ask police if anyone with access to children has convictions for child sex offences .

On Saturday 15 April 1989 , eight of us set off from Nottingham for Sheffield under a beautiful blue sky .
Liverpool were playing Nottingham Forest in an FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough , and our two cars - one carrying four Forest fans , one four Liverpool fans - made short work of the motorway .
We had made a loose arrangement to meet up after the game ( no mobiles back then ) , but when our driver parked the car a mile or so from Hillsborough , we realised we 'd come in at the west end of the ground , behind the Leppings Lane stand - the Liverpool end .
I 'd been a Liverpool fan since I was six years old .
I went to my first cup final at 16 , and had my first season ticket on the Kop before I 'd left school .
But in 1988 - 89 , aged 19 and in my gap year , I could n't afford one .
Two weeks before the semi-final , the phone went .
My brother , a Forest season ticket holder , had a spare .
" It 's for the Forest end , mate , " he said .
" Come and educate yourself . "
Now , as we approached the stadium on Leppings Lane , we split up - I 'd only met the other three lads for the first time that day - and I set off for the Forest end .
The residential streets around the stadium were barricaded at each end , so I approached two policemen and asked how to get round the ground .
" You do n't , " they said .
I moved on to the next street , where a senior officer , wearing a flat hat , was talking to a constable .
I asked again .
" You a Liverpool fan ?
You 're not going up the Forest end .
Forget it . "
They turned away .
I hid any trace of my colours and gave it one last try .
Fifty yards on stood another senior officer .
He stopped me before I got within five yards of him .
" I 've just seen you , " he said .
" You 've already spoken to four of my men and I know what they 've told you . "
He pointed at the entrance to the Leppings Lane stand .
" Now get to that turnstile right on the end .
The fella there is letting in fans with Forest tickets . "
Strangely , I turned to walk away .
That fella was n't going to let me in with a Forest ticket .
But I had n't walked a few steps before the policeman shouted at me .
I 'll never forget his words : " This is your last chance , " he said .
It was n't an offer .
Two minutes later , I was through the turnstile .
As I made my way towards the tunnel that led to the terrace behind the goal , I did n't dare look back .
I could n't believe my luck .
It was 2.15 pm when I walked into pen 3 on the Leppings Lane and took up a spot just to the right of Bruce Grobbelaar 's goal , about 10ft from the perimeter fence .
I had travelled to matches alone since I was 15 , and today , as always , I made for the liveliest spot , right among the choir and the comedians .
For 10 minutes I stood in the sun , taking in the sight of a big old stadium slowly filling up on FA Cup semi-final day , leaning idly on one of the crash barriers that stood like staples on the terraces to limit a crowd surge .
By 2.30 pm it was getting strangely uncomfortable .
Looking around , I could see that fans older and clearly more seasoned than me were getting edgy .
I shrugged two people off my back and pushed my way under the crush barrier , so that it was now behind me , and not on my chest .
Ten minutes later , it would have been too late .
By then , 20 minutes before kick - off , the crowd around me was wheezing and sweating and settling slowly , grudgingly , like cement .
I had been in tight crowds before , but this was different .
A silence was falling over the people around me .
Some were hyperventilating , others were fainting .
I was starting to panic now , but I was stuck .
The pressure was tightening like a vice .
My eyes began searching for police , or stewards , but no one was coming .
Slowly , my legs , my backside , my arms and finally my chest went numb .
One ear was folded in against my cheekbone by the head of a man to my right .
I could move my head , my eyes and my mouth , and no more .
My right foot seemed to move involuntarily , until I realised it was n't on the ground but planted on the calf of a man in front of me .
I had never felt anything like this before : not on the Kop , not at Wembley .
And it was about to get worse .
Behind me , Peter Carney , a 30 - year - old fan from Liverpool , was one of hundreds of people now being swept into the packed central pens from the concourse .
" We were walking through the tunnel at about 10 to three when , whoosh , this surge came and I was off my feet , " he remembers .
" I actually entered the stadium with my back to the pitch . "
Just as Peter thought he would be OK , a crush barrier went down .
" I knew there was a gap in the crowd , which was odd - it was like : ' What the fuck 's that ? '
The people pressed against the barrier had fallen as it buckled , the people leaning on their backs fell on them , and a third row went down , too .
There was a stack of bodies . "
That crush barrier was a few feet to my right , but I did n't see it .
Because the light was slowly closing around my head .
By now I was gasping for breath , and worried that my neck was n't moving freely .
Within feet of me people were standing dead , bolt upright .
Three men had long stopped breathing and were now staring , with a fixed , almost disinterested expression , into the distance .
Their faces were bleached white , but turning blue , their lips a cold violet .
The only comfort I could find was that thousands of people who were still alive were now shouting for help , screaming , " There are people dead in here ! "
There were CCTV cameras trained on us .
And there were police just a few feet in front of the fence who must have realised that metal crush barriers in our pen were bursting out of the ground .
Unbelievably , at 3 pm , the match kicked off .
I remember the roar of the crowd around the ground , and the stillness that followed in pen 3 as people gave up screaming for help to save the air in their lungs .
By this time my lungs were burning and freezing with alternate breaths .
I was paralysed from the neck down .
Rival chants were bouncing the length of the ground , and I thought of my brother , watching from the opposite end of the stadium , where I should have been .
Two police officers were sharing a joke , nervously , on the cinder track , 10 ft away .
No one was coming to help .
Behind me , Peter Carney was about to have a near - death experience .
" Whenever I see a fish come up to the surface , that 's how I must 've been , " he remembers .
" My head was tilted back , gasping for air .
Then I lost consciousness .
The sky became white cloud , the white cloud became a tunnel shape , and I went down this tunnel .
It was like looking down a pipe .
It was never - ending .
Then I 'm looking back at the pens , me in the middle of a perfect circle of people , and heads , and I 'm going down , and I 'm looking at the top of my head . "
Eight feet or so in front of Peter , I was about to have my own moment of reckoning .
I had been crushed on that terrace for over half an hour .
I was exhausted , and stiff with shock .
Incredibly , two people to my left had managed to climb above the crush , and were now crawling on all fours over the shoulders and heads of people around me , to the fence at the front .
Unable to move , too exhausted now to shout , I wondered how they had managed to get out .
And why it had been decided that I would n't .
It was then that I caught the eye of a policeman just the other side of the fence .
It was an unmistakable , meaningful moment : because for four or five seconds , across the heads of scores of people , we looked each other in the eye .
I lost him when I mouthed the words , " Help us . "
He smiled to himself and shook his head at me , and walked on , a little uncertainly .
At that point I thought : " We 've been left to die . "
Many people already had .
People bigger than me , smaller than me , and smarter than me were gone .
Now it was my turn .
Fifty seconds , my brain was telling me : you 've got 50 seconds left .
I do n't know where the figure came from , but there was n't a moment of doubt in my mind : just a calm , orderly voice telling me to hurry up and take in the final minute of my life .
As the seconds ticked down to 45 , 40 , 35 , my lungs began to falter .
I screwed up every ounce of strength left in my body - to lever myself into the air , climb on to someone 's shoulders , escape .
But as I heaved and strained , my body would n't move an inch .
Those pressed tight around me were heavy , some were unconscious ; others were gibbering , trying to black out what was happening .
I counted down to 20 seconds , and then at 15 , or 14 , I gave up .
At 10 seconds , nine , eight , I floated away for a moment , briefly euphoric .
Then I settled into my body , opened my mouth towards the sky and sucked what I could out of it .
And then I closed my eyes .
Five seconds later , they opened .
The sky was still blue .
And the police had finally opened the gate in the fence and were swearing at us .
And I had survived .
The people on the Leppings Lane who did n't survive were daughters , husbands , sisters , sons .
The oldest victim was 67 , the youngest a 10 - year - old boy , the cousin of a then eight - year - old Steven Gerrard .
Many of them died standing up , of traumatic asphyxia .
Others , in their last moments , were borne across the pitch on advertising hoardings , towards ambulances that never came .
Some of the dead had lost their footing in the crush and had been trampled .
Others , unfortunate to be leaning against the crush barriers , were killed by a weight on their chest equivalent to a small car .
In his interim report , Lord Justice Taylor concluded that the main cause of the disaster was overcrowding , and that the main reason was " a failure of police control " .
As the police neglected to manage the build - up of fans on the streets outside the Leppings Lane stand , the senior officer , Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield , ordered a large concertina gate leading into the ground to be opened .
More than 2,000 people moved through the gate and into the Leppings Lane terrace , straight for the two packed central pens behind the goal : no one thought to direct them to the two outer pens , which were lightly populated .
Swept along a narrow tunnel by a growing swell from behind , the fans ploughed into pens 3 and 4 , unaware that their fellow supporters were being ground into the barriers , the fence , and each other .
Lord Justice
Taylor stated of the senior officers on duty that " neither their handling of problems on the day nor their account of it in evidence showed the qualities of leadership to be expected of their rank " .
To this day , no one has ever been successfully prosecuted for the deaths of 96 people at Hillsborough .
Written by Professor Phil Scraton , Hillsborough : The Truth is recognised as the definitive analysis of the disaster , and all that followed .
Commenting on the updated edition , Scraton says : " Twenty years on , many bereaved families and survivors are remarkably resilient .
Yet beneath the surface lies unimaginable grief , compounded by an overwhelming sense of injustice .
Brought together by an avoidable tragedy , they were treated appallingly on the day , then betrayed by a flawed investigation , inadequate inquests and a criminal justice system that protected the authorities .
All police statements were reviewed and , in many cases , altered by a team of senior officers .
Anger is understandably directed towards those responsible , those who made deceitful allegations against fans , and those who perpetuate the myth of hooliganism . "
That the very act of surviving a major tragedy changes people 's lives and personalities is obvious .
But to what extent is not .
Family and friends who knew me then and now will tell me I 'm the same person .
I think they 're right , a few psychological bumps and bruises aside .
After escaping through the gate in that fence , I carried two people across a football pitch to a gym that had become a mortuary .
One was barely alive when , along with six or seven other fans , I picked him up off the grass and laid him on an advertising hoarding .
By the time we had run the length of the left wing , he was dead .
We went back for another : there was a row of bodies by the goal - line .
Help yourself , the police seemed to be saying .
We kicked another board over , but as it lay flat on the ground a policeman walked over and stood on it .
" You ca n't just vandalise the stadium , " he said .
So we picked up this lad by his arms and legs .
As we ran his big , heavy body along , bumping his head on the grass in the vain hope of reviving him , I gazed down at the little ring of blue marks now swelling round his belly , like a baby 's footprints .
We stopped in the corner of the pitch , at a bottleneck by the football club 's gym .
People were waiting for orders , ambulances , oxygen .
There were dozens of fans there , holding the injured and the dead - on boards , by the arms and legs , in their arms .
I stood there looking up for my brother , wondering how he was dealing with this .
As we entered the gymnasium , there were medics going to work on people ; policemen and fans with their heads in their hands , priests administering the last rites .
The man we were holding now was dead when we picked him up , but I found it hard to let go of his hand .
Eventually his body , coated in a gelatinous sweat , slipped from my grasp and on to the shiny floor .
A few bumps and bruises ?
The truth is that I will never know if the person I am today , nearing middle age , was the man I was always likely to be - the result of my genes , my schooling , my childhood friendships - or whether I am the reconstructed remains of that traumatised teenager .
This leaves me something of a mystery to myself - a problem common among survivors .
Peter Carney has never discovered who saved his life in pen 3 .
" Between passing out and being found lying out the back , I can't find any footage or witnesses to confirm what I think went on , " he says .
" This has been part of my struggle for my sanity , to find the people who carried me out . "
It would take a psychologist to unlock parts of my mind that have been numb for 20 years , and some that I have surrendered .
If in a sense I have come from Hillsborough , I am not prepared to go back .
What I have long suspected is that , emotionally , the clock stopped at 19 .
Since holding death at arm 's length I 've held the advancing years there , too .
I was a mature teenager , but I have n't grown up since at the same pace as my friends .
I have n't had kids .
I wo n't let my own youth go just yet .
I will turn 40 next year , but to most people I seem to be around 30 .
It was n't until many years later that I realised I 'd suffered post - traumatic stress disorder .
It lasted for four years .
I cried a lot , and randomly .
I felt cold and angry , and empty .
I 'd never felt like this before .
At times I felt overjoyed to be alive .
The next day , I might wake up feeling half - dead .
I woke up one day on the kitchen floor , after blacking out .
( Get up , make a cup of tea , do n't tell Mum and Dad . )
I drank heavily , but socially , and verbally abused police officers in the street , and I spent two nights cooling off in a police cell , in the early 90s , for my troubles .
( Still have n't told Mum and Dad . )
Then , strangely , one day it was over .
Since then , since my mid-20s , I have never begrudged Hillsborough its place in my life .
If I had lost someone that day then I would feel differently .
But it is such an integral part of my life , and I have to live with who I am .
Perhaps the most important thing Hillsborough taught me is honesty .
There is so much about 15 April 1989 that is wrong , and false , and dishonest , that survivors cling to what they know to be true .
Lord Justice Taylor described the Liverpool fans ' reaction at Hillsborough as " magnificent " .
But to experience something so terrible , to be accused of thieving and pissing on police officers when you were in the process of trying to save lives , or comforting people in their final moments , is an insult so deep in the psyche that honesty becomes the key not just to remembering but to anything that really matters in life .
And it 's honesty that allows me to look other survivors in the eye and know that we did what we could .
Some of this will be news to my friends and my family reading this .
And to my girlfriend , too , who was my girlfriend that day .
But then , there are many secrets to a disaster - not to surviving one , but to living with one .
Today , 20 years on , thousands of people still bear the scars of Hillsborough - some more visibly than I do , others inevitably less so .
So what is it like to lose your son in a disaster watched by millions on television ?
What was it like to be the only ambulance attendant to reach the chaos of the Leppings Lane end ?
What was it like to be one of the players on the pitch ?
Few of the surviving victims of Hillsborough have been heard outside of a courtroom in Sheffield in 1990 .
Below , some of them tell us how that beautiful spring day changed their lives for ever .
The ambulance man : Tony Edwards
The only professional ambulance attendant to reach the Leppings Lane , Tony left the ambulance service in 1995 now lives on the Isle of Bute
We were at the Northern General when we got a 3 - 9 call to an incident .
They told us there was a fatality , but when we got to the ground there were ambulances from everywhere , even Derbyshire .
As we pulled up a policeman came to my window and said : " You ca n't go on the pitch , they 're still fighting . "
A senior ambulance officer came to the door , and it was him who put the horns on .
We said : " The policeman says they 're fighting - we can't go on . "
And he said : " I do n't give a fuck who 's told you you can't go on .
You get on that pitch and you do n't stop until you get to the end . "
As we went along , the police were starting to form a wall across the pitch .
We went through them and then saw people running towards us .
As we got to the goal there was an absolute sea of people .
I 'll never forget the sound ... it was like a large swimming pool ; there was screaming and shouting , it was deafening .
People were banging on the side of the ambulance , shouting " Help ! " and " Over here ! " I did n't have a clue what was going on .
We 'd been told there was one fatality , that was it .
We had these walkie - talkie radios and we tried to see if there was anyone I could report to , but the radios were useless .
I was being pulled in different directions , people were shouting for oxygen , all sorts of demands .
And I thought : " I ca n't help everybody . "
I was looking back up the pitch for other ambulances , but nobody was coming .
There were two girls on the grass , getting CPR .
I decided to take one into the ambulance , but when I got back there were three bodies on board : one on the stretcher , and two piled on top of each other on the floor .
There was a woman got into the vehicle doing mouth - to - mouth on a guy in the bulkhead .
There was a young girl 's body with a guy bent over her trying CPR , but he was blowing vomit into her chest .
I got the girl on the stretcher and then I looked down ... and it was n't the girl I 'd wanted to take .
This is the problem I 've lived with ever since .
I asked again to be put in touch with ambulance control , but the radio was n't working .
I went to get my oxygen mask and bag , but they were gone .
I looked up the pitch again and no one was coming .
And I said to the driver : " We 're gonna have to fuck off here , " and we asked a policeman to close the door .
We were n't doing any good .
You 're used to having one casualty in the back , but there were too many bodies to deal with .
We just did n't do a very good job that day .
We left people on that pitch who were being worked on , and there were no professionals there to help them .
A few years later we attended an accident on the A1M .
There are people alive today because of the treatment we gave them ; we were just so good , as a team .
But we were never given the chance at Hillsborough .
There were 44 ambulances waiting outside the stadium - that means 80 - odd staff could have been inside the ground .
But they were n't allowed in .
There was no fighting !
The survivors were deciding who was the priority , who we should deal with .
The police were n't .
We were n't .
Can you imagine a rail accident where all the ambulances wait on the embankment while the survivors bring the casualties up ?
I took away the wrong people .
I was the only professional ambulance attendant to reach the Leppings Lane , but I was written out of the disaster .
I was given a commendation ( which I ripped up ) , and I represented the South Yorkshire ambulance service at the memorial service , but I was n't called to the Taylor inquiry .
I did n't exist .
You look at the Taylor report - I did n't exist .
When I was interviewed by the West Midlands police I questioned the whole thing : why was I put in that position , you know ?
They did n't want that aired in court .
I know I dealt with it wrong .
I know that .
But I should never have been put in that position .
The Taylor inquiry was told my ambulance never got on to the pitch : it would 've contradicted evidence given in another case .
But I was there , in the police CCTV videos .
All these questions they would have had to ask me are key to the mismanagement of Hillsborough .
If they had asked me , it would have been disastrous for the police and the ambulance services .
Afterwards I blamed myself so much .
I still do .
I still get angry with myself , for not stopping and taking a deep breath , for not changing the course of things .
I could n't deal with it afterwards .
I ran marathons , triathlons .
I took it out on my partner at the time .
I went on holiday to Dallas in 1992 and I came back and I realised I was n't in control .
I split up with my partner .
But who 's to say I would n't have done that anyway ?
In the summer of 1995 we got a call to a suicide in Rotherham .
Nothing unusual in a suicide .
But he had a T - shirt , jeans and trainers on .
That 's what almost everyone was wearing at Hillsborough , in that makeshift mortuary .
I just went to pieces : I was hyperventilating , I could hear the screaming again .
And I left , I went off sick that day , and I never returned to the ambulance service .
By October I was living here , on Bute .
My partner joined me and we 've been here ever since .
I needed to get away , and this felt right straightaway .
It was the turning point .
People here know about Hillsborough , but they are very good - no one talks about it .
I 've had two children since we 've been here , and I have two from my first marriage .
For the first nine years I ran a bicycle repair shop , but I 've been a community recycling project manager since 2004 .
We 're a social enterprise ; we employ people who've had difficulties .
We 've won awards , and people have come up from England to have a look at us .
I 'm very busy , and it's a very positive part of my life .
It 's very therapeutic here .
Everything here is positive .
The ex-wife : Angela Woolfall
Her husband survived , but their marriage broke down as a result of the mental and physical injuries he had suffered
Michael was 32 when he went to Hillsborough .
He was a steward at Anfield and had got into pen 3 at around 2.15 pm .
He leant on a crush barrier to read his programme and before he realised , he found he was trapped .
The crush became so bad he began to pass out .
Two lads in front of the barrier had a bit more room , and they kept slapping his face to keep him conscious .
But the pain was too much , and he could n't breathe .
The next thing he knew he woke up in the Northern General in Sheffield .
The hospital phoned me at 6.30 pm to say they had Michael .
I said : " I had a feeling I was going to hear from you . "
I just knew .
I had been glued to the television , but my daughter , Sam , who was two at the time , kept saying : " I want to watch Thomas the Tank ... Thomas the Tank , Mummy ! " I was going out of my mind .
My brother 's wife drove us over the Pennines .
The thing I remember most was all these half - empty coaches coming back .
Michael had ended up hanging over this barrier .
He severed the nerves in the top of his leg , which has left him partially disabled , and he suffered broken ribs - one of these fans had been hammering on his chest to revive him .
He only found out what had happened three weeks later , when he went to the rearranged match at Old Trafford and bumped into these lads .
One of them said : " Last time we saw you , you were dead ! "
They had been giving him the kiss of life when a policeman came over and said : " You 're wasting your time , lads , leave him there with ... " ( there was a line of bodies , you know ) .
These lads got the fright of their lives when they saw Michael on his crutches , but they were overjoyed because their efforts had n't been in vain .
Nine months later , there was a TV documentary about Hillsborough , and the camera zoomed down the tunnel and on to the terrace .
Michael went into a trance , watching it ; he relived it all , there on the sofa .
He was saying : " I ca n't breathe , I can't breathe , I 'm going to die ! "
And he had stopped breathing .
He was speaking , screaming , clutching his trousers ...
I witnessed what he'd been through , but when he came round he could n't remember .
It was about 18 months later that he learned his injuries were permanent .
Michael had been a scaffolder , but although he gave it a good go he had to call it a day in 1990 .
He hated not being able to work , and I had to work full - time as a legal secretary .
He 's not on crutches any more , but he says it 's like having toothache in the top of his legs .
We were assigned a family counsellor , and that helped , but Michael became a very selfish person .
He began to go out a lot - he was out all the time - and he was drinking more than he had before .
His excuse was that it was the only way he could sleep .
He was frightened to go to sleep , and frightened that he might not wake up .
Everyone loved him ; he was just an outgoing , good bloke .
But he would never speak about the fact that he was left for dead .
When he was having counselling I was sitting there thinking : " I 'm suffering too , you know . "
Because he was shutting me out - there was no way of helping him , and that upset me a lot .
Our second child , Ben , was born in 1991 , which was a lovely surprise , but Michael just could n't snap out of it .
I was thinking : " If Hillsborough had n't happened , I 'd be really pissed off with you . "
But it was like : " What will people think of me if things do n't work out ?
It will be my fault . "
I was burnt out trying to support him , and it became one - way support .
He just wanted to go into his own world .
The eldest knew by the time she was six or seven that Daddy had been through something terrible , and the kids began to dread Saturdays - match days .
I began to sense things were n't going to work out in about 1994 or 95 , but it took me two years to pluck up the courage to end it .
We went to the pub and I said : " This is n't working any more . "
He looked quite relieved , actually .
We split up , and then divorced in 1998 .
He remarried in 1999 or 2000 .
It 's only in the past 18 months I 've started to feel like I 'm my own person again .
Sam is 22 now , and Ben's 17 .
None of us blames Michael for what happened , and we 're all still friends .
The most important thing is that he 's alive .
But I lost my husband at Hillsborough , and that gets overlooked .
I 've found it hard to commit to a new relationship , but when you have kids you have to get on with things , and as a mother they come first .
The Liverpool player : Peter Beardsley
Peter was playing for Liverpool when the game was abandoned .
He is now based in Newcastle , doing PR for Newcastle United and also working in the community
Four minutes into the game I had a shot that hit the crossbar .
Naturally , at the time I was disappointed .
In hindsight , it was good that I did n't score , because people outside the ground heard the roar when I hit the bar and tried even harder to get into the terraces .
They were just excited ; they did n't know what was happening at the front .
If I had scored , the fans would 've been even more excited and more people could have been crushed .
But as soon as I hit the bar I turned round , and from even way up the pitch I could see there was trouble behind the goal .
There were people climbing over the fences .
We did n't have a clue what was going on .
A policeman ran on to the pitch and told the referee to take the teams off .
We sat in the dressing room , waiting .
Graham Kelly , the chief executive of the FA , came in and told us he would get the game back on as soon as possible .
He came in every 15 minutes or so and said that .
We did n't have a clue that people were losing their lives outside .
But the dressing rooms backed on to a car park , and we could hear the sirens .
There were players in that dressing room who had been at Heysel , so they were fearing the worst .
We were still sat in our kit at 4.30 pm .
We did n't know what had happened until we left the dressing room and met our families .
I went to a funeral of one of the victims , in Burnley .
The family were magnificent with me , but I found it really hard .
I 'd only been to one funeral before that , but this one was for a teenage boy .
I can go to funerals now , of young children who I 've met in hospital and who 've died .
And as sad as it is , I can cope with it now .
But I could n't then .
It was terrible .
The likes of John Barnes , Alan Hansen and Kenny Dalglish were better men than I was .
They went to so many funerals .
Kenny and his wife Marina went to over half of the funerals .
They went to three in one day on more than one occasion .
From the moment the disaster began , right to the end , Kenny was unbelievable .
Many of the players feel that the reason Kenny left the club in 1991 was because mentally he'd had enough .
The whole Liverpool ethos changed when he left , in terms of the managers .
It 's taken them a long time to get back in contention for the title .
We had a two - week break from football after the disaster .
We went and visited survivors in hospital , here , there and everywhere .
But I could n't wait to get back on the field and play : it took my mind off things .
Barnesy could n't face it for a while .
We lost the league title decider to Arsenal a few weeks later .
I was n't too bothered , to be honest .
My wife Sandra had gone into labour and I went straight from the match to hospital .
After what had happened at Hillsborough , people had lost children and I was just about to have one .
Our son was born the next morning .
Hillsborough made me realise how lucky I was .
I was a fan myself in the 70s and 80s , watching Newcastle at St James 's Park , and I 'd been in some uncomfortable situations .
It made me realise what the fans had to go through to follow the team .
Meeting some of the families who lost their children that day made me realise that I was born lucky .
No money in the world could buy the memories I have of playing for that team .
I 'm just so relieved I did n't score that day .
The widow : Jenny
Her husband Ian committed suicide two years ago .
He had never been the same since suffering post - traumatic stress disorder following his experience at Hillsborough
I met Ian when I was 14 and he was 15 , and we married five years later .
At the time of Hillsborough , we had two children , both under eight .
Ian was a psychiatric nurse at a high - security hospital and I 'd just started a degree course in criminal justice .
He went to the match with a group of workmates : some had seat tickets , but Ian and his best friend Joe were in the Leppings Lane .
They had been swept into one of the pens behind the goal by the surge .
It was so strong it carried them two - thirds of the way down the pen .
Ian was right in front of Joe and they were squashed together .
He could always feel Joe 's hands on his shoulder , and he kept up a discussion with him , saying : " We 'll get out this way . "
When he got out of the pen Ian was still talking to Joe , and he could swear Joe was talking back .
But at the inquest Ian was told this was impossible , because Joe was dead before Ian even got out of the pen .
He could n't get over the fact that their conversations had n't happened .
Ian got out through a hole in the fence and he assumed Joe was with him .
He was n't .
I did n't hear from Ian until 9 pm , when he called to say Joe was still missing .
They 'd been to the mortuary at the stadium several times , and there were Polaroids of the people they had there .
But Joe 's face was so contorted Ian could n't recognise him in the photo .
It was a logo on his shirt they noticed , then they went to check the body , and it was Joe .
He was very tall , which put him at a disadvantage : his chest had been damaged by the heads of so many people around him .
Ian was diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder just a few weeks after .
He was n't seriously injured , but he was a wreck .
He was a man 's man and he said he did n't need help , so he went straight back to work .
Two weeks later he came home from his night shift , went upstairs and smashed the bathroom up .
He was n't an aggressive person , but he could n't handle the emotions .
Ian agreed to have counselling .
Being a psychiatric nurse did n't help him , because he did n't want to be seen needing the support he was giving other people .
He saw it as some kind of failure .
He was prescribed Prozac , was on it for three months , and it helped .
But he had a lot of nightmares .
I thought he was through the worst , but Hillsborough was like a spectre .
He never went to football after that : our son lost so much bonding time with his dad because he would n't go to the game .
About two or three weeks before Ian died , there was all this stuff about Kelvin MacKenzie being on Newsnight , and Ian got really angry .
I did n't realise just how much it bothered him .
His sleep was being disturbed , but he was also worrying about his business .
He gave up nursing 10 years after Hillsborough and he set up a computer company .
For seven or eight years it went well , then it started going downhill .
Ian died on the Tuesday .
The weekend before , we 'd gone up to the Lake District and had a lovely time ; there was no hint of any anxiety .
He said everything at work would be fine .
On the Monday night he was a bit tetchy , a bit tired .
In the morning I remember him getting up before the alarm and turning it off .
I 'd just rolled over to where he'd been sleeping , and I thought , " Ooh , I 'm glad he 's not coming back to bed , " because where he'd been lying was lovely and warm .
Ian got up and had a shower and put his work clothes on .
He did everything he 'd normally do : he had a cup of tea , went into the garage and fed the rabbit .
At about quarter to eight my daughter came up and asked me something and I said : " Oh , ask your dad , " and she said : " Dad 's gone , " and I said : " He has n't gone this early ; he has n't even said goodbye . "
She said : " He has .
He 's not downstairs . "
So I came down and his van was still on the path .
I called his mobile and it rang in the living room .
We went out into the kitchen and the garage door had the key in , so my daughter ran out to the garage .
And Ian had hanged himself in there .
She started screaming .
My daughter was barely a teenager .
Luckily she did n't see his face .
Ian was on a small ladder ; he was still standing on it .
At first she thought he was standing on it to reach something , so she started to talk to him , but then she noticed that he had something round his neck .
When I went in I saw his face .
Sometimes I feel angry , and I think : " Why did n't you talk to me ?
I could 've helped . "
In the weeks after Ian 's death I felt that if my youngest had n't been there , I 'd have taken an overdose .
Sometimes I think he did n't mean to do it ; it was a cry for help .
Then I just think : " He 'd gone into the garage to feed the rabbit and thought : ' I ca n't go back , I 've had enough , ' and he snapped .
He 'd seen a way out . "
Ian was never the same after Hillsborough .
He was like a coiled spring .
The least thing , he would get worked up .
He was always on edge .
He 's been gone two years now .
We had his funeral in the church we got married in , and it was lovely , really comforting .
But his death has made us all a lot more insecure .
I do have faith , and I have to believe there 's an afterlife .
There 's just nothing that 's worth taking your life for .
Nothing will ever be the same again .
All names have been changed .
Survivors of Bereavement by Suicide ( uk- sobs.org.uk ) ; MerryWidow , for anyone who has lost a partner ( merrywidow.me.uk )
The mother : Anne Williams
Anne , who lives in Chester , has spent 18 years campaigning for a new inquest into the death of her son , Kevin , at Hillsborough
I did n't go out to take the system on .
I just wanted to find out what happened to Kevin .
But the jury at the inquest never heard the true story of how my son died .
He would 've been 16 in May 1989 , and he'd been working really hard for his GCSEs .
He was due to go to the match with his friend Andrew and Andrew 's dad .
But the night before , Kevin told us Andrew 's dad had to work , so he could n't take them .
Steve , Kevin 's stepdad , said : " Well , you ca n't go . "
Kevin went upstairs looking so sad .
Steve said : " Poor little bugger , all he does is study .
Shall we let him go ? "
And I said yes .
We never got a call to say Kevin was missing .
There was a young lad up the road , Stuart , who'd gone to the match , too , and his mum had just heard that Stuart was dead when I called in on her .
She was in floods of tears , but she said : " Do n't worry , Anne , Kevin will be OK . "
I phoned the hospital in Sheffield , and eventually I got through to the mortuary at the ground .
And I said to this guy : " Can you look for a little boy with a horn of life around his neck ? "
He said : " You best stay where you are , the police are coming round . "
I put the phone down and said to my mum : " I know why the police are coming . "
Kevin had been pulled out of the crush in pen 3 , but he died not long afterwards .
When we got to Sheffield we were n't allowed to touch him .
He was behind a pane of glass : " Property of the coroner " .
When the coroner finally released his body I was really excited , it was like : " Kevin 's coming home ! "
He was in his little coffin , but he looked lovely .
He was just Kevin .
At the inquest in March 1991 , the coroner ruled that everyone who'd been killed at Hillsborough had died of traumatic asphyxia , and that they were all dead or brain dead by 3.15 pm .
This ruling was crucial , because it meant there could be no investigation into the actions of the South Yorkshire police after this time .
Questions like why were over 40 ambulances not allowed into the ground , and why did the police not activate the major accident plan until 3.55 pm could n't be examined because everyone was meant to be dead at 3.15 pm .
The jury returned a verdict of accidental death .
But an off - duty policeman at the match , a Mr Bruder , gave a statement that he gave Kevin the kiss of life at 3.37 pm , as he still had a pulse .
There had also been a WPC at the game who said she 'd held Kevin in her arms when he died , and that it was a few minutes before 4 pm .
She gave Kevin heart massage , and his ribs were moving .
He started breathing , and he still had colour .
He opened his eyes and murmured the word " Mum " .
Then he died .
How could Kevin have opened his eyes and called for me if he'd been brain dead for 40 minutes ?
In 1991 Dr Iain West , a leading pathologist ( he 'd worked on the King 's Cross fire , the Brighton bombing and the Clapham rail crash ) , looked into Kevin 's case for me .
The inquest had ruled that Mr Bruder had mistaken Kevin 's pulse for his dead body twitching .
But Dr
West told me that a body simply wo n't twitch from 3.15 to 3.37 , so at that point Mr Bruder must have been dealing with a live body .
From the autopsy report and post - mortem photographs , Dr West concluded that Kevin had n't died of traumatic asphyxia , but of neck injuries , which closed down his airways .
( Dr Carey , the pathologist who worked on the Soham murders , was of the same opinion . )
Kevin , and others who died , could have been saved , he said .
A tracheotomy ( a quick incision into the windpipe ) , or even the insertion of a rubber tube down the throat , would 've reopened Kevin 's airways .
An ambulance attendant would have known how to perform a tracheotomy .
But the police would n't let the ambulances on to the pitch .
In 1997 Jack Straw appointed Lord Justice Stuart - Smith to review whether the Hillsborough inquest should be reopened .
Both Mr Bruder and the WPC told Stuart - Smith that they had come under pressure to change their statements about finding Kevin alive after 3.15 pm , but that they stood by them .
Other witnesses said that statements and CCTV footage of the disaster had been suppressed .
But Stuart - Smith ruled there was insufficient new evidence to reopen the inquiry .
Kevin's case is now being heard in the European Court of Human Rights , under Article 2 , the right to life .
Kevin died in the hands of the state , and it's his right to a thorough investigation into how he died .
We 've also gone under Article 6 , the right to a fair trial .
My solicitor has told me that if they rule in my favour , we 'll get that inquest .
That would open 3.15 pm till 4 pm for everyone .
I 'm really tired of it now .
Sometimes I wake up and think : " No , I do n't want Hillsborough today . "
I grow my flowers in memory of Kevin , marigolds and asters and lobelia .
It 's helped me a lot .
But if Europe does n't rule in my favour , I 'll carry on , because I know that the only answers I can get are in court .

Today , I found out that what my husband meant by " we should try swinging " is " I really want to have sex with this one friend of yours , and if you so much as make eye contact with any guy I 'm going to totally flip out and threaten to kill him and you . "

about the film
Insecurity is an Australian - made independently - funded feature film .
However , as it's not a typical film in any way , we have n't given it a typical official website for a film , either .
What you 'll find here is information about the film , the filmmakers , why we made it , how we made it , and information about where to get the film .
You see , we 're giving Insecurity away for free .
Insecurity is a hacker film , but rather unlike any you 're likely to have seen before .
Almost everyone involved in its creation are , to one degree or another , involved in the IT industry or some other nerd subculture - and we 've done our best to keep as technically accurate as we can .
Wanky blurb from the back of the DVD :
When offered four thousand dollars to break into a computer network , Leon( Peter Love ) and Greg ( Kurtis Wakefield ) are n't concerned with something as petty as morality .
The only real questions are what complications can arise from hacking into a small home business , what 's wrong with the twenty year old daughter Madison ( Zoe Tarling ) ...
... and what should Greg do when his friend can't stop watching the girl on her own webcam - and without her knowledge .

An aside :
So my girlfriends and I decided to stream this film one evening on a whim .
We get together once a month to watch little known , or esoteric films .
Sometimes we luck out and watch a fantastic little known film , other times , as you would expect , the film is a total dud .
Recently I bought a new dog bed for His Dogness , Spitzer , a Yorkshire Terrier and his every faithful companion that I inherited when my parents died , Samuel , a large greyhound .
The contrast between the two dogs is hilarious .
Likewise the size of their beds .
I bought two round dog beds from an online site called Goodnight Dog .
The beds look like pillows partly because they are covered in beautiful designer fabrics .
Samuel 's bed looks like a large floor pillow .
Spitzer 's bed looks line a large throw pillow that has ended up on the floor .
When friends came over the night we watched Insecurity , one friend sat down on Samuel 's dog bed pillow and commented about how comfortable my new floor pillow was and another picked up Spitzer 's dog bed and tossed it on the sofa assuming that is where it belonged .
Both dogs had been in the kitchen eating food .
When they came back to the living room to settle in , both were surprised not to find their dog beds .
One being occupied by a human and the other on the sofa where neither dog are allowed to go .
Samuel , being the old , chilled dog that he is did n't mind and curled up next to the human that was occupying his bed .
Spitzer on the other hand was much disturbed , frustrated because he could n't get to his dog bed .
Samuel took in the scene , got up , went to the sofa and picked up Spitzer 's bed and carried over to his own occupied pillow and dropped it down , reclining once again on the floor .
Spitzer immediately scampered over and settled down on his dog bed .
My friends were quiet for a moment and then some one said : " What was that all about ? "
I found it hilarious , but was able to explain what had just happened between my laughter .
As far as our opinion regarding Insecurity ....
We mostly agreed with the IMBd reviewers general comments , but none of us would agree with the assessment that it was one of the best independent films we had seen .

And when you involve technical elements to the degree we have , it 'll be inevitable .
Not quite as many as certain other films that have featured ' hacking ' , but we 're still only too aware of them .
So - we want you to pick them out !
So far , by my count , there are three goofs I 've located .
However , I 'm going to wait until people mail me about them before I list them here .
Feel free to let us know about continuity goofs , too - but technical goofs are our big goal here .
Insecurity is a full - length independent feature - film released for free under a creative commons 3.0 license .
When offered four thousand dollars to break into a computer network , Leon( Peter Love ) and Greg ( Kurtis Wakefield ) are n't concerned with something as petty as morality .
The only real questions are what complications can arise from hacking into a small home business , what 's wrong with the twenty year old daughter Madison ( Zoe Tarling ) ...
... and what should Greg do when his friend can't stop watching the girl on her own webcam - and without her knowledge .

The Actors
Kurtis Wakefield playing Greg .
Kurtis is an actor who started on the stage in Perth but quickly moved into independent filmmaking .
This is his third feature film as an actor , amidst many more credits in shorts .

Peter Love playing Leon .
Peter is a young actor currently starring in the Australian TV show Pete Boone : Private Eye , screened on Aurora .
Ben Sand playing Kevin .
Ben is a career nerd ( which is a Good Thing ) , having spent time repairing computers , performing system builds & installs , and occasionally dabbles in various forms of scripting on his Linux servers .
What 's this got to do with acting ?
Nothing !
Although some of his pro-Open Source rants did inspire some lines of dialogue given to his character in the film .
Zoe Tarling playing Madison Black .
Zoe is a talented musician / actress currently working toward a career in the business - end of the Australian alternative music industry .
Her music can be heard over the end credits , and also on the soundtrack cd .
The Principle Crew
Rohan Harris , writer / director / editor / producer .
Rohan has been working on independent , zero - budget projects for two years now , starting with various shorts and culminating most recently with this project .
He works as a contract software developer to support his film - making , and believes that literally nothing can't be accomplished with the judicious application of Python , PostgreSQL and the tiniest bit of C ++.
He also prefers either RPM - based distros , or OS X for anything visual .
Jay Mitra , cinematographer / stills photographer .
Jay has been an avid stills photographer for some years , and has recently begun working with Rohan as his cinematographer .
When not pointing cameras at things , Jay engages in a daily battle against Exchange servers , and enjoys sneaking Linux servers into work when nobody 's looking .
David W. Murdoch , executive producer .
David has written , produced , directed and edited his own work for years - he has shot shorts on everything from 8 mm up to HD .
Peter Beamish , sound recordist / production assistant .
Words can't express the gratitude everyone on this project has for Pete 's work .
However , they can describe some of the hardships , which included : a very cold , uncomfortable place to sit with the sound equipment for hours at a time and working ( like the rest of us ) on almost no sleep at all for four straight days .
Sean Walsh , musician .
Sean 's incredible music makes up almost every single track in Insecurity .
From fast - paced alternative tracks to remixes like the opening title music Pitt St to the haunting Create the Future played over Madison 's webcam footage , we can't stress enough just how important his brilliant work was on this project .
In addition to these people , we also need to think the others who put their time and energy into all stages of this production .
These are :
Laurel Oades , for designing the web site you 're now viewing
Jen Greiss , sound recordist and beret connoisseur
Louise Bennett , co-producer and a being of the utmost resolve
Grant Barrie , for putting up with so much in the same frequency bands as the six trillion crickets that inhabit Sydney , Australia .
Terry Lelliott , for his astute eye

Great movie !
******** 12 April 2010 | by gaudstuff
I enjoyed this movie .
Would have preferred it to be a little more technical , but I expect some viewers would have preferred less technical .
I liked the opening dialog , it kind of set the stage for the moral questions .
The music throughout the film could have been toned down a little , at times it was hard to hear the actors .
A little more information about the job could have been provided , I felt it was a little hard to follow exactly what they were doing the job for other than money .
This is one of the best independent films I 've seen !

The man who died during last week 's G20 protests was " assaulted " by riot police shortly before he suffered a heart attack , according to witness statements received by the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
Investigators are examining a series of corroborative accounts that allege Ian Tomlinson , 47 , was a victim of police violence in the moments before he collapsed near the Bank of England in the City of London last Wednesday evening .
Three witnesses have told the Observer that Mr Tomlinson was attacked violently as he made his way home from work at a nearby newsagents .
One claims he was struck on the head with a baton .
Photographer Anna Branthwaite said : " I can remember seeing Ian Tomlinson .
He was rushed from behind by a riot officer with a helmet and shield two or three minutes before he collapsed . "
Branthwaite , an experienced press photographer , has made a statement to the IPCC .
Another independent statement supports allegations of police violence .
Amiri Howe , 24 , recalled seeing Mr Tomlinson being hit " near the head " with a police baton .
Howe took one of a sequence of photographs that show a clearly dazed Mr Tomlinson being helped by a bystander .
A female protester , who does not want to be named but has given her testimony to the IPCC , said she saw a man she later recognised as Tomlinson being pushed aggressively from behind by officers .
" I saw a man violently propelled forward , as though he'd been flung by the arm , and fall forward on his head .
" He hit the top front area of his head on the pavement .
I noticed his fall particularly because it struck me as a horrifically forceful push by a policeman and an especially hard fall ; it made me wince . "
Mr Tomlinson , a married man who lived alone in a bail hostel , was not taking part in the protests .
Initially , his death was attributed by a police post mortem to natural causes .
A City of London police statement said : " [ He ] suffered a sudden heart attack while on his way home from work . "
But this version of events was challenged after witnesses recognised the dead man from photographs that were published on Friday .
An IPCC statement was due to be released the same day and is understood to have portrayed the death as a tragic accident .
However , the statement 's release was postponed as the complaints body received information that police officers may have been more involved in events than previously thought .
An IPCC spokesman said yesterday that in light of new statements it was " assessing " the information it had received before deciding whether to launch a full investigation .
Part of the commission 's inquiries will involve the examination of CCTV footage from the area .
Liberal Democrat MP
David Howarth said : " Eventually there will have to be a full inquest with a jury .
It is a possibility this death was at police hands . "
A police source told the Observer that Mr Tomlinson appears to have become caught between police lines and protesters , with officers chasing back demonstrators during skirmishes .
He was seen stumbling before he collapsed and died on Cornhill Street , opposite St Michael 's Alley , around 7.25 pm .
At around 7.10 pm , protesters had gathered outside the police cordon to call for those contained inside - some for hours - to be let out .
Officers with batons and shields attempted to clear them from the road .
Around 7.20 pm , five riot police , and a line of officers with dogs , emerged from Royal Exchange Square , a pedestrian side street .
Three images taken around this time show Mr Tomlinson on the pavement , in front of five riot police , and in apparent distress .
He had one arm in the air , and appeared to be in discussion with the officers .
Mr Tomlinson then appears to have been lifted to his feet by a bystander .
Minutes later he fell to the ground .
" We saw this guy staggering around , " said Natalie Langford , 21 , a student .
" He looked disorientated .
About five seconds later he fell , and I grabbed my friends to help him . "
Police have claimed that when paramedics tried to move Mr Tomlinson away for urgent treatment , bottles were thrown at them by protesters .
He was later pronounced dead at hospital .
Branthwaite added : " He [ Mr Tomlinson ] was not a mouthy kid or causing problems , but the police seemed to have lost control and were trying to push protesters back .
The police had started to filter people into a side street off Cornhill .
There were a few stragglers who were just walking through between the police and protesters .
Mr Tomlinson was one of those . "
The police tactics during the G20 protests were condemned in the aftermath of the demonstrations .
The clearance of a climate camp along Bishopsgate by riot police with batons and dogs after nightfall on Wednesday came in for particular criticism .
Protesters marched to Bethnal Green police station in east London yesterday to demand a public inquiry into Mr Tomlinson 's death .
Ex -AIG chief says problems ' not his fault '
Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday April 2 , 2009
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP ) -
The former head of disgraced insurance giant AIG , Maurice " Hank " Greenberg , " said in an interview published Thursday he did not " feel any responsibility at all " for the company 's problems .
Greenberg , 83 , was set to testify Thursday before a Congressional committee , his first public appearance under oath since the government 's first bailout of the firm in September .
At the hearing , he plans to propose reducing the government 's stake in AIG and pressuring trading partners to invest back into the company , the Wall Street Journal said on its website .
" Somebody should lean on them , " Greenberg told the Journal , referring to trading partners who received massive payments thanks to a government rescue that has so far exceeded 170 billion dollars .
AIG has been vilified by politicians and analysts after it was revealed it was still paying bonuses worth around 165 million dollars despite huge cash injections by Washington to keep it from collapsing .
The company has since said it will return about 50 million dollars of the bonuses .
Greenberg helped turn the firm into the world 's biggest insurer before he was forced out in 2005 .
During his 38 - year tenure as CEO , he pushed for expanding the company , helping create the troubled financial products unit widely blamed for AIG 's downfall .
He also many of the executives still working at the company , the newspaper noted .
" I do n't feel any responsibility at all " for AIG 's problems , Greenberg said .
" How can I be responsible for something that occurred when I 'm not there ? "
In his prepared testimony , Greenberg said that reducing the federal government 's stake in the company from its current level of about 80 percent to 15 percent would attract private investors .
" Shrinking the government 's ownership could be politically unpalatable , given public frustration with government bailouts of financial firms , " the newspaper noted .
According to the Journal , Greenberg was expected to urge pressuring AIG 's trading partners -- including big US and foreign banks -- to invest some of the money they received from the bailout back into the company .
The Hill newspaper said Congressman Darrell Issa , the ranking Republican on the committee , sent a letter to committee chairman Edolphus Towns questioning Greenberg 's credibility as a witness because he is involved in nine lawsuits and a securities fraud investigation .
" I hope you will reconsider allowing Mr Greenberg to testify before the Committee or at the very least , join me in publicly acknowledging the veracity of his testimony is questionable , " Issa wrote .
Greenberg 's lawyer Lee Wolosky responded to Issa in a statement , saying that a " few civil allegations are still being investigated by regulators " but that they " have nothing to do with AIG 's current situation . "
The former AIG executive , who now leads another insurer , C.V. Starr & Company , acknowledged he had been impacted by AIG 's decline , although he minimized his losses .
" Of course , I lost considerable net worth , " he told the Journal .
" But I 'm working .
My life is not materially changed . "

One provision makes it illegal for a woman to resist her husband ’s sexual advances .
A second provision requires a husband ’s permission for a woman to work outside the home or go to school .
And a third makes it illegal for a woman to refuse to “ make herself up ” or “ dress up ” if that is what her husband wants .
The passage of the law has amounted to something of a historical irony .
Afghan Shiites , who make up close to 20 percent of the population , suffered horrendously under the Taliban , who regarded them as apostates .
Since 2001 , the Shiites , particularly the Hazara minority , have been enjoying a renaissance .
Image Some women in Kabul chanted in support of a new family law for the Shiite minority that permits marital rape , among other things , and applies other restrictions .

President Karzai , who relies on vast support from the United States and other Western governments to stay in power , has come under intense international criticism for signing the bill into law .
Many people here suspect that he did so to gain the favor of the Shiite clergy ; Mr. Karzai is up for re-election this year .
Previous Afghan governments , during the Soviet era and before the arrival of the Taliban , did not impose such restrictive laws , although in practice many rural women ’s freedoms have long been curtailed .
Rights advocates say the law for Shiites could influence a proposal for Sunnis and a draft law on violence against women .
Responding to the outcry , Mr. Karzai has begun looking for a way to remove the most controversial parts of the law .
In an interview on Wednesday , his spokesman , Homayun Hamidzada , said that the legislation was not yet law because it had not been published in the government ’s official register .
That , Mr. Hamidzada said , means that it can still be changed .
Mr. Karzai has asked his justice minister to look it over .
“ We have no doubt that whatever comes out of this process will be consistent with the rights provided for in the Constitution  equality and the protection of women , ” Mr. Hamidzada said .
The women who protested Wednesday began their demonstration with what appeared to be a deliberately provocative act .
They gathered in front of the School of the Last Prophet , a madrasa run by Ayatollah Asif Mohseni , the country ’s most powerful Shiite cleric .
He and the scholars around him played an important role in drafting the new law .

" I think the markets are really embracing this step by Geithner and Obama , " said Manus Cranny , market analyst at MF Global Spreads in London .
" This really is a precipitous moment for the market . "
But Cranny warned that Geithner needed to do a better job at delivering his plan than he has in the past , to avoid spoiling the rally .
" [ Geithner 's ] last delivery was patchy at best , both in terms of style and substance , " said Cranny .
" He needs to look and sound a lot more confident about what he 's tabling to us . "
Treasury plan :
The U.S. government said late Sunday that it will initially commit up to $ 100 billion to subsidize private investors ' purchase of banks ' so - called toxic assets , which have led to the seizure of the credit markets .
" Over time , by providing a market for these assets that does not now exist , this program will help improve asset values , increase lending capacity by banks , and reduce uncertainty about the scale of losses on bank balance sheets , " Geithner wrote in an op -ed in the Wall Street Journal .
The aim of the public - private partnerships is to buy up at least $ 500 billion of bad assets , and possibly up to $ 1 trillion over time .
Peter Cardillo , chief market economist for Avalon Partners , said that futures are responding positively to the notion that the Obama administration is " being less hostile toward the private sector . "

A man in northern Idaho says he has seen a massive hand of God in his life , and he is willing to share it with the highest bidder .
Paul Grayhek says the " Hand of God " appeared in his backyard in March .
Paul Grayhek , 52 , listed the rock formation he dubbed the " Hand of God Rock Wall " on the online auction Web site eBay .
The highest bid was $ 250 early Sunday , with three days left to go in the auction .
The hand - like formation , approximately 9 feet tall and 4 feet wide , appeared in Grayhek 's backyard after a rockfall during Lent on March 8 , he said .
The Coeur d'Alene resident said he faced tough times after losing his job , and believed the rock was a sign .
" I prayed between licking my wounds and looking for a job , " he said .
" We rarely get rockfalls and this formation is 20 feet from my house .
It 's definitely a symbol of the hand of God in my life . "
However , the winning bidder on eBay should not start clearing out his backyard .
Grayhek is not planning to part with the formation .
The buyer will " basically be buying the rights , complete and exclusive rights " to the rock , including literary and movie rights , according to Grayhek .
Grayhek said he plans to use the money from the sale to pursue an unpaid internship in counseling when he graduates with a master 's degree in social work in two years .
" People think I 'm some holier - than - thou person trying to get rich .
I 'm not , " Grayhek said .
" The purpose is to spread the story of God and eBay is just a vehicle . "

Bread Making Demonstration :
Bread Using a Starter
Ciabatta Ciabatta is typically identified by its shape , which is that of a worn or flattened slipper , and thus the meaning of the word " ciabatta " in Italian .
The bread features a crisp crust surrounding an interior that has a soft texture and an open crumb with a flavor that is slightly sweet / sour .
The bread requires the preparation of a starter , which must be allowed to rise overnight .
The remaining ingredients are then mixed with the starter and allowed to rise for several more hours .
The bread has a high liquid content that makes the dough difficult to manage , but is necessary to achieve the correct results .
Plain ciabatta is as common in Italian supermarkets as white sandwich bread is in the United States .

Former Senator Chuck Hagel , a Republican from Nebraska , has weighed in on his party ’s Rush wars .
Rush Limbaugh is “ the center of gravity ” of the Republican Party , and “ we need a new center of gravity , ” Hagel told me on Tuesday night .
That evening , Hagel was taping an interview with Rachel Maddow for her MSNBC show .
Now cochairman of the Commission on United States Policy Toward Russia , he discussed Russian President Dmitri Medvedev ’s announcement that Russia would begin a “ large - scale rearming ” and the news that Russia might be putting long - range bombers in Cuba and Venezuela .
On the segment , Hagel , who was a foreign policy leader in the Senate , talked about his recent trip to Moscow and called for moving the US - Russia relationship back to a “ smart ” track .
He also criticized former Vice President Dick Cheney for claiming that the Obama administration has placed the nation in danger and noted that Cheney was partly responsible for the “ mess ” the Bush administration left behind .
On the show , Hagel took a shot at new Republican Party chairman Michael Steele .
Asked about Steele ’s threat to support primary challengers against Republican Senators Arlen Specter , Susan Collins , and Olympia Snowe , who each defied GOP leaders and voted for Obama ’s stimulus package , Hagel called it “ a very foolish , foolish move , ” commenting , “ there ’s no room for that kind of silliness . ”
He added , “ People expect serious people to deal with serious issues and to govern seriously .
And when you do n’t do that , you become irrelevant . ”
Maddow did not ask Hagel about Limbaugh .
But prior to the taping , Hagel was not shy about bemoaning Limbaugh ’s drag on his party .
He told me that Limbaugh was the opposite of what the Republican Party needs now .
“ We blew eight years of governing , ” Hagel said , excoriating GOPers for having “ run up ” the national debt .
“ You can only blame Ted Kennedy for so much , ” he remarked .
Hagel ’s comments about Limbaugh were not surprising .
Before he left the Senate last year , after serving two terms , Hagel developed the reputation of an independent Republican .
He flirted with a presidential run in 2008 and then backed off .
Last summer , he practically endorsed Obama , traveling to Iraq with the Democratic candidate , when John McCain ’s campaign was attacking Obama for being soft on defense and accusing him of wanting to lose the war there .
The Rush wars , though , have abated in the past week .
Steele has moved on , after apologizing to Limbaugh for calling his broadcasts “ ugly ” and “ incendiary . ”
Pro-administration groups have throttled back on the anti-Limbaugh ads .
The mini-uproar over Limbaugh ’s offensive reference to Ted Kennedy ’s possible death has subsided .
( The new GOP cat - fight is a three - way dust - up involving Laura Ingraham , Meghan McCain , and Ann Coulter . )
But Limbaugh ’s not fading away , and Republicans will continue to have to figure out their party ’s relationship to the radio provocateur .
And Hagel , for one , does not want his party –he still calls himself a Republican –to be fall prey to Limbaugh ’s gravitational pull .
Here ’s Hagel on The Rachel Maddow Show :

Who are the world 's leading public intellectuals ?
The October 2005 cover of Prospect
Foreign Policy and Britain's Prospect magazine selected their top 100 , and invited readers to vote for their top five .
Here was their selection criteria .
The irony of this " thinkers " list is that it does not bear thinking about too closely .
The problems of definition and judgment that it involves would discourage more rigorous souls .
But some criteria must be spelled out .
What is a public intellectual ?
Someone who has shown distinction in their own field along with the ability to communicate ideas and influence debate outside of it .
Candidates must have been alive , and still active in public life ( though many on this list are past their prime ) .
Such criteria ruled out the likes of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Milton Friedman , who would have been automatic inclusions 20 or so years ago .
This list is about public influence , not intrinsic achievement .
And that is where things get really tricky .
Judging influence is hard enough inside one 's own culture , but when you are peering across cultures and languages , the problem becomes far harder .
Obviously our list of 100 has been influenced by where most of us sit , in the English - speaking West .
We tried to avoid the " box ticking " problem of having x Chinese , y economists and z under - 50s .
But we have also tried to give due weight to the important thinkers in all the main intellectual disciplines and centers of population .
We also tried to ensure that all names on the list are influential in at least a few countries in their region , if not the entire globe .

Eastern days are over - time to blog again !
Today we got something exiting new : The Octopus IP is a " soft robot " , that uses a principle derived from the muscles of an octopus .
It 's made of rubber and strings - and it looks extremely sleek .
The research for the Octopus Project is funded by the 7th FP of the EU .
But , yeah .
It should be also possible to assemble this at home for the freaks !
The final robotic octopus prototype will be capable of locomotion on different substrates , of squeezing into small apertures , of dextrous manipulation by coordinating the eight arms , of anchoring in order to exert forces on external environment ; of controlling a flexible structure with virtually infinite DOFs .
Just look at this !

AUSTRALIA will boycott a United Nations forum on racism in Geneva starting today over fears that the meeting could be used as a platform to air anti-Semitic views .
After weeks of negotiation on the wording of a draft text to be presented at the conference , Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said yesterday Australia had decided " with regret " to pull out of the meeting .
The Obama Administration had announced a few hours earlier that the United States would not be attending the forum — also using the phrase " with regret " .
The lead - up to the meeting has been dogged by claims that some countries will use the summit to criticise Israel 's occupation of Palestinian territories and mount anti-Semitic tirades .
LOS ANGELES  Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has reintroduced the grizzly bear to California .
On a recent business and skiing trip to Aspen , Colo. , the governor popped into an art gallery and became transfixed by a large - scale bronze sculpture of a grizzly bear .
“ Suddenly this picture started running in my mind of this being in front of my office in the Capitol , ” Mr. Schwarzenegger said Wednesday in a telephone interview .
“ I thought of kids sitting on it , and would n’t that be cool ? ”
So he reached into his personal bank account and ponied up for the bear  as well as the shipping costs to Sacramento last month  and there it now sits , outside Mr. Schwarzenegger ’s office , as he dreamed .

“ Everyone is loving it now , ” he said .
“ We have so many kids hanging around , it has become a great attraction . ”

• A daily summary of global reports on security issues .
The Taliban have vowed to launch a new offensive this summer in Afghanistan against the government and the foreign soldiers stationed there .
The news comes as the United States and its allies plan to increase their troop presence to counter the growing Taliban threat .
A wave of suicide attacks and ambushes will start Thursday , according to the Taliban website , al Emerah .
Since America and NATO have resolved to send extra troops to Afghanistan , therefore , the Afghans too in response feel the need to start rapid and strong operations , as part of their struggle , to defend themselves and to free the country …
The targets of these operations will be the military units of the invading forces , diplomatic centers , mobile convoys , high - ranking officials of the puppet administration .
The Guardian reports that the insurgents have the potential to make good on their promise .
A western security official said the statement should be taken seriously as the Taliban have previously lived up to their often bold statements of intent , including their past promises to attack roads and encircle Kabul .
" They said they would launch operations in the north of Afghanistan this year and that 's exactly what they have done , " he said .
" There is no doubt that they can counter - surge if they want to – if they choose to consolidate themselves in Pakistan . "
Fighting has been intense across the country .
The US claims to have killed up to 42 insurgents in various battles on Wednesday .
Meanwhile , nine German soldiers were injured and one killed in a pair of attacks on Wednesday in the north of the country .
Earlier this week a British soldier was killed in an explosion .
The website iCasualties.org , which tracks troop fatalities , reports that 90 foreign soldiers have been killed so far this year , a 67 percent increase from the same period last year .
The US government and independent analysts said Thursday that violence has risen in the past year and the insurgents have consolidated and expanded their operations , according to the Associated Press .
A new State Department study found that the number of insurgent attacks has increased .
In addition , the American Security Project , Washington - based think tank , reported on Wednesday that the Taliban is gaining ground in both Afghanistan and Pakistan .
" Governmental weakness in both states has created opportunities for radical Islamist groups on both sides of the border , " the independent analysts concluded .
" Terrorist attacks are up , but worse , territory controlled by the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban has also increased , " said the American Security Project …
The American Security Project attributes the rise in incidents to the spread of the Taliban , which it said has a " persistent presence " in about 75 percent of the Afghanistan .
In Pakistan , it noted that the government increasingly has ceded authority to militants in tribal areas , even before turning over the Swat Valley to the Taliban earlier this month .
Western nations are pouring more troops into the beleaguered country in hopes of stemming this violent tide .
In addition to the more than 20,000 soldiers that the US has earmarked for Afghanistan , Australia and Britain are also pledging troop increases , The Afghan news website Quqnoos reports :
[ The ] British Prime Minister [ said an ] extra 700 troops will be sent to Afghanistan mainly to help provide security during upcoming elections .
Deployment of the new British contingent will [ raise the number of ] troops to 9,000 stationed in Afghanistan , mostly in Helmand , the stronghold of the Taliban militants .
" For Afghanistan , our strategy is to ensure the country is strong enough as a democracy to withstand and overcome the terrorist threat , " Brown said .
In addition , Australia has pledged to send an additional 450 troops .
The force increases this year will bring the total number of foreign forces in Afghanistan to more than 90,000 .
President Obama is also planning to ask Congress for an additional $ 83 billion in funding for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , CNN reports .
The request is expected to pay for those conflicts for the rest of the 2009 budget year , two Democratic congressional sources said .
The money would bring the running tab for both conflicts to about $ 947 billion , according to figures from the Congressional Research Service .
More than three - quarters of the $ 864 billion appropriated so far has gone to the war in Iraq , the agency estimated .

Here is Background Information for Salvador Dali Alice in Wonderland
This genius of Dali is for “ objectifying the subjective . ”
This makes the real the unreal .
Thus , giving substance to dreams .
Dali was a master academician , and accomplished miniaturist in his teens .
He was a man who handled highlights and shadows in a way that haloed his subjects .
William S. Rubin of the Museum of Modern Art , New York , called this “ apparitional luminosity . ”
Salvador Dali is an artistic law unto himself .
He is uniquely himself as was Lewis Carroll , the creator of Alice in Wonderland .
The meeting and matching of these two talents may well go down as an event in both art and literature of the mid-twentieth century .
In the mind of Dali , as in the mind of Carroll , the stuff of dreams is the true reality .
Everyday life is the shadow - world .
You will see this when you read this version of Alice in Wonderland .
That is with the text in the company of Dali ’s fantastic illustrations .
You too will actually live on the safe side of the Rabbit Hole .
And when you return , the everyday world will never be quite the same again .
Dalí uses a number of surrealist techniques in his interpretation of the story .
Alice is represented by a girl skipping rope .
He first painted this image several decades earlier .
Alice appears in every chapter .
Alice appears as this strange , static , mid-motion figure , in each of the twelve illustrations .

Salvador Dali Alice in Wonderland as Described by Random House
“ Even in your deepest imaginings we doubt that you could conceive of a work more uniquely and breathtaking beautiful .
The Limited Edition of this gigantic work of the imagination is restricted to 2,500 portfolios .
Dali hand - signed each title page individually .
Interest indicates that the demand from art and book collectors the world over will far out - run the supply .
And small wonder .
In addition to Lewis Carroll ’s handsomely printed text , there are 13 works of art .
Opposite the tile page is an original Dali etching .
This etching is in four colors .
And it signed in the plate .
It is printed on Mandeure paper .
Each sheet measures 11/2 x 17 inches .
A miniature Alice also appears on each of the 12 chapter headings .
Each chapter is graced by its extraordinary Dali fantasy .
The fantasy was conceived as twelve original mixed media illustrations .
Here , the great imagination of Dali had utilized new modern techniques to illustrate the word of Lewis Carroll .
Each of these gravure illustrations had been superimposed with an original woodcut remarque . ”

The rap against sociology is that it ’s an incoherent discipline .
There ’s definitely an element of truth in that view , but the case is overstated .
I think the right way to say it is that sociology has a handful of major traditions and none of them has stamped out the others .
What are they ?
I count four major traditions in soc world :
Hard core interactionism / social constructionism : Social reality is defined mainly by how it ’s enacted in specific situations and these vary quite a bit .
Moreover , interactions are n’t necessarily reducible to the broader social order .
The more radical elements of this tradition run into post - modernism – there is no coherent social reality because it ’s created differently in different contexts ( i.e. , no coherent self ) .
You see it also pop up in the strong sociology of knowledge ( construction of ideas may have little to do with “ reality ” ) .
Critical social theory :
The basis of social reality is power .
This can be defined in economic terms ( Marx ) , race ( DuBois ) , or gender ( feminists ) .
Or it can be generically defined ( Bourdieu ) .
Most of social life boils down to struggle over the stuff that gives your power , or resisting the power .
Values , institutions , and relations :
This is the broad trend stemming from Weber and Durkheim .
The basic elements of VI&R are that human communities have values , which are translated into order via rules , organizations , and institutions .
This basic set up motivates everyone from Parsons , to Selznick , to Sumner , to Luhmann , to the world polity crowd .
The flavors may be different , but they ’re all about the push and pull between values and structure .
Resources and Action :
This strand represents what might be called the “ economic view ” on things .
Psychology and values are strongly de-emphasized and you just work on strategic action .
The old version was called “ social exchange . ”
Now we call it rational choice .
But the R&A tent is big enough to catch some other types of sociology .
Organizational ecology – psychology thin and focusing on competition – fits here as well .
So might lightly theoretical stratification research .
This scheme wo n’t catch everything .
For example , demography rarely focuses on institutions and interactions , so it does n’t fit here .
A - theoretical areas of sociology , like network analysis , or applied statistics , do n’t fit either .
But when you think about it , each box in the typology offers an object of study , a vocabulary for studying society , and a set of preferred explanations .
With the latest stable release of rails out the door for about a month , we ’ve had a chance to upgrade the bulk of the applications we maintain to 2.3.2.1 .
The rails 2.3 release notes were a HUGE help during this upgrade .
Thanks to the Mike Gunderloy for compiling that document .
Here are some gotchas , aka issues , aka roadblocks to Strategic Enterprise Adoption that we discovered while upgrading some of them .
Problem : ‘ const_missing ’: uninitialized constant CGI :: Session ( NameError )
Solution : Hoptoad Notifier plugin needs to be updated .
ruby script / plugin install -- force git://github.com/thoughtbot/hoptoad_notifier.git
Problem : You see ' load_missing_constant ' : uninitialized constant ApplicationController ( NameError ) .
Solution :
You need to rename application.rb to application_controller.rb .
Problem : @request.cookies [ " name " ] = CGI :: Cookie.new ( " name " , " value " ) sets the cookie to [ value ] instead of value .
Solution :
You no longer need to set the cookie to a CGI :: Cookie instance .
Just set it to the string directly : @request.cookies [ " name " ] = " value " .
Problem : You see an undefined method ' use_transactional_fixtures= ' for Test :: Unit :: TestCase : Class ( NoMethodError )
Solution :
In your test / test_helper.rb file , you need to rename Test :: Unit :: TestCase to ActiveSupport :: TestCase to set these options .
Problem :
You see `NoMethodError : undefined method ‘ assert_recognizes ’ for
Solution :
Are you testing your routes in a unit test with a class of ActiveSupport : : TestCase ?
The routing assertions are only included in ActionController : : TestCase now , so change the test class to use that instead .
Problem : errors on a #count that goes through a named_scope on a has_many : through .
This used to successfully proxy through and run a successful SQL COUNT query .
Now there ’s all this .
Solution : not sure yet , maybe use the file at the end of that ticket ?
Problem : when you deploy to staging or production , you get an error about an undefined reenable method on Rake : : Task .
Solution :
This method was introduced in rake 0.8.2 , but not actually used by rails prior to the 2.3 release .
You need to update rake to a version newer than 0.8.2 on your servers ( 0.8.4 is latest stable as of now ) .
Problem :
When deploying you get an undefined method ruby_version for Gem : Module error .
Solution : Upgrade rubygems to the latest stable version ( 1.3.1 at the time of this post ) .
If watching 24 ( Mon , 9 pm , Sky1 ) is like being in a relationship - which it is n't , but bear with me - then this is the seven - year - itch period .
For the first few seasons , you could n't get enough of it ; driven by raw desire , you even found its weaknesses charming rather than annoying .
A subplot in which Kim gets chased by a mountain lion ?
You simply chuckled and forgave your beloved for being so silly .
By season four , you were going through a rocky patch .
Those same idiosyncrasies were starting to grate .
Things picked up a bit for season five , but season six was like sharing a home with someone you 've fallen out of love with .
It was clearly in an unhappy rut - setting off nuclear bombs every few minutes and torturing people half to death - while you were yearning for freedom , fantasising about seeing other shows .
Season seven , then , is the make - or - break holiday you 've booked together in a bid to rekindle old passions after a trial separation brought on by the writers ' strike .
And so far you 've managed an uneasy truce .
It seems guarded and keen not to offend ; you 're weighing up the security of staying against the liberty of burying the relationship for good .
Incidentally , I do n't know if you 've had sex on this holiday yet because the metaphor does n't stretch that far , although for the sake of completeness let 's imagine you have , and it was OK - ish .
Anyway , episode one opened with what is hopefully 24's equivalent of a vision of America 's real future , as Jack Bauer and his neocon masters find themselves on trial for human rights abuses conducted by the bloke who played Clarence Boddicker in RoboCop .
In previous series , Jack 's readiness to torture suspects with ordinary household objects started out funny .
How we chuckled when he threatened to shove a towel down a man 's throat until his stomach started to ingest it , then rip it back out , bringing half his digestive system with it .
But the tee - hees ebbed away as real - life stories about waterboarding and the like began to dribble out of the putrid black sponge that was the Bush administration .
To make matters worse , it turned out the show was directly affecting the mindset of military recruits : the US army had to remind fresh cadets that stapling someone 's eyelids to the floor should n't be attempted until you 'd at least asked three or four questions .
Even some of the new cast members seem uneasy with the show 's history .
Former Larry Sanders star Janeane Garofalo , who plays office nerd Janis Gold , told USA Today she was " initially very reticent to do it , because I heard about the rightwing nature of [ the creator 's ] politics and the torture - heavy scripts .
And then I thought , ' I 'm unemployed ! ' "
Well , at least she 's honest .
Anyway , thus far the worst Jack 's done is hold a ballpoint pen under a man 's eye and ready his elbow to make a scooping - out gesture .
By his standards that 's nothing .
He probably does that at children 's parties .
Worryingly , I was inwardly urging him to do it , so I could be appalled and entertained at the same time .
But he 's got other things on his mind , namely the return of Tony Almeida , who 's come back from the dead to play the bad guy .
Or is he the bad guy ?
It 's hard to say , because when Jack shouts " what the hell happened to you ? " at him , he clams up and looks hard instead of answering .
To make him look evil , Tony 's been given a buzz cut and some scars , and looks a bit like an Action Man figurine that 's been standing in a car park for the past four years , braving the elements .
I 'm prepared to bet this is just a bit of role play to keep the relationship fresh .
By episode nine Jack and Tony will doubtless be sidekicks again , spit - roasting the terrorists in a bid to extract confessions , and high - fiving over their shuddering victim 's back .
I 've been wrong before , mind .
But now I 've got to find out .
I 'm hooked again , dammit .
Oh , 24 : in the words of Brokeback Mountain , I wish I knew how to quit you
WASHINGTON  The Senate handed a victory to the banking industry on Thursday , defeating a Democratic proposal that would have given homeowners in financial trouble greater flexibility to renegotiate the terms of their mortgages .
The House of Representatives , meanwhile , overwhelmingly approved a bill backed by the Obama administration that would limit the ability of credit card companies to charge high fees and penalties .
The bill , approved 357 to 70 , still faces obstacles in the Senate , where  as the action on Thursday illustrated  the industry has more clout , particularly among Republicans and moderate Democrats .
In recent days the White House , partly in response to polls showing the significant public outrage over high fees charged by credit card companies , has begun to work for its passage .
The mortgage provision garnered only 45 votes in the Senate , falling well short of the 60 votes necessary to break a threatened filibuster to a measure sponsored by Senator Richard Durbin , Democrat of Illinois , that would give bankruptcy judges greater flexibility to modify mortgages .
In recent weeks , major banks and bank trade associations worked closely with Senate Republicans to stop the measure .
Twelve Democrats joined all the Republicans in voting against it .
The defeat clears the way for a final vote as early as Friday for the legislation , which has several features that the banking industry has sought .
One provision would have the effect of reducing a proposed special premium the banks would owe the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation later that year by more than 50 percent  a $ 7.7 billion saving .
A second provision would make permanent the temporary increase in deposits guaranteed by the F.D.I.C. , to $ 250,000 , from $ 100,000 .

The Supreme Court tomorrow will tackle a question that pits First Amendment freedom of speech rights against congressional efforts to limit the influence of special interests that have millions of dollars to spend on speech .
Capital Eye will cover Tuesday ’s oral argument , but for now , here ’s a synopsis of the case :
The Case : Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission
At Issue : Whether a feature - length movie critical of Hillary Clinton as a presidential candidate , and ads promoting the movie , should have been considered “ electioneering communications ” and , therefore , subject to campaign finance laws .
Companies , unions and nonprofit issue advocacy organizations are prohibited from spending money directly from their treasuries on advertising supporting or opposing a candidate 30 days before a primary and 60 days before a general election .
The Supreme Court is now charged with the task of determining where full - length movies fit into the campaign finance scheme during an election .
History : A three - judge panel of the Federal District Court already sided with the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) and determined that “ Hillary : The Movie ” and its advertisements by conservative advocacy group Citizens United should have included certain disclosures and was rightfully prohibited in the 30 days before the presidential primaries .
These rules come from the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 ( BCRA ) , which prohibits the use of corporate funds to finance “ public communications ” that advocate for or against a candidate for federal office , including ads via broadcast , cable and satellite .
In 2003 , the Supreme Court upheld this provision of BCRA in McConnell v. FEC , but two judges new to the court since then , Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito , could shake things up .
Citizens United :
The nonprofit corporation argues that attaching required spoken and written disclosures on ads for the movie would have been unconstitutionally burdensome .
The group also says it should have been allowed to spend $ 1.2 million to make the movie available via cable video - on - demand services in the days before the primaries , saying that “ video - on - demand ” is different from the prohibited means of broadcast in the law .
According to the group ’s lawyer , Theodore Olson , the movie was a journalistic endeavor and a long - form documentary film and , therefore , not a political communication .
It has even gained support from a group of editors and reporters , the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press .
Olson will argue that BCRA is unconstitutional as applied to the film and that the use of corporate funds for political speech should be permitted .
Citizens United ’s PAC raised $ 3.7 million in the 2008 election cycle and spent $ 3.1 million of that .
The FEC : The FEC , joined by BCRA co-sponsors Sens. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) and Russ Feingold ( D - Wis. ) and former Reps.
Chris Shays ( R - Conn . ) and Marty Meehan ( D - Mass. ) , want the Supreme Court to uphold the Federal District Court ’s ruling , saying that the 90 - minute film by the anti-Clinton group was clearly a political appeal meant to hurt Clinton ’s chance of winning the primaries .
Films–and their advertisements –that set out to support or defeat a candidate should be subject to BCRA limitations and disclosure rules , the FEC argues .
The government brief also states that a video - on - demand show is nothing more than a political “ infomercial , ” which would be banned by BCRA .

Vid American robo- profs have developed control software which will allow the droid ground - troops of tomorrow to be controlled by their fleshy comrades using standard military hand signals .
You know in the movies , where the soldiers are creeping about on patrol and they raise a hand to halt the column or get it moving again ?
Now you can do that with war robots .
Boffins at Brown University , who developed the new person - following ' ware , demo the concept in this vid :
Thus far , the robotrooper tech can recognise such standard hand / arm signals as " follow , " " halt , " " wait " and - of course - " door breach " .
It would seem only a matter of time until more advanced concepts like " root out cowering meatsacks " or " terminate the first born male child in every family " can be conveyed .
The boffins at Brown see their technology as being generally applicable to all robotics , perhaps one day delivering the long - awaited robot butler and so stealing a march on the rival brain - chipped monkey industry .
The military flavour comes from the fact that the research was funded in part by military agencies including the Office of Naval Research and our old friends at DARPA - where they probably already open doors by having small robotic tanks drive through them , just for fun .
The robot in the vid is merely a puny PackBot for now , fitted with a CSEM Swiss Ranger depth - imaging camera ( " picture the head on the robot in the film Wall - E " ) .
The PackBot comes from famed auto-vacuum company iRobot , which also offers a much arse - kickinger model - the quadbike - sized Warrior X700 .
The Warrior has been sold to the US Army , and has on occasion been fitted with a " Metal Storm " four - barrelled grenade launcher able to ripple off 16 40 mm warheads in a trice .
The company which makes the Metal Storm grenade - gasm gun has already tried it out with trendy thermobaric " bunker buster " rounds , able to collapse buildings or cavern roofs .
The US military is known to be working on 40 mm cartridges able to blow open inches - thick doors locked with deadbolts which " should completely remove the door , or at a minimum break off half of the door " .
The only hope for opposing fleshies would seem to be that the circuitry - frying electropulse grenade - apparently already in service - gains wider circulation . ®
Mr Sarkozy 's views on the novel are hardly new .
As far back as 2006 , before he became president , he made a comment that left no doubt that his school memories of it were not happy ones .

The public beta of Twitter OAuth support has been released and I ’m excited to introduce a new library that I ’ve been working on called TwitterAuth .
TwitterAuth is a Rails plugin that provides a full external authentication stack for Rails applications utilizing Twitter .
Think of it as “ Twitter Connect ” for Rails , letting you create an application that may be logged into using only Twitter credentials .
TwitterAuth supports both OAuth and HTTP Basic ( though OAuth is certainly the recommended strategy ) giving you maximum flexibility for building the application .
Without further ado , let ’s get into the installation and usage of TwitterAuth !
Installation
TwitterAuth is available as a GemPlugin , so the preferred way to install it is simply to add it as a dependency in your config / environment.rb :
config.gem ' twitter -auth ' , : lib => ' twitter_auth ' 1 config .
gem ' twitter - auth ' , : lib =& gt ; ' twitter_auth '
You can also choose to install it as a traditional Rails plugin :
script / plugin install git://github.com/mbleigh/twitter-auth.git 1 script / plugin install git : //github.com/mbleigh/twitter-auth.git
Once you ’ve installed it , you ’re ready to create a new application using TwitterAuth !
The Low - Down
TwitterAuth uses Rails 2.3
Engine support to completely encapsulate the login process within itself .
All you need to do is run a generator to make all of the support files necessary in your application .
Run it with the -- basic option if you want to use HTTP Basic , otherwise it will default to OAuth .
script / generate twitter_auth 1 script / generate twitter_auth
This generates a User class , a migration , and twitter_auth.yml .
You will need to edit twitter_auth.yml to match the settings of your application , such as providing the OAuth client token and secret .
Once you ’ve migrated , that ’s it !
You are up and running with Twitter authentication ; just point users at / login to start the process ( login and registration are handled in a single step ) .
For more detailed usage information including how to access the Twitter API through TwitterAuth , take a look at the README file .
The source for TwitterAuth is available on GitHub .
I have also created a Lighthouse Project for the reporting of any bugs you may come across .
There is also a basic homepage that will be listing who ’s using TwitterAuth .
If you ’re pretty familiar with Rails authentication systems ( particularly Restful Authentication ) , this is probably all you need to know to get started .
Go forth and make awesome apps !
If not , I ’ve written a quick run-through of the whole process to make it easy for anyone to get started with Twitter apps .
A Quick Run-Through
I think the best way to show what TwitterAuth is capable of is just to show how quickly you can build a simple Twitter application with it .
To that end , let ’s build a simple way to look at your friends ’ timeline in an old - school text - based way ( note , this is a totally useless application but works well for a quick demo ) .
First we need to generate the app :
rails texty - twitter 1 rails texty - twitter
Next we want to install TwitterAuth on the application , so we ’ll add this to our config / environment.rb :
config.gem ' twitter -auth ' , : lib => ' twitter_auth ' 1 config .
gem ' twitter - auth ' , : lib =& gt ; ' twitter_auth '
Once we have hooked TwitterAuth into the application , we will want to run the generator to build the support files we need :
script / generate twitter_auth -- oauth 1 script / generate twitter_auth -- oauth
Before I start on application logic I always lay out a basic HTML layout .
Here it is for this application ( in app/ views / layouts/master.html.erb ) :
< html > < head > < style type='text/css '> ul.tweets { list - style : none ; margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; } ul.tweets li { font - family : monospace ; font - size : 14 px ; padding : 4px 8 px ; } ul.tweets li a { color : # fa0 ; font - weight : bold ; text - decoration : none ; } </style > </ head > < body > <%= yield %> </ body > </html > 1 & lt ; html & gt ; & lt ; head & gt ; & lt ; style type = ' text / css ' & gt ; ul .
tweets { list - style : none ; margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; } ul .
tweets li { font - family : monospace ; font - size : 14px ; padding : 4px 8px ; } ul .
tweets li a { color : # fa0 ; font - weight : bold ; text - decoration : none ; } </style > </ head > < body > <%= yield %> </ body > </html >
The next step is to edit config / twitter_auth.yml to reflect our OAuth client key and secret ( to register your application log in to Twitter and visit http://twitter.com/oauth_clients).
Other than the client key and secret , the defaults are fine for our purposes .
We ’ve now set up a basic TwitterAuth application ; that ’s really all there is to it .
So now let ’s make it a working Twitter application .
First let ’s generate a controller :
script / generate controller timeline 1 script / generate controller timeline
This will just be a one - action controller that will render out the main timeline for the logged in user in an text - based manner .
Here ’s the contents of the controller :
class TimelineController < ApplicationController # this requires us to log in through Twitter before accessing any actions here before_filter :login_required def index @tweets = current_user.twitter.get ('/ statuses/friends_timeline ') end end 1 class TimelineController & lt ; ApplicationController # this requires us to log in through Twitter before accessing any actions here before_filter :login_required def index @tweets = current_user.twitter.get ('/ statuses/friends_timeline ' ) end end
In this action , current_user is the logged in user , and the twitter method provides a simple wrapper around the Twitter REST API that will automatically parse JSON API requests into Ruby hashes for you to use in your application .
So current_user.twitter.get ( '/ statuses /friends_timeline ' ) will grab the latest statuses from your friends ’ timeline ( the main timeline you see when you ’re logged in to Twitter ) as an array of hashes .
Now let ’s display the tweets by creating app / views / timeline/index.html.erb :
< ul class= ' tweets ' > < % for tweet in @tweets %> < li ><%= link_to tweet [ ' user ' ] [' screen_name ' ] + ':' , ' http://twitter.com/' + tweet [ ' user ' ] [ ' screen_name ' ] , : target => ' _blank ' %> < %= tweet [ ' text ' ]
%></li > <% end %> </ul > 1 & lt ; ul class = ' tweets ' & gt ; & lt ; % for tweet in @ tweets % & gt ; & lt ; li & gt ; & lt ; %= link_to tweet [ ' user ' ] [ ' screen_name ' ] + ':' , ' http://twitter.com/' + tweet [ ' user ' ] [ ' screen_name ' ] , : target =& gt ; ' _blank ' % & gt ; & lt ; %= tweet [ ' text ' ] % & gt ; & lt ; / li & gt ; & lt ; % end % & gt ; & lt ; / ul & gt ;
This simply goes through each of the tweets we pulled down and adds a list item with a link to the author of the tweet and the content of the tweet .
The structure of the hashes are identical to their description in the Return Elements section of the Twitter API wiki .
Finally , we need to add some routing to tie everything together .
Make the config / routes.rb look like this :
ActionController :: Routing ::Routes.draw do |map| map.root : controller => ' stream ' , :action => ' index ' end 1 ActionController :: Routing :: Routes .
draw do | map | map .
root : controller =& gt ; ' stream ' , : action =& gt ; ' index ' end
And we ’re done !
Fire up your server with script / server and go to http://localhost:3000/ .
If everything is working properly , it should redirect you to Twitter with a screen like this :
Once you click through and hit allow , it should then take you back and display your tweet stream in an old - school text interface , something like this :
It ’s a simple and useless application , but in about 10 - 15 minutes you ’ve created a fully - functioning Rails application that accesses the Twitter API and stores user information .

ITS promises are alluring , yet elusive ; everyone , from politician to pundit , calls for more .
In its recent report on financial reform , the Group of Thirty , a body of financial experts , mentioned it more than 30 times .
Transparency is in vogue .
Yet few ask whether it actually works .
Not long ago the cheerleaders of opacity were the loudest .
Without privacy , they argued , financial entrepreneurs would be unable to capture the full value of their trading strategies and other ingenious intellectual property .
Forcing them to disclose information would impair their incentive to uncover and correct market inefficiencies , to the detriment of all .
And for years the so - called shadow banking system thrived , away from prying eyes .
Then crisis hit , lending weight to the quip “ What you see is what you get ; what you do n't see gets you . ”
Few saw it coming , but if a lack of transparency was pervasive , how could they have ?
As clear as mortgage - backed securities
“ Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants , ” wrote Louis Brandeis , later a Supreme Court justice , in 1913 , and almost a century later his words have become a maxim .
Yet transparency is amorphous ; it can , frustratingly , be anything but transparent and , implemented wrongly , may harm the very interests it is supposed to serve .
In financial markets , the word is nearly always equated with information disclosure .
The trouble is that the information is often incomplete , irrelevant or outright incomprehensible .
Subprime - mortgage - backed securities are a case in point .
These instruments — whose value remains shrouded in mystery — can have prospectuses of about 500 - 600 pages , most of which are devoted to intricate legalese .
Yet , inexplicably , they do not contain the information about individual loans that is needed to detect default risk .
Nor is transparency free .
The Sarbanes - Oxley act , which partly restored confidence after the scandals of Enron , WorldCom and others , came at a cost — not only in terms of the burden of compliance it imposed on companies .
In order to shield small firms , those with a stockmarket value of less than $ 75 m were initially exempted .
This created a peculiar incentive : at least one study suggests that firms just below the threshold began disbursing unusual amounts of cash to shareholders and making fewer investments .
The act has also been accused of stifling risk - taking and increasing directors ' pay .
At its onset , the turmoil in financial markets was described as a liquidity crisis .
And transparency and liquidity are close relatives .
One enemy of liquidity is “ asymmetric information ” .
To illustrate this , look at a variation of the “ Market for Lemons ” identified by George Akerlof , a Nobel - prize - winning economist , in 1970 .
Suppose that a wine connoisseur and Joe Sixpack are haggling over the price of the 1998 Château Pétrus , which Joe recently inherited from his rich uncle .
If Joe and the connoisseur only know that it is a red wine , they may strike a deal .
They are equally uninformed .
If vintage , region and grape are disclosed , Joe , fearing he will be taken for a ride , may refuse to sell .
In financial markets , similarly , there are sophisticated and unsophisticated investors , and unless they have symmetrical information , liquidity can dry up .
Unfortunately transparency may reduce liquidity .
Symmetry , not the amount of information , matters .
The good news is that transparency can work .
When information is relevant , standardised and public , it fosters intelligent decision - making .
Lenders , for instance , are required to quote interest rates as annual percentage rates , making loans easy to compare .
Some behavioural economists call this “ simplified transparency ” , and think similar requirements should be imposed on complex financial products .
Information must also be accurate as the credit - rating debacle shows : an AAA rating is harmful rather than helpful if it describes a CCC asset .
But politics impedes the ideal of transparency for at least two reasons .
First , the benefits of transparency are widely dispersed among information users , whereas the costs are borne by few information disclosers ; the disclosers therefore dominate the political process .
Second , disclosure requirements are often drawn up after crises .
They therefore tend to be hurried and haphazard , and support for them fades with memory of the hard times .
And even well - designed disclosure requirements may not suffice .
People may make ill - informed choices , simplified transparency or not .
In a recent study , two groups ( made up of Harvard University staff ) were asked to pick mutual funds .
One group was given prospectuses which neatly summarised the funds ' objectives , risk profiles , costs and past performance in a few pages .
The other group received the standard long - winded and hard - to - understand prospectuses .
They nonetheless made nearly identical choices , opting for funds with good past performance and largely neglecting fees .
Academic research suggests that people should do precisely the opposite .
Still , for all its difficulties , transparency is usually better than the alternative .
The opaque innovations of the recent past , rather than eliminating market inefficiencies , unintentionally created systemic risks .
The important point is that financial markets are not created equal : they may require different levels of disclosure .
Liquidity in the stockmarket , for example , thrives on differences of opinion about the value of a firm ; information fuels the debate .
The money markets rely more on trust than transparency because transactions are so quick that there is little time to assess information .
The problem with hedge funds is that a lack of information hinders outsiders ' ability to measure their contribution to systemic risk .
A possible solution would be to impose delayed disclosure , which would allow the funds to profit from their strategies , provide data for experts to sift through , and allay fears about the legality of their activities .
Transparency , like sunlight , needs to be looked at carefully .
In Permaculture landscape design , zones describe an energy efficient master pattern for your site based on conserving the energy of its components people , machines , wastes and fuels .
Along with sector analysis , which is consideration of energies flowing through your site from outside , resource efficient design is achieved .
Such purposeful efficiency is essential to self sufficiency and sustainable living .
An appropriate placement pattern locates your components in efficient energetic relationship within prescribed zones with respect to frequency of use , access and time .
The more frequent the visits , the closer the component needs to be to your site ’s main activity centre .
The number of visits will depend on how often the component needs your attention , in addition to how often you need to visit it to access its yields .
Consider the hen house :
How many times would you visit it in a year ?
With daily egg collection and feeding , weekly watering , monthly manure collection , and occasional culling , annual visits could easily exceed 450 .
By contrast , a fodder hedge might only be attended eight times a year to cut and throw over the fence for dry season livestock feed .
So where should each sit within your site plan ?
The concept of Permaculture zones suggests sensible placement for all elements in your system .
While adaptation to your actual site is never quite so neat in reality , Permaculture zones can be thought of as a series of concentric circles radiating out from the site ’s activity centre .
Zone Zero : The Home
Frequent daily visits –
The innermost circle , or Zone 0 , represents the focal point of activity in the system .
In a small farm this is usually the home .
It is the “ hottest ” area of human activity , symbolized in our diagram by the color red !
If we are going to achieve energy efficiencies it makes sense to place those elements of our system that must be visited the most often within Zone 0 : the house , attached glasshouse or shadehouse , as well as house integrated living components such as pergola - trained vines , potted plants and companion animals .
Zone One : The Home Garden
Regular daily visits – Within 6 meters ( 20 feet ) or so of the house , in Zone 1 , should be placed those elements that require close observation , frequent visiting , high work input or continual complex techniques .
The aim of Zone 1 is to yield household self - sufficiency and climate control for the home .
Zone 1 is also the first Zone that should be developed on your site :
Start at the back door and work out from there !
Once you have Zone 1 fenced and under control you will be providing much of your needs , as well as having established a pleasant living environment for yourself and your family .
And so , elements such as rainwater tanks , the lemon tree , other dwarf or espalier - grown multi - graft fruit trees , chicken laying boxes , small ponds , culinary herbs , worm farm for recycling of household wastes , intensive , fully mulched vegetable beds of quick growing annuals , seedling raising areas , and small , quiet domestic animals like fish , rabbits and pigeons can be kept very close at hand within the home garden .
Zone Two : The Home Orchard
Attended every few days – Zone 2 is a little less intensively managed .
Suitable elements to place here are spot mulched home orchards , longer cycle vegetables , main crop beds ( for trading ) , and forage ranges for closely managed livestock such as poultry and milking goats or cows .
Since they are visited daily for milking , feeding and supervising , the livestock and poultry shelters of Zone 2 often adjoin Zone 1 .
This Zone may be extended along frequently used paths through more outlying zones .
Zone Three : The Farm
Attended weekly to monthly – Broader scale commercial crops , and animals raised for trade , along with natural trees , dams , windbreaks and barns belong .
This area is managed with soil conditioning , green manure crops and manure from Zone 2 .
Zone Four : Managed Forest
Attended infrequently – Hardy , self - care forests and woodlots that are visited infrequently for wood collection , log harvest and wild harvest belong in far flung corners of the property , and can act as buffers to protect Zone 5 wilderness areas .
It may also be used occasionally to pasture animals .
Zone Five : Wilderness
Visited occasionally for recreation and appreciation – This is the component of the site left for nature .
It comprises natural forest and native remnant and rehabilitated flora and fauna and can be linked to the home garden by a wildlife corridor extension .
The Zone concept can be applied equally well for the planning of neighborhoods , farming communities , schools and institutions ; in fact , any human system .
Permaculture landscape design for sustainable living achieves resource and energy efficiency through such zone analysis to conserve internal energies , combined with a optimization of external energies using Sector Analysis .
The S&P 500 certainly has n’t made anyone rich over the last year :
Most people see this and think “ an investment one year ago would have lost 45 % of its value ” .
Others think “ great , now stocks are all cheaper ! ”
In reality , most ordinary people invest portions of their paychecks , either through their 401 ( k ) or a personal account .
This means they ’re doing time averaging .
Sure , investments when the market was up are n’t doing well .
But investments when the market was down are doing just fine .
This is all kind of wishy - washy , though .
Let ’s try to quantify it .
Suppose a market drop and recovery looks like a parabola :
The prices here are parabolas
for various values of a. a=0 means the market is flat .
a =0.5 means the market loses 50 % of its value .
If you invest dt dollars in this market at each point in time , you can work out a nasty integral and show that the number of shares you have at time t is :
and hence the value of your shares at the end is :
Here ’s what that looks like :
The x -axis is a , the fraction by which the market drops .
The y - axis is your total return on investment .
If the market drops by 50 % ( a=0.5 ) then your total return on investment is around 55 % .
With time - averaging , the more the market drops , the better you do .
This makes a lot of sense if you think about it .
Say the market drops 99.9 % and then recovers .
The shares you bought when it was at its bottom earned you a return of 1000 x .
Investing at the bottom is important !
You should keep investing , even as the market drops .
If you do n’t , you ’ll miss that bottom .

Four years after New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin tried to endear himself to black voters by playing to their fears that they were about to be “ overrun by Mexican workers , ” things have and have n’t changed .
Mexican and other Latin American migrants who came to rebuild in the wake of Hurricane Katrina did n’t overwhelm the city .
But , at roughly 15 % of the population -- up from 3 % pre-Katrina -- they are n’t going away either , and New Orleans is grappling with their presence as part of a larger post - disaster demographic shift .
On the street , you hear stories about black criminals robbing Latino day laborers , who are not - so - affectionately referred to as “ walking ATMs . ”
There also seems to be plenty of lingering resentment over the widespread use of migrant labor to rebuild the city .
But there are signs of connection as well , evidence of New Orleans ’ pride in its history as the most flavorful of New World melting pots .
Some see in them the possibility of a city going back to the future .
Advertisement
New Orleans has a decidedly Hispanic ( and French and Caribbean and African ) pre-Louisiana Purchase past , and both black and Latino activists I met suggested that this history is a useful template for this city ’s increasingly mixed future .
“ We did n’t just discover Latin America , ” says Dillard University Professor Mtangulizi Sanyika .
“ The golden age of New Orleans is a historical resource for this community . ”
Although the French were the first and clearly the dominant colonial culture here , France , Spain and ultimately the U.S. all forced their peculiar laws and customs on the city .
Starting in the 1760s , New Orleans prospered under Spanish rule , trading with Cuba , Santo Domingo , the Yucatan and the Mexican Gulf Coast .
Most significantly , however , the Spanish installed a brand of slavery that for all its inherent cruelty allowed for greater liberties than the English and French versions .
In Spanish colonies , slaves had the ability to purchase their freedom , which had an enormous impact on the development of black culture and race relations .
In his book , “ The World That Made New Orleans , ” writer Ned Sublette concludes that “ Afro- Louisianians had more freedom during the territory ’s three - plus decades of Spanish rule than they had during the French colonial period , and more than black slaves had or would have anywhere else in the South at any time before emancipation . ”

Both the Spanish and the French also gave New Orleans a nuanced view of the color line ; they employed a three - part racial system .
In addition to the categories of free whites and black slaves , there was a third group -- free people of color , many of whom were of mixed blood .
By 1805 , five years after Spain relinquished control of New Orleans back to France and two years after the fledgling U.S. acquired New Orleans in the Louisiana Purchase , free people of color made up 33.5 % of the African - origin population and 19 % of the city overall .
By contrast , around that time , 98 % of black people in Kentucky and Tennessee southward into Louisiana were slaves .
More than anything else , this official recognition of mixture , of a category between black and white forged modern New Orleans ’ self - conscious embrace of mestizaje ( think gumbo as metaphor ) .
But after taking control of the city , the U.S. began to suppress recognition of mixture by imposing a simple binary black / white racial order .
By the late 19th century , the social status of mixed - race people had been downgraded and the idea of racial purity was on the rise .
Advertisement
Still , the heavy hand of Jim Crow could n’t completely eradicate the city ’s liberating history of mixing .
University of New Orleans historian Michael Mizell - Nelson told me that despite official segregation , a combination of “ malign neglect ” and the city ’s “ tradition of racial and ethnic borrowing ” kept integrated working - class neighborhoods alive into the mid-20th century .
These are the neighborhoods that gave birth to jazz , R&B and early rock ‘ n ’ roll .
And yet , as Katrina revealed , New Orleans became a classically segregated American city .
Today , the most important demographic fact about New Orleans is that it ’s about 30 % less populated , and decidedly whiter , since Katrina .
A powerful signal of that change is the City Council ’s 2007 switch to a white majority for the first time in two decades .
In February , a racially charged struggle between the black mayor and the white majority City Council broke out .
That puts the black - Latino tensions here into perspective as much as it calls into question the coming of a new mestizo golden age here .
On the other hand , who knows .
At the very least , maybe a growing Latino population will distract whites and blacks from fighting with each other .

New results from NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory have made a major advance in explaining how a special class of black holes may shut off the high - speed jets they produce .
These results suggest that these black holes have a mechanism for regulating the rate at which they grow .
Black holes come in many sizes : the supermassive ones , including those in quasars , which weigh in at millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun , and the much smaller stellar - mass black holes which have measured masses in the range of about 7 to 25 times the Sun 's mass .
Some stellar - mass black holes launch powerful jets of particles and radiation , like seen in quasars , and are called " micro-quasars " .
The new study looks at a famous micro-quasar in our own Galaxy , and regions close to its event horizon , or point of no return .
This system , GRS 1915 +105 ( GRS 1915 for short ) , contains a black hole about 14 times the mass of the Sun that is feeding off material from a nearby companion star .
As the material swirls toward the black hole , an accretion disk forms .
This system shows remarkably unpredictable and complicated variability ranging from timescales of seconds to months , including 14 different patterns of variation .
These variations are caused by a poorly understood connection between the disk and the radio jet seen in GRS 1915 .
Chandra , with its spectrograph , has observed GRS 1915 eleven times since its launch in 1999 .
These studies reveal that the jet in GRS 1915 may be periodically choked off when a hot wind , seen in X - rays , is driven off the accretion disk around the black hole .
The wind is believed to shut down the jet by depriving it of matter that would have otherwise fueled it .
Conversely , once the wind dies down , the jet can re-emerge .
" We think the jet and wind around this black hole are in a sort of tug of war , " said Joseph Neilsen , Harvard graduate student and lead author of the paper appearing in the journal Nature .
" Sometimes one is winning and then , for reasons we do n't entirely understand , the other one gets the upper hand . "
The latest Chandra results also show that the wind and the jet carry about the same amount of matter away from the black hole .
This is evidence that the black hole is somehow regulating its accretion rate , which may be related to the toggling between mass expulsion via either a jet or a wind from the accretion disk .
Self - regulation is a common topic when discussing supermassive black holes , but this is the first clear evidence for it in stellar - mass black holes .

" It is exciting that we may be on the track of explaining two mysteries at the same time : how black hole jets can be shut down and also how black holes regulate their growth , " said co-author Julia Lee , assistant professor in the Astronomy department at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
" Maybe black holes can regulate themselves better than the financial markets ! "
Although micro-quasars and quasars differ in mass by factors of millions , they should show a similarity in behavior when their very different physical scales are taken into account .
" If quasars and micro-quasars behave very differently , then we have a big problem to figure out why , because gravity treats them the same , " said Neilsen .
" So , our result is actually very reassuring , because it 's one more link between these different types of black holes . "
The timescale for changes in behavior of a black hole should vary in proportion to the mass .
For example , an hour - long timescale for changes in GRS 1915 would correspond to about 10,000 years for a supermassive black hole that weighs a billion times the mass of the Sun .
" We can not hope to explore at this level of detail in any single supermassive black hole system , " said Lee .
" So , we can learn a tremendous amount about black holes by just studying stellar - mass black holes like this one . "
It is not known what causes the jet to turn on again once the wind dies down , and this remains one of the major unsolved mysteries in astronomy .
" Every major observatory , ground and space , has been used to study this black hole for the past two decades , " said Neilsen .
" Although we still do n't have all the answers , we think our work is a step in the right direction . "
This was work made using Chandra 's High Energy Transmission Gratings Spectrometer .
These results appear in the March 26th issue of Nature .

S.F. summit looks at lesbian health issues SAN FRANCISCO
The first problem surfaced when Dulce Garcia went to a San Francisco clinic two years ago for her annual physical .
As she filled out the intake form , all the questions assumed she was straight .
Then in the examining room , a nurse repeatedly offered her a pregnancy test and birth control .
" She kept telling me Latino women have a high risk of pregnancy , " said Garcia , a health educator who teaches youths about disease prevention .
" I had to out myself right there and then .
The nurse seemed shocked that I was n't heterosexual .
Even here in San Francisco , this kind of thing happens . "
The health concerns of lesbians , from interpersonal difficulties in doctors ' offices to the high prevalence of risk factors for heart disease and many cancers , will be highlighted at a national summit this weekend in San Francisco .
" This conversation is long overdue , " said Dr. Sandra Hernandez , chief executive of the San Francisco Foundation and an assistant clinical professor at UCSF .
" This is the first summit to bring together clinicians , scientists , leaders in their communities to discuss these issues .
" The summit will call for more research into lesbian health , and more funding for research . "
Women 's health has become a focal point of medical study relatively recently .
" For research purposes , women used to be thought of as smaller men , " said Diane Sabin , executive director of the Lesbian Health & Research Center at UCSF .
" We were once outside the research structure , our body chemistry was viewed as too complex to be able to isolate individual variables for a research focus . "
The subset of lesbians has emerged even more recently as a field of medical research , she said .
" One thing we still need to do are more studies on resiliency - to learn why so many lesbians not only function but thrive despite having so many health obstacles . "
For reasons that are not yet well understood , studies show that lesbians weigh more than their heterosexual counterparts , smoke more , drink more , abuse drugs more often , and have more fat around their midsections , putting them at a higher risk of heart disease , said Dr. Katherine O'Hanlan , a Bay Area gynecologic cancer surgeon and healthy policy advocate .
" The health profile of lesbians is significantly more unhealthy , " she said .
" Lesbians have a higher concentration of risk factors for cancer , heart disease and stroke than heterosexual women . "
Research has shown that lesbians undergo fewer mammograms than heterosexual women and perhaps as a consequence , may suffer higher rates of breast cancer , she said .
Additionally , they may have a higher risk for ovarian and uterine carcinomas due to " less frequent use of oral contraceptives , combined with higher rates of obesity and endometriosis , " O'Hanlan wrote in an article published three years ago in Obstetrics & Gynecology .
She said many lesbians fail to get Pap tests , believing they do n't need them , despite having had prior sexual relations with men .
In general , lesbians do n't go to the doctor as much as they should , O'Hanlan said .
" They think they do n't need to if they do n't have aches and pains and they do n't need contraception , " she said .
As a result , though , they may be diagnosed at a later stage in the course of a disease , she said .
Influencing many lesbian health issues is their experience with societal discrimination and a resulting lack of self - esteem , said Dr. Caitlin Ryan , a clinical social worker at San Francisco State University and director of the Family Acceptance Project .
Ryan , who has spent more than 30 years studying lesbian health , published a groundbreaking study in January documenting serious health consequences to lesbian , gay and bisexual adolescents due to family rejection .
The youths were at greater risk for HIV infections , depression , illegal drug use and suicide attempts , the research found .
" Social stress has an enormous impact on their health , " said Ryan .
" Many avoid going to doctors - a significant portion of lesbians have had negative experiences with health providers who did n't want to work with them or provided rough or inappropriate care .
As a result , the women avoid medical care until their health problems become very serious . "
Ford Slashes Debt , Stays Ahead of GM and Chrysler
Ford , the only of the Big Three automakers to so far refuse government bailout money , said this morning that it has slashed the debt in its automotive division , enabling it to save $ 500 million per year in interest expense .
Ford used $ 2.4 billion in cash and 468 million shares of its common stock to buy down $ 9.9 billion in debt , reducing its leverage by 38 percent .
" By substantially reducing our debt , Ford is taking another step toward creating an exciting , viable enterprise , " Ford chief executive Alan Mulally said in a statement .
Ford has so far been spared the wrath of the federal government and the administration 's automotive restructuring team , headed by former investment banker Steve Rattner .
The White House ousted GM chief executive Rick Wagoner last week .
Last Wednesday , Ford reported that March vehicle sales were down 40.9 percent compared with March 2008 , which beat forecasters ' expectation of a 45 percent plunge for Ford .
Ford sales were up 30 percent compared with February of this year .
As recently as first quarter 2008 , Ford was profitable .

This story first appeared on Alternet .
Jonathan Haidt is hardly a road - rage kind of guy , but he does get irritated by self - righteous bumper stickers .
The soft - spoken psychologist is acutely annoyed by certain smug slogans that adorn the cars of fellow liberals : “ Support our troops : Bring them home ” and “ Dissent is the highest form of patriotism . ”
“ No conservative reads those bumper stickers and thinks , ‘ Hmm — so liberals are patriotic ! ' ” he says , in a sarcastic tone of voice that jarringly contrasts with his usual subdued sincerity .
“ We liberals are universalists and humanists ; it ’s not part of our morality to highly value nations .
So to claim dissent is patriotic — or that we ’re supporting the troops , when in fact we ’re opposing the war — is disingenuous .
“ It just pisses people off . ”
The University of Virginia scholar views such slogans as clumsy attempts to insist we all share the same values .
In his view , these catch phrases are not only insincere — they ’re also fundamentally wrong .
Liberals and conservatives , he insists , inhabit different moral universes .
There is some overlap in belief systems , but huge differences in emphasis .
In a creative attempt to move beyond red-state / blue - state clichés , Haidt has created a framework that codifies mankind ’s multiplicity of moralities .
His outline is simultaneously startling and reassuring — startling in its stark depiction of our differences , and reassuring in that it brings welcome clarity to an arena where murkiness of motivation often breeds contention .
He views the demonization that has marred American political debate in recent decades as a massive failure in moral imagination .
We assume everyone ’s ethical compass points in the same direction and label those whose views do n’t align with our sense of right and wrong as either misguided or evil .
In fact , he argues , there are multiple due norths .
“ I think of liberals as colorblind , ” he says in a hushed tone that conveys the quiet intensity of a low - key crusader .
“ We have finely tuned sensors for harm and injustice but are blind to other moral dimensions .
Look at the way the word ‘ wall ’ is used in liberal discourse .
It ’s almost always related to the idea that we have to knock them down .
“ Well , if we knock down all the walls , we ’re sitting out in the rain and cold !
We need some structure . ”
Haidt is best known as the author of The Happiness Hypothesis , a lively look at recent research into the sources of lasting contentment .
But his central focus — and the subject of his next book , scheduled to be published in fall 2010 — is the intersection of psychology and morality .
His research examines the wellsprings of ethical beliefs and why they differ across classes and cultures .
Last September , in a widely circulated Internet essay titled Why People Vote Republican , Haidt chastised Democrats who believe blue - collar workers have been duped into voting against their economic interests .
In fact , he asserted forcefully , traditionalists are driven to the GOP by moral impulses liberals do n’t share ( which is fine ) or understand ( which is not ) .
To some , this dynamic is deeply depressing .
“ The educated moral relativism worldview is fundamentally incompatible with the way 50 percent of America thinks , and stereotypes about out - of - touch elitist coastal Democrats are basically correct , ” sighed the snarky Web site Gawker.com as it summarized his studies .
But others — including many fellow liberal academics — have greeted Haidt ’s ideas as liberating .
“ Jonathan is a thoughtful and somewhat flamboyant theorist , ” says Dan McAdams , a Northwestern University research psychologist and award - winning author .
“ We do n’t have that many of those in academic psychology .
I really appreciate his lively mind . ”
“ Psychology , as a field , has lots and lots of data , but we do n’t have very many good new ideas , ” agrees Dennis Proffitt , chairman of the University of Virginia psychology department .
“ They are rare in our field , but Jon is full of good new ideas . ”
An unapologetic liberal atheist , Haidt has a remarkable ability to describe opposing viewpoints without condescension or distortion .
He forcefully expresses his own political opinions but understands how they are informed by his underlying moral orientation .
In an era where deadlocked debates so often end with a dismissive “ you just do n’t get it , ” he gets it .
Four years ago , he recalls , “ I wanted to help Democrats press the right buttons because the Republicans were out - messaging them .
“ I no longer want to be a part of that effort .
What I want to do now is help both sides understand the other , so that policies can be made based on something more than misguided fear of what the other side is up to . ”
Haidt ’s journey into ethical self - awareness began during his senior year of high school in Westchester County , N.Y .
“ I had an existential crisis straight out of Woody Allen , ” he recalls .
“ If there ’s no God , how can there be a meaning to life ?
And if there ’s no meaning , why should I do my homework ?
So I decided to become a philosophy major and find out the meaning of life . ”
Once he began his studies at Yale , however , he found philosophy “ generally boring , dry and irrelevant . ”
So he gradually gravitated to the field of psychology , ultimately earning his doctorate at the University of Pennsylvania .
There he met several influential teachers , including anthropologist Alan Fiske and Paul Rozin , an expert on the psychology of food and the emotion of disgust .
Fascinated by Rozin ’s research , Haidt wrote his dissertation on moral judgment of disgusting but harmless actions – a study that helped point the way to his later findings .
As part of that early research , Haidt and a colleague , Brazilian psychologist Silvia Koller , posed a series of provocative questions to people in both Brazil and the U.S.
One of the most revealing was :
How would you react if a family ate the body of its pet dog , which had been accidentally run over that morning ?
“ There were differences between nations , but the biggest differences were across social classes within each nation , ” Haidt recalls .
“ Students at a private school in Philadelphia thought it was just as gross , but it was n’t harming anyone ; their attitude was rationalist and harm - based .
But when you moved down in social class or into Brazil , morality is based not on just harm .
It ’s also about loyalty and family and authority and respect and purity .
That was an important early finding . ”
On the strength of that paper , Haidt went to work for Richard Shweder , a cultural anthropologist at the University of Chicago who arranged for his postdoc fellow to spend three months in India .
Haidt refers to his time in Bhubaneshwar — an ancient city full of Hindu temples that retains a traditional form of morality with rigid cast and gender roles — as transformative .
“ I found there is not really a way to say ‘ thank you ’ or ‘ you ’re welcome ’ ( in the local language ) , ” he recalls .
“ There are ways of acknowledging appreciation , but saying ‘ thank you ’ and ‘ you ’re welcome ’ did n’t make any emotional sense to them .
Your stomach does n’t say ‘ thank you ’ to your esophagus for passing the food to it !
What I finally came to understand was to stop acting as if everybody was equal .
Rather , each person had a job to do , and that made the social system run smoothly . ”
Gradually getting past his reflexive Western attitudes , he realized that “ the Confucian / Hindu traditional value structure is very good for maintaining order and continuity and stability , which is very important in the absence of good central governance .
But if the goal is creativity , scientific insight and artistic achievement , these traditional societies pretty well squelch it .
Modern liberalism , with its support for self - expression , is much more effective .
I really saw the yin -yang . ”
After returning to the U.S. , Haidt accepted a position at the University of Virginia , where he continued to challenge the established wisdom in moral psychology .
His colleagues were using data from middle - class American college students to draw sweeping conclusions about human nature .
Proffitt remembers him arguing “ with some passion ” that they needed to widen their scope .
“ Jon recognizes that diversity is not just the politically correct thing to do – it ’s also the intelligent thing to do , ” he says .
“ Seeing things from multiple perspectives gives you a much better view of the whole . ”
In January 2005 — shortly after President Bush won re-election , to the shock and dismay of the left — Haidt was invited by a group of Democrats in Charlottesville , Va. , to give a talk on morality and politics .
There , for the first time , he explained to a group of liberals his conception of the moral world of cultural conservatives .
“ They were very open to what I was saying , ” he says .
“ I discovered there was a real hunger among liberals to figure out what the hell was going on .
Haidt ’s framework of political morality can be traced back to a dispute between two important thinkers :
Shweder , who would go on to become his mentor , and legendary Harvard psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg .
In his 1981 volume The Philosophy of Moral Development , Kohlberg essentially argued that other moral systems are mere stepping - stones on a path that will eventually lead the entire world to embrace Western humanist values .
Reviewing the book for the journal Contemporary Psychology , Shweder politely but effectively tore that notion apart .
Citing his extensive research on traditional Indian culture , Shweder pointed out the inconsistencies and lack of convincing evidence behind Kohlberg ’s arguments .
Agreeing with philosopher Isaiah Berlin , Shweder asserted — and continues to assert — that a range of ethical systems have always coexisted and most likely always will .
In a 1997 paper co-written with three colleagues , he broke down primal moral impulses into a “ big three ” : autonomy , community and divinity .
Haidt found Shweder ’s ideas persuasive but incomplete .
Agreeing with evolutionary theorist James Q. Wilson , he concluded that any full view of the origins of human morality would have to take into account not only culture ( as analyzed by anthropologists ) but also evolution .
He reasoned it was highly unlikely humans would care so much about morality unless moral instincts and emotions had become a part of human nature .
He began to suspect that morality evolved not just to help individuals as they competed and cooperated with other individuals , but also to help groups as they competed and cooperated with other groups .
“ Morality is not just about how we treat each other , as most liberals think , ” he argues .
“ It is also about binding groups together and supporting essential institutions . ”
With all that in mind , Haidt identified five foundational moral impulses .
As succinctly defined by Northwestern University ’s McAdams , they are :
• Harm / care .
It is wrong to hurt people ; it is good to relieve suffering .
• Fairness / reciprocity .
Justice and fairness are good ; people have certain rights that need to be upheld in social interactions .
• In - group loyalty .
People should be true to their group and be wary of threats from the outside .
Allegiance , loyalty and patriotism are virtues ; betrayal is bad .
• Authority / respect .
People should respect social hierarchy ; social order is necessary for human life .
• Purity / sanctity .
The body and certain aspects of life are sacred .
Cleanliness and health , as well as their derivatives of chastity and piety , are all good .
Pollution , contamination and the associated character traits of lust and greed are all bad .
Haidt ’s research reveals that liberals feel strongly about the first two dimensions — preventing harm and ensuring fairness — but often feel little , or even feel negatively , about the other three .
Conservatives , on the other hand , are drawn to loyalty , authority and purity , which liberals tend to think of as backward or outdated .
People on the right acknowledge the importance of harm prevention and fairness but not with quite the same energy or passion as those on the left .
Libertarian essayist Will Wilkinson of the Cato Institute — one of many self - reflective political thinkers who are intrigued by Haidt ’s hypothesis — puts it this way : “ While the five foundations are universal , cultures build upon each to varying degrees .
Imagine five adjustable slides on a stereo equalizer that can be turned up or down to produce different balances of sound .
An equalizer preset like ‘ Show Tunes ’ will turn down the bass and ‘ Hip Hop ’ will turn it up , but neither turns it off .
“ Similarly , societies modulate the dimension of moral emotions differently , creating a distinctive cultural profile of moral feeling , judgment and justification .
If you ’re a sharia devotee ready to stone adulterers and slaughter infidels , you have purity and in - group pushed up to 11 .
PETA members , who vibrate to the pain of other species , have turned in - group way down and harm way up . ”
McAdams was first exposed to these ideas about three years ago , when he heard Haidt speak at a conference .
Around that same time , he was analyzing information he had compiled from interviews with 150 highly religious middle - aged Americans — men and women from across the political spectrum who had described in detail the ways they find meaning in their lives .
Realizing this was an excellent test case for Haidt ’s theories , McAdams started comparing the comments of self - described liberals and conservatives .
Sure enough , “ Conservatives spoke in moving terms about respecting authority and order , ” he found .
“ Liberals invested just as much emotion in describing their commitment to justice and equality .
Liberals feel authority is a minor - league moral issue ; for us , the major leaguers are harm and fairness . ”
It ’s hard to play ball when you ca n’t agree who deserves to be a big leaguer .
Of Haidt ’s five moral realms , the one that causes the most friction between cosmopolitan liberals and traditionalist conservatives is purity / sanctity .
To a 21st - century secular liberal , the concept barely registers .
Haidt notes it was part of the Western vocabulary as recently as the Victorian era but lost its force in the early 20th century when modern rules of proper hygiene were codified .
With the physical properties of contamination understood , the moral symbolism of impurity no longer carried much weight .
But the impulse remains lodged in our psyches , turning up in both obvious and surprising ways .
You can hear strong echoes of it when the pope rails against materialism , insisting we have been put on Earth to serve a loftier purpose than shopping until we drop .
It can also be found in the nondenominational spiritual belief that we all contain within us a piece of the divine .
( Although it ’s sometimes used in a tongue - in - cheek way in our society , the phrase “ my body is a temple ” is reflective of the purity / sanctity impulse . )
“ The question is : Do you see the world as simply matter ? ”
Haidt asks .
“ If so , people can do whatever they want , as long as they do n’t hurt other people .
Or do you see more dimensions to life ?
Do you want to live in a higher , nobler way than simply the pursuit of pleasure ?
That often requires not acting on your impulses , making sacrifices for others .
It implies a reverence — which is a nonrational feeling — towards human life . ”
Consider two letters to the editor in a recent issue of the Ventura ( Calif . ) Breeze .
The weekly newspaper has been chronicling a controversy about a 19th - century cemetery that gradually fell into disrepair and , since the early 1960s , has been used as a dog park .
Some descendents of the people buried there are demanding that it be restored as a proper burial place .
“ Why is there even a debate ? ” wrote one angry resident .
He referred to the park as “ this holy ground ” and admonished city officials : “ Your values and judgment need some serious realignment . ”
But a second reader looked at the controversy from a more practical perspective , noting that public funds are limited in these tough economic times .
Besides , he added , “ the park is full of life now , and I ’m sorry if this sounds harsh , but life is for the living . ”
Both arguments are rooted in firm moral beliefs .
It ’s just that for the first correspondent , purity / sanctity is paramount , while for the second it ’s of minimal importance .
Not surprisingly , Haidt ’s data suggests purity / sanctity is the moral foundation that best predicts an individual ’s attitude toward abortion .
It also helps explain opposition to gay marriage .
“ If you think society is made up of individuals , and each individual has the right to do what he or she wants if they are n’t hurting anybody , it ’s unfathomable why anyone would oppose gay marriage , ” he says .
“ Liberals assume opponents must be homophobic .
“ I know feelings of disgust do play into it .
When you ’re disgusted by something , you tend to come up with reasons why it ’s wrong .
But cultural conservatives , with their strong emphasis on social order , do n’t see marriage primarily as an expression of one individual ’s desire for another .
They see the family as the foundation of society , and they fear that foundation is dissolving . ”
Haidt does n’t want religious fundamentalists dictating public policy to ensure it lines up with their specific moral code .
Even if you perceive purity as a major - league issue , it does n’t have to be on steroids .
But he argues it is important that liberals recognize the strength that impulse retains with cultural conservatives and respect it rather than dismissing it as primitive .
“ I see liberalism and conservatism as opposing principles that work well when in balance , ” he says , noting that authority needs to be both upheld ( as conservatives insist ) and challenged ( as liberals maintain ) .
“ It ’s a basic design principle :
You get better responsiveness if you have two systems pushing against each other .
As individuals , we are very bad at finding the flaws in our own arguments .
We all have a distorted perception of reality . ”
Spend some time reading Haidt , and chances are you ’ll begin to view day - to - day political arguments through a less - polarized lens .
Should the Guantanamo Bay prison be closed ?
Of course , say liberals , whose harm / fairness receptors are acute .
Not so fast , argue conservatives , whose finely attuned sense of in - group loyalty points to a proactive attitude toward outside threats .
Why any given individual grows up to become a conservative or a liberal is unclear .
Haidt , like most contemporary social scientists , points to a combination of genes and environment — not one ’s family of origin so much as the neighborhood and society whose values you absorbed .
( Current research suggests that peers may actually have a stronger impact than parents in this regard . )
In his quest to “ help people overcome morally motivated misunderstandings , ” Haidt has set up a couple of Web sites , www.civilpolitics.org and www.yourmorals.org.
At the latter , you can take a quiz that will locate you on his moral map .
For fun , you can also answer the questions you think the way your political opposite would respond .
Haidt had both liberals and conservatives do just that in the laboratory , and the results are sobering for those on the left : Conservatives understood them a lot better than they understood conservatives .
“ Liberals tend to have a very optimistic view of human nature , ” he says .
“ They tend to be uncomfortable about punishment — of their own children , of criminals , anyone .
I do believe that if liberals ran the whole world , it would fall apart .
But if conservatives ran the whole world , it would be so restrictive and uncreative that it would be rather unpleasant , too . ”
The concept of authority resonates so weakly in liberals that “ it makes it difficult for liberal organizations to function , ” Haidt says .
( Will Rogers was right on target when he proclaimed , “ I do n’t belong to an organized political party .
I ’m a Democrat . ” )
On the other hand , he notes , the Republicans ’ tendency to blindly follow their leader proved disastrous over the past eight years .
“ Look how horribly the GOP had to screw up to alienate many conservatives , ” muses Dallas Morning News columnist and BeliefNet blogger Rod Dreher , an Orthodox Christian , unorthodox conservative and Haidt fan .
“ In the end , the GOP , the conservative movement and the nation would have been better served had we on the right not been so yellow - dog loyal .
But as Haidt shows , it ’s in our nature . ”
Like Wilkinson , Dreher does n’t fit cleanly into the left - right spectrum ; he reports that taking Haidt ’s test ( showing he scored high on certain liberal values but also on some conservative ones ) helped him understand why .
He ’s appreciative of that insight and admiring of the way the psychologist is able to set aside the inherent prejudice we all share in favor of our own moral outlook .
“ It ’s hard for any of us to get outside our own heads and perform acts of empathy with people we do n’t much like , ” he notes .
In higher education , as in so many other fields , the best way to negotiate a pay raise is to get a competing offer .
Not infrequently , an academic will entertain an offer from an institution he or she is n’t really interested in joining , specifically so he can get a salary offer , take it back to his current employer and demand it be matched .
Haidt found himself in just that situation a few years back .
But as he explained to Proffitt , his department chair , he was uncomfortable with the notion of lying to gain leverage .
“ He told me , ‘ I know that if I was offered the position , I could get a big raise here .
But I study ethics !
I ca n’t do that !
That would be wrong !’
He felt he would n’t be playing fair with the people from the other university , who were putting out money and effort to recruit him . ”
“ That game is played by a lot of people , but Jon would not , ” Proffitt says .
“ He elected not to do that on purely ethical grounds .
That decision cost him at least $ 30,000 a year . ”
But was he guided by the harm / care instinct ?
Or fairness / reciprocity ?
Or did the conservative value of in - group loyalty , which tends to lie dormant in liberals such as Haidt , emerge under these unusual circumstances and convince him to be true to his school ?
The most likely answer is “ all of the above . ”
The point is Haidt realized the wrongness of that behavior in his gut and acted on instinct .
In making such decisions , he is setting a rigorous moral example for his son , Max , who turns 3 in July .
Haidt would be pleased if , by the time Max gets to secondary school , the study of ethics is part of the curriculum .
“ If I had my way , moral psychology would be a mandatory part of high - school civics classes , and civics classes would be a mandatory part of all Americans ’ education , ” he says .
“ Understanding there are multiple perspectives on the good society , all of which are morally motivated , would go a long way toward helping us interact in a civil manner . ”
Shweder cheers him on in that crusade .
“ I think this is terribly important , ” he says .
“ People are not going to converge on their judgments of what ’s good or bad , or right and wrong .
Diversity is inherent in our species .
And in a globalized world , we ’re going to be bumping into each other a lot . ”
Whether they ’re addressing the U.S. Congress or U.N. General Assembly , Haidt has astute advice for policy advocates :
Frame your argument to appeal to as many points as possible on the moral spectrum .
He believes President Obama did just that in his inaugural address , which utilized “ a broad array of virtue words , including ‘ courage , ’ ‘ loyalty , ’ ‘ patriotism ’ and ‘ duty , ’ to reach out and reassure conservatives . ”
Haidt notes that the environmental movement was started by liberals , who were presumably driven by the harm / care impulse .
But conservative Evangelical Christians are increasingly taking up the cause , propelled by the urge to respect authority .
“ They ’re driven by the idea that God gave man dominion over the Earth , and keeping the planet healthy is our sacred responsibility , ” he notes .
“ If we simply rape , pillage , destroy and consume , we ’re abusing the power given to us by God .
“ The climate crisis and the economic crisis are interesting , because neither has a human enemy .
These are not crises that turn us against an out - group , so they ’re not really designed to bring us together , but they can be used for that .
I hope and think we are ready , demographically and historically , for a less polarized era . ”
But that will require peeling off some bumper stickers .
Contrary to the assertion adhered onto Volvos , dissent and patriotism are very different impulses .
But Haidt persuasively argues that both are essential to a healthy democracy , and the interplay between them — when kept within respectful bounds — is a source of vitality and strength .
“ Morality , ” he insists , “ is a team sport . ”
Idiots , liars and thieves have torched billions of dollars in this financial crisis .
But it is a safe bet that at least as many billions were lost by smart people trying to do good , honest work on behalf of others -- usually as part of a committee .
Examples are so abundant it is n't hard to trip over them :
Compensation committees on Wall Street ...
Actor Billy Bob Thornton has laid claim to his own Joaquin Phoenix moment .
An ornery Thornton appeared on CBC Radio's Q yesterday morning to promote his band the Boxmasters and was alternately belligerent and bizarre before drawing host Jian Ghomeshi into an argument about the way his appearance on the show had been promoted .
Thornton , the band 's singer , took issue with Ghomeshi 's introduction to the interview , which included references to the star 's career as a Hollywood actor , director and screenwriter .
Through the first half of the conversation , Thornton refused to answer any of Ghomeshi 's questions directly , responding by mumbling " I do n't know what you 're talking about " or some variation of that .
The Oscar - winning star of Sling Blade later said that Ghomeshi had been instructed ahead of time not to talk about his film career at all .
Phoenix , who abandoned acting to pursue a career in rap music , made headlines when he sulked his way through an interview on Late Show With David Letterman earlier this year .
That clip immediately achieved YouTube fame , and Thornton might not be far behind .
His Q appearance has already been posted on American gossip website TMZ , and a CBC spokesperson said the show had received over 1,600 emails and blog responses at the public broadcaster 's website .
Thornton also criticized Canadian audiences during his appearance .
" They just sort of sit there .
And it does n't matter what you say to 'em ....
It 's mashed potatoes but no gravy . "

I wrote an article last Thursday in which I attempted to quantify the Election Contest Court 's Tuesday request for 400 currently rejected absentee ballots .
While my previous analysis was not technically incorrect , it was however a misrepresentation of the current state of affairs ; I entirely neglected to account for the Nauen group of petitioners .
I 'll first present the corrected extrapolation :
Extrapolations : ECC Requests by City [ Nauen ] [ PDF , 128KB ]
Identified Extrapolation Voters Coleman Franken ECC Request 358 150.24 149.86 Coleman Regions 219 106.02 76.30 Franken Regions 139 44.24 73.56 Nauen Petitioners 42 2.10 37.80 Only Orig. 64 6 .30 5.40 Ordered Counted 36 1.80 32.40 Total 400 152.35 187.66
You 'll notice that the new version greatly increases Franken 's projected gain ; up to about 35 from around 1.5 previously .
This vast increase can be directly attributed to the assumption that any voter listed within the Nauen group is inherently more likely to vote for Franken as the Franken campaign is providing the financial support ; Mr. Nauen also appears to be a Democrat based upon his contributions .
The extrapolation uses a 90 - 5 - 5 split , in favor of Franken .
Coleman needs to make up 225 votes , and the numbers simply do not add up ; either in the extrapolation above or the trinomial distribution below :
The very small number above , is the probability of Norm Coleman overcoming the Canvassing Board Certified 225 vote deficit within the 400 ballots requested by the ECC ; the calculation uses the statewide result as certified by the MN State Canvassing Board on January 5th .
The numbers of the current situation are hopefully well understood but let 's take a look at the sequence of events relating to the Nauen Petitioners to better understand the current circumstances .
The pertinent excerpts of the original Nauen petition , as presented on January 13th , is quoted below ; this filling listed each of the 64 voters by name and county within Exhibit A :
CLAIM FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE , Petitioners respectfully pray for an Order of the Court as follows : 1 . Directing that Petitioners ' absentee ballots shall be opened and counted , and the total be declared and certified , for such use as might be deemed appropriate by the United States Senate or the judges responsible for the election contest pending in the District Court for the County of Ramsey , No. 62 - CV -09 - 56 or any other proper use under law , pursuant to procedures established by this Court .
2 . Granting Petitioner 's such other relief as the Court deems just and appropriate .
Dated : January 13 , 2008 ... Exhibit A [ List of 64 Voters by Name and County , CSV ] Source : Petition by Certain MN Voters to have their Votes Counted Pursuant to Mn.Stat.204B.44 via MNCourts.gov
Within the first filling , the 64 petitioners basically asked to have their votes counted .
The ECC would eventually grant 23 of these individuals their request ; a 24th also met the court 's criteria barring the presence of a completed voter registration application .
The February 10th order pertaining to these 23 ( or 24 ) is presented below along with the digitized table containing their names and associated county :
This matter comes before the Court on Petitioners Dennis Peterson , et. al. 's ( '' Petitioners ' ' ) motion for summary judgment .
After consideration of the arguments of counsel , the written submission of the parties , and the pleadings in the case .
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED : 1 . Petitioners ' Motion for Summary Judgment is granted in part and denied in part .
2 . The following absentee ballots shall be provided to the Secretary of State at a date to be determined by the Court to be opened and counted at a date to be determined by the Court , and the total be declared and certified for such use as might be appropriate by the United States Senate , this Court , or any other proper use under law .

I wrote a previous article addressing the above order that may provide additional insight .
The Coleman campaign then moved to vacate the previous order by specifically addressing eight of the just mentioned voters .
The ECC met Coleman about half way and vacated three of the previously granted 24 petitioners .
This order was released on March 2nd , but was never posted to the Litigation Website , but The Ohio State University pulled through :
This matter comes before the Court on " Contestants ' Notice of Motion and Rule 60.02 Motion to Vacate Judgment . "

2 . That Portion of the Court 's February 10th Order granting summary judgment to Petitioners Hannah Gorski , Donna Mortenson and Audrey Verlo is vacated .

The remaining forty or so voters still had the opportunity to provide additional evidence to support their original motion ; nineteen voters then renewed their previous motion on February 20th .
The court would release the following order with respect to this renewed :
The above - entitled matter came on for hearing before the Court on February 27 , 2009 , upon Petitioners ' Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment .

Fourteen of the nineteen petitioners were granted their requested relief as their ballots were ordered to be opened and counted , eventually .
Three of the neglected five voters then tried again by further requesting that the ECC count their vote .
This motion was filled on March 31st and is excerpted below :
This matter comes before the Court on Petitioners ' Second Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment .
After consideration of the arguments of counsel , the written submission of the parties , and the pleadings in the case , IT IS HEREBY ORDERED : 1 . Petitioners ' Second Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment is granted in full .
2 . That portion of the Court 's March 11th Order granting summary judgment to Petitioners Donald and Donelda Applebee is vacated .
3 . The attached Memorandum is incorporated as if fully set forth herein 4 .
Any other relief not fully set forth herein is expressly denied .
Dated : March 31 , 2009 ... II . Petitioners ' Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment is Granted
In their second renewed motion for summary judgment , Petitioners seek summary judgment on claims brought by four voters : Katie Kaszysnki , Roxanna Saad , Kourteney Dropps , and Tempest Moore .
In addition to the evidence presented by Petitioners in support of their motion for summary judgment , the Court in the election contest received evidence as to each of these voters .
As in prior orders , the Court looks at the individualized evidence in support of Petitioners ' claims that their ballots were properly cast and rejected in error in the November 4 , 2008 election .
The Court examines each of the identified Petitioners in tum .

The three petitioners who were the subject of the second renewed motion were granted their relief , but two other , already relieved voters were not so fortunate .
These two voters will not have their ballot examined for potential inclusion ; there was apparently a clerical error that lead to their inclusion in one of the previous orders .
This brings the total number of relieved Nauen petitioners to 35 ( or 36 ) .
I 've provided a recap of the Nauen orders below that accompanies a much more detailed spreadsheet :
Extrapolations : Nauen Petitioners and ECC Ordered Opened & Counted [ PDF , 125KB ]

While the Nauen group accounts for the vast majority of previously relieved voters , their was one other group , brought forth by the Contestee , Al Franken .
The following order by the ECC takes us back to February 23rd addresses twelve voters listed within Franken 's original counterclaim :
The above - entitled matter came on for hearing before the Court on January 23 , 2009 , upon Contestee 's Conditional Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Certain of Contestants ' Claims and on Contestee 's Conditional Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Certain of Contestee 's Counterclaims .

These twelve voters votes will eventually be counted bringing the total number of previously relieved voters 47 ( or 48 ) :
Date Type Party Result Total Votes Feb 23 Order Franken Count 12 47 ( 48 )
Each of the 47 ( or 48 ) are included within the list of 400 requested by the ECC on March 31st .
The 400 are supposed to be provided to the court by Monday , April 6th at noon so the process of opening and counting each ballot can begin tomorrow ( Tuesday ) morning at 9:30 AM CT .
At that point , the counting will begin with respect to Minnesota law ; that is , because a ballot is instructed to be opened , it may not be counted .
Overvoting and undervoting may have occurred , or the voter may have improperly marked their ballot ; a multitude of issues could prevent a physical ballot from being counted above and beyond that which has already been determined by the ECC ; simply that the absentee ballot was legally cast .
The physical counting of these 400 ballots will take place in the same courtroom and may or may not be open to the public , due to privacy concerns ; but in either case we should know the result Tuesday evening .
If the process is public , theuptake.org will probably provide a live stream .
Fox 's Chris Wallace and Brit Hume are certainly trying to paint the stock market collapse as " Obama 's bear market " and put it squarely on his shoulders .
They are making the case that since President Obama brought hope to the country when he was elected , the markets would magically rally around him even though the fundamentals are not there and the money changers in The Street hate Obama 's policies to the bitter core .
When job losses are as staggering as they are coupled with foreclosers going through the roof and earnings statistics coming in from the 4th quarter of last year that do have an incredible impact on the current decline in the market , but to them , it 's all Obama 's fault .
WALLACE : Well , as we 've been discussing , the stock market is officially in bear territory , down exactly 20 % since the Obama inauguration .
Brit , John McCain did n't want to answer the question , but I 'll ask you .
Is this the Obama bear market ?
HUME : It 's kind of a bear market within a bear market .
The market was already down tremendously over the previous year , and I think most people entered this period of the new Obama administration thinking that it probably was bottoming out and that he would give by his very presence and by what he would offer real hope and that it would at least change the psychology a bit .
It has changed the psychology , it seems , for the worse and I think he does bear responsibility for that , and the impression that he has managed to leave is that he 's too busy with massive new spending and a scatter shot stimulus bill which was reckless and breathless new initiatives .
Have you noticed that they never give us a graphic that shows when the " bear market " started ?
Here 's a graph of the DJI :
On May 19th , the market was at 13,028 .
On July 15th the market was at 10,962 .
On Oct 10th , the market was at 8451 .
On Nov 20th , the market was at 7552
The market lost almost half of its value from May until November , but the stock market talking heads would never blame Republicans .
All the bad news is still hitting the fan from the Bush administration , but you would never know Bush had anything to do with it if you watch the news media spin this into Obama 's market failure .
He 's in office now , so he has to do his best to repair the damage , but I wish these Villagers would tell the truth and let his programs start to work through the system .
The media need their talking points , but it 's fraking ridiculous .
I was surprised Wallace did n't ask McCain something like this .
Wallace : " When is Obama gonna cure cancer ? "
That was a campaign promise , was n't it , Mr McCain ?
McCain : I 'll let the experts be the judge of that .

" What information is out there on marijuana ?
And why do I need to know it ?
Why can I not rely on common sense ? " you might ask .
As Galileo once said , where your senses fail , reason must step in .
Likewise , there are many basic facts about marijuana that people seem to think are true based on their own common sense .
However , you might quickly learn that common sense is not exactly the best way to approach marijuana related issues .
Let me give you an example .
All of us have lived to see a cigarette smoker or two ... they die of horrible diseases like lung cancer or heart disease , or they are forced into a life with several taxing surgeries and never are the same .
We see people rushed out of burning buildings with smoke inhalation who then need to be placed on oxygen tanks , or who die .
So we see people inhale marijuana smoke , and we only have cigarette smoke and house fires to compare it to ... and likewise say , " Marijuana is bad for you because smoking ANYTHING is bad for you .
It causes cancer , because smoke always causes cancer ! "
But this just is not the case .
Smoking marijuana is different from the other kinds of smoke .
Marijuana smoke is a bronchodilator , so tar does not get trapped in your lungs like nicotine .
Furthermore , THC has been shown to have anti-carcinogenic properties , making this issue far more complicated .
Let me introduce you to the scientific body of thought behind marijuana , cancer , and other diseases :
Peer Reviewed Studies showing marijuana poses no cancer risk :
http://www.washingtonpost.com/...
The new findings " were against our expectations , " said Donald Tashkin of the University of California at Los Angeles , a pulmonologist who has studied marijuana for 30 years .
" We hypothesized that there would be a positive association between marijuana use and lung cancer , and that the association would be more positive with heavier use , " he said .
" What we found instead was no association at all , and even a suggestion of some protective effect . "
http://www.webmd.com/...
According to Ford , he thought he would find an association between marijuana use and cancer , but " that the association would fall away when we corrected for tobacco use .
That was not the case .
The association was never there . "

And all of a sudden , it becomes apparent that in this case , our senses have failed us .
We must throw aside our anecdotal experiences and become informed in the science behind the issue .
When I was younger , just turned 16 years old , I remember very clearly the day my best friend told me he smoked marijuana .
Of course , up to that point , I had relied on my common senses as well , much like many of you here on Dailykos .
I was taken aback ...
I felt hurt , betrayed .
How could my best friend become a pothead ?
How could he put me in the situation to choose between his friendship and what I so obviously felt I know was morally reprehensible ?
So I launched a deluge at him .
Told him that marijuana kills brain cells , that it caused cancer , that it caused infertility , that he was hurting himself , and how betrayed I felt .
I kept trying to convince him that what he was doing was killing himself .
He was good to me though and stayed calm through my assault on his newly found recreational activity .
He calmly referred me to a series of studies , a page on marijuana myths , and systematically deconstructed my entire worldview on marijuana .
Then I turned my hurt and anger to society and the government , because it had so obviously lied to me .
I stopped trusting anything coming from the government , and I was appalled at how studies against marijuana were so flawed as to be intentionally intellectually dishonest .
This too , I got over with over time , because it was n't the government 's fault that I felt so betrayed , nor was it my friends fault .
The fault lied with me and only me , because I did not know the truth behind the issue .
So then I turned to more research .
I wanted to know WHY marijuana was illegal , and what the government itself said about marijuana .
The more I researched , the more I learned .
I never knew , for instance , that governments across the world , including our own federal and some state governments , have determined that marijuana is not a danger to society :
Official commissions that have determined marijuana poses no great risk to society and should NOT be criminalized :
Canadian Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs . 2002 .
Cannabis : Summary Report : Our Position for a Canadian Public Policy .
“ We believe … that the continued prohibition of cannabis jeopardizes the health and well - being of Canadians much more than does the substance itself or the regulated marketing of the substance .
In addition , we believe that the continued criminalization of cannabis undermines the fundamental values set out in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and confirmed in the history of a country based on diversity and tolerance .

" Following detailed consideration of the different options , the Federal Commission unanimously recommends the elaboration of a model which not only removes the prohibition of consumption and possession , but also makes it possible for cannabis to be purchased lawfully .
New Zealand Parliamentary Health Select Committee .
1998 .
Inquiry into the Mental Health Effects of Cannabis .

We recommend that based on the evidence received , the government review the appropriateness of existing policy on cannabis and its use and reconsider the legal status of cannabis . "
United States National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse .

U.S. Government Printing Office : Washington , DC .
" The Commission recommends only the following changes in federal law : Possession of marihuana for personal use would no longer be an offense .
...
Casual distribution of small amounts of marihuana for no remuneration , or insignificant remuneration not involving profit would no longer be an offense . "
More commissions finding that possession should be legal :
the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse ( the Shafer Report ) ( 1973 ) ;
the Canadian Government 's Commission of Inquiry ( Le Dain Report ) ( 1970 ) ;
The British Advisory Committee on Drug Dependency ( Wooton Report ) ( 1968 ) ;
Still , you say , what about the studies against marijuana out there ?
You want to go looking throughout the internet to find contrary studies ?
I can probably even tell you right now which studies that you will find to support your case , and then exactly why those studies are severely flawed and not respected in the scientific community .
The two most common studies that prohibitionists use are the link between cannabis and lung cancer shown by a New Zealand study that focused on a sample size of only 81 people ( the biggest study that I showed you was a sample size of 20,000 people ) , and of those 81 , 90 % smoked tobacco at the same time .
Tobacco use was not controlled for .
Another study you will find is the testicular cancer risk study .
This study does not control for patients who are smoking marijuana , ironically enough , BECAUSE of their cancer .
Furthermore , the investigators themselves admit that the link is weak and needs much more research , and it should not be used to support the claim of marijuana causes a form of testicular cancer .
Furthermore , the testicular cancer they speak about is a very rare one and is made just slightly more common by smoking marijuana .
Still , the chances of any individual developing this cancer are astronomically low .
Fatty acids , yellow 5 , and high fructose corn syrup have better links to cancer .
Another study you will find are in vitro studies , where claims are made such as " marijuana has carcinogenic properties on such and such cells " or " Marijuana smoke contains more such and such than tobacco smoke . "
The problems with these studies are that the in - vitro studies never seem to hold up in vivo .
Tashkin , the author of the biggest marijuana safety study ever , was once vehemently against marijuana .
Look up Donald Tashkin yourself and find this out .
He changed though when he realized that in - vitro studies ignored the possible carcino - protective effects that THC seems to have , and when his in - vivo research supported this .
Furthermore , in - vitro studies on strictly THC show that it indeed DOES have carcino - protective effects , and it is actually available as a topical ointment for skin cancer .
As for the " contains more tar " studies , this ignores that " tar " is a VERY vague term , not a scientific one , that includes any residues .
The residues of marijuana are easier to remove from the lungs because they are not trapped like they are when nicotine is smoked , which constricts your bronchioles and traps the tar .
But the matter remains , even if marijuana IS dangerous , prohibition makes marijuana more dangerous .
Banned pesticides , glass dust , and illegal fertilizers make it into marijuana just for the higher profit margins , because marijuana is illegal , untaxed , and unregulated .
Furthermore , many argue that legalization of marijuana would increase use , but if you look at the netherlands , they use marijuana at just over 20 % , whereas 40 % of Americans and 56.7 % of Americans age 18 - 28 have smoked marijuana .
800,000 marijuana smokers are arrested each year .
That is millions of people that now have a drug conviction on their record , making them harder to employ , boosting unemployment and decreasing revenue .
Why do we allow smoking marijuana to destroy the professional prospects of millions of Americans , while alcohol use is considered acceptable ?
Doctors are accepted every day into medical school who drink , but those who smoke marijuana are not allowed due to drug tests .
The same applies for jobs all throughout the economy for marijuana smokers .
Furthermore , 500 dollars per arrest is spent , adding up to hundreds of millions of dollars in cost .
It costs 30,000 a year to imprison someone , why not just turn them into the backbone of a new economy and free up prison space ?
Why not encourage cops to go after violent criminals instead of farmers ?
I believe that if we do decide to legalize marijuana , we will see many benefits :
1 - It will instantly provide a multibillion dollar industry to the united states .
The state that legalizes will experience a big boom in their economy in just a few days .
2 - Medical users could then smoke freely instead of taking pain medicines that are damaging to their health .
3 - Non-medical users that smoke will face less liver - toxicity if they take when they have a headache than eating tylenol .
4 - 30,000 dollars a year is spent to keep a prisoner in prison .
More if it is in a federal penetentiary , where several marijuana growers are spending hard time .
Legalizing not only will provide an instant gain in the money that it normally costs to keep these people in prison , but will turn them into taxpaying members of society , or hell , maybe even entrepreneurs .
5 - It will reduce many billions of dollars that we spend fighting corruption in the United States caused by the mexican drug cartels , and the drug cartels themselves .
6 - It will reduce the national security concerns of the above as well .
7 - Hemp will be an even big industry .
Hemp will bring in much more money than other paper sources .
8 - Marijuana is good for the environment .
It produces a lot of oxygen , and it is much more quickly grown than pine forests , which face heavy deforestation every year .
It is a very renewable source of paper and tough fiber .
9 - It will make the people feel good about their government not intruding on their lives unjustly .
10 - Imagine the sort of coffeeshops , smoke bars , paraphernalia , etc ... the peripheral market for marijuana will be amazing .
11 - It will eliminate 60 % of the violent mexican drug cartel 's funding directly .
The other 40 % , cocaine , will be significantly reduced due to the virtual death of the black market centering around marijuana .
12 - It will draw people away from alcohol and cigarettes , which are much more dangerous and deadly .
13 - Marijuana is actually carcino - suppressive , cuts your chances of getting lung cancer in half , and is neuro - protective , meaning that people who do drink on marijuana will possibly see less brain damage .
Furthermore , as in point 12 , who would drink all day when you could smoke weed all day ?
We may see less people drink alcohol as a result .
14 - It costs 500 dollars every time we arrest someone for Marijuana .
That does not take into account all of the maintainence programs , drug rehab programs that we pay for when they are on probation , drug testing , and constant purchasing of equipment meant to find marijuana growers .
This will save billions of dollars in legalization .
So what can you do about the situation ?
Well , anything !
Just talk to people about your feelings on the issue , and hell , even if you are against it , engage in open debate and open discussion .
This is something that our nation absolutely needs to talk about .
Here is what I did recently :
870 AM broadcasted out of Louisiana reaches hundreds of thousands of listeners , and at night , its broadcast range is all the way to Chicago .
The topic tonight was the legalization of marijuana .
The host is VERY supportive of legalization , and this is a guy that is just a regular old person , a radio talk show host , older guy , who never smoked , but just sees to much benefit in it .
I called in , and had a great conversation with him , and my call has been referenced multiple times tonight ... it was a great feeling .
Anyways , just get the message out there , folks .
Here is what I said :
Hello , my name is ***** and I am calling because I strongly believe marijuana should be legalized .
Anyone who believes marijuana is dangerous needs to realize that prohibition makes marijuana magnitudes more dangerous .
Illegal pesticides , fertilizers , and even glass dust can be found in marijuana at times for extra profit because marijuana is legal , untaxed , and most importantly , unregulated .
Prohibition has not curbed supply or demand , it has only made the illegal black market for marijuana more lucrative .
Someone can work hard for 12 months in this economy and get 30,000 a year , or grow 12 plants in 3 months with little effort for the same money .
Its a multi-billion dollar industry for drug cartels , who then arm themselves to protect their proffits .
All of this goes away with legalization .
I also talked about how 800,000 people a year are arrested each year , and the lost revenue from them having a drug conviction on their records probably costs us tons of money in lost taxes ...
I mean , hell , in 10 years , 8 million people will have a drug conviction on record and be very hard to emply .
An hour later , he said :
" When we planned this show this afternoon , I was deathly afraid .
I thought people would think I went crazy and was out of my mind , and that we'd have a fierce debate ... but even still , not one person has called agianst legalization .
That should say something to our politicians . "
So with that , I leave it up to all of you to go out and inform yourselves on this very important issue .
Hopefully you leave this diary a little less uninformed than when you entered .
Knowledge is power , use it wisely .
" The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by the prohibition law .
For nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which can not be enforced .
It is an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime in this country is closely connected with this . "
Albert Einstein , " My First Impression of the U.S.A. " , 1921
And as Gandhi said :
First they ignore you , then they ridicule you , then they fight you ... then you win .
Update : A poster bellow wanted more sources for other claims , so I have included them here :
Marijuana already
Is a multi-billion dollar industry .
Hell , even in just British Columbia , it is a 7.5 billion dollar industry .
In the US , it would be much higher :

As far as billions to fight corruption and violence caused by the cartels , the DEA is not the only agency that fights the cartels .
ICE , local , state , and federal police are fighting the cartel members that have popped into over 200 cities .

" U.S. May Provide Billions to Mexico to Fight Drug Cartels "
For a graphical representation of how much money is spent in just the legal issues on marijuana and crime :
Another Update : I strongly recommend anyone reading thus far and entering the debate to also check out these studies with regards to THC and its protective effect against cancer .
This website has compiled 35 studies showing that THC seems to prevent cancer and be anti-carcinogenic :

If you are considering starting your own business , you came to the right place .
More than 25 million Americans are on their way to becoming entrepreneurs , and there is no reason you should n’t be one of them .

Peter
Thiel , foremost among Silicon Valley 's loopy libertarians and the first outside investor in Facebook , has written an essay declaring that the country went to hell as soon as women won the right to vote .
Thiel is the former CEO of PayPal who now runs the $ 2 billion hedge fund Clarium Capital and a venture - capital firm called the Founders Fund .
His best - returning investment to date , though , has been Facebook .
His $ 500,000 investment is now worth north of $ 100 million even by the most conservative valuations of the social network .
On the side , though , his pet passion is libertarianism and the fantasy that everything would be better in the world if government just quit nagging everybody .
But , now he 's given up hope on achieving his vision through political means because , as he writes in Cato Unbound , a website run by the Cato Institute , all those voting females have wrecked things :
The 1920s were the last decade in American history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics .
Since 1920 , the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women - two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians - have rendered the notion of " capitalist democracy " into an oxymoron .
So there you have it :
The problem with women is that they do n't vote like their menfolk tell them .
We would have so much more freedom , Thiel suggests , if only we 'd deprived women of it .
You may wonder : Is Thiel on drugs ?
The answer , according to Thiel , is yes :
As a young lawyer and trader in Manhattan in the 1990s , I began to understand why so many become disillusioned after college .
The world appears too big a place .
Rather than fight the relentless indifference of the universe , many of my saner peers retreated to tending their small gardens .
The higher one 's IQ , the more pessimistic one became about free - market politics - capitalism simply is not that popular with the crowd .
Among the smartest conservatives , this pessimism often manifested in heroic drinking ; the smartest libertarians , by contrast , had fewer hang - ups about positive law and escaped not only to alcohol but beyond it .
" Positive law " is Libertarian - speak for laws which proscribe certain activities , such as taking drugs .
Translate
Thiel 's language , and you 'll see that he 's saying anyone in his generation who was n't taking drugs was an idiot .
Which squares with rumors we'd heard about Thiel during his PayPal days , especially while he was fitfully coming out as a gay man .
With a life like that , we can understand Thiel 's visceral dislike of the government .
But what did women ever do to him ?
Hundreds of people trying to save their homes from foreclosure flocked to Connecticut 's wealthy Gold Coast this weekend to give financial kingpins a piece of their mind .
Stamford sits in the midst of one of the nation 's wealthiest areas , and among the regions particularly hard - hit by the housing market collapse .
Nearby Greenwich and other suburbs are home to many of Wall Street 's wealthiest executives and financial managers .
Homeowners are fed up – and many are frustrated that those who lead the companies that gave them their subprime mortgages live in luxury while they struggle so hard to meet their loan payments and not fall behind .
On Sunday , hundreds of angry homeowners and volunteers traveled in vans and minibuses and protested outside Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack ’s multi-million - dollar mansion to tell the wealthy finance czar how they really feel .
The group , led by Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America ( NACA ) , also went to Greenwich Finance CEO William Frey , among others , as part of what NACA calls the “ Predator ’s Tour . ”
Sporting bright yellow shirts that read , “ Stop Loan Sharks , '' protestors demanded more accountability from the CEOs of the financial institutions responsible for the millions of unaffordable mortgages in the state and across America .
" We ca n’t let them live quietly in a lap of luxury while they throw hard working Americans out on the street , " NACA explains on its Web site .
" This action is within our legal rights as Americans to peacefully protest and meet with those who control our family ’s livelihood . "
NACA coordinated the protest as part of its “ Save the Dream ” forum – a weekend of workshops to counsel stressed - out homeowners on ways to refinance their mortgages amid the nation 's housing market meltdown .
Event organizers expected thousands to show up throughout the weekend for financial advice and mortgage assistance .
NACA has helped restructure thousands of mortgages to arrangements homeowners can afford .
None of the protestors were arrested .
DeLaval Automated Cow Brush Makes Pretty , Happy Cows
A good scratching makes cows happy .
Happy cows make more milk .
An automated cow brush makes happy , milk - producing cows .
The DeLaval cow brush automatically rotates at a cow - friendly speed when it is touched .
It provides a ' safe and comfortable brushing at all angles . '
The DeLaval company provides its customers with a wide array of products and equipment for farm production of buffaloes , sheep , goats and cows .
Implications -
The featured video shows the scratching machine hard at work , pleasing all of the cows around it .
The brush actually " improves animal welfare by increasing blood circulation while keeping the cows clean , busy and calm . "
Having a big mechanical brush for the cows is much better than having the cows try to scratch themselves in a somewhat crowded area .
An unusual internal meeting scheduled for Wednesday at the Food and Drug Administration may signal how agency officials intend to handle the many controversies swirling around its embattled device division .
Dr. Donna - Bea Tillman , director of the agency ’s office of device evaluation , sent an e-mail message on April 10 announcing an “ all - hands meeting ” to discuss the strategic direction of the device center .
Such a broad - based meeting that includes all scientists within the device evaluation office has not been held for years , two agency officials said .
Nine dissident scientists signed letters to President Obama and others in the administration charging that agency officials had acted illegally and that patients were routinely put at risk by medical devices approved for sale despite significant and often unanimous objections from scientific reviewers .
The scientists have sent numerous e-mail messages to Dr. Joshua Sharfstein , the agency ’s principal deputy commissioner , pleading for his intervention .

ABSTRACT : Relying on standard measures of macroeconomic performance , historians and economists believe that war prosperity  prevailed in the United States during World War II .
This belief is ill - founded , because it does not recognize that the United States had a command economy during the war .
From 1942 to 1946 some macroeconomic performance measures are statistically inaccurate ; others are conceptually inappropriate .
A better grounded interpretation is that during the war the economy was a huge arsenal in which the well - being of consumers deteriorated .
After the war genuine prosperity returned for the first time since 1929 .
 War prosperity is like the prosperity that an earthquake or a plague brings . 
 Ludwig von Mises [ 1 ]
For nearly half a century historians and economists , almost without exception , have misinterpreted the performance of the U.S. economy in the 1940s .
The reigning view has two aspects : one pertaining to the conceptualization and measurement of the economys performance ; the other pertaining to the explanation of that performance in macroeconomic theory .
The two are encapsulated in the title of a chapter in a leading textbook :  War Prosperity : The Keynesian Message Illustrated . [ 2 ]
I shall challenge the consensus view .
The accepted profile of the economys performance during the 1940s peak prosperity from 1943 to 1945 , followed by much worse performance from 1946 to 1949  is indefensible as a description of economic well - being .
Further , the most widely accepted explanation of the events of the war years cannot withstand critical scrutiny .
The prevailing misinterpretations of economic performance during the 1940s have arisen because historians and economists have failed to appreciate that the wartime economy , a command economy , cannot be readily compared with either the prewar or the postwar economy .
The Consensus
According to the orthodox account , the war got the economy out of the Depression .
Evidence for the claim usually includes the great decline in the standard measure of the unemployment rate , the large increase in the standard measure of real GNP , and the slight increase in the standard measure of real personal consumption .
The entire episode of apparent business - cycle expansion during the war years is understood by most writers as an obvious validation of the simple Keynesian model : enormous government spending , with huge budget deficits , spurred the military economy and produced multiplier effects on the civilian economy , the upshot being increased employment , real output , and consumption and decreased unemployment .
Some analysts , recognizing the rapid increase of the money stock during the war , have blended Keynesian and monetarist explanations , treating them as complements .
This consensus account , occasionally with minor qualifications or caveats , appears in the works of historians , economists , and other writers . [ 3 ]
Employment and Unemployment
The standard measure of the unemployment rate ( persons officially unemployed as a percent of civilian labor force ) fell between 1940 and 1944 from 14.6 percent to 1.2 percent .
[ 4 ]
Michael Darbys measure , which does not count those in emergency government employment as unemployed , fell from 9.5 percent to 1.2 percent .
[ 5 ]
Either measure signals a virtual disappearance of unemployment during the war , but in the circumstances neither measure means what it is commonly taken to mean .
The buildup of the armed forces to more than 12 million persons by 1945 made an enormous decline of the unemployment rate inevitable .
But the welfare significance of the decline is hardly the usual one .
Of the 16 million persons who served in the armed forces at some time during the war , 10 million were conscripted , and many of those who volunteered did so only to avoid the draft and the consequent likelihood of assignment to the infantry . [ 6 ]
The civilian labor force between 1940 and 1945 ranged from 54 to 56 million .
[ 7 ]
Therefore , the 12 million serving in the armed forces during the last year of the war , most of them under duress , constituted about 18 percent of the total ( civilian plus military ) labor force , itself much enlarged during the war .
What actually happened is no mystery .
In 1940 , before the military mobilization , the unemployment rate ( Darby concept ) was 9.5 percent .
During the war the government pulled the equivalent of 22 percent of the prewar labor force into the armed forces .
Voilà , the unemployment rate dropped to a very low level .
No one needs a macroeconomic model to understand this event .
Given the facts of the draft , no plausible view of the economy is incompatible with the observed decline of the unemployment rate .
Whether the government ran deficits or not , whether the money stock increased or not , massive military conscription was sure to decrease dramatically the rate of unemployment . [ 8 ]
Between 1940 and 1944 unemployment fell by either 7.45 million ( official measure ) or by 4.62 million ( Darby measure ) , while the armed forces increased by 10.87 million .
Even if one views eliminating civilian unemployment as tantamount to producing prosperity , one must recognize that placing either 146 or 235 persons ( depending on the unemployment concept used ) in the armed forces to gain a reduction of 100 persons in civilian unemployment was a grotesque way to achieve prosperity , even if a job were a job .
But military jobs differed categorically .
Often they entailed substantial risks of death , dismemberment , and other physical and psychological injuries .
Military service yielded little pay under harsh conditions and , like it or not , lasted for the duration of the war .
Sustained involvement in combat drove many men insane . [ 9 ]
Physical casualties included 405,399 dead and 670,846 wounded . [ 10 ]
To treat military jobs as commensurable with civilian jobs , as economists do in computing the tradeoffs between them , betrays a monumental obtuseness to their realities .

This measure rose from 17.6 percent , almost all of it being unemployment , in fiscal year 1940 to more than 40 percent , almost all of it being war - related employment , during the fiscal years from 1943 to 1945 , then dropped abruptly to about 10 percent during the fiscal years from 1946 to 1949 .
The extraordinarily high level of the labor force residuum during the war indicates that the prosperous condition of the labor force was spurious : official unemployment was virtually nonexistent , but four - tenths of the total labor force was not being used to produce consumer goods or capital capable of yielding consumer goods in the future .
The sharp drop of the labor force residuum between fiscal years 1945 and 1946 marks the return of genuine prosperity .
Real Output
To find out what happened to real output during World War II , historians usually reach for Historical Statistics , economists for the most recent issue of the Council of Economic Advisers  Annual Report .
As Table 2 shows , which source one chooses makes a big difference .
Although the two series show roughly the same profile of real GNP during the 1940s , the latest Commerce Department version indicates , in index number form ( 1939 equals 100 ) , a peak value of 192.7 in 1944 , versus a peak value of 172.5 in 1944 in the series taken from Historical Statistics .
Both series show a large drop in real GNP from 1945 to 1946 : 12 percent in the older series , 19 percent in the newer .
Another series , constructed by John Kendrick , moves similarly with the first two in the table but displays some discrepancies .
Notably , from 1945 to 1946 Kendricks estimate drops by just 9 percent .
Analysts who employ these standard series , besides ignoring the discrepancies , seem generally unaware that the figures may be conceptually problematic .

GNP * is equal to Kuznetss variant III minus gross war construction and durable munitions and was computed form data in Kendrick , Productivity Trends , pp. 291-92 .
By contrast , Simon Kuznets , a pioneer in national income accounting , expressed many concerns .
In National Product in Wartime Kuznets noted that national income accountants must make definite assumptions about  the purpose , value , and scope of economic activity .
He observed that a major war magnifies these conceptual difficulties , raising questions concerning the ends economic activity is made to pursue ; and  the distinction between intermediate and final products .
Moreover , war and peace type products . . . cannot be added into a national product total until the differences in the valuation due to differences in the institutional mechanisms that determine their respective market prices are corrected for . 
During the war Kuznets constructed several alternative series , one of which appears in Table 2 , column 4 .
Its values for 1942 and 1943 are substantially lower than those in columns 1 , 2 , and 3 , in part because Kuznets used preliminary nominal data as well as different deflators for expenditure on munitions . [ 11 ]
After the war Kuznets refined his estimates , producing a series ( Table 2 , column 5 ) that differs substantially from the standard series partly because of the allowance for overpricing of certain types of war production , partly because of the exclusion of nondurable war output ( essentially pay and subsistence of armed forces ) .
Contrasting his estimate and that of the Commerce Department , he found the latter difficult to accept because it made too little correction for actual inflation during the war years and did not deal satisfactorily with the decline in the relative prices of munitions during the war . [ 12 ]
Kuznetss refined estimates follow a completely different profile for the 1940s .
Most notable is that whereas the Commerce Departments latest estimate of real GNP drops precipitously in 1946 and remains at that low level for the rest of the decade , Kuznetss estimate increases in 1946 by about 8 percent , then rises slightly higher during the next three years .
Kuznets might have made an even greater adjustment , deleting all war outlays .
Although computing GNP in this way now seems highly unorthodox , a strong argument can be offered for it , and Kuznets considered it seriously . [ 13 ]
The crucial question : does war spending purchase a final good and hence belong in GNP , or an intermediate good and hence not belong ?
In his studies of long - term economic growth , Kuznets always insisted on a peacetime concept of GNP .
In this , government spending counts only if it pays for a flow of goods to consumers or a flow to capital formation .
Military spending enters only to the extent that it finances additions to the military capital stock , the justification being that even though military durables and construction are used for military purposes , they represent capital that could be employed for nonmilitary purposes a justification that seems far - fetched with regard to many forms of military capital .
Application of this approach in estimating real GNP during the 1940s yields the series that Kuznets designated Variant III ( Table 2 , column 6 ) . [ 14 ]
This estimate reached a peak in 1941 , stalled throughout the war period , then surged with the demobilization and reconversion .
It jumped by nearly 17 percent between 1945 and 1946 and remained at the higher level for the rest of the decade .
No wartime prosperity here .
Kuznets himself did not accept the Variant III concept as applicable to the war years . [ 15 ]
Beginning with National Product in Wartime and continuing through elaborations in his contributions of the early 1950s , he maintained that although ordinarily one ought to count as part of national product only goods that either contribute immediately to consumer satisfaction or add to the stock of capital from which future flows of consumer goods can be derived , the situation changes during the life and death struggle of a great war .
Then , one must temporarily recognize " success in war and preservation of a countrys social framework as a purpose at least equal in importance to welfare of individuals . 
Kuznets insisted that this approach was justified only during these extraordinary and necessarily brief intervals in the life of a body social .
One must particularly beware of extending this viewpoint , justified by the necessarily temporary crises in the life of a nation , to the common run of public activities . [ 16 ]
But when the Cold War developed and persisted , most economists took the position that military expenditures always perform the function that Kuznets viewed them as performing only during a war for national survival . [ 17 ]
Not everyone accepted the dominant view .
Among the dissenters were William Nordhaus and James Tobin , who made numerous adjustments to the standard GNP concept to transform it into what they called a measure of economic welfare .
They aimed to eliminate from GNP all activities that are evidently not direct sources of utility themselves but are regrettably necessary inputs to activities that may yield utility in other words , only instrumental . 
Accordingly they deleted , among other things , all national defense spending .
They did not consider military spending wasteful ; they merely insisted that it purchases an intermediate good .
It is a necessary regrettable expense . [ 18 ]
Earlier Kuznets had come close to adopting this position .
He regarded warfare as  the central difficulty in distinguishing between final and intermediate output of government .
He found it difficult to understand why the net product of the economy should include not only the flow of goods to the ultimate comsumers , but also the increased cost of government activities necessary to maintain the social fabric within which the flow is realized .
Still , Kuznets did not disavow his insistence on recognizing two end purposes  in estimating real output during World War II . [ 19 ]
Kuznetss own logic , however , required that he go all the way : maintenance expense remains maintenance expense , even though much more maintenance is required when the weather is stormy than when it is placid .
As Kuznets himself said ,  there is little sense in talking of protection of life and limb [ against external enemies ] as an economic service to individuals it is a pre-condition of such service , not a service in itself . [ 20 ]
When one adopts this position on the treatment of military outlays , that is , when one deducts all of them from GNP on the grounds that they purchase ( at best ) intermediate rather than final goods , one arrives at a starkly different understanding of economic performance in the 1940s .
Constructing an index purged of all military spending , one obtains the measure designated here as GNP * ( Table 2 , column 7 ) .
Like Variant III , GNP * shows a peak in 1941 followed by a U - shaped profile during the war years with a trough in 1943 .
However , the U is much deeper in GNP * , with real output in 1943 more than 14 percent below its value in 1941 .
Moreover , while Variant III exceeded its 1941 value by 1945 , GNP * did not .
Between 1945 and 1946 GNP * surged upward by almost 27 percent , versus less than 17 percent for Variant III .
From 1946 to 1949 , with military spending at a much lower level , the two indexes were virtually identical . [ 21 ]
Finally , one can make an even more unorthodox which is not to say incorrectargument for rejecting the conventional wisdom .
One can simply argue that outside a more or less competitive equilibrium framework , the use of prices as weights in an aggregation of physical quantities loses its essential theoretical justification .
All presumption that price equals marginal cost vanishes , and therefore no meaningful estimate of real national product is possible . [ 22 ]
In fact , price was never a factor in the allocation of resources for war purposes .
The authorities did not permit  the price - cost relationship . . . to determine either the level of output or the distribution of the final product to individual uses . [ 23 ]
Clearly , all presumption of equalities between prevailing prices , consumers  marginal rates of substitution , and producers  marginal rates of technical substitution vanished .
Absent those equalities , at least as approximations , national income accounting loses its moorings ; it necessarily becomes more or less arbitrary .
Some economists appreciated the perils at the time .
Noting that the government had displaced the price system , Wesley Mitchell observed that comparisons of the war and prewar economies , even comparisons between successive years , had become highly dubious . 
Index number problems lurked around every corner .
Much output during the war , especially the weapons , consisted of goods that did not exist before the war .
Even for physically comparable goods , price structures and output mixes changed radically .
Production of many important consumer goods was outlawed .
Surrounding everything were the obvious uncertainties concerning [ price ] quotations in a land of price controls and evasions . [ 24 ]
Kuznets declared that the bases of valuation for the war and nonwar sectors of the economy are inherently noncomparable . . . .
It is impossible to construct directly a price index of war products that would span both prewar and war years .
Kuznetss own efforts to overcome these problems never escaped from arbitrariness , as he himself admitted . [ 25 ]
It will not do to maintain , as some economists have , that although the standard indexes of real GNP are deficient from a welfare standpoint , they can serve as indexes of production or resource consumption .
Economics is not a science of hammers and nails , or of production or consumption in the raw ; it is a science of choice , and therefore of values .
Valuation is inherent in all national income accounting .
In a command economy the fundamental accounting difficulty is that the authorities suppress and replace the only genuinely meaningful manifestation of peoples valuations , namely , free market prices . [ 26 ]
Real Consumption
Most writers insist that real personal consumption increased during the war .
In Seymour Melmans flamboyant but otherwise representative portrayal ,  the economy [ was ] producing more guns and more butter . . .
Americans had never had it so good . [ 27 ]
This belief rests on a weak foundation .
It fails to take sufficiently into account the understatement of actual wartime inflation by the official price indexes , the deterioration of quality and disappearance from the market of many consumer goods , the full effect of the nonprice rationing of many widely consumed items , and the additional transactions costs borne and other sacrifices made by consumers to get the goods that were available .
When one corrects the data to provide a more defensible measure of what happened to real consumer well - being during the war , one finds that it declined .

Table 3 shows the standard series on real personal consumption expenditure during the 1940s .
They do not differ much .
The similarity is hardly surprising , as all rest on nearly the same conceptual and statistical bases .
These figures have led historians and economist to conclude that the well - being of consumers improved , though not by much , during the war .
Even if one stays within the confines of the standard series , the conclusion is shaky .
Notice , for example , that the data indicate that consumption in 1943 hardly differed from consumption in 1941 .
The change between 1941 and 1944 varies from 3.7 percent to 5 percent , depending on the series considered .
But the population was growing at a rate of more than 1 percent per year , so the official data imply that real personal consumption per capita remained essentially unchanged between 1941 and 1944 .
Merely to maintain the level of 1941 , a year in which the economy had yet to recover fully from the Depression , hardly signified wartime prosperity . [ 28 ]
The more serious problem , however , is that the standard real consumption series are quotients fatally flawed by their deflators .
Everyone who has looked closely at the official price indexes recognizes that they underestimate the actual inflation during the war and an important point usually overlooked overstate the actual inflation during the immediate postwar period .
But investigators have not agreed on exactly how the actual price level moved or the proper technique for finding out .
During the war a committee headed by Wesley Mitchell investigated how far the official consumer price index had fallen short of the true price level , but the committee neither attempted to adjust nor succeeded in correcting for all the factors creating the discrepancy .
In 1978 Hugh Rockoff made additional adjustments , concluding that the official consumer price index understated the true price level by 4.8 to 7.3 percent in June 1946 , just before the price controls lapsed . [ 29 ]
Rockoffs adjustments remained incomplete , as he recognized .
He commented that if anything , the errors were larger than the estimates indicated .
Moreover , evasion and black markets were probably more severe outside the group of commodities that were covered by the consumer price index . [ 30 ]
More recently , Rockoff and Geofrey Mills , using a different ( macroeconomic ) approach , have estimated an alternative deflator for NNP during the war .
This shows that the official deflator understated the price level by 2.3 percent in 1943 ( the first year that the price controls had a significant effect ) , 4.9 percent in 1944 , 4.8 percent in 1945 , and 1.6 percent in 1946 . [ 31 ]
These discrepancies seem too small to be credible .
By comparison , Kuznetss alternative ( GNP ) deflator , published in 1952 , differed from the official deflator for the corresponding years by 11.1 percent , 13.4 percent , 11.4 percent , and 2.2 percent , respectively . [ 32 ]
Perhaps the most credible alternative deflator has been produced by Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz .
They found the official deflator for NNP to be understated by 3.7 percent in 1943 , 7.7 percent in 1944 , 8.9 percent in 1945 , and 3.3 percent in 1946 . [ 33 ]
Their deflator is for NNP , not for just the consumption component of NNP .
In using it as a deflator for consumption alone , one is taking a risk .
It definitely moves in the right direction , however , as it implies larger adjustments than Rockoffs admittedly incomplete adjustments of the official consumer price index .
Moreover , it is well established that munitions prices rose much less than the prices of civilian goods ; hence , a deflator for official NNP , which includes munitions , most likely still understates the extent to which the prices of consumer goods rose during the war .
If one uses the Friedman - Schwartz price index to deflate personal consumption spending per capita , the results are shown in table 4 , column 3 .
The pattern shown there diverges markedly from that shown by the standard data .
According to the alternative estimate , real consumption per capita reached a prewar peak in 1941 , nearly 9 percent above the 1939 level ; it declined by more than 6 percent during 1941 - 1943 and rose during 1943 - 1945 ; still , even in 1945 it had not recovered to the level of 1941 .
In 1946 , however , the index jumped by 18 percent , and it remained at about the same level for the rest of the decade .

Column 3 is column 1 divided by column 2 and multiplied by 100 .
In fact , conditions were much worse than the data suggest for consumers during the war .
Even if the price index corrections considered above are sufficient , which is doubtful , one must recognize that consumers had to contend with other extraordinary welfare - diminishing changes during the war .
To get the available goods , millions of people had to move , many of them long distances , to centers of war production .
( Of course , costly movements to areas of greater opportunity always occur ; but the rate of migration during the war was exceptional because of the abrupt changes in the location of employment opportunities . ) [ 34 ]
After bearing substantial costs of relocation , the migrants often found themselves crowded into poorer housing .
Because of the disincentives created by rent controls , the housing got worse each ear , as landlords reduced or eliminated maintenance and repairs .
Transportation , even commuting to work , became difficult for many workers .
No new cars were being produced ; used cars were hard to come by because of rationing and were sold on the black market at elevated prices ; gasoline and tires were rationed ; public transportation was crowded and inconvenient for many , as well as frequently pre-empted by the military authorities .
Shoppers bore substantial costs of searching for sellers willing to sell goods , including rationed goods , at controlled prices ; they spent much valuable time arranging ( illegal ) trades of ration coupons or standing in queues .
The government exhorted the public to use it up , wear it out , make it do , or do without . 
In thousands of ways , consumers lost their freedom of choice . [ 35 ]
People were also working harder , longer , more inconveniently , and at greater physical risk in order to get the available goods .
The ratio of civilian employment to population ( aged 14 and over ) increased from 47.6 percent in 1940 to 57.9 percent in 1944 , as many teenagers left school , women left their homes , and older people left retirement to work . [ 36 ]
The average work week in manufacturing , where most of the new jobs were , increased from 38.1 hours in 1940 to 45.2 hours in 1944 ; and the average work week increased in most other industries , too  in bituminous coal mining , it increased by more than 50 percent . [ 37 ]
Night shifts occupied a much larger proportion of the work force . [ 38 ]
The rate of disabling injuries per hour worked in manufacturing rose by more than 30 percent between 1940 and its wartime peak in 1943 . [ 39 ]
It is difficult to understand how working harder , longer , more inconveniently and dangerously in return for a diminished flow of consumer goods comports with the description that economically speaking , Americans had never had it so good . 
Irrelevant Macro Models
None of the standard macroeconomic theories employed to account for the wartime experience provides an acceptable explanation .
The models cannot do the job because they do not pertain to a command economy , and the United States between 1942 and 1945 had a command economy .
Regardless of the peculiarities of their assumptions , all standard macro models presume the existence of functioning markets for commodities , factor services , and bonds .
The assumption fails even to approximate the conditions that prevailed during the war .
Commodity markets were pervasively subject to controls : price controls , rationing , and in some cases outright prohibition in the consumer goods markets ; and price controls , prohibitions , priorities , conservation and limitation orders , quotas , set - asides , scheduling , allocations , and other restrictions in the market for raw materials , components , and capital equipment . [ 40 ]
While taxes were raised enormously , many forms of production received subsidies so the price controls would not drive suppliers from the market . [ 41 ]
Factor markets were no freer , and in some respects ( such as conscription ) were much less free . [ 42 ]
Credit markets came under total control , as the Federal Reserve undertook to reduce and allocate consumer credit and pegged the nominal interest rate on government bonds at a barely positive level . [ 43 ]
Two - thirds of the investment in manufacturing plants and equipment from July 1940 through June 1945 was financed by the government , and most of the remainder came forth in response to tax concessions and other de facto subsidies authorized in 1940 to stimulate the rearmament . [ 44 ]
In sum , the economy during the war was the exact opposite of a free market system .
Every part of it was either directly controlled by the authorities or subject to drastic distortion by virtue of its relations with suppliers and customers who were tightly controlled . [ 45 ]
To suppose that the economy allocated resources in response to prices set by the unhampered interplay of demands and supplies in the markets for commodities , factor services , and loanable funds is to suppose a complete fiction .
Clearly , the assumptions that undergird standard macro models do not correspond with the empirical reality of the wartime economy .
So What Did Happen ?
As the 1940s began , the economy , although substantially affected by various government intrusions , remained one in which resource allocation for the most part reflected the operation of the price system .
It was far from classic capitalism but also far from a command economy .
Beginning in the fall of 1940 , proceeding slowly until the attack on Pearl Harbor and then very rapidly , the government imposed such pervasive and sufficiently effective controls that , by the beginning of 1943 , the economy became a thoroughgoing command system .
This regime persisted until the fall of 1945 , when the controls began to come off rapidly .
Although some persisted , the overwhelming mass of them had been removed by 1947 .
In the late 1940s the economy was once again broadly market - oriented , albeit far from pure capitalism .
So , within a single decade the economy had moved from being mainly market - directed to being nearly under the complete control of central planners to being mainly market - directed again .
When one views any economic measure spanning the decade , one must keep this full revolution of the institutional framework in mind , because the meaning of such measures as the unemployment rate , GNP , and the consumer price index depends on the institutional setting to which they relate .
In 1940 and 1941 the economy was recovering smartly from the Depression , but in the latter year the recovery was becoming ambiguous , as substantial resources were diverted to war production .
From 1942 to 1944 war production increased rapidly .
Although there is no defensible way to place a value on the outpouring of munitions , its physical dimensions are awesome .
From mid-1940 to mid-1945 munitions makers produced 86,338 tanks ; 297,000 airplanes ; 17,400,000 rifles , carbines , and sidearms ; 315,000 pieces of field artillery and mortars ; 4,200,000 tons of artillery shells ; 41,400,000,000 rounds of small arms ammunition ; 64,500 landing vessels ; 6,500 other navy ships ; 5,400 cargo ships and transports ; and vast amounts of other munitions . [ 46 ]
Despite countless administrative mistakes , frustrations , and turf battles , the command economy worked . [ 47 ]
But , as always , a command economy can be said to work only in the sense that it turns out what the authorities demand .
The U.S. economy did so in quantities sufficient to overwhelm enemy forces .
Meanwhile , as shown above , real personal consumption declined .
So did real private investment .
From 1941 to 1943 real gross private domestic investment plunged by 64 percent ; during the four years of the war it never rose above 55 percent of its 1941 level ; only in 1946 did it reach a new high . [ 48 ]
Notwithstanding the initial availability of much unemployed labor and capital , the mobilization became a classic case of guns displacing both butter and churns .
So why , apart from historians and economists misled by inappropriate and inaccurate statistical constructs , did people evidently almost everyone think that prosperity had returned during the war ?
The question has several answers .
First , everybody with a desire to work was working .
After more than 10 years of persistently high unemployment and the associated insecurities ( even for those who were working ) , full employment relieved a lot of anxieties .
Although economic well - being deteriorated after 1941 , civilians were probably better off on the average during the war than they had been during the 1930s .
Second , the national solidarity of the war effort , though decaying after the initial upsurge of December 7 , 1941 , helped to sustain the spirits of many who otherwise would have been angry about the shortages and other inconveniences .
For some people the wartime experience was exhilarating even though , like many adventures , it entailed hardships .
Third , some individuals ( for instance , many of the black migrants form the rural South who found employment in northern and western industry ) were better off , although the average person was not .
Wartime reduction of the variance in personal income and hence in personal consumption along with rationing and price controls , meant that many people at the bottom of the consumption distribution could improve their absolute position despite a reduction of the mean . [ 49 ]
Fourth , even if people could not buy many of the things they wanted at the time , they were earning unprecedented amounts of money .
Perhaps money illusion , fostered by price controls , made the earnings look bigger than they really were .
In any event , people were building up bank accounts and bond holdings ; while actually living worse than before , they were feeling wealthier .
Which brings us to what may be the most important factor of all : the performance of the war economy , despite its command - and - control character , broke the back of the pessimistic expectations almost everybody had come to hold during the seemingly endless Depression .
In the long decade of the 1930s , especially its latter half , many people had come to believe that the economic machine was irreparably broken .
The frenetic activity of war production never mind that it was just a lot of guns and ammunition dispelled the hopelessness .
People began to think : if we can produce all these planes , ships , and bombs , we can also turn out prodigious quantities of cars and refrigerators . [ 50 ]

When the controls began to come off and the war ended more quickly than anticipated in 1945 , consumers and producers launched eagerly into carrying out plans based on rosy forecasts and , by so doing , made their expectations a reality .
Of course , the ability to draw on the accumulations of financial assets built up by forced saving  during the war was important , especially in conjunction with the Federal Reserves continued support of bond prices .
But the liquidation of those assets alone could not have turned the trick if such tricks were possible , a government could produce prosperity simply by cranking the money presses . [ 51 ]
Probably the most solid evidence of expectations comes from the stock markets , where thousands of transactors risk their own wealth on the basis of their beliefs about future economic conditions .
( See Table 5 . )
Evidently investors took a dim view of the prospect of a war economy .
After 1939 , stock values dropped steadily and substantially ; U.S. entry into the war in December 1941 did not arrest the decline .
By 1942 the Standard & Poors index had fallen by 28 percent , and the market value of all stocks on registered exchanges had plunged by 62 percent in nominal terms .
( Adjustments for price level changes would make the declines even greater . )
The declines occurred even though current corporate profits were rising steadily and substantially .
In 1943 , as the tide of war turned in favor of the Allies , the stock market rallied and small additional advances took place in 1944 .
Still , in 1944 , with the war economy operating at its peak , the stock markets real value had yet to recover to its 1939 level .
By early 1945 , almost everyone expected the war to end soon .
The prospect of a peacetime economy electrified investors .
Stock prices surged in 1945 and again in 1946 .
In just two years the Standard & Poors index increased by 37 percent and the value of all shares on registered exchanges by 92 percent , despite a decline of current - dollar after - tax corporate profits from their peak in 1944 .
Did people expect the end of wartime prosperity  to be economically deleterious ?
Obviously not .
To sum up , World War II got the economy out of the Great Depression , but not in the manner described by the orthodox story .
The war itself did not get the economy out of the Depression .
The economy produced neither a carnival of consumption nor an investment boom , however successfully it overwhelmed the nations enemies with bombs , shells , and bullets . [ 52 ]
But certain events of the war years the buildup of financial wealth and especially the transformation of expectations justify an interpretation that views the war as an event that recreated the possibility of genuine economic recovery .
As the war ended , real prosperity returned .

Differences between Kuznetss 1952 figures and the Variant III estimates reflect the incorporation of new data showing lower proportions of durables in military purchases during the war as well as a switch ( justified by the need for continuity in a longer series ) back to Commerce Department deflators .

Again , his discussion in Capital , pp. 465 - 84 , may be read as an implicit disavowal .
There he no longer defended or even mentioned the two end purposes  argument .
Referring to a comparison of his approach and the Commerce Departments approach to treating military spending for a period that includes World War II , he said ( p. 471 ) that one errs less  by using his approach , that is , the peacetime concept of national product .
20 . Kuznets ,  Government Product ,  pp. 193-94 .
21 . Even if one accepts GNP * conceptually , one might object that my estimate of it makes too large a deduction .
Some of the military durable equipment and construction purchased during the war was used after the war for the production of civilian as well as military outputs .
To delete all military spending gives rise to the error exposed by Gordon ,  $ 45 Billion . 
If one could make a correction completely consistent with the spirit of the argument , one would arrive at an estimate somewhere between Variant III and GNP * , the exact location being determined by the distinction between military capital potentially capable of augmenting civilian output and military capital lacking this capability .
Data on war durables purchases are insufficient to allow the separation to be made with precision .

This is not to say that prices played no role ; much of the planning had to do with the manipulation of prices .
But market - determined prices and costs were never permitted to play a fundamental role .

In a personal communication Professor Vatter has noted that the civilian population actually fell between 1941 and 1944 by nearly five million , and hence consumption per civilian rose more rapidly than the per capita data indicate .
The point is well taken but somewhat unsettling .
It suggests a civilian population enhancing its well - being by forcing millions of men into military service , where civilian goods became wholly irrelevant to them while their more fortunate fellows enjoyed those goods exclusively .
The more fundamental problem , however , is that the numerator ( total real consumption ) is overstated .

Recent statements by President Barack Obama , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel admitting that they were going to use the economic crisis to get other things done is at least surprisingly honest .
But it is also hypocritical .
Remember when some of these same people criticized George W. Bush for using the 9/11 tragedy to invade the unrelated nation of Iraq ?
It is true that the super secretive Bush administration was less honest about its " bait and switch " subterfuge than Obama and his team appear to be , but Bush ’s ulterior motives occasionally showed through .
Then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , shortly after 9/11 , did once write a memo to then - President Bush declaring that , " If the war [ on terror ] does not significantly change the world ’s political map , the U.S. will not achieve its aim . "
Liberals would also argue that using the economic crisis to pass new education , energy , and health initiatives , which they deem to be positive , is of a much different magnitude than using a horrendous terrorist attack to invade an unrelated country for no good reason and get even more people killed .
Of course , many neoconservatives still tell us that all the chaos , mayhem , and death in Iraq were for a positive good .
And even if the new education , energy , and health initiatives have a positive effect  a dubious proposition  the question is whether the deficit - and debt - ridden government can afford them during a severe economic meltdown .
Different politicians , same chicanery .
Other hypocrisies abound overseas .
President Obama recently broached the possibility of negotiating with the Taliban , in the same spirit with which the Bush administration bought off the Sunni guerrillas in Iraq .
Yet the United States has implied that Pakistani government officials were wimps for doing the same thing .
U.S. government officials and politicians frowned on Pakistan acquiescing to Islamic law in the former ski resort country of the Swat Valley , not too far from Pakistan ’s capital city , in exchange for a truce with Islamic militants .
And what about all of that U.S. rhetoric supporting democracy ?
All of a sudden , Hamid Karzai , the democratically elected president of Afghanistan , is on the outs with the United States .
Unlike the Bush administration , the Obama team seems to have distaste for him and is doing everything it can to undermine him .
This spurning of democracy is nothing new , however .
The Bush administration foolishly pushed for elections in Palestine in 2006 , was somehow surprised and horrified when the Islamic militant group Hamas won them , and has shunned and put the screws to the group ever since then .
Thus , given the historical tendency of the United States to favor " pragmatism " over democracy , Karzai needs to watch his back or he could end up overthrown , much like Ngo Dinh Diem was in South Vietnam in 1963 .
And speaking of Palestine , how can the U.S. fund and support both sides in the same war ?
With billions per year in military and economic aid , the United States funded and supported Israel ’s costly destruction of Gaza in the recent war , only to offer Gazans $ 900 million to clean up the mess .
Is any of these expenditures a good use of U.S. taxpayer dollars at a time of skyrocketing budget deficits and an economic crisis on the home front ?
I think not .
Also , the U.S. was recently dismayed by British reestablishment of contact with the political arm of Hezbollah , a militant Islamist group in Lebanon that is an enemy of Israel ( Britain continues to eschew the group ’s military wing ) .
Meanwhile , the United States is making diplomatic overtures to Iran and Syria , Hezbollah ’s main benefactors .
Finally , instead of prosecuting terrorists as heinous criminals , the United States has conducted a " war on terror , " which created offshore prisons outside U.S. law and shunned legal niceties such as habeas corpus , civil trials , and international prohibitions against torture .
As part of this war and lack of legal due process , the U.S. government created a prison at Guantánamo that has held lots of people who were probably innocent and tortured even the guilty , making convictions in civilian courts more difficult .
Now after unilaterally creating this abomination , to help close the facility , the United States is pressuring other countries to take potentially dangerous detainees .
Should n’t the U.S. have to take all of these people since the Bush administration caused the problem in the first place ?
Like banks who made risky and stupid loans , if the U.S. government is bailed out of this situation , wo n’t it be more likely to adopt more reckless policies in the future ?
Hypocrisy in government is nothing new and is certainly not more prevalent in one party or the other .
There just seems to be a lot of it around lately .
As soon as you sense that you are descending into that hormone - fueled fog , GRAB THIS LIST AND CAGE THE BEAST .
1. First , and this is very important for your future happiness , avoid anyone who does not love you unconditionally
2 . Even if they DO love you unconditionally , avoid anyone who has previously hinted that they think you ought to be committed to some form of institution
3 . If you are struck down at work , avoid interaction with your boss and coworkers .
Try to dull your senses with loud Pandora music .
Chew gum .
Pretend you have something contagious .
4 . If your time is your own , and it seems that playing competitive games would take your mind off your troubles , be careful to only play opponents far inferior to your skills .
This should provide some protection against broken electronics and / or furniture .
5 . Remember , if someone ’s odor or appearance offends you , that does not give you the right to punch them .
Wait till they say something that could reasonably be construed as a threat or insult .
6 . Alcohol will probably just make things worse .
7 . It is for these moments that the sensible woman keeps a chocolate stash .
Be sure to maintain this stash in times of peace and harmony , but do n’t fool yourself into thinking it is safe to buy unknown brands .
Low - quality chocolate is a dangerous drug , and could just add to the hormone - induced rage .
High quality and gooeyness are good factors to look for in creating your stash .
8 . Go to the gym .
You know you should anyway .
9 . If you ca n’t make yourself go to the gym , consider sleeping the whole thing off .
There is no shame in hibernation , but I would advise telling others that you have a headache ( bringing up homicidal urges and demon possession will make people keep talking to you , which never ends well ) .
10 .
There is likewise no shame in crying , though it is best pursued as a solitary release .
If you must cry , be sure to stick your face in cold water afterwards .
Otherwise , you WILL look ridiculous and lumpy - faced tomorrow .
It ’s no good persuading yourself that you will look wan and heroic , because you wo n’t .
You ’ll have to explain to your coworkers that you watched a sad movie and cried , and admitting that it was Hot Rod will not advance your career one little bit .
11 . Wow , it would be really great if you had a loving , furry pet right now , would n’t it ?
Try visualizing it .
Or go to CuteOverload .
Do it .
12 . Come on now , how would your grandma feel if she saw you acting like this ?
Snap out of it !
13 . Exorcism is probably not the answer , but who am I to judge ?
I ’m attaching two useful resources that I ’ve created :
Clearing floats
No compatibility problems .
Incredible , is n't it ?
Discuss this page .
A common problem with float - based layouts is that the floats ' container does n't want to stretch up to accomodate the floats .
If you want to add , say , a border around all floats ( ie. a border around the container ) you 'll have to command the browsers somehow to stretch up the container all the way .
The problem
Let 's try it .
This is the CSS we 'll use throughout the page :
div.container { border : 1 px solid # 000000 ; } div.left { width : 45 % ; float : left ; } div.right { width : 45 % ; float : right ; }
Now this happens :
The left column .
The left column .
The left column .
The left column .
The right column .
The right column .
The right column .
We want the black border to go around both our floating columns .
That does n't happen , though .
The container div itself has no height , since it only contains floating elements .
Therefore the border stubbornly stays at the top of the floating columns .
The old solution
The old solution to this problem required you to add an extra element with clear : both to the container .
Once it was in place the container contained a non-floating element , which means it stretches itself up to accomodate it :
The left column .
The left column .
The left column .
The left column .
The right column .
The right column .
The right column .
clearer div with clear : both
This can be done either by adding the extra element in the HTML source code ( as the example above does ) or by using the : after pseudo - class to generate it .
Since Explorer ( Win and Mac ) does n't support : after this second solution was mainly of theoretical interest .
In any case , adding an HTML element for presentation 's sake is something we 've learned to avoid .
Unfortunately the problem could not be solved in any other way , until now .
The new solution
It was Alex Walker who first posted a new , simpler solution , though he gives the credits for actually inventing it to Paul O'Brien .
In any case , the solution seems to be :
div.container { border : 1 px solid # 000000 ; overflow : auto ; width : 100 % }
The width is necessary to trigger " hasLayout " in Explorer Windows ( except for 7 ) .
This works :
The left column .
The left column .
The left column .
The left column .
The right column .
The right column .
The right column .
Now the border neatly fits around the floated elements .
The tricky bits
A few points merit extra attention :
The trick works with three of the four overflow values : auto , hidden and scroll .
Of course , using the last value will show scrollbars , regardless of whether they 're needed or not .
Some browsers also need a width or height for the container div .
The browser may show scrollbars when the content escapes beyond the specified width .
width or height required
The use of a width or height declaration is required to make the effect work in Explorer Windows and Opera .
If you do n't include it Explorer Windows continues to show the border at the top of the columns , as if there were no overflow .
Opera completely hides the content of the container .
A width : 100 % is a neat starting point , although more complicated layouts may require other values .
Explorer Mac : hidden
If Explorer Mac is still important to you , use overflow : hidden .
This browser always shows scrollbars when you use overflow : auto ; and I 'm not sure why .
Unwanted scrollbars
As Dave Shea noted , this solution might cause unwanted scrollbars if the content escapes from the container box .
Personally I wonder if this will be a serious problem .
overflow : hidden makes sure that no scrollbars will ever be visible .
Of course some content might be hidden instead , but if we make very sure that
the height of the container remains flexible ( ie. " as much as needed " ) the widths of the combined floats never exceed the width of the container , and preferably remain slightly smaller to allow for some flexibility
this problem will never creep up .
On the other hand , never say never .
In pure tests like the ones above the effect works fine .
In real - world sites , where there 's plenty more CSS to confuse browsers , something will eventually go wrong somewhere .
Until we reach that point , though , this technique will do nicely .
The complete effect
For completeness ' sake , here 's the code you need :
div.container { border : 1 px solid # 000000 ; overflow : hidden ; width : 100 % ; } div.left { width : 45 % ; float : left ; } div.right { width : 45 % ; float : right ; }
