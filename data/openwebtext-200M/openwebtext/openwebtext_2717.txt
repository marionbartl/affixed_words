NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
It 's coming down to the wire for General Motors .
With GM rapidly burning through its cash reserves due to hefty losses amid an historic slump in auto sales , President Obama said the Treasury Department would give the automaker the cash it needs to continue operations on the condition that GM restructure its debt or file for bankruptcy by June 1 .
The automaker set a May 26 deadline for its bondholders to reach a restructuring agreement .
GM chief executive officer Fritz Henderson has repeatedly said that the difficulty in inking a deal makes a bankruptcy filing for the automaker " probable . "
A spokeswoman for GM said Friday the company continues to plan for a bankruptcy , which is the likely next step if no agreement is reached .
A deal with bondholders is one of the last major hurdles for GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) to clear in order to avoid bankruptcy .
GM has reached agreements with the United Auto Workers and Canadian Auto Workers unions that will allow the company to reduce some of its labor and retiree health care costs .
The Canadian deal was ratified by union members on Sunday ; the UAW vote is expected to be completed later this week .
Rival Chrysler , which has also received billions of dollars from the federal government , filed for bankruptcy last month despite reaching a deal with the UAW , after several bondholders held out of the restructuring agreement .
So if GM cannot work out a deal with bondholders , it could file for bankruptcy as early as some time next week .
Bondholders key to avoiding Chapter 11
Still , bankruptcy is not a done deal .
" In very hostile negotiations , most of the progress is made at the 11th hour , " said Edward Neiger , founder of Neiger LLP , a creditors ' rights and bankruptcy law firm .
" It 's very hard to predict what the outcome will be until the 11th hour , when the parties often realize the alternative is worse for both of them . "
To avoid bankruptcy , GM would need to convince the bondholders to accept a much reduced stake in the company .
GM 's proposal would give bondholders a 10 % stake in the automaker , even though they currently own about 40 % of the company 's debt .
The Treasury would get about a 50 % stake in GM .
Bondholders have issued a counteroffer that would give them a 58 % stake in the company .
The Treasury , however , would not receive any stake in GM , and the automaker would remain liable to pay back the money that the government has lent it .
Late Friday GM said it borrowed an additional $ 4 billion from the U.S. government making a total of $ 19.4 billion borrowed from the Treasury Department .
Under both plans , the UAW would receive about a 40 % stake in the company .
Henderson has suggested that it will be up to the government , not GM , to determine whether bondholders should get a better deal , but the government has not given any sign it will adjust its offer .
The Treasury has indicated it wants to protect the interest of the taxpayers who have given billions to the automaker .
A spokeswoman for the Treasury said Friday the government continues to work with all stakeholders to reach an agreement .
But Rep. Jeb Hensarling , R - Texas , wrote in a letter to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner Friday that more negotiations " must take place soon and at an expedited pace . "
" Bondholders must have a seat at the table during negotiations in how the company would be restructured .
The company , the government , the union and the bondholders should negotiate details of a reasonable debt - to - equity swap before stepping into court , " Hensarling wrote .
Bankruptcy would be bad for investors , suppliers and dealers
Should GM file for bankruptcy , the court will determine just what debts will be paid to various creditors .
Bondholders could end up with a better deal than GM 's offer , and many appear willing to take that gamble .
GM 's stockholders , however , would likely be cleaned out .
Although many GM shareholders have essentially been wiped out already .
The stock currently trades for about $ 1.40 a share , more than 90 % lower than year - ago levels .
Auto parts suppliers could also take a hit .
GM pays its parts makers an average of $ 2 billion a month .
The company would be able to pay some of the money it owes suppliers , but only those whom the court determines to be " critical vendors . "
The fate of many GM dealers could also be decided by a bankruptcy court .
GM notified 1,100 of the 6,000 dealerships in its network that it would be terminating their contracts next year .
Some of those dealers would likely close this year .
Some dealers are hopeful that state franchise laws could protect them from having to be shut down , but many legal experts have said that the dealers will face an uphill battle if GM actually does wind up filing for bankruptcy .

California Mendocino County Under Medical Marijuana Seige Now by Laurel Krause
Monday Feb 23rd , 2009 8:58 AM
On - going medical marijuana busts through - out Mendocino County have been arresting local residents daily .
I was one of five busts made and charged with two felonies ( cultivation and intent to sell / distribute ) last Friday , February 20 , 2009 , even though I had my doctor recommendation and was growing with the guidelines published at the Mendocino county web site .
My name is Laurel Krause .
Last Friday ( 2/20/09 ) as I looked out my kitchen window I was shocked to see 25 Mendocino County Sheriffs / Deputies coming through my gate very quickly .
The lead man , Sheriff ( do n't know deputy , or what class ) Jonathan Martin , showed me a search warrant , hand cuffed me and read me my rights .
I was cooperative ( I actually cried and begged for mercy , but that did n't work ) as they searched my home , my grow area on my five acres ( behind my locked gate - - so no probable cause ) and seized all grow equipment related to 24 medical marijuana plants in full bloom .
They chopped down the plants and hauled them away as I was being grilled and bullied in my home .
This number is significant because if you google the Mendocino County Sheriff 's web page on MedMari guidelines it says 25 plants .
You are probably aware of the ' fuzziness ' of these guidelines .
I have a recommendation from my doctor to allow me to grow med marijuana .
They charged me with two felony counts , one for marijuana cultivation and another for intent to sell / distribute , carted me to Ukiah , CA to jail in handcuffs .
It gets worse .
I was the # 4 bust of 5 that day ( Friday , Feb 20 ) and the guys let us know that they had five more for Saturday ( yesterday ) and five more on Sunday ( TODAY ! ) .
Not individuals , but actual grows that might arrest multiple people .
And most of the growers are women with kids ( so now the children are possibly being taken away and bank accounts frozen ) .
Real emotional and economic despair .
As I met others that were arrested in Ukiah , the county seat to jail ( never before , first offense for everything for me ) I learned they were my neighbors and not one had a ' commercial ' size grow .
So this Mendocino County Sheriff 's dept sweep is coming up short as the take is not producing the kind of busts they claim they are after ( i.e commercial , 500 plants & up ) , unenvironmental grows that scar the land ( we all grow organic ) , we all have our recommendations that we paid for and actually care about the quality of medicine we are growing ( it 's in the past for me now ) .
I am in shock , but then I started getting mad yesterday .
What is motivating this gestapo situation all of the sudden ?
DA Meredith Lintott or Sheriff Allman ?
NeoCons ?
I keep to myself mostly so did not hear about this happening all over the county of Mendocino .
Furthermore , most growers do n't let others know their business so as not to get busted .
I 'm coming forth as I have nothing to loose and I 'm not backing down .
I am a little afraid that if this does n't become a big story that I might be unsafe though .......... so bust this story wide open .
Help us in Mendo !!!
Since getting busted , I 've learned that they were up and down my street ( just outside Fort Bragg city limit , so in Mendocino County ) busting and getting this sweep in order over the last month and logging on the computer even ( wish I had known ! ) .
That they have also had busting sweeps in the towns of Covelo , Ukiah , Willits ....... all within Mendocino county .
I 'm sure you 're asking what is motivating me to come to you .
This is truly an American story of our time right now , a devestating economic massacre for us personally and it has county - wide ramifications as at least 70 % of the Mendocino economy is based on growing marijuana .
Maybe even California as it's the state 's largest crop .
During these times of extreme economic hardship and 10 % unemployment in Ft. Bragg , it just does n't make any sense to be busting and criminalizing tax - paying citizens , my neighbors and me operating within state and county guidelines .
We are considering moving forward with a class - action suit .
I have calls out .
I am sounding this alarms as far and wide as I can .
Please feel free to forward this to any of your interested colleagues .
I hope to hear from you .
Sincerely ,
Laurel Krause
All of this was very exciting and appealing to us young folks .
But , unfortunately , that is where the progress stopped .
In the 40 - plus years since Vatican II , society has evolved , and most Catholics I know have changed with the times .
A result is the large number of " cafeteria Catholics " , who pick and choose which doctrines they will follow and which they will ignore .
A cafeteria Catholic , for example , might faithfully attend Mass every Sunday , but also use birth control or regularly engage in premarital sex .
Indeed , a recent Gallup poll found that U.S. Catholics are more liberal than the general population on social issues like divorce and homosexuality .
The Church , however , refuses to evolve .
It 's still stuck at Vatican II , and is unlikely to progress any further under the very conservative man who currently occupies the papal throne .
The consequences ?
Surprisingly , the percentage of Americans who identify as Catholic has n't changed much in recent years .
But it has become tougher and tougher to recruit new priests .
And the priests they do recruit are kept on a short and bizarre kind of leash .
Celibacy is required , but child molestation is tolerated and covered up .
And so they lose the good priests .
In Miami , former Catholic priest Rev. Alberto Cutie ( who certainly is , by the way ) last week defected to the Episcopal Church amidst a scandal involving his love affair with a woman .
And , per the more reasonable Episcopalian standards of priestly conduct , Rev. Cutie will now marry the woman he loves .
After all , Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees that " [ m ] en and women of full age , without any limitation due to race , nationality or religion , have the right to marry and to found a family , " although the Catholic Church apparently disagrees .
And , late last year , Father Roy Bourgeois , a beloved human rights advocate , was excommunicated for participating in the ordination of a woman into the priesthood .
The Catholic Church , even with all its Virgin Mary worship , still apparently believes that women are somehow inferior .
Defections and transgressions like we 've seen in recent months by Fathers Cutie and Bourgeois are guaranteed to continue if the Church remains stubborn on progress .
And now , with millions of followers but so few priests to lead them , can the Church survive over the long term ?
Certainly not in its current form , I would think .
But then again , one little trip to the confessional can wipe away a lifetime of progressive conduct by a straying member of the flock .
And that keeps the so - called Catholics comfortably ensconced in an identity , and keeps the Catholic Church comfortably funded .

Introduction
The Ubuntu team is happy to bring you the latest and greatest software the Open Source community has to offer .
This is their latest result , the Ubuntu 9.10 Release Candidate , which brings a host of exciting new features .
Upgrading from Ubuntu 9.04
If you are upgrading from Ubuntu 9.04 , we have easy - to - follow upgrade instructions .
New features since Ubuntu 9.04
Upstart
As part of our boot performance work , we have now transitioned to Upstart native jobs , to let users get to their desktop faster after boot .
Upstart is written by Scott James Remnant .
Software Center
Ubuntu 9.10 RC includes the Ubuntu Software Center , developed by Michael Vogt , replacing ' Add / Remove ' in the Applications menu .
GNOME
Ubuntu 9.10 RC includes the latest GNOME 2.28 desktop environment with a number of great new features :
Empathy has replaced Pidgin as the default instant messaging client , introducing the Telepathy framework .
The gdm 2.28 login manager by William Jon Mc Cann is a complete rewrite compared to the version in earlier Ubuntu releases , permitting a more integrated login experience .
Evince , the GNOME document viewer , now ships with an enforcing AppArmor profile .
This greatly increases security by protecting you against flaws in the historically problematic PDF and image libraries .
Users who use a non-standard location for their home directory will need to adjust the home tunable in /etc/apparmor.d/tunables /home .
This profile has been developed by the Ubuntu Security team .
Ubuntu 9.10 translation status
Thanks to the efforts of the broad translations community around the globe , Ubuntu is available in the following 25 languages : Spanish , Brazilian Portuguese , French , Italian , Swedish , German , Hungarian , Simplified Chinese , English , Russian , Dutch , Japanese , Portuguese , Finnish , Danish , Catalan , Czech , Polish , Korean , Bulgarian , Greek , Slovenian , Traditional Chinese , Basque and Galician .
This list represents the languages which have achieved the target of what we consider a translated operating system .
However , Ubuntu is also available in many other languages with varying degrees of support , a big number of which are close to what we consider complete : Asturian , Serbian , Vietnamese , Estonian , Norwegian Bokmål , Bengali , Hebrew , Gujarati and Hindi .
You can see the full list of languages , along with their statistics at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Translations/ReleaseLanguages/9.10.
Application development with Quickly
Quickly , by Rick Spencer and Didier Roche , makes it easy for developers to make new applications for Ubuntu , and to share those application with other Ubuntu users via .deb packages or personal package archives .
Kubuntu
Kubuntu 9.10 includes the first Kubuntu Netbook release , Social from the Start and the latest KDE packages .
See the Kubuntu technical overview .
Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud Images
Ubuntu 9.10 RC includes images for common use on Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud ( UEC ) and Amazon 's EC2 .
You can try out the latest Ubuntu 9.10 server image instantly on EC2 using a preconfigured AMI , or download an image and put it into your own Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud .
For information on using UEC images on Amazon EC2 , see the EC2 Starter 's Guide .
Ubuntu One
Ubuntu 9.10 RC ships with Ubuntu One by default .
Ubuntu
One is your personal cloud .
You can use it to back up , store , sync and share your data with other Ubuntu One users .
Ubuntu
One gives all features and 2 GB of essential storage to everyone .
Synchronize files , contacts , and Tomboy notes across all of your Ubuntu computers and to the cloud .
More space is available with a monthly subscription .
Ubuntu
One project information is available on Launchpad .
Linux kernel 2.6.31
Ubuntu 9.10 RC includes the 2.6.31-14.48 kernel based on 2.6.31.1 .
The kernel ships with Kernel Mode Setting enabled for Intel graphics ( see below ) .
linux - restricted - modules is deprecated in favour of DKMS packages .
hal deprecation
Ubuntu 9.10 RC 's underlying technology for power management , laptop hotkeys , and handling of storage devices and cameras maps has moved from " hal " ( which is in the process of being deprecated ) to " Device Kit- power " , " Device Kit- disks " and " udev " .
New Intel video driver architecture
The Intel video driver has switched from the " EXA " acceleration method to the new " UXA " , solving major performance problems of Ubuntu 9.04 .
Ubuntu 9.10 RC also features kernel mode setting by default on Intel hardware , which reduces boot - time flickering and dramatically speeds up suspend / resume .
ext4 by default
The new " ext4 " filesystem is used by default for new installations with Ubuntu 9.10 RC ; of course , other filesystems are still available via the manual partitioner .
Existing filesystems will not be upgraded .
If you have full backups and are confident , you can upgrade an existing ext3 filesystem to ext4 by following directions in the Ext4 Howto .
( Note that the comments on that page at the time of writing about Ubuntu 's use of vol_id vs. blkid are out of date and are not applicable to Ubuntu 9.10 RC . )
Maximum performance will typically only be achieved on new filesystems , not on filesystems that have been upgraded from ext3 .
GRUB 2 by default
GRUB 2 is the default boot loader for new installations with Ubuntu 9.10 RC , replacing the previous GRUB " Legacy " boot loader .
Existing systems will not be upgraded to GRUB 2 at this time , as automatically reinstalling the boot loader is an inherently risky operation .
If you wish to upgrade your system to GRUB 2 , then see the GRUB 2 testing page for instructions .
See also the upstream draft manual .
Some features are still missing relative to GRUB Legacy .
Notable among these are lock / password support , an equivalent of grub - reboot , and Xen handling .
iSCSI installation
The iSCSI installation process has been improved , and no longer requires iscsi=true as a boot parameter ; the installer will offer you the option of logging into iSCSI targets if there are no local disks , or you can select " Configure iSCSI " in the manual partitioner .
Putting the root filesystem on iSCSI is now supported .
AppArmor
AppArmor in Ubuntu 9.10 RC features an improved parser that uses cache files , greatly speeding up App Armor initialisation on boot .
App Armor also now supports ' pux ' which , when specified , means a process can transition to an existing profile if one exists or simply run unconfined if one does not .
Please see the AppArmor documentation for information on using App Armor in Ubuntu .
New profiles
In addition to the above changes to App Armor itself , several profiles were added .
Enforcing profiles for ntpd , evince , and libvirt are enabled by default .
Complain mode profiles for Dovecot are now available in the apparmor - profiles package .
A new profile is provided for Firefox as well , though it is disabled by default .
Users can enable App Armor sandboxing of their browser by running :
$ sudo aa- enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.firefox-3.5
This profile can be disabled again by performing :
$ sudo apparmor_parser - R /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.firefox-3.5 $ sudo ln -s /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.firefox-3.5 /etc/apparmor.d/disable/usr.bin.firefox-3.5
An App Armor profile is now available for Apache in the libapache2 - mod - apparmor package .
When used in combination with the mod_apparmor Apache module , web applications can now be protected and isolated from each other .
Instructions for enabling the profile are in the /etc/apparmor.d/usr.lib.apache2.mpm-prefork.apache2 file .
Please see the SecurityTeam / KnowledgeBase for a full listing of readily available profiles in Ubuntu .
Libvirt
Libvirt now contains App Armor integration when using KVM or QEMU .
Libvirtd is configured to launch virtual machines that are confined by uniquely restrictive App Armor profiles .
This feature significantly improves virtualisation in Ubuntu by providing user - space host protection as well as guest isolation .
Uncomplicated Firewall
The Uncomplicated Firewall now has support for filtering by interface and egress filtering when using the ufw command .
Documentation for ufw is also improved to help users better utilise the ufw framework and take full advantage of Linux netfilter 's power and flexibility .
See UbuntuFirewall #Features for a full list of features .
Non-eXecutable Emulation
Non-eXecutable ( NX ) memory protection , also known as eXecute - Disable ( XD ) , has always been available in Ubuntu for any systems that had the hardware to support it and ran the 64 - bit kernel or the 32 - bit server kernel .
The 32 - bit PAE desktop kernel ( linux - image - generic - pae ) now also provides the PAE mode needed for hardware with the NX CPU feature .
For systems that lack NX hardware , the 32 - bit kernels now provide an approximation of the NX CPU feature via software emulation that can help block many exploits an attacker might run from stack or heap memory .
Blocking Module Loading
To block the loading of any further modules after boot ( generally for servers with unchanging hardware ) , the / proc / sys / kernel / modules_disabled one - way sysctl flag now exists to add another layer of protections against attackers loading kernel rootkits .
Position - Independent Executables
Building on the work done in Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04 to proactively protect Ubuntu from unknown threats by using strict compiler flags , more applications have been built as Position - Independent Executables ( PIE ) to take advantage of the Address Space Layout Randomisation ( ASLR ) available in the Ubuntu kernel .
In addition to the growing program list , PIE programs are now also built with the BIND_NOW linker flag to take full advantage of the existing RELRO linker flag .
This results in PIE programs having fewer places in their memory that can be controlled to redirect program flow when an attacker attempts memory - corruption exploits .
New input method framework
Ubuntu has switched to IBus as preferred input method framework .
Unlike the previously used SCIM , IBus is under active development and fixes a number of SCIM 's design limitations .
The language selector tool now gives the user the possibility to select the preferred input method framework .
Language - selector improvements
Chinese language - packs , formerly containing both Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese translations , have been split into separate packages for these languages .
This reduces the amount of data Chinese users need to download .
The language - support - extra and language - support - translations metapackages have been removed from the archive .
Packages which provide additional translations for applications such as Thunderbird or OpenOffice.org are now installed by language - selector only if the application package is already installed on the system .
In Ubuntu 9.10 it is necessary to run language - selector manually to get the missing localisation packages installed .
An automatic solution for this is planned for the next Ubuntu release .
Known issues
For a full list of errata for Ubuntu 9.10 , please see the Ubuntu 9.10 release notes .
( CNN ) -- South Carolina authorities have located a 555 - pound teenager and his mother , who faces a charge of violating a custody order , police said Thursday .
Alexander Deundray Draper , 14 , " is possibly at a stage of critical health risk , " social services said .
Alexander Deundray Draper , 14 , of Travelers Rest , South Carolina , and his mother , Jerri Althea Gray , were located at about 4:30 p.m. near a laundromat in Baltimore , Maryland , by the Baltimore County Sheriff 's Office , said Matt Armstrong , a spokesman for the Greenville County Sheriff 's Office in Greenville , South Carolina .
" Draper was checked out by EMS [ Emergency Medical Services ] personnel and turned over to the Maryland Department of Social Services , " Armstrong said .
The South Carolina Department of Social Services will work with its Maryland counterpart to have the boy returned to South Carolina , he told CNN affiliate WYFF .
The mother is being held in a detention center and will be extradited to South Carolina on an outstanding warrant , he said .
Watch report on finding teen and his mother »
" The understanding was that the individual was of the weight where it was decided by medical authorities that he needed treatment that was not being provided for by his mother , " Armstrong said .
Earlier in the day officials said the boy " is possibly at a stage of critical health risk . "
Gray was supposed to appear in family court Tuesday with her son and failed to do so , the sheriff 's office said .
During the family court hearing , the boy was ordered into state custody because of medical neglect , as well as his mother 's failure to appear .
The Department of Social Services then contacted the sheriff 's office , authorities said .
The warrant said Gray was served with papers Monday and told to report to court for a hearing in which the department would seek state custody of Draper .
" The defendant has avoided the custody proceeding and has concealed the child , " the warrant says .
Travelers Rest is about 10 miles north of Greenville , South Carolina .

All About Greenville
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) -- Controversial unmanned aircraft strikes against targets in Pakistan 's restive tribal region are not working , the country 's prime minister has told the Obama administration 's point man for the region .
Drone strikes are unpopular among many in the region because of the threat to civilians .
" Continued drone attacks in FATA have proved counterproductive and have seriously impeded Pakistan 's efforts towards rooting out militancy and terrorism from that area , " Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani told Ambassador Richard Holbrooke on Wednesday , according to a press release from Gilani 's office about their meeting .
FATA is the semi-autonomous Federally Administered Tribal Areas .
Delegations for Holbrooke , the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan , and Gilani met at the prime minister 's house in Islamabad on Wednesday morning .
Pakistani military forces have been conducting an offensive against the Taliban in North West Frontier Province and have targeted insurgents in the adjacent tribal region .
U.S. - led forces fighting Taliban militants in Afghanistan are thought to have conducted drone strikes against those targets over the border in Pakistan 's tribal region .
The strikes have been unpopular among many in the region because of the threat to civilians .
Pakistan has said such attacks have claimed hundreds of civilian lives .
The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported drone attacks .
However , the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones , which are controlled remotely .
The news release said Gilani told Holbrooke that United States " should share real time , credible and actionable intelligence , " and provide " unarmed vehicle technology , " and " immediate supply of much - needed equipment and ammunition to Pakistan 's armed forces " to ensure a " successful completion of its operation against militants . "
The pair also discussed the dislocation and widespread damage in the war - torn North West Frontier Province .
Gilani called for the United States and other countries to help Pakistan rebuild and urged the Obama administration to speed up the passage of proposed legislation that would help the country .
Any comment from Holbrooke on the issue was not mentioned in the press release .
But Holbrooke is cited as praising Pakistan 's fight against the militants and is working on getting the key legislation adopted .
He said the United States would provide funds for reconstruction and help for dislocated residents .
He said the United States would help other countries to contribute .

Simplifying CSS Selectors
This post is based on a chapter from Even Faster Web Sites , the follow - up to High Performance Web Sites .
Posts in this series include : chapters and contributing authors , Splitting the Initial Payload , Loading Scripts Without Blocking , Coupling Asynchronous Scripts , Positioning Inline Scripts , Sharding Dominant Domains , Flushing the Document Early , Using Iframes Sparingly , and Simplifying CSS Selectors .
“ Simplifying CSS Selectors ” is the last chapter in my next book .
My investigation into CSS selector performance is therefore fairly recent .
A few months ago , I wrote a blog post about the Performance Impact of CSS Selectors .
It talks about the different types of CSS selectors , which ones are hypothesized to be the most painful , and how the impact of selector matching might be overestimated .
It concludes with this hypothesis :
For most web sites , the possible performance gains from optimizing CSS selectors will be small , and are not worth the costs .
There are some types of CSS rules and interactions with JavaScript that can make a page noticeably slower .
This is where the focus should be .
I received a lot of feedback about situations where CSS selectors do make web pages noticeably slower .
Looking for a common theme across these slow CSS test cases led me to this revelation from David Hyatt ’s article on Writing Efficient CSS for use in the Mozilla UI :
The style system matches a rule by starting with the rightmost selector and moving to the left through the rule ’s selectors .
As long as your little subtree continues to check out , the style system will continue moving to the left until it either matches the rule or bails out because of a mismatch .
This illuminates where our optimization efforts should be focused : on CSS selectors that have a rightmost selector that matches a large number of elements in the page .
The experiments from my previous blog post contain some CSS selectors that look expensive , but when examined in this new light we realize really are n’t worth worrying about , for example , DIV DIV DIV P A.class0007 {} .
This selector has five levels of descendent matching that must be performed .
This sounds complex .
But when we look at the rightmost selector , A.class0007 , we realize that there ’s only one element in the entire page that the browser has to match against .
The key to optimizing CSS selectors is to focus on the rightmost selector , also called the key selector ( coincidence ? ) .
Here ’s a much more expensive selector : A.class0007 * {} .
Although this selector might look simpler , it ’s more expensive for the browser to match .
Because the browser moves right to left , it starts by checking all the elements that match the key selector , “ * “ .
This means the browser must try to match this selector against all elements in the page .
This chart shows the difference in load times for the test page using this universal selector compared with the previous descendant selector test page .
Load time difference for universal selector
It ’s clear that CSS selectors with a key selector that matches many elements can noticeably slow down web pages .
Other examples of CSS selectors where the key selector might create a lot of work for the browser include :
A.class0007 DIV {} #id0007 > A {} .class0007 [ href ] {} DIV : first - child {}
Not all CSS selectors hurt performance , even those that might look expensive .
The key is focusing on CSS selectors with a wide - matching key selector .
This becomes even more important for Web 2.0 applications where the number of DOM elements , CSS rules , and page reflows are even higher .
The state 's highest court has n't reached a decision but election law experts agree : Norm Coleman does n’t have a prayer .

All but over for Coleman , experts say
Seven months after Minnesota 's Senate election , the state 's highest court has n't reached a decision but election law experts agree : Norm Coleman does n’t have a prayer .
These experts see almost no chance Coleman 's lawyers will prevail in their appeal to the state ’s high court to count more ballots in a bid to erase Al Franken ’s slim lead .

Peter Knapp , a professor at William Mitchell College of Law in St. Paul , pointed to the court 's oral arguments on Monday , when the justices expressed skepticism toward Coleman ’s lawyer , Joe Friedberg .
“ Each of the five justices asked some questions that seemed to hone in on the absence of evidence , " said Knapp , an expert on the Minnesota Supreme Court who has kept a close eye on the case .
" And when each of the five are asking those questions , that ’s significant . ”
He cautioned that “ it ’s really easy to over - read the judges ' questions as a sign of the way they ’re leaning , ” but added : “ That being said , if I had to put money on the outcome – my money would be on Franken . ”
Edward B. Foley , an election law expert at the Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University , agreed : “ Based on the questioning , I ’d be surprised if Coleman got a remand back to the trial court . ”
Foley said that Coleman ’s lawyers “ always had a fighting chance ” based on legal theory — but , he pointed out , “ having a valid legal theory is not enough to win a lawsuit . ”
He and other legal scholars interviewed by POLITICO said that that the facts were simply not on Coleman ’s side .
Friedberg ’s task this week was to convince the justices of his contention that more than 4,000 additional absentee ballots should be included in the final vote tally because they had not been handled in the same way by every county .
The legal wrangling has stretched on since January and in his appeal to the state high court , Coleman , a Republican , contended that the decision in April of a three - judge panel that ruled Franken won the election by just over 300 votes should be overturned .
In an article posted on his Web site after watching the oral arguments , Foley noted that Coleman might end up losing the appeal not because his case lacked merit , but instead because his legal team failed to muster enough hard proof to “ show which specific ballots were wrongly treated by local election officials . ”

At one point on Monday , Associate Justice Christopher Dietzen , who was appointed to the court last year by Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty , complained to Friedberg that he was offering “ no concrete evidence ” to back up his theories .
Guy - Uriel Charles , a Duke University professor who specializes in election law , said that he had not talked to any colleagues in the legal community who had made a convincing argument that Coleman could win his appeal .
“ It ’s not that Coleman has n’t raised important questions , ” Charles said .
“ If it is true that counties are interpreting the absentee ballot rules differently because of differential resources , that ’s a question the legislature should address , but I do not think that ’s a question the courts could address after the fact . ”
He added , “ Generally , election law is not terribly conducive to broad fishing expeditions . ”
Robert Bennett , who has taught constitutional law at Northwestern University since 1969 , said that the odds were slim Coleman would be successful with members of the court , who are expected to reach a decision in the next few weeks .
“ There will always come a point when the judges have to say enough is enough , ” Bennett said .
“ And it sounds to me like they think enough has been done to make this a respectable recount and doing more just does n’t make a lot of sense . ”
In his live - blog of the oral arguments , professor Rick Hasen , an election law expert at Loyola Law School in southern California , wrote that there is “ good reason here to believe that the state Supreme Court Justices went into this with their minds made up ” – and that ’s bad news for Coleman .
Hasen , who moderates an election law list - serve with 800 subscribers , said that not one of his members had volunteered a scenario or prediction about how Coleman could win the case .
The only chatter this week , he said , focused on the shortcomings of the Republican ’s legal case .
Coleman 's lawyers " did the best they could with what they had to work with , ” said Hasen .
“ Coleman just ended up on the short end of the sick . ”
Other legal experts said that the court ’s ruling may even foreclose the possibility that Coleman could appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court .
Raleigh Levine , a professor at William Mitchell College of Law , watched Monday ’s oral argument with her colleague , Professor Knapp .
Like other observers of the Coleman - Franken fight , she said that the justices seemed to be sending a clear message that the Coleman team had failed to present enough facts to back up their claims about the handling of absentee ballots .
“ If that is the basis on which the court makes its decision , to a large extent it insulates the case from the U.S. Supreme Court , ” Levine said .
“ If the factual premise is accepted then you have to wrestle with the Constitutional argument , but if he has n’t even established that , there ’s nothing really for the U.S. Supreme Court to do . ”
May 16 , 2009  -- Scientists say a 47 - million - year - old fossil found in Germany may be a key link to explain the evolution of early primates , and , ultimately , modern human beings .
The fossil , of a young female that probably resembled a modern - day lemur , is described as " the most complete primate fossil ever found . "
It is small -- with a body about the size of a raccoon -- but it has characteristics found in later primates and in humans .
It has , among other things , opposable thumbs , similar to humans ' and unlike those found on other modern mammals .
It has fingernails instead of claws .
And by examining the structure of its hind legs ( one of which is partly missing ) , scientists say they can see evidence of evolutionary changes that would eventually lead to primates standing upright .
Remains From a German Caldera
The find is being published next week in the online journal Public Library of Science - One ( PLoS One for short ) .
The cable channel History , which bought the North American documentary rights to the find , provided exclusive details to ABC News .
" She is a transitional species showing characteristics from both the non-human ( prosimians and lemurs ) and human ( anthropoids , monkeys , apes and man ) evolutionary lines , " said the producers in a statement reviewed by the authors of the PLoS One paper .
It was discovered by amateur fossil hunters in 1983 in a mile - wide crater called the Messel Shale Pit , not far from Frankfurt .
Scientists speculate that at one time the pit was a volcanic caldera , where animals got caught and their remains unusually were well preserved .
The amateurs recognized that they had a very good fossil , but they did not recognize its potential importance .
The location , a UNESCO World Heritage Site , has been the source of many other fossils from the Eocene Period , about 50 million years ago .
The fossil was shown by collectors to Dr. Jorn Hurum of the University of Oslo , who brought in colleagues from Oslo and from the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt to authenticate the find .
They bought the specimen so that it would not disappear into private hands .
Examination of the fossil went on for two years .
They have called the specimen Darwinius masillae .
The researchers were able to keep their work secret until word leaked out in the last week .
Fossil May Be Evolution ' Link '
Hurum 's team said 98 percent of the fossil 's skeleton appears intact .
It has a long , curling tail .
X - rays show it was young ; it had baby teeth and , beneath them , adult teeth forming to replace them .
There also was evidence that the animal had once broken its wrist .
Evolution Debate
It is hard to say what the find may do to the modern understanding of evolution .
The fossil , for one thing , is far older than any of the human ancestors other scientists have reported finding in what is now eastern Africa .
" Lucy , " probably the best - known African fossil that is generally accepted as pre-human , is somewhat more than three million years old .
This year happens to be the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin , originator of the theory of evolution by means of natural selection .
Most scientists , following Darwin , believe that humans and modern apes had common ancestors , but the fossil record has had gaps in it .
The fossil is to be unveiled Tuesday , when the paper is published in PLoS One and a news conference takes place in New York .
The fossil will be shown on " Good Morning America " to coincide with the announcement .
History plans to air its two - hour documentary , titled " The Link , " on Monday , May 25 .
Photographic Treasure Trove What East Germany Was Really Like
They wanted to clean up the basement but found a treasure trove of photos instead .
After Berlin teacher Manfred Beier died , his sons stumbled across 60,000 pictures .
Their father , it turns out , created one of the best documentations of life in East Germany , and the first days of the West .
Federal Felony To Use Blogs , the Web , Etc. To Cause Substantial Emotional Distress Through " Severe , Repeated , and Hostile " Speech ?
That 's what a House of Representatives bill , proposed by Rep. Linda T. Sanchez and 14 others , would do .
Here 's the relevant text :
Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication , with the intent to coerce , intimidate , harass , or cause substantial emotional distress to a person , using electronic means to support severe , repeated , and hostile behavior , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years , or both .... [ " Communication " ] means the electronic transmission , between or among points specified by the user , of information of the user 's choosing , without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received ; ... [ " Electronic means " ] means any equipment dependent on electrical power to access an information service , including email , instant messaging , blogs , websites , telephones , and text messages .
1 . I try to coerce a politician into voting a particular way , by repeatedly blogging ( using a hostile tone ) about what a hypocrite / campaign promise breaker / fool / etc .
he would be if he voted the other way .
I am transmitting in interstate commerce a communication with the intent to coerce using electronic means ( a blog ) " to support severe , repeated , and hostile behavior " -- unless , of course , my statements are n't seen as " severe , " a term that is entirely undefined and unclear .
Result : I am a felon , unless somehow my " behavior " is n't " severe . "
2 . A newspaper reporter or editorialist tries to do the same , in columns that are posted on the newspaper 's Web site .
Result : Felony , unless somehow my " behavior " is n't severe .
3 . The politician votes the wrong way .
I think that 's an evil , tyrannical vote , so I repeatedly and harshly condemn the politician on my blog , hoping that he 'll get very upset ( and rightly so , since I think he deserves to feel ashamed of himself , and loathed by others ) .
I am transmitting a communication with the the intent to cause substantial emotional distress , using electronic means ( a blog ) " to support severe , repeated , and hostile behavior . "
( I might also be said to be intending to " harass " -- who knows , given how vague the term is ? -- but the result is the same even if we set that aside . )
Result : I am a felon , subject to the usual utter uncertainty about what " severe " means .
4 . A company delivers me shoddy goods , and refuses to refund my money .
I e-mail it several times , threatening to sue if they do n't give me a refund , and I use " hostile " language .
I am transmitting a communication with the intent to coerce , using electronic means " to support severe , repeated , and hostile behavior . "
Result : I am a felon , if my behavior is " severe . "
5 . Several people use blogs or Web - based newspaper articles to organize a boycott of a company , hoping to get it to change some policy they disapprove of .
They are transmitting communications with the intent to coerce , using electronic means " to support severe , repeated , and hostile behavior . "
Result :
Those people are a felon .
( Is n't threatening a company with possible massive losses " severe " ?
But again , who knows ? )
6. John cheats on Mary .
Mary wants
John to feel like the scumbag that he is , so she sends him two hostile messages telling him how much he 's hurt her , how much she now hates him , and how bad he should feel .
She does n't threaten him with violence ( there are separate laws barring that , and this law would apply even in the absence of a threat ) .
She is transmitting communications with the intent to cause substantial emotional distress , using electronic means " to support severe , repeated , and hostile behavior . "
Result : Mary is a felon , again if her behavior is " severe . "
The examples could be multiplied pretty much indefinitely .
The law , if enacted , would clearly be facially overbroad ( and probably unconstitutionally vague ) , and would thus be struck down on its face under the First Amendment .
But beyond that , surely even the law 's supporters do n't really want to cover all this speech .
What are Rep. Linda Sanchez and the others thinking here ?
Are they just taking the view that " criminalize it all , let the prosecutors sort it out " ?
Even if that 's so , wo n't their work amount to nothing , if the law is struck down as facially overbroad -- as I 'm pretty certain it would be ?
Or are they just trying to score political points here with their constituents , with little regard to whether the law will actually do any good ?
I try to focus my posts mostly on what people do , not on their motives , but here the drafting is so shoddy that I just wonder why this happened .
DURING his career as a cocaworkers ' leader , Evo Morales took part in hunger strikes on 18 occasions .
Then he was elected as Bolivia 's president .
So it came as a surprise when just before Easter he unrolled his mattress on the floor of an ornate state room in the presidential palace and began a five - day political fast , fortified by chewing coca leaves .
This time the object of his gesture was not to change government policy but to implement it .
In January Mr Morales won a referendum approving a new constitution inspired by his Movement to Socialism ( MAS ) .
This calls for a fresh election on December 6th , in which the president hopes to win a second term .
But the opposition , which controls the Senate , was holding up the requisite electoral law , because the government refused to agree to a new electoral register .
The need for this was stressed by a European Union mission which observed the referendum .
The opposition fears that a government programme to give identity cards to Bolivians who lack them was abused to swell the government 's vote in rural areas .
When the president of the electoral court said there was no time to organise a new register , the opposition walked out , leaving Congress inquorate , and prompting Mr Morales to begin his fast .

President and protester - in- chief
But it was the government , not the opposition , which gave ground .
The court decided that a new electoral roll with biometric data could indeed be ready in time .
The government agreed to find the $ 35 m this may cost .
For the first time it will include many of the 2 m Bolivians who have migrated abroad .
The government retreated , too , on earlier talk of earmarking up to three dozen seats in the new , 121 - seat lower house of Congress for candidates of indigenous descent , to be chosen in special electoral districts .
It was unclear whether this would allow certain Bolivians to vote twice .
Even some in the MAS had reservations .
There will now be only seven such seats .
Mr Morales remains popular , thanks to his championing of indigenous Bolivians and his nationalisation of the natural - gas industry , which has boosted the government 's finances .
He seems assured of a second term .
But the opposition reckons that in a fair vote it will deprive him of a strong majority in the new Congress .
Despite Mr Morales 's hunger strike , its prospects of doing so have improved .
Military Torture , Legal Fig Leaves & Premature Exculpation ...
Ernest A. Canning Byon 5/6/2009 , 12:07 pm PT
Guest Blogged by Ernest A. Canning
" When any modern state tortures even a few victims , the stigma compromises its majesty and corrupts its integrity .
Its officials must spin an ever more complex web of lies that , in the end , weakens the bonds of trust and the rule of law that are the sine qua non of a democracy .
And , beyond its borders , allies and enemies turn away in collective revulsion . "
- Prof. Alfred W. McCoy , A Question of Torture ( 2006 ) .
Truth and justice are essential components of democracy and the rule of law .
We cannot move forward unless we honestly examine our past .
Accuracy is vital to every decision we make , be it impeachment , prosecution or a restoration of our nation ’s honor and integrity .
This is the first in a five - part series of articles which will strive to correct misperceptions arising from the erroneous blending of military and CIA torture .
This task has become especially relevant now that the Justice Department 's the Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) , the very section which had issued the torture memos , tasked by former Attorney General Michael Mukasey with investigating itself , has now released a recommendation that none of the authors of the torture memos be prosecuted .
This recommendation stands in stark contrast to our nation 's post - World War II decision to prosecute German judges for war crimes at Nuremberg .
Part I addresses the relatively public involvement of the U.S. military and private contractors at Guantanamo , Afghanistan and Iraq .
It will dispel the notion that the Bush White House sought out independent legal opinions from the OLC before deciding to torture .
Part II will discuss the CIA 's dark beginnings , including its recruitment of former Nazis , its devotion to covert " psychological operations " as a founding principle , the experiments on unwitting subjects that were part of a maniacal quest to crack the code of human consciousness , and the scientific studies that led to KUBARK , the CIA 's torture manual .
Part III provides a vital historical account of CIA torture applied by surrogates in developing nations as a component of empire , an account that belies the suggestion made by the The New York Times that CIA torture first arose as an aftermath of 9/11 .
Part 's IV and V will address the CIA 's involvement in extraordinary rendition and an ultra-secret system of “ black - sites ” into which “ ghost detainees ” would disappear .
It will show how the techniques used on " ghost detainees " are the culmination of a half - century of CIA research and practices ...
Military Torture
The 263 - page Senate Armed Services Committee Report [ PDF ] ( the “ Levin Report ” ) , whose release was inexplicably delayed from its Nov. 20 , 2008 completion to April 22 , 2009 , tracks the military ’s involvement * in torture .
It reveals that in December 2001 , more than a month prior to the issuance of a Feb.
7 , 2002 Presidential memorandum , erroneously ** declaring that the Geneva Convention 's proscriptions on torture did not apply to al Qaeda and Taliban detainees , the DoD ’s Office of General Counsel “ solicited information on detainee " exploitation " from the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency ( JPRA ) , the “ agency that oversees military Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape ( SERE ) training , ” whose techniques are [ emphasis added ] “ based , in part , on Chinese Communist techniques used during the Korean war to elicit false confessions . ”
In the SERE program U.S. military personnel , under careful medical controls , are taught to resist unlawful interrogation practices ( aka torture ) .
SERE techniques include forced nudity , stress positions , hooding , sleep disruption , loud music and flashing lights , exposure to extreme temperatures , face and body slaps and , in the Navy 's SERE school , waterboarding .
The Levin Report discusses how SERE techniques were “ reverse engineered ” for use at Guantanamo , by the U.S. .
This was approved at the highest levels of the Bush / Cheney cabal , *** despite multiple legal memoranda from all branches of the armed forces challenging its legality and despite a July 2002 JAPRA memo which noted that aside from its “ myriad legal , ethical , or moral implications , ” torture produces unreliable intelligence .
The Levin report reflects modification of the SERE techniques to exploit fear , such as the use of vicious dogs .
Levin includes an historical account of how these modified and reverse engineered SERE techniques migrated from Guantanamo to Afghanistan and Iraq .
The Levin report contains neither an in - depth analysis of the CIA history and application of torture nor the CIA ’s role in extraordinary rendition and methods that were exclusive to “ ghost detainees . ”
Levin does not address the role of private contractors , like CACI International Inc. and Titan Corp. ( now L - 3 Services ) , named in lawsuits brought by the Center for Constitutional Rights ( " CCR " ) , Al Shimari v. CACI and Saleh v. Titan .
The CCR alleges the companies engaged in torture while providing interrogation and translation services at Abu Ghraib .

Legal Fig-Leaves
President Obama ’s initial rush to shield CIA torturers on the basis of their supposed reliance on the quasi-legal memos overlooked a critical issue , now partially resolved by a newly released summary [ PDF ] sent by Sen.
John D. Rockefeller , IV to Attorney General Eric Holder for a declassification review .
It reveals that Abu Zubayda was “ badly injured in the firefight that brought him into custody ” in March 2002 ; that he was initially interrogated by FBI agents while receiving medical care ; that contacts in which the CIA sought NSC approval for application of its torture techniques began in April 2002 and that the National Security Advisor authorized application of CIA torture techniques , “ subject to a determination of legality by ” the OLC .*
The Levin Report reflects that the torture memos were issued by the OLC ’s Jay Bybee only “ after consultation with senior Administration attorneys , including then White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and then - Counsel to the Vice President David Addington . ”
This seemingly innocuous notation says a great deal .
As revealed by Jane Mayer ’s July 3 , 2006 New Yorker article , " The Hidden Power , ” the former Vice President and his chief legal counsel ( who later became Cheney 's chief of staff ) , David Addington were the driving force behind the Bush regime 's unprecedented claims of dictatorial executive powers .
Addington , a man described by Lawrence Wilkerson , Secretary of State Colin Powell ’s former assistant , as “ utterly ruthless , ” began his government career as assistant CIA general counsel where he aided William Casey ’s resistance to Congressional oversight .
He served as a staff attorney on the U.S. House / Senate select committee investigating the Iran / Contra scandal , assisting Congressman Richard Cheney in preparation of the Iran - Contra Minority Report .
Although the scandal produced 17 felony convictions , the Minority Report , Mayer observes , made the “ outlandish ” claim it was “ Congress --- not the President --- [ which ] had overstepped its authority , by encroaching on the President ’s foreign - policy powers . ”
According to Mayer , Addington dominated the agenda .
She quoted an administration source : “ ’ If you ’re not sufficiently ideological , he would cut the ground out from under you . ’”
Former Pentagon lawyer Richard Schriffrin described a tense multi-agency White House meeting in which Addington would simply dismiss them .
“ He did n’t recognize the wisdom of the other lawyers .
He was always right ... He knew the answers ... If you favored international law , you were in danger of being called ‘ soft on terrorism . ’ ”
Mayer said a number of “ talented top lawyers who challenged Addington ... left the Administration under stressful circumstances . ”
As we observed previously in " Prosecute or Perish , " Addington was well aware that innocents were being held at Guantanamo .
He did n’t care .
" Torture is n’t important to Addington as a scientific matter , good or bad , or whether it works or not , ” the Administration lawyer , who is familiar with these debates [ told Mayer ] .
" It ’s more about his philosophy of Presidential power .
He thinks that if the President wants torture he should get torture .
He always argued for ' maximum flexibility ' . "
Addington , Bybee and DoD General Counsel William J. Haynes were included amongst the six Bush administration attorneys who were targeted by Spanish prosecutors in the war crimes complaint they filed with Judge Baltasar Garzón .
The Levin Report reveals that Haynes quashed a review by “ then - Captain ( now Rear Admiral ) Jane Dalton , Legal Counsel to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ” which “ discussed the military services ' concerns ” about application of reverse engineered , SERE techniques to detainees .
The evidence is compelling .
The President and Vice President wanted torture .
They had no intention to leave little matters like international and federal laws forbidding torture to stand in the way .
The notion that they relied on legal opinions from an independent OLC is a farce .
Any doubts about that were conclusively resolved when the White House sought to collect and destroy all copies of a dissenting legal memo from former State Department attorney Philip Zelikow .
_____
Premature Exculpation
In his haste to evade his obligation to faithfully execute the law with respect to those who supposedly relied upon the OLC legal opinions , President Obama not only ignored the long history of CIA torture that will be addressed in subsequent articles , but the significant issue of whether , in terms of the Bush regime 's so - called " war on terror , " the CIA was already engaged in torture and sought the OLC opinions as a retroactive justification for crimes already committed .
Where the Aug. 2002 Bybee torture memo suggests that the CIA was seeking OLC approval " before " it tortured Abu Zubaydah , there is reliable evidence that Abu Zubaydah was subjected to torture long before Bybee conjured his now infamous memos .
Abu Zubaydah initially cooperated with FBI agents , one of whom tended to his wounds .
But the CIA , which would later destroy some 92 interrogation tapes , insisted on taking over the interrogation .
After Zubaydah was transferred to a CIA black site , the two FBI agents complained about " brutal tactics . "
They were told the tactics had been approved " at the highest level . "
It is likely that Zubaydah was not the first Bush - era victim of CIA torture .
In 2001 John Walker Lindh , “ The American Taliban , ” was captured by the Northern Alliance and taken to a courtyard inside a Northern Alliance fort where he was “ brutally ” questioned by two CIA agents .
This sparked a riot that resulted in the death of the CIA ’s Michael Spann .
Recaptured , Lindh was transferred to Bagram Airbase , by which time he was “ dehydrated , starving , and suffering from a festering bullet wound in his leg . ”
He was then “ duct - taped to a gurney , blindfolded with tape , and left in a dark , sealed , unheated metal shipping container … .
His leg was left untreated for days .
Allegedly tortured …he was repeatedly threatened with death and …when he asked for a lawyer , ” Lindh was told “ nobody knows you ’re here . ”
He “ cracked and signed a confession . ” D. Lindorf & B . Olashansky , The Case for Impeachment ( 2006 )
Lindorf & Olshansky reveal that , after his return to the US , Lindh ’s family hired attorney James Brosnahan , who moved to suppress the confession , seeking to call as witnesses both soldiers from Bagram and Guantanamo detainees .
Faced with possible revelations of CIA torture , Michael Chertoff , then the head of the Justice Department ’s criminal division , offered a plea arrangement in which the government would drop the terrorism , attempted murder and conspiracy to kill Americans charges if Lindh would plead guilty to the charges of providing assistance to a banned country and carrying a weapon .
Chertoff 's offer required that Lindh “ sign a letter saying he had ‘ never been mistreated . ’”**
Lindh accepted

Australia 's South Asian community has promised to continue protests Indian students in Australia have vowed to fight back against a series of callous attacks they have blamed on racists .
Furious demonstrators have rallied in Sydney and Melbourne , where dozens of assaults have been reported in the past year .
" People got stabbed in their houses , on train stations , on the street and there were petrol bombs thrown on people 's cars , " said Gautam Gupta , the founder of the Federation of Indian Students of Australia .
He accused the authorities of being " too slow " to respond to the violence .
" We have no reason to believe they are not racist attacks , " Mr Gupta told the BBC .
" Whenever they are attacking they always use the words ' Indians , go back ' , " he said .
" It would be insulting to all the good people of Australia to say the country is racist .
There are racist elements and we will fight with them . "
The federation is organising self - defence classes for worried students and , in at least one case , there has been violent retaliation , where rough justice has been meted out to those suspected of targeting young Indians .
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has warned against vigilante action , and , while deploring the abuse of foreign students , he said it was " equally unacceptable for so - called reprisal attacks " .
Diplomatic tension
In Melbourne , home to many of the 90,000 Indians who are studying in Australia , the police will intensify patrols at known trouble - spots , including a dozen train stations .
The retaliation attack got me a bit concerned because something like that can easily spiral into something a lot more serious
Ranjinee Dey , student Senior commanders have insisted the beefed - up response is driven by crime in general , and not only the muggings and beatings of international students .
Australian authorities have conceded that some of the attacks on Indian expatriates were fuelled by racial prejudice .
But there is an official belief that most are the work of opportunistic criminals preying on easy targets , who often travel alone on public transport after dark .
" I think it would break the heart of any Australian to see an Indian student who has come to this country to get a good education the subject of a violent attack , " said Julia Gillard , Australia 's Welsh - born deputy prime minister .
Indian newspaper editor Raj P Dudeja ( R ) has praised the police response
The identity , background and motives of alleged assailants remain sketchy .
Certainly not all are white , but from a range of ethnic groups , and other foreign students have been victims , not just Indians .
While the debate rages , and the diplomatic stress between Canberra and Delhi continues to simmer , with India calling on Australia to do more to protect its expatriates , the violence shows little sign of abating .
" It is really very bad .
Almost every day there is a case where an Indian is being bashed openly and aggressively , " said Raj P Dudeja , the chief editor of the Melbourne - based Indian Voice newspaper .
He initially blamed young teenagers but believes more recently a hidden wave of hostility has been perpetrated by racists .
" Some people did n't report these matters with a fear that their names would appear in police records , which might affect their application for migration in the future , " added Mr Dudeja , who has praised the response of Victorian police and its newly appointed chief commissioner , Simon Overland .
Scars
The spate of attacks , though , has damaged Australia 's reputation and there are concerns the country 's multi-billion - dollar education business that relies , in large part , on the fees paid by foreigners could suffer as a result .
For many youngsters from overseas , however , the Australian experience is positive and enriching .
" I 've never come across any kind of racial discrimination , " explained Ranjinee Dey , 25 , from Calcutta who is studying for a Masters in organisational psychology in Melbourne .
There have been large rallies against racism in Melbourne and Sydney " One of my aunts [ in India ] felt that as soon as I stepped out the house someone would be jumping on me and attacking me , which I thought was ridiculous , " she told the BBC .
" The retaliation attack got me a bit concerned because something like that can easily spiral into something a lot more serious .
It is one violent incident leading to another , " she said .
It was a drunken assault on Gautam Gupta on a university campus in Melbourne that led to the creation of the Federation of Indian Students of Australia .
" I was almost in a depression for a year .
It took me a very long time to recover and the scars still remain and as a result of that attack we started what is now the federation , " he said .
Community groups in Melbourne and Sydney have been working to soothe tensions but there are fears the situation may have reached breaking point and that Indian students will continue their noisy rallies , raising the prospect of further confrontations with those suspected of carrying out racist attacks .
" The level of frustration has gone beyond a manageable limit , " Mr Gupta said of the young Indian protesters .
" They are angry .
They do n't know what else to do .
How else can they get their voice heard ? "

Despite everything , Specter ’s sojourn in the Democratic doghouse did not last very long .
By the end of the week , the party leadership was rearranging things to give him a face - saving Senate subcommittee to chair .
This is pretty much par for the course .
After all , Joe Lieberman ran for re-election last year as an independent and then campaigned tirelessly for John McCain .
Really , he did everything short of picketing the inauguration , and there was nary a wrist - slap .
This seems wrong .
Bucking your party ought to mean accepting the risk of punishment .
After all , you did sign up with the team , which is supposed to work together and get things done .
Unfortunately , sometimes the team will go places where a man or woman of good conscience cannot follow .
And then you will stand alone , a Profile in Courage .
And we will cheer .
But the bravery part is all about facing up to the consequences .
Lieberman was outraged when the Democratic voters in Connecticut responded to his principled stand in favor of the war in Iraq with their principled decision to find a new candidate for his seat .
Specter was beside himself when the Republican voters seemed ready to toss him out of office for his vote in favor of the Obama stimulus plan , so he switched parties .
Then he made it clear that he expected to reserve his right to be totally unreliable as a Democrat and be rewarded for it with a powerful subcommittee chairmanship currently in the possession of another Democratic senator .
President Obama , he reported to his new colleagues , told him that “ he would seek my advice , especially when I disagree with him . ”
We are not sure this actually happened , since Specter ’s memory of what assurances he got during the party - switching period seem to be at odds with those of the rest of the world .
His hearing is not what it once was .
Perhaps the president said , “ I will have you over to watch Harvard play Yale , ” and Specter heard , “ I will invite you over after every betrayal . ”
But it does fit in with Specter ’s theory , which is that his propensity to do whatever he wants should not only be tolerated , but constantly rewarded .
That ’s not character .
It ’s self - indulgence .
A long time ago , in a galaxy identical to this one , I wanted to make a life - sized Katamari , and use it to play Katamary Damacy on PS2 .
My friend Eric Skiff shot a video , and while it ’s not quite a polished project , I decided it ’s time to share it with the world .
Here ’s the wiring schematic .
I realize it does n’t make a lot of sense .
Basically the each mouse ( one for each joystick ) is wired up to the Arduino , and there ’s a handy PS / 2 library for Arduino which makes it easy to work with .
It was also the first Arduino program I wrote after “ make an LED blink . ”
I used an AD5206 digital potentiometer chip , although the 5204 would work as you only need four channels ( left x , left y , right x , right y ) .
It ’s a pretty simple circuit , and maybe when I have some time I ’ll redo it to use an AVR and a single power source .
It was a fun first electronics project .
Originally I wanted to use one of those giant yoga balls , to really get the scale .
But it turns out those do n’t roll very well on ball bearings .
Luckily Adam had one of those mirror balls folks put in their gardens .
Or at least I assume they do , no one I know has a big enough yard to put lawn ornaments in .
While somewhat smaller and less impressive , it rolls much more easily .
This project would n’t have been vaguely possible without help from the fine folks at NYC Resistor , who very patiently explained things like “ why do I need a pull up resistor ? ”
Extra thanks to Eric who documented my work ( something I forget to do ) and Adam who helped me with EAGLE .
Sadly I never did get around to properly etching a board for it ( but I did have a lot of incorrectly etched boards ) .

For the 40 percent of women who ’ve had one , an orgasm in a dream is often more intense that one in real life .
And it ’s not just a dream — a nocturnal orgasm is a real physiological phenomenon .
The dreamer awakens to the same pulsing sensations she ’d have during an orgasm from masturbation or sex .
Her heart rate surges , her breathing deepens , her vaginal blood flow increases .
Her orgasm might even be so fierce that she cramps up as she transitions from dream to reality .
Why ?
A few studies shed some light :
1. During REM , the relative pulse pressure in the vagina increases .
This also happens to a man ’s penis , resulting in nocturnal emissions and morning erections .
The content of the dream does n’t appear to affect genital pulse — after all , it increases every time you sleep — but the physical sensation may influence your dreams ( no one knows for sure ) .
At the same time , the parts of the brain that inhibit orgasm , particularity the prefrontal cortex and amygdala , are offline when you ’re asleep .
( Readers of BLONDES might recall that the left amygdala , associated with anxiety , and the prefrontal correct are quiet during orgasm . )
2. Female orgasm can result from brain activity alone — “ no hands . ”
Evidence of this comes from the research of Beverley Whipple , who studied women who reach orgasm via “ self - induced imagery ” ( i.e. fantasy ) alone .
Volunteers ’ blood pressure , heart rate , pupil size , pain threshold , and so on increase as they reach climax , their hands nowhere near their genitals .
As speculated by Whipple ( see also her research on paralyzed women ) , a “ hands - off ” orgasm may channel the vagus nerve , which is like a livewire that extends from the brain to the cervix via the heart , lungs , and other organs .
Not every orgasm strums it — but , like hitting the right chord , a vagus nerve climax is said to be richer and more fulfilling .
Some women think they can even feel it surge through their bodies from their brainstems .
( See previous blog about asphyxiophiliacs . )
It ’s interesting : Vagus nerve activity might be one reason why so many women say their nocturnal orgasms are so much stronger than their diurnal ones .
Only in their dreams ….
San Franciscans may have noticed an odd , camera - laden car driving through city streets taking photos of everything , but this time , it was n't Google .
The car belongs instead to earthmine , whose cameras capture more data than Google 's do , using a higher - resolution , stereo photography technique that assigns specific points in space to every captured surface .
To demonstrate the power of its virtual version of San Francisco ( other cities to follow ) , earthmine deployed the data on Wednesday as Wild Style City , a free , graffiti- oriented service that lets you navigate real San Francisco streets in a Flash viewer and tag surfaces using a variety of tools of the trade – paint rollers , spray paint and markers , stuffed into a virtual backpack alongside an actionable map of the city , which includes public transportation options .
After you ride the subway , you 'll even hear BART 's trademark electric whine as the train leaves the station .
The key to earthmine 's system is its detailed collection of three - dimensional data , which occupies more data per street than Google Street View .
The company considered using lasers to figure out where everything in San Francisco is , but opted instead for stereo photography , which captures two simultaneous images to create a 3 - D map – somewhat similar to the way in which our two eyes let us gauge distance .
" Every pixel in the image is 3 - D , " earthmine co-founder and co-CEO Anthony Fassero told Wired.com .
" You could actually click on one corner [ of a building ] and click on another corner , and get a real - world measurement . "
He says earthmine is the only company in the world with technology for assigning each 3 - D pixel a real - world equivalent on all three axes – longitude , latitude and elevation .
You enter this virtual San Francisco equipped with everything you need to navigate the city and tag it up to your heart 's content .
You can double - click a designated blank area to start painting , vote for other people 's art by declaring it " the bomb , " browse the city 's highest - rated tags , take public transportation to a new location or jump to a random spot on the map .
" Graffiti is an age - old way of talking about things , " explained Fassero , and he 's right .
My Latin 5 teacher once showed our class obscene graffiti from Caesar 's time .
" We actually work with real graffiti artists here in San Francisco , and some out in Denver and other places , and these are the exact same tools that graffiti artists would use . "
For instance , the whitewash paint roller with which you clear up space for a new tag is limited to the width it would be in real life .
If you want to create a large canvas , you 'll have to spend a good chunk of time paint - rolling with your mouse .
The real - world graffiti skill set translates to Wild Style City 's tools fairly well .
To the right is a tag that Fassero said a " pro " graffiti artist added to the map in about five minutes .
If you 're used to bopping around a first - person shooter videogame fragging the enemy at a lightning - fast pace , Wild Style City 's slow - loading , high - resolution images will drag at first .
It 'd be nice if you could enter a specific address and teleport there , rather than clicking through each screen ( the public transportation options solve the problem to an extent ) .
But overall , earthmine 's demonstration of the sort of thing that 's possible with its data succeeds .
It actually made me feel a bit nostalgic for the San Francisco I left behind over three years ago .
" You do n't actually have to go somewhere anymore to be able to experience a place , " said Fassero .
" It 's about really hitting that hyper - local experience , and being able to see it in a way that 's realistic . "
Earthmine released Wild Style City because it 's fun , but also to show potential partners how detailed their 3 - D information is .
For example , the city of San Francisco could license earthmine 's data to check the exact location ( longitude , latitude and elevation ) of every fire hydrant and bus stop in the city for planning purposes – possibly in conjunction with the open - source transportation models the LimeWire CEO is working on .
The exclusive screenshot to the right shows earthmine mashed with Google Maps – the system San Francisco would use for that .
In fact , Fassero says , the city is already interested in a somewhat ironic use for Wild Style City .
" Just as we 're putting in graffiti here , the same goes for cleaning up [ real ] graffiti , " added Fassero .
" If the city says , ' Oh , we need to clean this up , ' they can map it and send a ground crew out there . "
At that point , Wild Style City would be the only place to see the old graffiti – assuming no one has painted over it online .
Even then , Wild Style City denizens could revert to an earlier reality in order to see it .
This should be just the tip of the iceberg for earthmine .
Fassero hinted that next - generation directory services running on the company 's data will appear later this fall , and said the company 's stereo - photographing car will soon set its course for other west - coast cities .
And once third - party developers get their hands on the company 's API , we expect even wackier and more useful implementations .
The API is free , but earthmine plans to sell its data as a service .
" Think of us as the white - label for a lot of applications , " said Fassero .
" We 're hoping to be the data provider – and we are the data provider for some people we can't mention yet – for a lot of local search and mapping companies , but also , for a whole group of really creative people out there [ with more ambitious ideas ] . "
Earthmine 's data will be free for companies with a small number of users , with different price points available for companies of various sizes .
The rest of the company 's business model involves in - world advertising .
It plans to add video billboards to Wild Style City , and might even consider allowing people to spray paint over the ads ( with a daily refresh ) .
" You 're looking at the ad the whole time you 're graffiti-ing it , right ? " added Fassero .
" It 'd be a really high impression rate . "
He mentioned that nothing in current U.S. law would prevent the company from covering real - life ads with virtual replacements .
Third parties looking to harness this data might wonder how long it takes to put together a new app using earthmine 's API .
According to Fassero , Wild Style City was created by an earthmine developer playing around with the API on a couple of his days off .
A few weeks later , the team released it as a final product .
One more thing :
When earthmine 's car drove past 171 Fell street , it captured this guy staring at a blank wall ( right ) .
It 's now considered one of the most desirable surfaces in Wild Style City , due to the built - in spectator .

With Cleveland ’s pure outside shooters ( Delonte West & Mo Williams ) struggling to hit outside shots , why is Zydrunas Ilgaukas outside the arc firing threes ?
I was never a fan of Ilgauskas shooting very far from the paint .
Why not keep your biggest player close to the hoop ?
Maybe he would get a rebound or get Dwight Howard to foul him .
I have been fired up all year when Big Z shoots these long - range shots .
To me , this is the equivalent of bringing in that utility outfielder to pitch when you are getting clobbered and realize realistically that you have no chance to win .
It is lining that fat tackle up as a tight end eligible on the one and throwing to him when you are up by more than 10 points in the fourth quarter .
It is something that should be seen as a novelty in sports .
Unfortunately for Cavs fans , Ilgauskas has his mind set on firing bricks from more than 20 at least three times a game .
This all started in the early 90’s when Manute Bol would get the ball with big leads or deficits and shoot the 3 .
Message to Mike Brown :
Tear that play out of the arsenal .
Sadly , a few of Z ’s threes have gone in .
Take a six - year - old to a putt - putt course and they might get a couple hole - in - ones for getting lucky enough to hit the clowns mouth .
Big Z hit the clowns mouth a few times from three this season , so now he thinks he is Robert Horry and wants to hang outside the three - point line and just wait for the ball .
In the meantime , Lebron James is driving and if he misses and does n’t get his own rebound , there is no one else around .
They are all having a picnic waiting for the ball to be kicked out .
The two exceptions are Anderson Varajeo and Ben Wallace .
They hustle after loose balls and play the game according to what their size dictates they should do .
Maybe we should turn Ben Wallace loose .
He can fire up his new McDonald ’s sponsored 30 foot hook shot .
If they start to fall , people get a free sixth Quarter Pounder if they buy five .
Or we can let Anderson Varajeo ( Sideshow Bob ) run give and go plays with Big Ben all night .
Bottom line is real simple …
If Delonte and Mo ca n’t hit the outside shot , bring in Joe Smith and Sasha Pavlovic and go to the bigger post - type lineup .
Where is Wally Szcerbiak ?
He gets hot and nails threes in bunches .
There are a million opinions as to what has to happen for Cleveland to pull this series out .
I do n’t think you would hurt your chances of winning any if you did n’t waste three possessions a game on Zydrunas Ilgauskas firing up bombs from long range .
Left 4
Dead was one of those games that you just knew was going to be good .
It combined the aspects of Valve ’s past successful FPS titles with a strong emphasis on cooperative gameplay , and the most important factor of all : Zombies .
Since its release in late 2008 , Left 4 Dead has receive much critical acclaim , as well as commercial success on both the PC and XBOX 360 .
Many people , including myself , find the game endlessly entertaining due to its unique emphasis on cooperative play and the fact that it allows the player to play as the zombies .
Needless to say , when you have a game that puts so much emphasis on teamwork , playing single player is n’t really an option .
You ’re going to have to play multiplayer to get the full bang for your buck .
As with any online experience , you ’re going to have to bump into a mixed bag when it comes to your teammates .
And in a game like Left 4 Dead , having a good or bad teammate is enough to define your gaming experience .
You ’ll run into a good share of like - minded players who are just on there to have some fun .
However , you will most likely run into the bad apples along the way , especially if you play regularly .
Avoiding extensive gaming with these types of people can significantly improve your overall Left 4 Dead experience .
To assist in accomplishing this , I have compiled a list of the eight types of people you will meet in Left 4 Dead that you DO NOT want to play with .
Jump for the inside scoop !
The 80’s Action Hero
Take your pick .
Sly Stallone ?
Jean - Claude Van Damme ?
Steven Segal ?
Arnold Schwarzeneger ?
Chuck Norris ?
Whoever you picked , rest assured that this player has every movie poster ever made with them in it , plastered right next to his Dragonball Z posters .
Pumped up and fresh off of “ pwning some noobs ” in his recent game of Halo , this player is utterly opposed to teamwork , specifically the “ team ” aspect of it .
In his mind , he is a one - man army .
In fact , it is likely you and the rest of the team do not even exist on his monitor .
Did you just get puked on , and now are being swarmed by a horde of zombies ?
Do n’t worry , those zombies will soon meet their end as our action hero throws a Molotov right onto your head to kill them .
The best way to identify our hero is at the beginning of each level , when he barges out of the saferoom while everyone is still collecting their guns , just to run 20 feet before getting pounced by a hunter .
Upon rescuing his worthless ass , the player will most likely ask what took so long , before running forward again .
Rinse and repeat until the player dies , at which point he will yell or type expletives and quit the game altogether in a fit of rage .
The Achievement Hunter
As time has passed , these types have dwindled off , but when the game first came out , they ruled each lobby with an iron fist .
If it ’s not the guy who runs up to the Witch to try to Cr0wn her , while the rest of the team is trying to run around , it ’s the guy who tells everyone not to damage the tank so they can get Man vs.
Tank … while playing Versus .
It can sometimes be hard to spot these types within a game , but if you ’re trying to get through Blood Harvest on Expert , and Zoey has been using her pistols the whole time , you know you ’ve got one on your hands .
The Chessmaster
Each level in L4D is a fairly linear experience .
However , while the overall objective remains the same for each playthrough , there are many small decisions that are made throughout any game that can have large effects on the outcome .
The Chessmaster is a player that exists solely to let you know that whatever decisions you ultimately make , are indeed the wrong ones .
If you picked up an auto - shotgun , you should ’ve picked up the assault rifle .
If you just threw a pipe bomb , you probably threw it 4 seconds too late .
If you just placed a gas tank down as a trap , you placed it in the wrong spot .
Heaven forbid the Chessmaster ever dies .
If he does , prepare to be told every possible reason why you suck donkey balls .
The Chessmaster is also easy to spot early on when the player has given out five commands , and you have n’t even picked up your health pack yet .
Strings of commands come out of the player ’s mouth or keyboard as if he was playing a game of verbal chess .
Be prepared to be treated like a chess piece when playing with this type of player .
The Griefer
One would think in a game where you ca n’t even survive more than 5 minutes of any level without the help of your teammates , someone like the Griefer could n’t exist .
If you thought that , you would be wrong .
This player is a shining example of everything that is wrong with the internet today .
Not only did he pay $ 50 - 60 dollars just so he could ruin your online gaming experience , but he is probably doing it with only one hand while getting off on it .
Now , here ’s the trick to identifying The Griefer .
Take a close look at the suspect ’s weapon .
If it just emptied an entire magazine into you , you ’ve got yourself a Griefer .
The High Jumper
This player has watched every hunter pounce montage video ever posted on Youtube .
He plays the game solely to attempt the stunt - like mega pounces he sees in said videos , and dreams about them in his sleep .
Although you will never know it , he is one of those people you see entering a lobby , and leaving immediately when they see the Infected team has already been filled .
Within the game , you can pick this type of player out as they are the ones that generally spend 5 minutes jumping around trying to get to the highest point in the map .
They then camp there waiting for the survivors to run into the “ sweet spot ” that will grant them the orgasmic 25 - point pounce that they covet .
Apparently , there are three playable boss infected classes ?
Not as far as this guy is concerned .
He will suicide when he is any other class just so he can respawn sooner as a hunter .
This player is also most likely the Infected with the least amount of points at the end of each map , since they normally get shot down from their camping spots before they even pounce because everyone and their mother knows of all those camping spots already .
The Orkin Man
Like a professional exterminator , this player is a pro at finding bugs .
However , instead of destroying them , they use them to exploit the game in every possible situation .
It started out innocent enough , with doggie style raping a Witch that could do nothing but flail her arms around helplessly .
Then it went to meleeing at an extremely quick rate .
Eventually , thanks to the Orkin Man ’s ingenuity , what started out harmless , slowly exacerbated itself and spread to more and more aspects of the game .
Soon , you could n’t play a Versus game without people turning themselves into human cannonballs with the gatling gun , and 12 hunters jumping around together trying to pounce you .
Due to a recent patch on the PC , most of these exploits have been fixed .
Be wary though , as this player is still lurking , waiting to strike at the next opportunity .
Every once in awhile , you ’ll catch an Orkin Man that ’s a little behind on the times , meleeing away at the No Mercy 3 rolling overhead door .
The Soprano
Also known to many as “ The 12 Year Old . ”
Easy to recognize as they always speak with a high pitched voice , and they often do not stop talking .
Ever .
If you join a game - in - progress with one of these players , you may be confused at first , but do n’t worry , you did n’t just walk into a taping for an episode of the Gilmore Girls .
Just as a heads up though , this type of player generally likes to take on a secondary personality similar to the ones mentioned previously .
Sometimes , you ’ll get a Chessmaster - in - training , or an Action Hero whose balls have yet to drop .
Whichever one you get , be prepared to get the chipmunk version of everything , all while wondering if you should hit on the player , because they could very well be a girl .
The Girl
This type does not exist .
Please refer to “ The Soprano ” for further details .

Craigslist 's new policy barring the publication of erotic ads has not only saved lives and stopped prostitution , it 's also saving the dying newspaper industry .
After the site announced last month under pressure that it would no longer publish erotic ads , sales of erotic ads in local alternative weekly newspapers have soared , according to the Washington City Paper .
The paper reports its own sales of adult ads was up 38 percent in the first week of May as criticism against Craigslist was heating up , compared to the same time last year .
Minneapolis ' City Pages says its adult ad sales have almost doubled .
And SF Weekly in San Francisco had 160 adult ads the week before Craigslist 's policy went into affect but clocked in with 910 ads last week .
Craigslist withdrew erotic ads after a 22 - year - old Boston medical student allegedly murdered a woman who advertised erotic services on the web site .
A week earlier , a New York City radio reporter was found murdered after placing an ad on Craigslist for rough sex .
The murders led South Carolina 's attorney general to threaten Craigslist with a criminal investigation if it did n't pull the ads .
The prosecutor accused Craigslist of facilitating prostitution .
Connecticut ’s attorney general called Craigslist “ a blatant Internet brothel . ”
Attorney generals in several states met with Craigslist to hash out a compromise that involved the site creating a new adult category for legal services that employees will monitor .
That move apparently did little to curb the activity lawmakers were trying to halt ; it simply sent erotic services ad buyers flocking from new media to old media , despite the fact that ads with the latter cost more than on Craigslist .
An adult - services ad in the Washington City Paper starts at $ 150 per week .
The Chicago Reader charges $ 50 for online - only ads ; $ 100 for online and print .
Craigslist , by contrast , charged only $ 5 until it was forced to implement its manual monitoring of ads .
It now charges $ 10 for ads placed in its adult category .
As the Washington City Paper points out , the criteria for vetting ad content varies drastically between the weekly newspapers and the now - revamped Craigslist , highlighting the randomness of the lawmaker 's attacks against the web site , while leaving print papers alone .
Now , when you place an adult - services ad on Craigslist , you have to aver that you are offering no “ content that is unlawful , pornographic , or which advertises illegal services ” ; no ads “ suggesting or implying an exchange of sexual favors for money ” ; no “ pornographic images , or images suggestive of an offer of sexual favors . " . . .
Craigslist ’s “ competition ” has standards , too — they ’re just not as fresh and unequivocal as the ass- covering Craigslist versions .
In a City Paper ad , says McAndrews , you ca n’t post a photo of genitalia or penetration .
“ Nipples are kind of on a fence , ” she says .
Heather Hansen of the Seattle Stranger says advertisers on its Naughty Northwest site ca n’t “ show their privates , ” adding that photos can be “ a little bit risqué and sexy but nothing over the top . ”
“ Kay , ” who advertises herself as a “ Busty Blonde / Toys ” in City Paper , says Craigslist ’s new standards mean she can only submit “ one of my pictures that does n’t net me a lot of business . ”
Another woman who advertises in both City Paper and Craigslist and spoke on the condition that I did n’t print her name says Craigslist ’s “ standard is no good because you cannot really describe who you are . ”
Craigslist CEO
Jim Buckmaster has been railing against the double standard that forced it to censor ads that the alt - weeklies continue to proudly publish .
In a blog post he lists a number of titles taken from ads placed with the alt - weeklies recently , which are full of sex - for - sale euphemisms : " Let me put you to bed backdoor available $ 80 ; " " Three holes anything goes $ 90 - Greek included . "
One ad includes photos of a woman performing oral sex on a man .
" It ’s worth noting that these ads ’ TITLES ALONE contain more explicit content than you will find in all craigslist adult service ads combined , " Buckmaster writes on his blog .
The alt weeklies have little sympathy for Craigslist , however , since newspapers have been complaining for years that the online classified site has been killing their revenue .

Mr Eising says after the accident there was little talk of him regaining use of the limb .
" My leg was basically on a wing and a prayer of being amputated because the damage was so severe , " he said .
The Toowoomba Hospital referred him to the PAH where he met specialist Dr Cameron Cooke .
" He lost a segment of his bone , there was a large defect there and the options were to consider amputation or to do a bone transport , " Dr Cooke said .
The technique , developed in Russia , involves fitting a metal frame , known as an ' Illizarov Frame ' to the outside of the leg .
Wires attached are attached to both ends of the broken bone and a small section of bone is cut allowing new bone to grow as the frame is moved down the leg each day .
Using the procedure , Mr Eising was able to grow one millimetre of new bone each day for three months .
" ' It involves a lot of teamwork , its multiple procedures and a lot of time in the operating theatres , " Dr Cooke said .
" Twelve centimetres is a lot of bone , often bone defects are a lot smaller than that .
" Hosea has done very well and has had no complications at all and is back walking without any walking aids . "
Today , Mr Eising walked back into the hospital to thank the medical team which helped him walk again .
He says his recovery still has some way to go but he is very thankful the procedure was a success .
" I just want to give a huge praise and thanks to God for the talents that he has given the surgeons , " he said .
" I was on crutches for 233 days and after I got out of hospital I worked out .
" So it was late last year that I was walking around with crutches with the frame in .
" I was released from hospital the day after the operation and I walked out of hospital unassisted by crutches which was a huge step forward for me . "
Walking back into the hospital today he said he was feeling great .
" Absolutely awesome feeling - it's been a long time coming but I thank God for giving me the strength to persevere through thick and thin , " he said .
As for getting back on his trail bike , he said that may take some time .
" I have n't touched it since the accident , " he said .
" In the future I 'll fix it up and I 'll get back in the saddle so to speak one day , [ but ]
I think but it 'll all take a long time though . "
The campaign has kicked off with a web page entitled “ It ’s better with Windows ” showing adverts for Windows and suggesting it is a better choice for use with Asus ’ range of netbooks .
Asus confirmed to vnunet.com that the campaign was legitimate , saying : “ As a hardware vendor we have to provide both operation systems for our consumers . ”
However , some will see this as a thinly veiled attempt by Microsoft to protect its share in the growing netbook market .
While the company is claiming that the vast majority of netbooks is shipping Windows nevertheless it appears worried by Linux .
Microsoft is also facing an increasing challenge from a traditional ally for control of netbooks .
Intel ’s Moblin operating system for netbooks is developed around Linux and the company its beta of the latest version .

Russia wants to keep its parts of the ISS flying beyond 2020
Russia is making plans to detach and fly away its parts of the International Space Station when the time comes to de-orbit the rest of the outpost .
Industry officials told BBC News of plans to keep the Russian ISS modules flying around a decade from now .
ISS partners are optimistic they will be able to extend funding for the project beyond a current 2015 deadline .
But most observers agree that most of the International Space Station will have to be scrapped around 2020 .
According to the plans , the remaining Russian modules will form the core of a new orbital outpost , which would serve as a haven and assembly shop for deep space missions heading to the Moon , Mars and beyond .
To facilitate the plan , RKK Energia , the country 's main ISS contractor , has already started developing a special node module for the Russian segment , which will double as the cornerstone of the future station .
I can tell you it is technically possible to separate the Russian segment ( from the ISS ) and fly free
Russian space official A ball - shaped compartment with docking ports on six sides would enable the future outpost to stay in space indefinitely , with only individual components being replaced as needed .
The current architecture of the International Space Station makes replacement of some of its key modules practically impossible .
Unlike many Nasa and European space officials , Russian engineers are confident that even after two decades in orbit , their modules would be in good enough shape to form the basis of a new space station .
" We flew on Mir for 15 years and accumulated colossal experience in extending the service life ( of such a vehicle ) , " said a senior Russian official at RKK Energia , Russia 's main contractor on the ISS .
" I do n't see any problems , with the exception of penetration of the modules ' skin by a meteoroid .
( The vehicles ) can fly 20 or 30 years and , if we do n't have a direct hit , we can replace practically every internal component .
We learnt a lesson from Mir that anything that can fail in this period of time can be replaced . "
However , the idea of turning the Russian segment of the ISS into an independent space station carries major political , legal and financial pitfalls , Russian officials admitted .
" I can tell you it is technically possible to separate the Russian segment ( from the ISS ) and fly free , however , ( in this case ) there are a number of issues with the ... end of the station 's life , " a Russian space official told BBC News .
The ATV could potentially guide the ISS to a controlled destruction
If the Russians moved the key service module away along with the rest of its segments , the remaining parts of the station would be left without a propulsion capability .
This would be needed to maintain the station 's orbit or to plunge it into the Earth 's atmosphere over a safe area .
According to Russian sources , they have actively discussed their intentions with American partners , but they have so far failed to come up with a satisfactory solution .
" Our position is that the primary integrator of the station ( Nasa ) is responsible for a civilized end to the flight after the conclusion of the mission , " a Russian official said .
" [ The Americans ] said they understood the issue , but did not go beyond that . "
To resolve the problem , Russian space officials are eyeing the European - built ATV spacecraft , which has a propulsion system powerful enough to guide the station towards a controlled destruction .
But currently , the vehicle can only dock with the Russian segment , and would need significant modifications to implement the new plan .
New goals Manuel Valls , head of policy and plans at the human spaceflight and exploration directorate of the European Space Agency ( Esa ) , told BBC News that the agency did conduct some preliminary studies on how to dock the ATV to the US segment of the station .
However , he said Esa was primarily focused on reaching a swift agreement with its partners on funding for the station until at least 2020 .
" If and when the ISS will be de-orbited , which is , again , highly unlikely to happen before 2020 , then the right vehicle to do the job would be the ATV , " Mr Valls said .
" However , by 2020 , we will also have the HTV ( a Japanese cargo vehicle designed to dock with the US segment ) and probably American vehicles , which could be used as well .
It is more than 10 years from now , so anything can happen . "
Although the Russian federal space agency ( Roscosmos ) first announced plans to succeed the ISS with its own space station almost a decade ago , several recent events brought this plan to the forefront of the country 's long - term space strategy .
In 2004 , the US government made a decision to abandon the ISS in the middle of the coming decade , and direct available Nasa funds toward lunar exploration goals .
Currently , the US space agency plans to end its participation in the ISS around 2015 , exactly the time when the newest Russian modules of the station are scheduled to reach the launch pad .
The new Russian ship would be launched towards the end of the next decade
Last year , Roscosmos and Esa failed to reach an agreement on a co-operative project to develop a next - generation manned spacecraft .
Instead , the Russian government committed to the independent development of a new crewed spacecraft .
The ultimate targets for this future ship would be the Moon or even support for a manned expedition to Mars .
With the first launch of the new Russian spacecraft optimistically set for 2018 , it would probably reach the launch pad by the time Nasa ends its support for the ISS .
Unlike the ISS , which was advertised primarily as a platform for scientific research , Russia 's future space station , dubbed the Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex ( OPSEK ) , would have the main goal of supporting deep space exploration .
Behind the scenes , Russian engineers have drawn up ambitious plans for orbital stations around the Earth and the Moon , and eventually in the orbit of Mars .
These would be linked by re-usable tugs , shuttling between them continuously to support the sustained exploration of the Solar System .
After separation from rest of the ISS , the station 's 20 - tonne service module could eventually be replaced by a 40 - tonne living quarters launched by a new family of rockets .
In turn , this module could ultimately serve as a construction site and a base for the Martian expedition complex , which could be assembled in Earth orbit in the mid-2030s to carry the first humans to the Red Planet .

MarketWatch is reporting California formally asks Geithner for TARP assistance
California Treasurer Bill Lockyer asked U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Wednesday to authorize assistance for his state from the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program , warning that depressed tax revenues may cut into basic services and halt the building of infrastructure .
In a letter , Lockyer asked Geithner for TARP assistance for California and " other financially strapped states and local governments which face a severe cash flow crunch . "
" If we can not obtain our usual short - term cash - flow borrowings , there could be devastating impacts on the ability of the State or other governments to provide essential services to their citizens , " Lockyer wrote .
In addition , Lockyer warned in the letter that California 's cash flow problems may lead to trouble accessing the long - term bond market , which could " eventually even halt our infrastructure construction programs . "
Lockyer estimated that California 's cash flow shortfall in fiscal 2009 - 2010 will be more than $ 13 billion .
A $ 13 Billion Deficit ?
LA Mayor To Declare Fiscal Emergency
With Los Angeles facing a $ 529 - million budget deficit , Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa on Tuesday urged the City Council to declare a fiscal emergency that would grant him the authority to lay off and furlough thousands of city workers .
The request signals a more hard - line tack by the mayor to win salary and benefit concessions from the city 's public employee unions , which had soured on Villaraigosa 's call for a salary freeze , furloughs and increased benefit costs to save $ 230 million and avert the need for layoffs .
Villaraigosa said the worsening economy and an expected $ 300 - million drop in city tax revenue gave him " very few options . "
L.A. 's budget gap is expected to grow to $ 1 billion in the 2010 - 2011 fiscal year because of investment losses in the city 's pension systems , which the city is required to keep solvent .
" The gravity of the fiscal emergency that we face is enormous , " Villaraigosa said in his letter to the council .
" Unless we act with urgency , the city will face a cash flow crisis , raising the prospect of running out of cash between November and February . "
Unions Hold California Hostage
One of the biggest stories in politics earlier this year was about California 's budget teetering on the edge of a $ 42 - billion deficit abyss .
It only staved off insolvency when its legislature ended three months of gridlock to pass a budget with steep tax hikes and spending cuts .
Guess what the Obama Administration is doing ?
It is telling Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger that it will revoke nearly $ 7 billion in federal stimulus money unless the state restores legislated wage cuts for unionized health - care workers .
Governor Schwarzenegger has sent a letter asking the feds to reconsider , noting the cuts were taken in response to " an unprecedented fiscal crisis . "
Even now the state faces an estimated cash - flow problem of some $ 17 billion by July .
Restoring the union money will require a two - thirds vote of the Legislature , a task in California somewhat akin to moving the Sierra Nevadas .
Still , it 's worth noting where the Obama team ranks the political authority of a legislative enactment by the state of California versus the political clout of a union .
Molyneux promoted to creative director of Microsoft Game Studios Lionhead boss to oversee creative output of all European talent and " push more innovation " for the Xbox 360
Matt Martin Thursday 4th June 2009
Share this article Share
Microsoft has promoted Lionhead boss Peter Molyneux to creative director of Microsoft Game Studios in Europe .
Molyneux will oversee the creative output of all internal studios as well as Microsoft 's third - party development partners , acting in a leadership role to help ideas come to fruition as well as ensuring better communication and understanding within the group .
" The best way for us to make sure our platforms evolve in a way that enables the best creative experiences is to make sure our creative leaders are closely tied into the work that 's going on with the platform team , " detailed Phil Spencer , general manager of Microsoft Game Studios , speaking exclusively to GamesIndustry.biz .
" What we 're asking Peter to do is a creative director role for us in Europe , overseeing all of the creative work that goes on at our studios in the UK and Europe , and the different projects that we have with external partners .
" His role there is to not only help the collaborations and to bring both the thinking from that region back to the platform and Microsoft Game Studios as different things are incubating and being worked on , but the reverse is also true , of taking global knowledge of our platform efforts and different efforts at MGS and help provide context and guidance to those teams . "
Molyneux said the promotion is n't about leaving his own mark on other studio's titles , but rather helping internal and external talent realise their creative visions within the Microsoft development ecosystem .
" What you 're not going to see is ten Peter Molyneux games .
The value of this role is for someone like myself going in and making those little tiny lights of an idea shine as brightly as possible and ensuring everybody within the organisation clearly understands why we 're making those titles , the purpose of those titles and their importance to Microsoft overall .
" All I 'm going to be doing is making sure those lights are as bright as possible .
People at Rare and other European studios are super , super bright and creative people and I 'll learn as much about design from them as they would from me . "
Molyneux said he hopes to help foster the passion of individuals , and in turn push Microsoft 's talent to drop preconceived ideas about game design and strive for innovation .
" I 'm definitely not going to go in and say ' this is a dumb idea ' and ' this is a good idea ' .
I 'm more about making sure they really are doing the experiences they 're passionate about .
Because passion is really central .
" That 's probably going to involve innovation , I 'm going to be pushing them more on the innovation side , especially with project Natal , and saying , 'look , do n't think you 've got all of your design comforts here any more , let 's think of a new way of doing all that . ' "
He also made it clear that he will still remain studio boss of Lionhead , and continues to work on the two titles currently in development at the studio .
There are usually two different measures that auction designers attempt optimizing for : efficiency ( social welfare ) and auctioneer revenue .
A “ better ” auction often improves both efficiency and revenue but in other cases these are conflicting goals .
It is well known that efficiency is optimized by Vickerey Auctions while revenue is optimized by Myerson optimal auctions .
I often hear cynical doubts about whether anyone optimizes efficiency rather than revenue , and specifically such disbelief regarding the big companies running ad auctions ( such as my current employer , Google ) .
As far as I can tell , reality seems to be quite the opposite : companies aim to optimize their long - term or middle - term revenue rather than the revenue of a single auction .
In a competitive environment the only way of optimizing long term revenue is by gaining and maintaining market share which in turn requires providing high “ added - value ” i.e. optimizing efficiency .
In any case , this post points out to a paper by Gagan Aggarwal , Gagan Goel and Aranyak Mehta recently posted to the arXiv .
Complementing a result of Jeremy Bulow and Paul Klemperer , they show that the difference between the two different optimization goals is not very large compared to increasing the number of bidders .
The setting is the classic one of selling a single indivisible good in the private value model with a commonly known distribution over bidders ’ valuations ( with some mild restrictions on the distribution ) .
The BK paper shows that the revenue of an efficiency - maximizing auction with k+1 bidder is at least as high as that of the revenue - maximizing one with k bidders .
The new AGM paper shows that the efficiency of a revenue - maximizing auction with k+logk bidders is at least as high as that of an efficiency - maximizing one with k bidders ( and that the logk term is necessary ) .
[ Added on 10.6 : Thanks to Tim Roughgarden for pointing out to me his closely related joint paper with Mukund Sundararajan that generalizes the BK result to an ad-auction setting , as well as provides direct revenue guarentees without increasing the number of bidders . ]

Baby tucuxi moments before the attack Adult tucuxi dolphins have been seen trying to kill a newborn calf of their own species .
It is the first record of these dolphins attempting infanticide .
Although common in many mammal species , infanticide is rarely recorded among cetaceans , the group of animals that includes whales and dolphins .
Until now , the behaviour has only been reported twice in bottlenose dolphins ; but the new episode suggests it may be more widespread than was thought .
Tucuxi dolphins ( Sotalia guianensis ) live either in the freshwater of the Amazonian basin , or in the ocean off the coast of Brazil to Nicaragua .
Adult male marine tucuxis are known to be aggressive to one another during the breeding season , but they had never been seen being aggressive or violent towards younger members of their species .
We believe the injuries the newborn calf received from this encounter were fatal
Marine biologist Mariana Nery
That is until Mariana Nery , of the Southern University of Chile in Valdivia , and Sheila Simao , of the Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , were surveying the dolphins in Sepetiba Bay , Brazil .
On the morning of 5 December 2006 , when the sea was calm , they saw a group of six adult tucuxi dolphins approach a mother with her newborn calf .
Two adults separated the baby from its mother .
The female began to take evasive action , swimming to try to avoid the interlopers .
But the other four adults herded her , hitting her body with their flukes and ramming her .
Any attempt by the mother to escape towards her offspring was prevented by the herding pack , which chased her and blocked her path .
The female dolphin frequently exposed her belly at the water surface , either as a passive behaviour or to signal that she would be sexually receptive to the males .
The adult female tucuxi dolphin exposes her belly in a bid to escape Four metres away , the two remaining adults rammed the calf and held it underwater .
They then threw it in the air and again pushed it underwater .
Afterwards the calf was disorientated and swam with difficulty .
Although the researchers saw the mother a few days later , they never again saw the calf .
" We believe the injuries the newborn calf received from this encounter were fatal , " the researchers report in the journal Marine Mammal Science .
" This is the first time we 've seen this type of aggression , " explained Ms Nery .
" It is difficult to say if they really attempted to kill the calf or if it was playful behaviour that went too far .
But they clearly looked to separate the calf from the mother . "
They believe the incidence adds to growing evidence that wild dolphins may practise infanticide .
In other animals , males often kill babies they did not father to induce their mother to become sexually receptive once more .
" Female dolphins become sexually receptive within a few days of losing a calf , " says Ms Nery .
That , combined with the sexual interest shown by the group in the mother , suggests they killed the calf for similar reasons .

FLINT , Michigan -- Fourteen children by 13 different women in Genesee County and more than $ 530,000 in unpaid child support .
Even in a county with $ 700 million in uncollected child support , Thomas Frazier may hold the unenviable title of biggest deadbeat dad .
After years of dodging support payments , Frazier was thrown in jail this week and given the choice of doing 90 days or coming up with about $ 28,000 .
" This guy gives fathers a bad name , " said Genesee County Friend of the Court Jack Battles .
Before leaving the Flint area in 2002 , Frazier amassed court cases for 14 children born since 1989 and has not paid any money on any of his Genesee County child support cases in at least the past six years , according to court records .
Frazier , 42 , portrays himself as the victim .
The victim of a system that he says saddled him with debt for children he claims are n't all his and the victim of a poor upbringing that he said caused him to seek affection from older women .
" I tried to find someone who would love me for me , " said Frazier , who believes he may have fathered his first child at age 15 .
Authorities say Frazier is a serial womanizer who bounces from state to state and has n't paid child support in years .
Frazier owes Talisha Tyler about $ 40,000 for a 14 - year - old daughter .
Tyler said he has never even bought so much as a diaper .
" Thomas has never been involved in her life -- period , " said Tyler .
A Genesee County judge on Thursday ordered Frazier to spend 90 days in jail unless he comes up with $ 4,100 for Tyler .
Even if he comes up with that money , the judge ordered him to spend 90 days in jail on another case .
On top of that , the judge gave him 45 days jail on six other cases .
In all , Frazier is looking at three months in jail unless he comes up with at least $ 27,900 .
Tyler would just as soon see him go to prison for much longer .
" He 's a fast talker , " she said .
" He 's not going to pay it . "
Frazier does n't dispute that he owes a sizable amount , but said it was unrealistic for the county to expect him to pay so much support .
" At one point , I owed like $ 3,000 ( a month ) , " he said .
" Nobody makes that much . "
He said he believes in his hear that only three of the children -- two daughters and a son -- are actually his .
The rest , he says , were born of women he may have slept with but who lied and claimed he was the father , giving the court false addresses for Frazier so that he could never show up to contest paternity .
Local officials , however , say Frazier has a story for everything .
In October , Friend of the Court officials said Frazier gave them a false Social Security number and tried to convince investigators he was someone else .
He remained under the radar until late last month when he got pulled over in Iowa for a broken taillight on his Mercedes Benz .
In his pocket , police found $ 5,000 in cash and plane tickets to Florida .
Frazier said he is unemployed and local officials said they do not know what he does for a living .
Frazier said he was actually on his way back to Flint and planned to use the $ 5,000 as a good faith payment on his child support .
The cop tossed him in jail on child support warrants and then had him delivered Wednesday to the Genesee County Jail .
Frazier says he " messed up " and wants to take care of his mistakes , but hopes the Friend of the Court will knock down his bill to a more manageable $ 200,000 and set him free .
" There 's not a lot I can do in jail , " Frazier said .
Frazier 's plan for freedom wo n't get a lot of support from the Friend of the Court .
" We will seek prison , " said Battles , who says he 's heard a litany of excuses from Frazier .
Battles said he 's willing to work with Frazier but said it 's going to take a lot more than $ 5,000 .
" It will take six digits , " said Battles .
His current jail term aside , Frazier is also looking at further legal woes for his probation violation cases .
Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton is not in a forgiving mood , noting that Frazier was rolling around in Mercedes Benz with thousands of dollars and plane tickets at the same time he was n't paying his child support .
" Shame on him for abandoning his children while he lives ' The Life of Riley , ' " said Leyton .
Frazier , who has already spent five years on probation for attempted non support of a child , does have one piece of advice for his children .
" Use a condom , " he said .
" You do n't want to end up like your dad . "

I do n’t know anyone who wanted to close the detention facility at Gitmo because of where it was — but rather because of what it was .
It ’s not merely a symbol , but is the embodiment of the implementation of a bad policy .
If you close Gitmo but carry on the same bad policy elsewhere , you ’re playing a shell game , Mr. President .
President Obama ’s public quarrel with Israel over the growth of Jewish settlements in the West Bank is developing into a test of the U.S. leader ’s international credibility , say foreign diplomats and other observers .
Obama and his senior aides have insisted for weeks that the Jewish state completely halt the expansion of its settlements .
But now , with U.S. and Israeli officials apparently close to an agreement on the issue , it is widely expected in Israel and the Arab world that the administration will give ground and support at least some growth in the 120 communities .
Opponents of such a move say the concessions will not only disappoint the Arabs whom the president has courted , but also will be read by adversaries around the globe as a signal that the president can be forced to back down .
“ It will tell people who are trying to bend his will , ‘ You have hope , ’ ” said Ziad Asali , president of the American Task Force on Palestine , a pro-Palestinian advocacy group in Washington .

Last month , Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton declared that Obama opposed any growth , saying that he “ wants to see a stop to settlements -- not some settlements , not outposts , not ‘ natural growth ’ exceptions . ”
Obama ’s decision to carry on an open dispute with Israel has been unusual for an American president .
But the White House believed that winning Israeli concessions would help him revive Middle East peace talks and build Muslim support for U.S. efforts in the region as well as Pakistan and Afghanistan .
After weeks of talks , U.S. officials have signaled that they are close to an agreement with the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that could open the way to a resumption of high - level peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians .
Former Sen. George J. Mitchell , Obama ’s envoy for Middle East peace , said this week that he hoped for a U.S. - Israeli accord “ very soon . ”
The talks have focused on two issues the Israelis raise to argue against a complete halt to settlement growth , officials say .

The Israelis say the nearly 300,000 Jewish settlers living in the West Bank need to be permitted a “ normal life , ” meaning they should be able to add rooms to their homes , schools and other facilities to accommodate normal population growth of existing communities .
Second , they argue that projects underway should be permitted to be completed .
They note that if the Israeli government tries to halt a settler from building on private land within an existing settlement , the courts may intervene to overrule the move .
Michael B. Oren , the Israeli ambassador to the United States , said in interviews in Israel this week that “ creative solutions ” had been devised and he predicted that an accord would be reached .
Mitchell is to meet with Netanyahu in Paris next week .
One U.S. official , asked about the credibility issue , said , “ I ’m quite confident that when this issue is resolved -- one way or another -- all the parties involved will understand that the president should be taken at his word . ”

Some critics of Israel ’s settlements are not reassured .
Saeb Erekat , chief negotiator for the West Bank - based Palestinian Authority , said the Obama administration should hold Israel to its commitment under earlier peace plans to freeze all settlement growth .
Asali , of the American Task Force on Palestine , said that if the U.S. were to make substantial concessions , it would have wide ramifications for peace efforts .
He said it would reduce the likelihood that the patchwork of Palestinian - held land could be united into a viable state , and it would undermine efforts to strengthen the moderate Palestinian Authority leadership in the eyes of Palestinians .
An Arab diplomat said a perception that Obama had caved in would greatly affect the willingness of Arab countries to make concessions to Israel .
U.S. officials have urged Arab countries to take steps to normalize ties with Israel , such as opening diplomatic posts or permitting commercial airline stops in their countries .

Winning concessions from Arab countries “ is going to be difficult in any case .
If there are American concessions , it will be very difficult , ” said the diplomat , who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue .
Elliott Abrams , an architect of President George W. Bush ’s Middle East policy , said U.S. officials needed to be able to argue when a deal was announced that they had made good on their pledge not to permit growth .
But he said the Israeli government could be expected to argue that it had won U.S. support for some growth .
He said the two governments would be putting “ contrasting spins ” on the agreement and that it would be difficult for the Obama administration to rebut any reporter who pointed out that U.S. officials had insisted there would be no loopholes .
Such an outcome , Abrams said , would raise questions about “ why the administration concluded they ought to do this with a public fight . ”

Israel began building settlements in the West Bank shortly after capturing the territory in the 1967 Middle East War .
Repeated U.N. resolutions have insisted that Israel abide by the Fourth Geneva Convention , which forbids a country to settle its civilians in areas conquered militarily .
Israeli officials say they wo n’t build new settlements or expropriate land to enlarge the space occupied by existing settlements .
But the boundaries of most settlements are far larger than the ground currently occupied by residences and other buildings , so that rules allowing growth based on “ normal life ” could in time result in construction of tens of thousands of new homes .
According to data compiled by Israel ’s Defense Ministry and disclosed in January by the newspaper Haaretz , about 46,500 future housing units have obtained the ministry ’s approval within existing master plans and await only a government decision to build .
If the government gave all of them the green light , it would nearly double the number of settler homes in the West Bank in 20 years .

Israeli officials argue that the growth of settlements does n’t prejudice the outcome of negotiations with the Palestinians because most of the growth is in huge blocks that Israel expects to keep as part of any peace agreement .

A gay couple has been forced to remove their rainbow pride flag , even though it was approved by a previous management company .
The new company does n't want to " clutter " the neighborhood and only allows national holiday flags to be recognized , even though Easter decor which is not part of a national holiday is permitted .
" Steven and Zeniff Vanderran of Mesa , Arizona say homophobia and ongoing disputes with their homeowners association are behind an order to remove a gay pride flag from their Queen Creek home .
Cambria Ocotillo ’s design guidelines only allow certain flags , including decorations for certain holidays , according to Jonathan Olcott , the association ’s attorney .
The association also allows military and U.S. flags .
The couple says it has been the subject of slurs and mockery since the dispute began .
In a May 11 posting on a local blog , a writer said the decorations were offensive and “ If they want to flaunt their preferences in sex partners like that , they need to move into a gay community ” ( Naz Today ) .
The gay couple is being unfairly mocked , and singled out while other non-nationally recognized celebrations are permitted .

The EU does not listen to what the general public wants , according to members of its own parliament .
The shocking finding comes in a report published today by the TaxPayers ' Alliance and ComRes , which surveyed MEPs and the British public on a range of EU issues , and then compared the results .
Asked if the EU listened to the general public , only 41 per cent of MEPs could bring themselves to answer yes .
Thirty per cent said the EU did not listen to the general public , while 29 per cent answered that they neither supported nor opposed the proposition .
The results are a disastrous showing given the respondents are those charged with representing the public in the European parliament .
UK and Irish MEPs were disproportionately concerned about whether the EU listens compared to fellow MEPs from other countries .
When members of the British public were asked the question , only 26 per cent said the EU listened to the public , while 71 per cent disagreed .
A huge majority of respondents - 88 per cent said referendums should be held in member states before significantly expanding EU powers , compared to 50 per cent of MEPs .
There was also a significant level of support for member states breaking EU rules is it is in their national interest .
Seventy - two per cent of the public accepted this , compared to just 23 per cent of MEPs .
Support for the EU continues to remain low in Britain , with just 48 per cent saying it is good for ordinary people , compared to 81 per cent of MEPs .
Matthew Elliott , chief executive of the TaxPayers '
Alliance , said : " These results show the stark difference in opinion between the British people and politicians in Brussels .
" Whilst many MEPs still think the EU is great for everyone , that Britain should join the Euro and that EU rules are sacrosanct , the British public are heading in the opposite direction . "
Europe goes to the polls this week in the largest trans-national elections in history .
Votes will take place over a three day period , with Britain voting on Thursday .
U.S. and Brazilian scientists have discovered that the brain manufactures proteins that act like marijuana at specific receptors in the brain itself .
This discovery may lead to new marijuana - like drugs for managing pain , stimulating appetite , and preventing marijuana abuse .
" Ideally , this development will lead to drugs that bind to and activate the THC receptor , but are devoid of the side effects that limit the usefulness of marijuana , " said Lakshmi A. Devi of the Department of Pharmacology and Systems Therapeutics at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and one of the senior researchers involved in the study .
" It would be helpful to have a drug that activated or blocked the THC receptor , and our findings raise the possibility that this will lead to effective drugs with fewer side effects . "
Scientists made their discovery by first extracting several small proteins , called peptides , from the brains of mice and determining their amino acid sequence .
The extracted proteins were then compared with another peptide previously known to bind to , but not activate , the receptor ( THC ) affected by marijuana .
Out of the extracted proteins , several not only bound to the brain 's THC receptors , but activated them as well .
" The War on Drugs has hit very close to home , " said Gerald Weissmann , M.D. , Editor - in - Chief of The FASEB Journal .
" Last year , scientists found that our skin makes its own marijuana - like substance .
Now , we see that our brain has been making proteins that act directly on the marijuana receptors in our head .
The next step is for scientists to come up with new medicines that eliminate the nasty side of pot — a better joint , so to speak . "
Almost 40 years after the historic Apollo 11 mission , we 'll hear voices from the moon again .
This time , celebrities , ham radio enthusiasts — and perhaps even you — will join the astronauts ' voices .
A massive project to bounce voices from Earth to the moon and back to another spot on Earth will be launched June 26 .
Several former astronauts and other famous people have signed on , and so can one lucky Wired Science reader .
We 've secured a spot for one Tweet to be bounced off the moon , so send your most space - worthy 140 characters to @wiredscience or e-mail betsy_mason@wired.com .
The winner can go to a moon bounce station to personally send the message to the moon .
The Echoes of Apollo project exists thanks to amateur radio operators .
Parabolic antennas , or dishes , around the world will lend their strength to the global moon bounce .
" We are actually sending out radio waves and shaking the electrons of the atoms of the dirt on the moon a quarter of a million miles away , " said Pat Barthelow , a ham radio operator for 43 years and the founder of the moon - bounce project .
" We are jiggling moon dust and there 's enough energy to send back radio waves to us which we convert back to voices .
To me that 's pretty profound . "
The World Moon Bounce Day could set the record for the greatest number of dishes facing the moon at once , even outnumbering the global focus during the first moon walk .
So far , people at dishes in Australia , Europe and the United States have committed to stop their regular space work to track the moon so human voices can echo back 2.5 seconds after being sent .
" We needed to set up inter-visibility between us and Australia , a time when we could both see the moon , so it will be June 26th here and the 27th there , " Barthelow said .
Before any satellites were in orbit , the military experimented with the moon as a means for wireless communications in the 1940s and 1950s .
President Eisenhower even bounced his voice off the moon in 1959 to congratulate Canada on opening the Prince Albert Radar Laboratory : " The transmission of this message by way of the moon — a distance of almost half a million miles — emphasizes the technical importance of your new laboratory and is a specific illustration of the scientific cooperation between Canada and the United States . "
In more recent decades , ham operators have built their own dishes and dedicated their own resources to talk to each other via the moon using voices or Morse code .
But generally , the larger the dish the better the quality , so Barthelow was thrilled when the 150 - foot dish at SRI International in California was recently modified and tested for EME , or Earth - moon - Earth transmissions for the upcoming global bounce .
" The difference in EME signal quality between this dish , and conventional EME antennas would be like listening to U2 in a stadium on a 10 - watt , battery boom box at home plate , with you 500 feet away in the center field seats , compared to hearing U2 over a full 2 - million - watt PA set up for a stadium concert , " Barthelow said .
" It is that radically different . "
SRI principle engineer Michael Cousins and others are donating time to help the amateur operators with the technical challenges of a much larger antenna and a more powerful transmitter , as well as the difficulties of aiming a signal at a spinning moon and receiving the bounce from its uneven surface .
" This is a ' golly gee would n't it be fun ' kind of project , " Cousins said .
" When you have a hobby , you usually like to push yourself a little and learn . "
The impulse to hear your own echo probably goes back to early humans shouting into canyons .
Now , the World Moon Bounce will expand the range and audience of echoes to commemorate the astronauts who first talked from the moon , and offers regular folks a chance to visit the moon — at least vocally .

A WOMAN who admitted to shooting her husband and chopping up his body might be out of jail by the end of 2011 after pleading guilty to manslaughter .
Joyce Chant , 57 , was originally charged with murder , but after a jury was unable to reach a verdict earlier this year she admitted to killing her husband after he produced a gun during an argument in their violent marriage .
Chant said that she felt threatened by Wayne Chant and lost control , shooting him dead and dismembering his body .
Justice Roderick Howie sentenced Chant to a minimum of three years and five months ' jail for manslaughter and 10 months for interfering with human remains .
But he said he did not believe her latest version of events and would have sentenced her on different facts if a jury had found her guilty .
However , he was bound to accept the facts which had been agreed by the Crown when it chose to accept her guilty plea , and sentenced her accordingly .
" She is in my opinion capable of … attempting to manipulate the court , " Justice Howie said .
" I do not believe she is in the slightest way remorseful for the death of her husband . "
“ One night we saw Jennifer Jones get out of a limo , ” he recalls , “ and I thought how elegant she was ; years later , I was doing her house , and I told her that story . ”
Gehry drops stellar names with a frequency made tolerable by his lack of boastfulness .
“ I do n’t know what to make of fame , ” he insists .
“ I see somebody like Brad Pitt , who I know , and what he goes through , and I would n’t want to go through that .
. . .
I only get maybe 1 percent of that , and it ’s scary already . ”
All that notwithstanding , Gehry indicates why hanging out with the rich and famous can help an architect ’s business .
During a trip to Bilbao , Gehry was dragooned by Thomas Krens , mastermind of the New York Guggenheim ’s Basque country offshoot , into joining an all - star motorcycle posse with Jeremy Irons , Diane Von Furstenberg and Barry Diller .
Gehry reconnected with Von Furstenberg , who served on the board of the American Center in Paris , which he designed .
She introduced him to Diller , her entertainment - mogul husband , who later asked Gehry to build the IAC headquarters in New York .
( That pairing was brokered by the real estate developer Marshall Rose : “ I had known his wife , Candy Bergen , for many years , ” Gehry notes . )
Things were n’t so easy before Gehry ascended to celebrity heaven .
Starting in 1965 , he executed a highly creditable series of jobs for America ’s most enlightened postwar commercial builder , James Rouse .
But the architect craved artistic status of a sort he ’d never win as a developer ’s hired hand , and severed that lucrative connection .
Gehry broke out with an audacious 1977 - 78 remake of a Santa Monica bungalow for himself and his young second family .
He enmeshed the pink - shingled exterior in chain - link fencing and corrugated steel , impaled it with an angular wire - glass skylight and exposed the interior ’s wooden lath like a Gordon Matta - Clark house - deconstruction sculpture .
This residential bombshell nailed Gehry ’s avant - garde credentials but left establishment patrons baffled or disgusted .
He lost the commission for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles to the Japanese newcomer Arata Isozaki and seemed destined for another humiliating local rejection when a new home for the Los Angeles Philharmonic was announced in the late 1980s .
Gehry recounts a nightmarish evening while that coveted assignment hung in the balance .
Jennifer Jones and her third husband , the conglomerateur and art collector Norton ­Simon , invited him to their birthday party for David Niven , where the host promoted Gehry to Dorothy Chandler , the imperious dowager of Los Angeles philanthropy .
“ I do n’t like his work , ” Chandler sniffed .
“ And he will not be considered to design a concert hall . ”
Another guest disparaged a nearby Gehry house with a crude epithet , and a servant spilled a tray of buttered vegetables onto the hapless architect .
Alas , Chandler did n’t live long enough to witness the triumphant opening of Gehry ’s Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2003 .
Sited across the street from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion , Gehry ’s pitch - perfect auditorium and the voluptuous forms that envelop it consigned Chandler ’s prissy sub-classical bandbox and its notoriously dead acoustics to the dustbin of architectural ( and musical ) history .
Disney
Hall furthermore proved that Bilbao was no fluke , and that Gehry could never have prevailed without a careerist drive as ferocious as his formidable talent .
Take a moment and read this heartbreaking letter from Dodge dealer George C. Joseph in Melbourne , Florida .
Here is an excerpt :
On Thursday , May 14 , 2009 I was notified that my Dodge franchise , that we purchased , will be taken away from my family on June 9 , 2009 without compensation and given to another dealer at no cost to them …
Our facility was recently totally renovated at Chrysler ’s insistence , incurring a multi-million dollar debt in the form of a mortgage at Sun Trust Bank .
HOW IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CAN THIS HAPPEN ?
THIS IS A PRIVATE BUSINESS NOT A GOVERNMENT ENTITY …
Mark Steyn ’s darkly amusing answer in The Corner to this fellow :
Get real , man .
If you ’re a Yemeni jihadist whose lawyer is now Assistant Deputy Associate Deputy Assistant Attorney - General , you ’re entitled to the full protection of the U.S. Constitution .
The rest of us have to take our chances .
Be thankful your refurbished showroom is n’t being confiscated to re-house Gitmo detainees .
Are you getting it ?
Is it sinking in ?
The government is taking this dealer ’s franchise away from him .
The dealer himself will be stuck with his new car inventory , financed for about $ 3 million .
The only thing he can do is try to sell them all before June 9 , because on June 10 he can’t sell them as new .
Chrysler has not only not offered to buy the vehicles back , but will extend him no factory incentives of any kind beyond the deadline .
Mr. Joseph will have to terminate the employment of 50 people as a direct result of his franchise being confiscated .
Will the Obama regime reduce their absurd “ saved job ” count by this number ?
Anyone care to guess whether he ’ll be getting a federal bailout for that renovation loan ?
How do you go from being a responsible and respected local leader owning and running a 35 - years - and - counting family business to destitute in less than a month ?
Change you can believe in , comrades !

Major Networks Sold Data Starting 2002
For years there has been a global market for off - the - shelf data - mining solutions that deal with analyzing mobile - phone calling records and real - time location information .
ThorpeGlen , VASTech , Kommlabs and Aqsacom are a few of the companies that sell ' passive probing ' data - mining services to governments all over the world , including the United States .
Major networks started to sell location data to any company willing to pay for it , starting in 2002 .

The election results in Iran may reflect the will of the Iranian people .
Many experts are claiming that the margin of victory of incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was the result of fraud or manipulation , but our nationwide public opinion survey of Iranians three weeks before the vote showed Ahmadinejad leading by a more than 2 to 1 margin – greater than his actual apparent margin of victory in Friday 's election .
While western news reports from Tehran in the days leading up to the voting portrayed an Iranian public enthusiastic about Ahmadinejad 's principal opponent , Mir Hossein Mousavi , our scientific sampling from across all 30 of Iran 's provinces showed Ahmadinejad well ahead .
Independent and uncensored nationwide surveys of Iran are rare .
Typically , pre-election polls there are either conducted or monitored by the government and are notoriously untrustworthy .
By contrast , the poll undertaken by our nonprofit organisations from 11 May to 20 May was the third in a series over the past two years .
Conducted by telephone from a neighbouring country , field work was carried out in Farsi by a polling company whose work in the region for ABC News and the BBC has received an Emmy award .
Our polling was funded by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund .
The breadth of Ahmadinejad 's support was apparent in our pre-election survey .
During the campaign , for instance , Mousavi emphasised his identity as an Azeri , the second - largest ethnic group in Iran after Persians , to woo Azeri voters .
Our survey indicated , though , that Azeris favoured Ahmadinejad by 2 to 1 over Mousavi .
Much commentary has portrayed Iranian youth and the internet as harbingers of change in this election .
But our poll found that only a third of Iranians even have access to the internet , while 18 - to - 24 - year - olds comprised the strongest voting bloc for Ahmadinejad of all age groups .
The only demographic groups in which our survey found Mousavi leading or competitive with Ahmadinejad were university students and graduates , and the highest - income Iranians .
When our poll was taken , almost a third of Iranians were also still undecided .
Yet the baseline distributions we found then mirror the results reported by the Iranian authorities , indicating the possibility that the vote is not the product of widespread fraud .
Some might argue that the professed support for Ahmadinejad we found simply reflected fearful respondents ' reluctance to provide honest answers to pollsters .
Yet the integrity of our results is confirmed by the politically risky responses Iranians were willing to give to a host of questions .
For instance , nearly four in five Iranians – including most Ahmadinejad supporters – said they wanted to change the political system to give them the right to elect Iran 's supreme leader , who is not currently subject to popular vote .
Similarly , Iranians chose free elections and a free press as their most important priorities for their government , virtually tied with improving the national economy .
These were hardly " politically correct " responses to voice publicly in a largely authoritarian society .
Indeed , and consistently among all three of our surveys over the past two years , more than 70 % of Iranians also expressed support for providing full access to weapons inspectors and a guarantee that Iran will not develop or possess nuclear weapons , in return for outside aid and investment .
And 77 % of Iranians favoured normal relations and trade with the United States , another result consistent with our previous findings .
Iranians view their support for a more democratic system , with normal relations with the United States , as consonant with their support for Ahmadinejad .
They do not want him to continue his hard - line policies .
Rather , Iranians apparently see Ahmadinejad as their toughest negotiator , the person best positioned to bring home a favourable deal – rather like a Persian Nixon going to China .
Allegations of fraud and electoral manipulation will serve to further isolate Iran and are likely to increase its belligerence and intransigence against the outside world .
Before other countries , including the United States , jump to the conclusion that the Iranian presidential elections were fraudulent , with the grave consequences such charges could bring , they should consider all independent information .
The fact may simply be that the re-election of President Ahmadinejad is what the Iranian people wanted .

One Body , Two Souls – Amazing story about siamese twins
Siamese twins .
Two girls in one body .
Abigail “ Abby ” Loraine Hensel and Brittany “ Britty ” Lee Hensel ( born March 7 , 1990 , Carver County , Minnesota , United States ) , are highly symmetric dicephalic parapagus conjoined twins , and further , tribrachius , bipedus .
They have two spines and separate half - sacrums , which converge distally within a slightly broad pelvis .
They each control and sense their corresponding arm and leg ; a third , rudimentary central arm was amputated in infancy .
( Siamese twins )
Abigail and Brittany Hensel ’s parents are Patty , a registered nurse , and Mike Hensel , a carpenter and landscaper .
The twins have a younger brother named Dakota , or Koty for short , and a younger sister named Morgan .
Brittany ’s head is about 15 degrees laterally outward , while Abby ’s head tilts laterally outward about 5 degrees , causing Brittany to appear to be of slightly less stature .
They were raised in New Germany , Minnesota and attended Lutheran High School affiliated with the Missouri Synod in Mayer , Minnesota .
At age 12 , they underwent surgery at Gillette Children ’s Specialty Healthcare to correct scoliosis and to expand their chest cavity to prevent future difficulties with breathing .
Each of the twins manages one side of their conjoined body and they are quite ambidextrous and coordinated in both their arms and legs when both hands or both legs are required .
By coordinating their efforts , they are able to walk , run and ride a bicycle normally — all tasks that they learned at a normal speed .
They each write with their corresponding hand .
Together , they can type on a computer keyboard at a normal speed .
Their sense of touch is partitioned to their own body half , which shades off at the midsagittal plane such that there is a small amount of overlap at their midline .
In April 2006 , they appeared in Joined for Life , a documentary produced by Advanced Medical , distributed on the Discovery Health Channel .
They also appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show on April 8 and April 29 , 1996 .
In April 1996 , the twins were featured on the cover of Life under the caption “ One Body , Two Souls ” , and their daily lifestyle was depicted in the corresponding article titled The Hensels ’ Summer .
Life followed up with another story in September 1998 .
In 2003 , an updated story of them at age 11 ( filmed in 2001 ) was published in Time and again in Life .
They appeared in a follow - up documentary on The Learning Channel on December 17 , 2006 filmed around the time of their 16th birthday , in which they discuss dealing with puberty and getting their driver ’s licenses .
In the summer of 2006 they had a vacation in Texas at the home of a family whose dicephalus twin girls had died at a few hours old .
They both successfully passed their driver ’s license exam , both the written and driving tests .
They had to take the tests twice , once for each twin .
Abby controls the pedals , radio , heat , defogger etc. , Brittany controls the turn signal and lights and together they control the steering wheel .
They also want to visit the UK , so they can both have a chance to use their opposite controls .
They both graduated from high school in 2008 .
They began college at Bethel University in St. Paul , Minnesota , USA .
In conversation , they are clearly distinct persons , with distinct likes and dislikes .
Despite sharing a body , the twins ’ preferences in food , clothing color , etc. differ .
Some of their clothes are altered by their seamstress so that they have two separate necklines in order to emphasize their individuality .
They will usually have separate meals , but sometimes will share a single meal for the sake of convenience ( e.g. , each takes a bite of the same hamburger ) .
Abigail is better at mathematics and Brittany is better at writing .
For tasks such as responding to e-mail , they type and respond as one , anticipating each other ’s feelings with little verbal communication between them .
In such cases as the latter , their choice of grammatical person is to use the first person singular out of habit when they agree , but when their responses do differ , they use their names in the third person singular .
There is some concern about their ability to have continued good health because only four known sets of conjoined twins who share an undivided torso and two legs have ever survived into adulthood , and most have congenital heart defects or other organ anomalies .
None have shown up in the Hensels ’ case .
They have so far had no desire to make themselves available for any medical studies .
They intend to make a rather limited number of media appearances in the future , primarily just to appease the world ’s curiosity and to reduce the number of people who might otherwise be taken aback by their unusual body configuration .
They intensely dislike [ 9 ] being stared at or photographed by strangers while going about their private lives .
They expect to date , get married , and have children .
They hope that by providing some information about themselves they will be able to lead otherwise fairly typical social lives as together they continue to make new friends .

[ Editor ’s note : A lot of web startups we talk to these days seem very similar to a lot of other web startups we talk to — from social networks to Firefox plugins to micro-messaging services to a long list of others .
We want to cover companies that are clearly doing something unique and interesting .
So here ’s a great post that we ’re republishing with permission from investor David Shen , with his pointers on how to take a me - too product and make it a winner . ]
I believe the universe of internet businesses has become extremely crowded in the last few years .
In the early days , you could easily come out with something new because there were n’t that many competitors out there .
Now , it ’s hard to find somebody who is n’t working on something similar to what you ’re thinking about .
So competition is fierce and many times you ’ll find entrenched competitors with a lot of product inertia and a great head start .
The other huge problem is on the consumer side .
Consumers are deluged by new products and services all the time .
They have overload and just keep to the products they know best , and need to have a really good reason to change and move from another service to a new entrant .
We saw this first in the past with email addresses ; Yahoo Mail users were hesitant to move because the cost of changing your email address was super high and thus user retention was very high .
Now add what makes up our digital lives on services like flickr ( all our pictures that we ’ve uploaded for half a decade now ) , or facebook ( our friends are all here , plus their interconnections ) , or linkedin ( our business connections are all here , plus all their historical connections ) .
The cost of moving has become so high because we ’ve invested so much time and effort into those services and we do n’t want to redo that , let alone adding the cost of learning a new service .
As an early stage investor , I ’ve found that this makes picking companies exponentially harder and it ’s a shame .
I meet a lot of smart entrepreneurs with some really great ideas , but then I do some research online and find that there are others who are working on something similar or in a close enough space to be competitive .
Then I start to get worried about their prospects .
You can find tons of books on the subject of competition and winning despite having entrenched competitors .
In general , I have found that entrepreneurs are doing what they should be doing to attack a crowded market .
These are things like ( my thanks to Andrew Chen for helping me with this list ) :
1. Innovate on the product experience ( ie. Posterous vs. WordPress ) .
2. Business model changes , where you are going free ( or freemium ) for a product that ’s usually subscription ( or fixed charge ) .
3 . Changing the market where you ’re going long tail instead of hitting the larger market ( ie. casual games versus hardcore games ) .
4 . Change in distribution model , where you are delivering something as a service rather than a download , or bundled into an existing thing ( ie. Facebook app ) instead of a standalone thing .
5. Change in branding .
An example is where you cater to an upscale prestige market or niche market instead of a mass brand , or vice versa like taking a niche product and making it available to the masses .
6 . Create a business that is better , out of a larger part of another business ( ie .
Lefora created a message board hosting product for those who do n’t want all the bells and whistles of a full social networking product ) .
7. Innovate on design , which appeals to those who want a similar product but one that looks / feels better .
8 . Offering more features on a product , or customization on product .
And the big , traditional way of taking a new entrant into a crowded market :
9 . Mass advertising to gain broad awareness and induce trial and adoption of new product in face of existing competitors .
So I am not saying it ’s not possible to win against a crowded marketplace .
My issue is with early stage startups : in order to win in a crowded marketplace , early stage startups often do n’t have enough resources to last long enough to compete effectively and win .
While a lot of the above can be implemented , growth time is limited by whether or not you have enough capital and revenue to survive until you run out .
To me , if you ’re developing a me - too product , it ’s ultimately going to boil down to a marketing game more than in any other situation .
You can develop the best product or service , but if nobody knows about it because they ’re busy using something else , then you ’re still dead .
So distribution for a me - too product is critical .
In the past and present , large corporations could do this because they had lots of money to launch large advertising campaigns .
They knew distribution channels and could insert their new product there .
They had contacts in their market and it was straightforward to get word out that they had a new product even if it was similar to existing products .
As a new startup , you may not have those channels and contacts established , and certainly you do n’t have money to spend on advertising plastered on the Superbowl , magazines , online , and elsewhere .
However , once you finish your product using one or more of the strategies above , you need to jump to strategy number 9 as soon as possible and get it out to consumers .
You do n’t have time to wait until people notice you ; you need to get noticed .
Some possible ways of doing this :
1. Buy advertising .
As an early stage startup , this is the least viable unless you somehow have enough money to do this .
Lead gen advertising can be better than CPM based advertising as you ’ll be able to pay only on a referral , but still this costs money .
Let ’s move onto cheaper alternatives .
2. Marketing that involves barter space .
You trade something of value for advertising space on their side .
Something of value can be advertising space on your site , or donation to their cause for charities .
3. Word of Mouth Marketing .
Contact bloggers , magazines , users and get them to try and talk about your product .
Getting in the NYTimes is a big traffic driver , as well as many other national circulation magazines .
Online publications like C|Net and The Huffington Post can also be great .
Twitter is also a great up and coming means for getting your word out .
4 . Get distribution partners .
Existing companies can add your product on their sites and can help you promote it .
This is usually in deeper partnership such that it goes beyond just buying ad space .
You look for exclusivity in contracts and features that your product has that enhance an existing company ’s product and prestige .
5. Viral marketing .
This is a very hard avenue to execute , which is to start with a few users and then it blossoms outward to many .
Determining how your product can be viral can be an elusive game and if you do n’t hit on it early , you could waste a lot of time tweaking and hoping that something you create will be virally popular and spread .
In working with a few startups , I am disheartened by the fact that the importance of distribution is still not well understood .
The leading thought is that “ if I build something great , then everyone will come find me . ”
Unfortunately , that is rarely the case in this crowded marketplace , and most early stage companies do n’t have enough time to let people just wander around until they find out about the product .
They did not do enough work to go out and contact bloggers .
They did n’t go out and try to woo corporate partners to see if they would help them get their message out .
They just waited for users to come and they did n’t come in great enough quantity to support their business by the time their money ran out .
So do n’t let your product fail simply because you ca n’t induce trial .
Remember , you have developed a me - too product , one that users already have a solution for and switching costs and barriers may be too high for them to take action to look for a better solution .
You need to get them to know that your solution exists , and attract them to try it out – and since you ’re an early stage startup , you need to do this ASAP to give yourself enough time to let consumer adoption grab hold and ultimately take off , all before your money runs out .

Robots are officially on the battlefield — UAVs like the Predator and Reaper patrol the skies while militarized bomb - disposal robots like the Talon detonate explosives on the ground .
But where are the humanoids ?
Roboticist and author Daniel H. Wilson makes the case for a humanoid robot army .

A humanoid robot is a general - purpose robot that looks a lot like a person , complete with a head , torso , arms and legs .
The " total package " humanoid can walk bipedally , like a person , and use its hands to dexterously manipulate objects in the world .
Current prototypes like the Honda ASIMO can deliver tea and politely shake hands with their human masters , but based on some great sci- fi movies , humanoid robots are supposed to be terrors on the battlefield — walking titanium endoskeletons crunching over human skulls and mowing down pesky humans with massive handheld Gatling guns .

Will we ever really see a humanoid robot army ?
I think so , and here are my top five reasons why .
1 . There is a one - to - one mapping between the human and the humanoid body .
Robots are n't yet smart enough to play without supervision .
That 's why human soldiers control unmanned aerial vehicles from thousands of miles away by twiddling joysticks .
It is n't easy , but flying a plane through empty space is child 's play compared to maneuvering a ground - based robot through rubble and wreckage .
And what if you need to do something more complicated than just stepping over a curb , like defusing a bomb ?
It 's called telepresence .
With telepresence , a person feels as though they are the robot by controlling the robot 's body and seeing through its eyes .
Human - shaped robots are infinitely easier to manipulate because there is a one - to - one mapping between man and machine .
Instead of shoving around a non-intuitive joystick , slide your hands into gloves that map your fingers to robot fingers thousands of miles away .
Now put your human expertise to work , without putting your human butt in danger .
2. Humanoid robots take advantage of human environments and equipment .
Nothing beats a tank for crossing the desert , but what about crossing a living room ?
Every human city is designed for a very specific type of animal : homo sapiens .
We humans come in a very specific range of sizes and weights , and our environments tend to have specific temperature , vibration and noise limits — all of which simplify the problem of designing a robot .
Humanoids are naturally suited to navigating environments designed for humans ; they can walk through doorways , climb steps , and see over counters and furniture .

Along with our cities , most military supplies are designed for use by humans .
That means a humanoid robot can wear human body armor , boots and camouflage .
In addition , it can fire standard - issue weapons and ammunition , removing a need for specially - designed weaponry .
Humanoids could also potentially pilot human vehicles .
Rather than creating an autonomous vehicle from scratch , just put a humanoid robot in the driver 's seat of a standard vehicle .
And when a robot squad is on the go and under fire , it always helps to be able to scavenge enemy weapons and improvise .
The infrastructure is there , and humanoid robots exploit it .
3. Humanoid robots are easier to train .
War is largely improvised , and that means learning new tricks on the fly .
So , how do you teach a robot comrade how to defuse a new type of coffee - can landmine ?
Without a degree in engineering , you probably do n't .
But given a humanoid robot , intuitive training approaches are available to regular soldiers .
An easy but tedious method is to physically push the robot's limbs through the proper series of movements .
Alternately , take direct control through teleoperation and then perform the activity yourself .
The robot then just needs to remember how you did it .
Advertisement
Ideally , however , a robot can be trained just like a person — by watching .
Robots who learn by demonstration can be quickly trained by ordinary people who do not speak robot - ese or do any programming .
That 's because it 's how we learn from each other .
The trainer simply performs the task ( e.g. , a flying scissor kick ) and the robot watches and intuits how to do it .
Humanoids are much better at learning by demonstration , thanks to that one - to - one mapping between its body and yours .
4. Teamwork is easier between humans and humanoids .
It is doubtful that robot armies will operate completely autonomously in the near future .
Human - robot teams will likely be the norm , as they are today .
Therefore , it 's important to make sure that human and robot allies can work together without stepping on each others ' toes .
And that means they 've got to have good communication .
Advertisement
Human combat teams communicate and cooperate using language and gestures , and by paying attention to each other 's facial expressions and emotions .
Robot warriors that recognize human body language will be able to make fast decisions in loud , hazardous environments .
Perhaps even more important , a human soldier should be able to understand what a robot is thinking naturally , by reading its body language instead of looking up an error code in an instruction manual .
Using the highly familiar human form - factor creates a natural communication channel that allows humanoids to cooperate with humans in chaotic environments where split - second decisions are the norm .
5 . The locals could potentially interact with humanoid robots .
War is becoming less about conventional fighting on a mass scale and more about cultural awareness .
Last month , President Obama unveiled plans to send hundreds of " social scientists " along with soldiers to Iraq , to counsel the military on local customs .
Relative to the faceless robots currently in use , a humanoid robot provides the opportunity for some kind of natural human interaction with non-combatants .
Instead of an impersonal unmanned ground vehicle wrecking through walls or an unmanned aerial vehicle dropping bombs from afar , humanoid robots ( armed or unarmed ) could patrol areas wearing local garb , speaking the local language , and obeying local customs .
How P.C. — or just freaky — is that ?

On the other hand , humanoid robots can be horribly terrifying .
Mind games are a part of every battle .
During World War II , aviators painted snarling teeth on the noses of their fighter planes .
Nowadays ( and back then ) , bombs have funny messages written on them , like " Boom shacka lacka , " and " You want fries with that ? "
Now imagine the enemy reaction on Robot D - Day , when thousands of super - powered humanoid robots march out of the crashing surf , bullets plinking harmlessly from their razor - sharp gilded breast - plates as death metal blares from their metal mouth speaker grilles .

Terrified yet ?
Well calm down , sissy ; humanoid robots are n't on the battlefield , yet .
But they might be soon , thanks to their natural ability to communicate and cooperate with humans , the ease with which they can operate in our environments and use our tools , and the terrible fear that blossoms in the heart of man upon laying eyes on the great and horrifying visage of the humanoid robot war machine .

Dust storms accelerated by a warming climate have covered the Rocky Mountains with dirt whose heat - trapping properties have caused snowpacks to melt weeks earlier than normal , worrying officials in Colorado about drastic water shortages by late summer .
Snowpacks from the San Juan Mountains to the Front Range have either completely melted or will be gone within the next two weeks , said Tom Painter , director of the Snow Optics Laboratory at the University of Utah and a leading expert on snowmelt .
The rapid melting is linked to a spate of intense dust storms that kick up dirt and sand that in turn are deposited on snow - topped mountains .
The dust darkens the snow , allowing the surface to absorb more heat from the sun .
This warms the snow -- and the air above it -- significantly , studies show .
The problem has been particularly acute in the semiarid Colorado Plateau region encompassing parts of Utah , Colorado , New Mexico and Arizona .
An unprecedented 12 large dust storms have occurred so far this year in the region , and at least two more are projected in the coming months , officials say .
" Already we have more than doubled the amount of dust we 've typically observed during the last six years , " Painter said .
The early snowmelt could spell disaster for thousands of farmers and ranchers in the region who depend on slowly melting snow to provide water flows over the dry summer months , said Scott Brinton , assistant division engineer in the Colorado Division of Water Resources '
Southwest regional office .
" Those people who were relying on the mountain snowpack are going to have difficulty later in the year , " Brinton said .
There are also broader implications as arid Western states wage costly legal battles over access to water supplies that are dwindling , in part , because of early snowmelt .
Colorado -- which is under an agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation to divert roughly 38 million gallons a year from the San Juan River Basin to thirsty cities in New Mexico , including Albuquerque and Santa Fe -- now fears it may not be able to meet the terms of the water transfer agreement as the snow melt arrives early and flows downstream .
Meanwhile , managers are working to empty reservoirs as quickly as possible across southern Colorado and New Mexico as huge volumes of melt water course down mountain streams .
Rapidly melting snow in the San Juan Mountains forced Reclamation managers last week to release water from the El Vado Reservoir in north - central New Mexico at its fastest rate in four decades , said Mary Perea Carlson , an agency spokeswoman .
" When it started coming down so rapidly , we realized we 'd better make some room , " Carlson said .
But once the water is gone , it is gone for the year .
" There 's not a whole lot we can do about it , " Brinton said .
" We 're telling people , ' You 'll be getting your water early this year , so use it while it lasts . ' "
A growing problem
Early snowmelt is not a new problem the West , but its causes are becoming increasingly well known to scientists who have studied the phenomenon .
Dust storms , one of the main contributors to the problem , are a key culprit , and they promise to grow worse as grazing , mining and increased recreational use remove vegetative cover and to expose loose soils to wind .
And the problem could grow worse as the Obama administration pushes to open millions of acres of federal land across the West to renewable energy development , including wind turbines , solar arrays and geothermal plants ( Land Letter , May 7 , 2009 ) .
Construction of these projects , along with the construction of tens of thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to carry renewable electricity to population centers , has the potential to disturb a great deal of parched land , creating ideal conditions for dust storms , said Jayne Belnap , a U.S. Geological Survey research ecologist in Moab , Utah .
" I 'm not saying we have to stop energy development , but we 've got to be smart about it , " Belnap said .
Humans exacerbate the problem in other ways , too .
The Department of Energy 's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory , in a groundbreaking study released in January , found that soot pollution emitted from vehicle tailpipes and industry smokestacks are helping to melt snowpacks from the Rockies to the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges .
( Land Letter , Jan. 22 ) .
Like dust , airborne soot is carried on wind currents to higher elevations where it settles on the snow - topped mountains , creating a dark - colored dirt layer that absorbs solar energy and melts the snow .
It is all part of a cycle , researchers say , in which the warming climate at lower elevations creates conditions that exacerbate pollution problems in the snow - topped mountain peaks , reducing the the snow 's reflective capacity and soaking up more heat .
This year is a classic example , said Painter , whose Snow Optics Laboratory operates a system of monitors that measures snow reflectivity across the Rockies .
Researchers in Painters ' group realized the West was poised for a bad dust season when snow and rainfall all but stopped in the Colorado Plateau region in January , February and March -- typically high - volume precipitation months .
Meanwhile , warming temperatures at lower elevations prompted plants to bloom before they had sufficient water , and the resulting dead vegetation exposed the parched soil underneath , creating more dust .
" We were expecting this , " Painter said .
" But even when you 're expecting something you do n't always necessarily want to believe your eyes . "
Shifting sands , rolling dunes
Another growing source of dust is the vast sand dune landscape that stretches thousands of square miles across the Four Corners region of northeast Arizona and northwest New Mexico , which over the last century has converted from a rolling grass prairie to a kind of desert plateau .
Margaret Hiza , a USGS scientist who has studied change on the Navajo Nation 's sprawling Four Corners reservation , said steadily warming temperatures have created drought - like conditions that have killed the vegetation that held the sandy soils in place .
The exposed sand is whipped by high winds , allowing the dunes to spread rapidly across the Navajo reservation , where they threaten to smother fragile ecosystems .
Native plants like rice grass and purple sage that are wiped out are replaced by foreign invasive species such as Russian thistle or tumbleweed .
The non-native plants do not hold the soils together as well , further exacerbating the problem of loosening soils .
The blowing sand also causes a number of other problems , including respiratory distress for local residents and disrupting highway traffic .
" It could just turn the whole Navajo Nation into a dust bowl , " said Hiza .
Painter and his colleagues , studying a disastrous 2006 dust storm season that helped melt snowpacks in southwest Colorado 's San Juan Mountains , determined that the dust came from hundreds of miles away , including Navajo country .
" There 's good evidence that northeast Arizona is strong in contributing to dust deposition in the mountains , " Painter said .
No easy solutions
While the problem is increasingly well - documented , solutions are proving more elusive .
While some have called for restoring native grasses and other soil - stabilizing species across the region , such activities cannot occur so long as the soils continue to blow away .
Hiza , the USGS scientist , is organizing a pilot project this summer near Winslow , Ariz. , that will attempt to replicate successful dune stabilization efforts in northern China .
The project calls for embedding straw mats about 10 square feet in diameter into the dunes , with about 4 inches of mat exposed above the dune line .
While the mats allow some sand to move across the surface , they help stabilize the subsurface and hold the dune intact .
" It 's tricky to try and slow moving sand down , " she said .
" But once it stops moving , plants can start growing on it again . "
Other options , including those aimed more directly at water supply , are to seed clouds with the hopes of increasing snow volumes in the high - elevation mountains .
Local governments and power companies spend tens of millions of dollars a year on such seeding projects that have been shown to increase snowpack .
But , experts say , such efforts are increasingly undermined by dust and soot accumulations that increase the melt rate of snowpacks , regardless of their depth .
And the problems will persist as long as the Western climate continues to warm , perhaps by as much as 7 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 90 years , according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
If such conditions persist , Painter said this year 's dust storm intensity and early snowmelt could become the norm across the region .
Belnap , the USGS research ecologist , said focused attention could help reverse the trend , but it will take more effort on the part of government and landowners .
" We do not manage for dust .
We do n't even think about it , " she said .
" I think the time is coming where we are going to have to decide we need to think about dust . "

Dressed in jeans and a tight headscarf , she stood in a makeshift courtroom with plastic chairs and ­tables and a television set hanging from the wall .
She barely said a word .
At the moment of sentencing , when the chief military judge in the Palestinian city of Jenin jailed her for 20 years ' hard labour , Taghrid al - Tibi held one hand to her face in shock and sadness .
Then she was led away .
Divorced , unemployed and only 21 years old , she was one of the few Palestinian women convicted of treason .
Her crime : collaboration with the Israeli security services .
Hers is a grim story of an unhappy life and naivety .
Enticed out of the occupied West Bank and into Israel , then plunged into a high - risk spying effort that lasted for five months until her capture , Tibi was lucky to escape with her life : collaborators , who are nearly always men , are so reviled among Palestinians that many are either shot in the street or sentenced to years on death row .
She did not speak to journalists after her hearing last week , but accounts from prosecutors involved in her case paint a scattered picture of Tibi 's life .
Originally from Tulkarem , she was living with her family in Nablus , in the north of the occupied West Bank .
She attended school until the age of 16 but then her father ordered her to marry an older man .
It was an unhappy marriage : she told the court that he had forced her into prostitution .
Within a few years she was divorced and increasingly cut off from her family .
Several months ago Tibi met an Arab - Israeli in Nablus , named Mahmoud , who persuaded her to join him on a trip back into Israel .
She agreed , though it should perhaps have raised her suspicions when he arranged a rare permit for her to leave the West Bank .
The couple slept together and then he took her to an office in Tel Aviv , where Israeli security service agents apparently confronted her with a video of her in bed with the man , the prosecutors said .
They threatened to pass the video back to her family unless she helped them and also apparently promised her 100,000 shekels ( £ 15,500 ) if she would pass them regular information about a group of militants in Nablus .
She told her story in a six - page signed affidavit for the prosecutors .
It began with her name , date of birth and her background .
Then she said : " Five months ago I met this guy , Mahmoud , I did n't know his full name .
He was working inside the Green Line [ within Israel ] .
I sat with him a couple of times in the park .
He took me on a visit .
We went to Tel Aviv .
Inside the offices there was an Israeli commander and he knew everything about me .
" He asked me to relax for an hour and then he said he wanted me to give him information on 10 wanted men in exchange for 100,000 shekels . "
She returned to Nablus and for five months she spent time with several ­militants , men she knew only by the pseudonyms they used to protect their identity .
She would regularly head out to the Israeli military checkpoint at Hawara , on the southern edge of the city , and pass on information to an Israeli contact .
However , she learned little about the militants or their activities and her information was always of little value , the prosecutors said .
None of the militants she met were arrested or killed .
Eventually the militants became suspicious of her questions .
They confronted her , she confessed and then in May they handed her over to the Palestinian authorities in Nablus .
At the end of the affidavit , she was asked if she wanted to add anything to her statement .
Tibi answered : " I 'm really sorry for what I 've done but I 'm glad that I have n't been the reason for anybody getting hurt . "
Tibi's case was passed to the military court and Major Alam Dalbeh , the military prosecutor in Jenin , sat with her in his second - floor office for an interrogation .
She volunteered the entire story , he said .
" Her father married her off when she was 16 and her husband was corrupt and immoral , " said Dalbeh .
" All these things contributed to her becoming a collaborator , but the law is the law .
Still , it was very hard for us to question her .
She confessed very fast , faster than in any other case like this that I 've dealt with before .
She was very sad .
She kept saying : ' I 'm sorry .
I wo n't do it again . '
She said : ' I 'm a victim of my father and my husband . ' "
She was offered the chance to hire a lawyer to defend herself , but refused and was given a court lawyer .
None of her family appeared at court for the hearing .
Prosecutors said her sentence of hard labour meant she faced years of menial tasks inside the jail , mostly cleaning and washing .
She may have to serve the full 20 years , although it is more likely that she will be pardoned well before her sentence ends – the Palestinian president has the authority to pardon prisoners and often does so , usually on religious holidays .
However , since collaboration is such a reviled crime in Palestinian society and given that her family appears to have disowned her , she is likely to face another challenge in finding a place in society when she is eventually freed .
Dalbeh , who has prosecuted other collaborators in the past , said the crime was seen as " very disgraceful " in Palestinian society .
" Many members of the resistance have been killed or arrested in the past because of collaborators , because of people like her .
We are in the stage of building a Palestinian state and such collaborators are affecting the establishment of the state , " he said .
Other cases had also involved sexual entrapment , Dalbeh said , or the promises of permits to enter Israel or visas to live in countries abroad .
" Their tricks are very well known to us , " he said .
" They used her like a slice of lemon , " said Mohammad Hamashe , another prosecutor .
" They squeezed the juice out of her and then threw her away with the rubbish . "
At a glance
According to B'Tselem , the Israeli human rights group , 26 Palestinians have been sentenced for crimes of treason or collaborating since the Palestinian Authority was established in 1994 .
Some prisoners have escaped or died in jail , others have had their sentences commuted by the president .
B'Tselem 's figures show only one execution for treason – that of a 27 - year - old man from Rafah , Gaza , who was killed in January 2001 at the beginning of the second intifada , the most recent Palestinian uprising .
But the statistics do not tell the whole story .
Many collaborators are rounded up before they reach court and shot in the street by militants .
Nearly all have been men .
It could be considered an air traffic control system for birds who have flown perilously off course .
A wind farm in southern Texas , situated on a flight path used by millions of birds each autumn and spring , is pioneering the use of radar technology to avoid deadly collisions between a 2,500 lb rotating blade and bird .
US wind farms kill about 7,000 birds a year , according to a recent study .
Other studies of individual wind farms suggest a higher toll on bats and birds , who crash into towers , blades , power lines and other installations .
Estimates from a single wind farm in Altamont , California showed as many as 1,300 birds of prey killed each year – or about three a day .
Such direct threats to wildlife , and concerns for habitats , have increasingly pitted conservationists against the renewable energy industry .
A handful of wind power projects in the US have been shelved because of wildlife concerns .
But new radar technology now in use at the Peñascal wind farm in Texas claims to have found a balance between competing environmental concerns – taking action against global warming and protecting wildlife – by protecting migrating birds at times of peak danger .
The 202MW farm , operated by the Spanish firm , Iberdrola Renewables , is the first in the world to use radar systems to enable it to shut down automatically if bad weather hits in peak migration times .
The installation , which opened late last month , uses radar systems originally developed for Nasa and the US Air Force to detect approaching birds from as far as four miles away , analyse weather conditions , and then determine in real time whether they are in danger of flying into the rotating blades .
If they are , the turbines are programmed to shut down , restarting once the birds are safely on their way , said Gary Andrews , the chairman of DeTect , Inc , the Florida company that developed the technology .
The system spots the birds and assesses their altitude , numbers and the visibility .
" With all these pieces coming together properly ... the turbines will shut down , " said Andrews .
Conservationists however are sceptical of such an easy fix .
They argue that wind farms should still be sited away from migration routes in the first place , and that the technology does nothing to solve the problem of installations that disturb bird and animal habitats and nesting grounds .
" The bottom line with wind energy is that it has great potential but it must be done correctly , " said Doug Inkley , a senior scientist at the National Wildlife Federation .
" The windiest site may not be the most suitable and one may have to live with having less windy conditions and less impact on wildlife . "
Even in Texas – where there are virtually no environmental restrictions on wind farms – there was controversy when the Peñascal project was first proposed and local conservationist organisations tried to block the project in the courts .
The Peñascal wind farm is located on the Central Flyway , a main route for migratory birds in the Americas .
Millions of birds funnel through the narrow air corridor during the semiannual migration .
A study in the autumn of 2007 found 4,000 birds an hour passing overhead .
More than 30 species of warbler alone fly the route , along with waterfowl , raptors , and hawks .
The area is also known as a nesting ground for reddish egret , which the Audubon Society views as threatened , terns and pelicans .
In ordinary circumstances , the birds would be thousands of feet above the wind farm , passing the turbines without incident .
But that can change dramatically in a sudden storm .
A sudden cold snap , like the legendary Texan " Blue Northern " , can prove fatal for migrating birds , bringing strong head winds and fog .
The birds , which typically fly at night , become disoriented and exhausted , elevating the risk they will lose altitude and crash into 400ft wind towers along their route , wildlife experts say .
" If inclement weather hits the birds that are aloft at that point may be very vulnerable , " said Christopher Shackleford , an ornithologist with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department .
Andrews says his radar systems can avoid such consequences – and at relatively little cost to the wind farm .
Forecasts suggest the wind farm would be forced to close only between 40 to 60 hours during peak migration times .
The US Air Force has been using similar technologies for more than a decade .
Nasa also turned to such systems after a turkey buzzard flew into the Discovery shuttle moments after its launch in 2005 .
The radar sets developed by DeTect draw on a network of 148 weather radar to provide real - time information about bird activity .
It is updated every six minutes .
The wind power industry has used such data before when planning wind farms , Andrews said .
It is illegal , under US law , to kill migratory birds or damage their nesting areas .
But this is the first time that a wind farm will use such data in real time .
Andrews 's company is also working on a variation that will allow wind farms to detect raptor if they start diving to close to the turbines as they chase down their prey .
Conservationists are reserving judgment .
" The wind energy industry makes bold claims , and they need to prove them , " said Andrew Kasner , director of bird conservation for Audubon Texas .
He added : " It 's possible for them to do [ switch off the turbines ] , but I do n't know whether they would do it during peak wind time . "

Last Easter Sunday , 11 - year - old Kara Neumann of Weston , Wisconsin , lay motionless on her bed , too weak to walk or speak .
If her parents had called the hospital that day , Kara might have lived .
Instead , Dale and Leilani — followers of the Unleavened Bread Ministry , an online church that shuns medical intervention — knelt in prayer beside her .
Kara died a few hours later of diabetic ketoacidosis , a result of undiagnosed and untreated juvenile diabetes .
Are Dale and Leilani guilty of reckless endangerment ?
That ’s a question juries will start to answer this week as Leilani stands trial May 14 .
( Dale will be tried separately in June . )
If convicted , each parent faces up to 25 years in prison .
“ The free exercise clause of the First Amendment protects religious belief , but not necessarily conduct , ” Judge Vincent Howard of Marathon County Circuit Court wrote when he ruled that the Neumanns must stand trial on charges brought by state attorney Jill Falstad .
Howard has ordered all parties in the case not to speak to the media .
The highly anticipated trial has opened a new front in the long - running war between some religious communities and the medical establishment over children ’s health care .
“ We are not commanded in scripture to send people to the doctor , ” Unleavened Bread Ministries preacher David Eells said in a statement to his followers , “ but to meet their needs through prayer and faith . ”
Under current Wisconsin law , his followers are n’t commanded by the state , either .
Part of the legacy of the 1996 Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act , which included a landmark exemption for parents who do not seek medical care for their children for religious purposes , is that parents cannot be accused of child abuse or negligent homicide if they genuinely believed that calling God , instead of a doctor , was the best option available .
While all states give social service authorities the right to intervene in cases of child neglect , criminal codes in more than half also provide additional protection for religious parents who forgo mainstream medical treatment .
Sen. Lena Taylor ( D - Milwaukee ) and the Church of Christ , Scientist in Wisconsin are currently working on legislation that may further impact children ’s health care by creating an “ affirmative defense ” for religious parents who choose “ faith healing ” over mainstream medicine .
In light of Kara ’s high - profile case , faith - healing communities around the country are worried about losing the right to treat their children according to their religious beliefs .
“ The way the law is worded right now is confusing and makes it seem like we have a shield to recklessly endanger children , ” says Joe Farkas , legislative affairs representative for the Church of Christ , Scientist in Wisconsin .
“ Our church loves children and we want to protect children … We want to have an ‘ affirmative defense ’ where parents relying on Christian Science treatment are given a fair opportunity to explain why they believed their action was in the best interest of their child , ” he adds .
Christian Science , developed by Church of Christ , Scientist founder Mary Baker Eddy in the late 19th century , believes “ Infinite goodness , realized in prayer , heals . ”
One Wisconsin - based Christian Science website features a montage of children ’s drawings thanking God for healing everything from a severed thumb to a pet rat .
Not everyone is convinced that the Church of Christ , Scientist puts children before dogma .
“ Sen .
Taylor should be deeply suspicious of their requests , ” says former Christian Scientist Rita Swan , executive director of the nonprofit Children ’s Health Care Is A Legal Duty .
“ The Christian Science church lobbies around the country for religious exemptions , ” notes Swan , who dedicated her life to “ protecting children from abusive religious and cultural practices ” after watching her infant die of meningitis — another curable disease .
“ Our son was having convulsions and the faith practitioner said we had to look at the positive side — he was gritting his teeth because he was planning an amazing achievement , ” said Swan .
“ Only when it was too late did we learn that symptoms of healing and divine intervention were actually signs of illness and suffering . ”
Since then , Swan has exposed unnecessary deaths , found outbreaks of polio and measles at Christian Science camps and schools , and interviewed adults who are handicapped today because their diseases and injuries went untreated during childhood .
Nobody knows exactly how many children are affected negatively every year by their parents ’ religious health beliefs , says Dr. Sara Sinal , who has written on religion - based medical neglect for Southern Medical Journal .
“ It is suspected that many deaths go unreported and unrecognized , particularly in closed communities . ”
Religious objection to medical treatment can be traced back to the late 1800s in England , when a sect called the Peculiar People ended up on trial for allowing generations of children to die as a result of their decision to reject doctors and medicine .
Today , many Christian fundamentalist groups routinely spurn some or all mainstream health care in favor of faith healing through prayer .
Jehovah ’s Witnesses accept some medical treatment but oppose blood transfusions , believing that only Jesus Christ ’s shed blood can redeem them .
Scientology eschews certain psychotherapeutic drugs .
The Amish , who are members of an Anabaptist Christian denomination , often reject invasive medical procedures .
Christian Scientist families similarly claim religious exemption from childhood vaccination programs and most routine medical care .
Mental illness is an area that remains especially taboo in orthodox religious communities .
“ A lot of fundamentalist Christians , including pastors , believe that people have mental illness symptoms because they do not pray hard enough or do not believe in God enough , ” says John McManamy , mental health journalist and author of Living Well With Depression and Bipolar Disorder .
McManamy notes that “ religion is often a very positive experience for people with mental illness , ” but extremists cling to a “ medieval belief that mental affliction is the result of the work of the devil and lack of sufficient faith in God . ”
More disturbingly , doctors who have religious objections to standard medical procedures now have federal protection .
The most dangerous section of the so - called “ conscience rule , ” which went into effect in January , bars health care institutions and employers from requiring “ any individual to perform or assist in the performance of any part of a health service program ” if it would offend his / her religious beliefs or moral convictions .
Prosecutors often file charges in religion - based medical neglect cases , and Christian Scientists have been convicted on charges of manslaughter .
However , many convictions are overturned due to the ambiguity created by religious exemption laws , says Shawn F. Peters , author of When Prayer Fails : Faith Healing , Children , and the Law .
“ The argument that the law is confusing — you apparently can treat your child with prayer under one statute , but not under another — is a strong one that has worked for faith healing parents in some states , ” says Peters .
An Oregonian couple was charged last year with criminally negligent homicide in the death of their 16 - year - old son , who died from complications of a severely painful but easily treatable urinary tract infection .
Earlier this year , a judge refused to drop criminal charges against another Oregon couple in the death of their 15 - month - old daughter , who likely would have survived had she received antibiotics .
And on May 8 , a court hearing for Colleen and Anthony Hauser began in Sleepy Eye , Minnesota ; the parents , part of a Native American organization called the Nemenhah Band , claim a “ spiritual right ” to try to cure their 13 - year - old son of Hodgkin ’s lymphoma with healthy food and vitamins .
Doctors contend their son has a 90 percent chance of recovery with chemotherapy and radiation .
The medical community has long grappled with religious traditions that jeopardize their patients ’ health .
“ Fundamentalists tell us their lives are in the hands of God and we , as physicians , are not God , ” says Dr. Lorry Frankel , a professor at the Stanford School of Medicine and author of Ethical Dilemmas in Pediatrics .
“ We respect people ’s religious beliefs and try to compromise , but we wo n’t deny treatment that will save lives . ”
Organizations that have called for repealing religious exemptions include the American Academy of Pediatrics , American Medical Association , National District Attorneys Association , Prevent Child Abuse America , National Association of Medical Examiners , and CHILD Inc .
“ Too often , deference to religion in contemporary American society has resulted in us subordinating all other values , ” says Dr. Richard Sloan , professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia University Medical Center .
“ The law must recognize that the right of children to live supersedes the rights of their parents to free expression of religion . ”
Deena Guzder has reported on human rights issues from New York , Tehran , and Mumbai .
She is the author of a forthcoming book on progressive religious radicals for social justice , currently scheduled for release by Chicago Review Press in 2010 .
Ode to the unhappy / Conservatism let you down ?
Obama nothing more than Bush II ?
Oh , you poor thing
I see you out there .
I know you 're lurking , seething , sending me angry letters , posting nasty comments in anonymous forums across the Interweb , not merely enraged that I and millions like me dare to support President Obama 's massive overhaul of the enormously flawed American idea , but that I also dare to see him as exactly the finest and most intelligent and , yes , even integrity - filled progressive visionary we could possibly hope for at a time like this .
You are fuming in disbelief .
How can I not see it ?
How can the vast majority of the country not see it ?
How is it that no one but you and a few manic fringe writers seem to notice that President Obama is either A ) a thinly veiled socialist commie instigator hell - bent on destroying America from the inside out , or B ) nothing more than a cleverly disguised corporate - loving Bush clone because , oh my God , have n't you seen his policy on H1Bs and faith - based initiatives and his nefarious plan to take over the banks and , um , something else you can't quite remember right now but you 're sure is really , really damning ?
You are slamming your fists on your keyboard .
Why does n't the world get it ?
That it 's all just the same old cronies rearranging the same old powermad furniture , a giant shell game Decepticon robot evil nightmare ?
Oh , you poor dear .
What utter , crushing frustration you must feel .
Especially since the other side , the conservative side -- maybe it was your side ? -- had its grand shot at running the show .
It ran every sour idea , pushed every extreme right - wing economic scenario , wasted trillions on a failed war , spit on gays and kowtowed to the fundamentalists and shoved the country so far to the right we fell off Ted Haggard 's massage table .
And alas , " unmitigated disaster " does n't even begin to cover what happened next .
Is this the source of your terrible pain ?
That the brutal neocon agenda let you down ?
That BushCo just did n't do it right ?
Or is it the absolute opposite , and you are right now sneering in disgust that Obama is n't nearly radical enough , that we 're all being duped into thinking he 's a thoughtful , revolutionary liberal when , in fact , he 's answering to the same ol ' corporate interests and fellating the same ol ' lobbyists and his plans merely sound grand and ambitious , despite how he 's sending more troops to Afghanistan ?
Perhaps this is what 's so infuriating .
Not merely that Obama is wrong in every possible way , but that no one on the far ends of the political spectrum can quite agree on how .
And so , the drama unfolds before you , and you are helpless to stop it .
The massive , unprecedented redistribution of wealth , this " reckless " agenda of giving health insurance to children , investing in green tech , addressing global warming , pumping money into education , ending farm subsidies ... it 's all such a sham .
A disaster in waiting .
A recipe for total anarchy .
This is what you absolutely insist , be you on the far right or the far left .
But to make matters worse -- oh holy hell , would you look at this ?
-- it turns out Obama is n't stopping with just reversing every toxic Dubya - caused debacle , nossir .
It turns out he 's reaching even further back , casually wrapping his long , socialist fingers around the throat of more than 30 years of pamper - the - rich , supply - side Reaganomics , and calmly squeezing .
Heathen !
This is , quite possibly , the most amusing thing I am hearing from the furious fringe :
That Obama 's plan will wreak hell on the deficit for generations to come .
It 's a bit like hearing a Catholic priest scold you on the perils of child abuse .
I 'm sorry , did you just say that it was fine and good to rape the Treasury for the past decade and worship Big Oil and waste two trillion on a failed and useless war , but redirecting those sums into science , health care , children and alternative energy is a terrible and costly idea ?
For you , there is nowhere to turn .
The neocons failed to induce WWIII against the Muslims , the libs are failing because Obama does n't openly endorse gay marriage and wo n't plant hemp in the Rose Garden and refuses to even acknowledge the obvious brain - scrambling power of chemtrails .
To whom shall you turn ?
Perhaps the new de facto king of the GOP , Rush Limbaugh , praying aloud that Obama fails as he scrunches up his sweaty , bulbous face and scans the horizon for the slightest glimmer of a tolerable future Republican candidate who can shove us , well , who the hell knows ?
Not back to Bush .
Not toward Obama .
Maybe into China ?
Ah , Limbaugh .
It is worth positing : How low hath the GOP sunk when the head of the Republican party , Michael Steele , drops to his knees and kisses the fat ring of this tumescent blowhard ?
The serene young black president calmly reinvents the American experiment , while the rival party sniffs around the armpits of ... extremist talk radio ?
What a thing .
Which leads to the biggest question of all : Can Obama actually be both ?
Can he truly be a radical Muslim socialist dedicated to destroying the American ideal , and just another empty suit , a cleverly disguised corporate drone enslaved , like every president in history , by the great Matrix of the capitalist machine ?
Could be , could be .
There is one more option , of course .
And that is : Obama , and the America that 's following him so passionately right now , are neither of those things in the slightest .
And the fact that his extraordinary , nation - altering agenda is right now infuriating the hard right and the hard left , exasperating the Wall Street sycophants and confounding armies of TV pundits and prognosticators , even as he inspires millions of " regular " Americans to get off their butts and do more with their lives , well , this is perhaps the truest sign of all .
When you piss off those kinds of people ?
You know you 're onto something good .

A medieval silver ring dating back more than 800 years has been unearthed on a farm in Northern Ireland .
The 12th century artefact was found by 17 - year - old Conor Sandford as he was putting up a fence post at the edge of one of his father 's fields near the village of Kilmore , Co Armagh .
The teenager told a treasure trove hearing in Belfast today he initially thought the engraved finger ring was a ring pull from an old fizzy drink can .
" Only when I was putting the soil back into the hole did I notice this wee thing sticking out , " he said .
" You know I thought it was a ring pull , off a Coca Cola can . "
The item was in fact a ring that experts at the Ulster Museum in Belfast have dated to circa 1170 .
The Sandford farm lies on land adjoining Kilmore parish church - an area acknowledged by archaeologists as a significant medieval settlement .
After making the discovery last summer , Conor contacted Helen Geake from Channel Four 's Time Team , who advised him to get in touch with the Ulster Museum .
Cormac Bourke , the museum 's long standing curator of medieval antiquities , explained the ring would have belonged to someone of wealth .
" It must pertain to middle or upper echelons of society , but we can't say if it was owned by a man or a woman , " he said during the hearing at Belfast 's Mays Chambers
Such cases are held before the Coroners Court in Northern Ireland to determine whether the items are treasure and thus belong to the Crown .
In order to qualify for that status , the artefact has to be more than 300 years old and be 10 % constituted of precious metal .

The rumors , leaked images , and speculation are only going to get worse as we move closer to E3 , and now it 's Microsoft 's turn to bear the scrutiny of the gaming press .
A report making the rounds , along with a " leaked " photo from Engadget , seems to show a type of sensor bar that will allow gamers to control their games using only their body .
You do n't have to hold any hardware , there is interaction with both video and sound , and the system is able to focus on the player and ignore the rest of the movement in the room .
How likely is this rumor ?
Very .
In fact , we think we already saw and demoed the technology ... last year .
Microsoft is making it clear that the company will have big things in store for E3 .
“ Microsoft is gearing up for a big presence at E3 which will completely transform how people think about home entertainment , " Don Mattrick , senior vice president for the Interactive Entertainment Business at Microsoft , said in a statement at the beginning of the month .
European executive David Gosen also hinted that E3 this year would be " gaming changing . "
It seems that people are comfortable with big promises , on the record .
So what fits the description of the technology according to the leak ?
At CES last year we met with a company called 3DV that showed off a small Web - camera - like device that was able to detect movement and interaction in 3D space .
We even played a boxing game that worked very , very well .
Even more impressive was the ability to control media functions with gestures .
You could swipe your way through your movies , interact with pictures , change channels , all with a small camera and your arms .
Imagine a Microsoft Surface — without the Surface .
In my years of covering games I 've sat through literally hundreds of briefings and tech demos at trade shows , and what impressed me about 3DV was how real the technology was .
Most companies are all show and no go at trade shows , but 3DV had a camera I could pick up and look at .
They had a game I could play , as well as demos of the user interface functions .
It was all there , and it was all working .
" We 're going to be launching comfortably in the sub - $ 100 area , " Tomer Barel , VP of Marketing and Product Management for 3DV , told us .
The 3DV camera does everything the new Microsoft rumor suggests .
So is there a connection ?
Of course there is .
In February , Reuters started talking about reports that Microsoft was buying the company , and chief among the uses for the company 's ZCam were gaming and teleconferencing applications .
Sound familiar ?
Every feature discussed in the Engadget report — every single one — we saw in action in January 2008 , by a company that Microsoft was reported to be in talks to buy , using sub -$ 100 technology that was mature more than 15 months ago .
If Microsoft is going to be showing its own version of the ZCam hardware , it could be bringing motion control that , in our time spent with it , felt even better than Nintendo's .
The difference is that this technology works without having to hold any peripherals , with the power of the 360 bringing high - resolution graphics and surround sound , and at a good price .
You could use the hardware to pause your streaming Netflix movies , or browse the music on your 360's hard drive .
The features of the ZCam brought to the 360 simply makes sense .
Or the original leak and rumor were just that , and we may be spinning our wheels .
After contacting Microsoft we received the expected lack of comment .
Still , the possibilities here are more than enough to get excited by .

What Colour are YOU ?
We all know that colour is very much part of this world .
We see it in the plants , the minerals , the animals and of course also the rainbow .
By now it is even common knowledge that colours do have healing impacts when applied to the aura of a person or even when being eaten by ways of say – purple fruit , greens or whatever .
Another important concept where colour comes in is the knowledge of personality colours .
This is probably not quite so much the common knowledge as other personality characteristics like being a sanguine or a hothead or whatever .
When it comes to personality it is the 4 prime colours which are being used : yellow , blue , green and red .
Yellow and blue people are open and vivacious whereas green and red people are closed up personalities .
Most people have a blend of colours in them , yet on of the colours is the dominant one and will have a considerable impact on their interaction with the world .
Determining of the personality types according to coulours has become quite a science and when you feel you want to improve your interaction , your communication with people knowledge about personality colours will come in rather handy .
While precise and wholesome information will be the best possible communication when it comes to dealing with greens , such an approach will bore the blue personality to death , just to give you a very clear example .
Getting full grasp of this concept will take you a bit of learning and practice , but once you have the hang of it you will be highly pleased with the results you get .
You are welcome to be in touch with me about it – I ’ll be more than happy to help you acquiring this knowledge .

Matthew Williams , who is a deity of subversive design , has created two beautiful MUNI and DHS photography licenses to confound cops and security guards that ( incorrectly ) believe taking photos in public places is a crime .
In the event you ’re stopped by overzealous law enforcement or security officials attempting to enforce fictitious laws , I ’ve designed these fictitious and official - looking Photographer ’s Licenses .
These unofficial ( not fake or fraudulent , mind you ) licenses were inspired when our guest blogger Troy Holden was stopped by a MUNI fare - inspector who demanded that Troy not take any photos and insisted that he needed permission and credentials to take photos .
MUNI has since apologized .
It 's hard for me to believe that my last technical post on the progress of the Intel graphics driver was nearly a year ago .
Certainly , a lot has happened in that year , and recent developments have been covered well by Keith , Eric , and Jesse .
So I wo n't go into any of those details , but I do want to give my impression of where things stand .
As my colleagues have described so well , a major restructuring of the driver is now complete , ( KMS , GEM , dri2 , removal of XAA , EXA , dri1 , etc. ) .
This restructuring caused months of upheaval , followed by months of stabilization during which many bugs were shaken out .
The end result is that the primary developers are all optimistic about the current state of the driver .
Things seem better than ever .
In the meantime , however , it 's also obvious that some users are not happy with the driver , and some have gotten the impression that the quality is getting consistently worse with time .
Some have theorized that no quality - assurance testing is happening , or that the developers just plain do n't care about regressions .
Neither of those theories are true , so why is there such a disconnect between the developers and the users ?
One reason for unhappy users is the lag between development happening and users getting their hands on the code .
So the phase of upheaval and instability might be behind the developers , but some users are just entering into it .
This is exacerbated by the fact that the major restructuring puts several important components of the driver into the kernel .
It used to be that getting the latest Intel driver just meant updating an xf86 - video - intel module or upgrading an xserver - xorg - video - intel package .
But now it 's essential to get a recent kernel as well , ( note that almost all of the major fixes that Eric describes happened in the kernel , not the user - level driver ) .
And these fixes are n't in a major kernel release until 2.6.30 which appeared only today .
In addition , distributions and users have a tendency to update the kernel less frequently than user - level components .
So when a user checks out the latest xf86 - video - intel from git , ( without a kernel upgrade ) , not only is that user not getting the " latest driver " as recommended by the developers , but they might also be running a combination that the developers and QA never saw nor tested .
For example , I recently attempted to run the latest - from - git Intel driver with a kernel version as installed by current Debian installation CDs .
This kernel is ancient with respect to our driver development ( 2.6.25 I think ) .
What I found was that the X server would not start at all .
Obviously , we had neglected to test this particular combination , ( so yes , QA is n't perfect --- but it also can't cover the infinite number of possible combinations ) .
Fortunately , the fix was simple , and appears in the 2.7.99.901 snapshot I just released ( today ! ) so will appear in the 2.8.0 release very soon .
The packagers of X for Ubuntu have been working hard to address this exact problem of the lag between developers and users .
They 've setup a repository of packages named xorg - edgers where users can easily get packages built directly from git .
I do n't think it includes the kernel yet , as it will soon hopefully , but this is definitely a step in the right direction .
Update :
It does include a 2.6.30 kernel now --- maybe all that time I spent writing this blog post was n't wasted after all .
But what about the users that did upgrade their kernel and driver and are still seeing some major problems ?
In this case , we really want to hear from you .
We take pride in our work and are committed to doing our best to make quality releases without regressions .
When you hit some awful behavior , ( GPU hang , scrambled mode , abysmal performance ) , it may be that you 're just hitting a combination of components or application behavior that we 've never seen before .
We want those details and we want to fix the problem .
File good bug reports and please make use of the " regression " keyword as appropriate .
We pay attention to that .
Performance regressions are an especially important issue .
In fact , performance is so important that I 'll make a separate post about that .
I 've got some exciting news to share about performance measurement .
As Nick Griffin drove towards Westminster to celebrate the British National Party 's European election success he would have been hoping for a decent turnout for the press conference he had planned .
Ever the savvy media operator , the far - right leader would have known that his extremist party desperately needed to keep riding the wave of press coverage .
He need not have worried .
Before he could begin speaking , a group of approximately 100 demonstrators from Unite Against Fascism began pelting the BNP leader and his shaven - headed bodyguards with eggs and chanting " Nazi scum ! "
The story topped the news agenda for the rest of the evening .
The BNP could hardly contain its delight .
As Simon Darby , the party 's number two , put it in his blog yesterday : " I wonder how much the resultant publicity from today 's aborted press conference would have cost ? "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
For those wishing to confront the rise of a party with overtly racist policies , the latest protest against the BNP goes right to the heart of how anti-fascist campaigners should deal with an extremist organisation that roughly 900,000 Britons now regularly vote for .
Should our fascists be ignored or confronted ?
Shouted at or spoken to ?
As one veteran anti-racism campaigner put it yesterday : " Throw eggs at the BNP and you might highlight how people are outraged that an extremist party has made headway in British politics .
But you also risk handing them publicity on a plate . "
For organisers of Unite Against Fascism , a coalition of anti-fascist campaigners with strong trade union links formed out of the Anti-Nazi League and the National Assembly Against Racism , giving the BNP a publicity coup was a risk they were willing to take .
" Thanks to its European election wins the BNP had already been on the front page of virtually every newspaper , " says Weyman Bennett , who helped organise the protest .
" What we had to do was deny it respectability .
The danger is that [ the BNP ] is trying to portray itself as a legitimate , mainstream party rather than the fascist , racist party that it actually is .
If it continues to get the votes of ordinary , respectable working - class people , it will become increasingly hard to stop . "
Backed by the TUC and major trade unions like Unison and T&G and with close links to the Socialist Workers Party , overt confrontation is a tried and tested formula for Unite Against Fascism .
For Sabby Dalhu , head of the National Assembly Against Racism , Tuesday 's protest was about stopping the BNP from celebrating its victory .
" Ultimately the BNP did n't get to call the shots and command the publicity the way it wanted to , " she said .
" Instead of a press conference celebrating the victory , the news was dominated by how anti-fascists had told the world that the vast majority of British people find the BNP abhorrent . "
But others believe tactics like egg throwing ultimately backfire .
" The protest was a failure because it enabled BNP members to portray themselves as free speech victims – it played right into their hands , " said Simon Hughes , the Liberal Democrat MP for North Southwark and Bermondsey and a staunch critic of the BNP .
For Ann Cryer , the veteran Labour MP for Keighley who stood against Nick Griffin in the 2005 general election , some anti-fascist groups were more of a hindrance than a help .
" At one stage of the campaign , " she recalled , " I had to phone a couple of groups to ask them not to come up because I knew the kind of protests they [ carry out ] would only give the BNP the headlines that it craves . "
Part of the problem for anti-fascist campaigners is that Unite Against Fascism and Searchlight – the two main organisations that campaign against the BNP – fundamentally disagree over how the far right should be confronted .
Activists from UAF are generally more willing to resort to direct action tactics , while members of Searchlight , which specialises in infiltrating the BNP and publishing exposés of its activities in the group 's magazine , are wary of doing anything that hands the BNP extra publicity .
The disagreements are so stark that Searchlight finally withdrew from the Unite Against Fascism coalition in 2005 .
Dan Hodges , a spokesperson for Searchlight , believes confronting the BNP now that it has seats in Brussels will take a mutli- pronged campaign from all sectors of British society .
" Ultimately we need to be tough on fascism , tough on the causes of fascism , " he said .
In other words , it will take more than a few broken eggs .
Propone cuerpo policial la medida para luchar con el creciente aumento de los asaltos violentos
Los rateros que la Policía de Malasia detenga deberán barrer las calles vestidos con camisetas que digan " Soy un ladrón " , según una iniciativa del cuerpo policial para luchar con el creciente aumento de los asaltos violentos .
" Hemos propuesto que los mangantes arrestados ejerzan un trabajo social limpiando las calles , las mismas calles que utilizan para buscar sus presas , de ocho a doce horas diarias " , indicó el director de la policía , Bakri Mohd Zinin , de acuerdo con el diario Malaysia Star .
Bakri señaló que los carteristas " parecen alérgicos " a desempeñar cualquier clase de trabajo honesto y este será un castigo humillante para ellos , ya que las penas convencionales no funcionan .
El director de la policía aclaró que el oficio de barrendero no es una tarea de la que nadie deba sentirse avergonzado y dijo que tiene un tío que hace ese trabajo .
" Él es dulce y agradable , y todos le queremos mucho " , agregó Bakri , según el citado rotativo .
En los últimos meses , dos mujeres embarazadas han fallecido en Malasia a causa de los robos violentos por parte de ladrones callejeros .

THE builders of the ancient Mayan temples at Tikal in Guatemala switched to inferior wood a few decades before they suddenly abandoned the city in the 9th century AD .
The shift is the strongest evidence yet that Mayan civilisation collapsed because they ran out of resources , rather than , say , disease or warfare .

RiCal is an implementation of RFC2445 , better known as the iCalendar format .
Although there are some existing Ruby libraries to read and write the iCalendar format , Rick DeNatale decided to write a new one .
We talked to him to learn why he started the project and what obstacles he had to face .
Implementing a calender format does n't seem to be much fun , so why did you start RiCal ?
I got interested in this problem during my last full - time job .
For most of last year I worked for a startup company which had a large Rails application which provided team / group collaboration functions as a software service .
The application had an existing calendar component , but it was considered inadequate for several reasons , the UI did n't stack up to competition like Google calendar , and there was a requirement to import icalendar files from external calendar applications .
I did a lot of work on the UI , which involved lots of interesting JavaScript and browser portability debugging .
But the cost of properly importing general icalendar files turned out to be outside the budget .
At the time , there were , and still are , two popular Ruby gems which provide a measure of support for the icalendar format ( Which is defined in RFC 2445 ) .
Both do a reasonable job of parsing and emitting icalendar data , but do n't go very far in implementing the semantics .
One of the biggest lacks was support for recurring events , and in a related vein time zones as defined in the RFC .
Since the company ran out of funding and ceased development operations , I 've been finding paying work on a hit or miss basis , and have had more time that I 'd otherwise like to work on RiCal .
The RFC is quite large and complex , where did you start ?
Yes , it 's definitely a camel designed by a committee .
The driving forces were Microsoft and Lotus Notes / IBM .
In my IBM career I 've been involved with other similar stardards bodies for Smalltalk , Java , etc . so I know both how such beasts get bred and somewhat how to deal with the animal .
The first thing I looked at , because I was interested in it , was the problem of recurring events .
RFC 2445 defines recurrence using a complex combination of rules and lists for generating , and excluding times or periods from the occurrences of an Event , Journal entry or Todo .
In addition , time zones within icalendar calendars have their transitions between standard and daylight periods defined using the same mechanism .
Have you had to start from scratch or were there any reusable pieces around ?
There are a couple of Ruby gems for dealing with recurrence , Matthew Lipper 's Runt , and Jim Weirich 's Texp .
Both are based on Martin Fowler 's Temporal Expressions pattern .
Martin did a much cleaner job than the committee , temporal expressions probably exhibit the 80/20 rule , they get 80 % accomplished with 20 % of the work / complexity .
I know several friends and colleagues who have tried to use one of these libraries to implement occurrence enumeration with one of these two libraries and did n't have a very enjoyable time , nor achieve the desired goal .
The problem is n't with Martin 's pattern , it 's with the camel .
How does such a recurring event look like ?
The biggest level of complexity in RFC 2445 is the recurrence rule , it specifies a basic frequency and interval , such as every Day , every 2 Months , etc .
This is applied to a start time to produce a series of modified times .
That 's simple enough , but the rule can also add things like on the 2nd and last Mondays of the Month , expressed with rule parts like BYWDAY =2MO , - 1MO , which I call byparts in the code .
These can be combined and interact in various ways with each other and the basic frequency and interval .
Depending on the relationship of the frequency of the bypart , a bypart can either add additional occurrences of filter them out .
As an example an event describing when US Presidential Elections take place starting with the 1996 election might look like this :
DTSTART ;TZID=US - Eastern : 19961105T090000RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;INTERVAL=4;BYMONTH=11;BYDAY=TU;BYMONTHDAY=2,3,4,5,6,7,8
The legal rule is that US Presidential elections happen every year which is divisible by 4 , on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November .
In fact the example I just gave comes straight out of RFC 2445 .
This really looks quite complex , so how do you analyze these rules ?
I spent a lot of time thinking about how to interpret these rules before coming up with an initial algorithm which worked .
The basic approach was to come up with a method which given the last occurrence time would produce the next .
My first working approach used a single enumerator class with a series of methods which figured out whether the next occurrence needed to have it 's seconds changed , then it 's minutes , etc , until it got to the level of the basic frequency , and then filtered out times which did n't match byparts with longer durations than the basic frequency .
I wrote RSpec examples for each of the recurrence rule examples in the spec and got them all to work .
And they worked fairly efficiently .
The full spec suite ran in something like 13 seconds on my MacBook .
With that accomplished , what came next ?
The next step was to tackle time zones .
Time zones in general are a mess .
There are no real standards for naming them , and there 's a lot of confusion about what they are .
Most Rubyists who have dealt with time zones are probably familiar with the Tzinfo gem , which provides access to the Olson time zone database which is commonly used by most modern operating systems .
For better or worse , the Olson database has lots of alternate identifiers for timezones so they are n't unique .
And RFC2445 punts on the matter of standardized time zone identifiers , which means that time zones can't be passed by reference between icalendar using applications , but must have their definitions contained within the icalendar data .
So RiCal contains a class representing a VTIMEZONE component , which can actually convert times between UTC and the time zone represented by the instance .
As I mentioned in order to determine whether the particular time is in a standard or daylight saving period requires using the recurrence rules to find the right period .
The flip side of that coin is that if you create say an event with RiCal from your Ruby / Rails application , and then export it to icalendar format data which can be understood by another application , it has to be exported in a calendar which contains VTIMEZONE components defining any time zone or time zones needed by that event .
So RiCal also has a class which represents a VTIMEZONE component which gets its time zone data from TZInfo , and knows how to export a valid RFC 2445 external representation of that VTIMEZONE component along with any periods and when they transition .
With these two hurdles taken , were there more problems ?
When I got that all done , I realized that although the occurrence enumeration worked rather efficiently on the average , that a few cases were driving that average in the wrong direction , and unfortunately those cases tended to be used in defining timezone definitions .
In many such cases I was enumerating potential occurence times for every day of the year , and thowing away all but those which fell on , say the first Sunday in April .
So I went back to the drawing board , or maybe it was the shower where I seem to do most of my best " aha ! " thinking , and came up with a new approach which now uses a chain of objects , one for each bypart and frequency / interval in the rule .
This effectively ' compiles ' a hybrid object the first time a particular recurrence rule .
More importantly it let me ' fast - foward ' those every 1st Sunday in April cases .
It did take quite a while to do that refactoring and get things back to green , but the results seem worth it .
That spec suite went from running in around 13 seconds to about 4 - 5 .
The suite has grown a bit since then but thats primarily because of added specs for new function unrelated to recurrences .
You also created a DSL to create calendars , could you elaborate on that ?
The past few weeks I 've been working on a ' builder dsl ' for RiCal .
I 've tried to make this as compatible as I can with the Icalendar and Vpim gems , but I 've extended it to do things like picking up a time zone from a TimeWithZone object if someone is using a recent enough version of Rails ( or actually ActiveSupport ) to have those .
I 've also tried to make RiCal insensitive to whether or not you are using it in Rails .
I do n't require ActiveSupport , which might have made my job a bit easier ) , and although I need TZInfo :: Timezone , I do n't care whether it comes from the tzinfo gem or ActiveSupport .
There are a few things about the DSL which I 'm not completely happy with right now which are the last issues before I ' officially ' publish RiCal on RubyForge as well as on github .
The Readme on GitHub contains an example of the DSL :
RiCal .
Calendar do
event do
description " MA - 6 First US Manned Spaceflight "
dtstart DateTime.parse ( " 2/20/1962 14:47:39 " )
dtend DateTime.parse ( " 2/20/1962 19:43:02 " )
location " Cape Canaveral "
add_attendee " john.glenn@nasa.gov "
alarm do
description " Segment 51 "
end
end
end
So what is there left to do in RiCal ?
As I said , right now I 'm trying to put the final touches on the DSL API .
After that I 'll listen to users .
Although RiCal should make it easier for people to write Ruby apps which interchange with other calendar applications , the complexity of the spec means that not every app interprets the spec in the same way in every detail .
I expect people will discover things that need to be attended to .
Follow on work might involve things like a rails plugin to help with modeling calendars and calendar components in ActiveRecord .
And there 's still room for some help in building calendar user interfaces , but that and the active record plugin are likely to be separate but related projects .
Thank you very much Rick for taking the time to talk to us .
More on RiCal can be found on Rick 's Blog and a pre-release is available on GitHub .
HANCOCK , Massachusetts ( CNN ) -- Imagine climbing 276 steps to change a light bulb .
That 's all in a day 's work for Rian Harford .
The Zephyr wind turbine towers over Jiminy Peak Mountain Resort in Massachusetts .
He 's a mountain operations mechanic at Jiminy Peak Mountain Resort .
And that light bulb is n't just a regular light bulb .
It belongs inside an air - traffic warning light that sits 253 feet high upon a wind turbine .
Jiminy Peak , in Hancock , Massachusetts , touts itself as the first ski resort in North America to feature such a structure .
The idea to build the turbine came to company president and CEO Brian Fairbank after years of struggling with the astronomical cost of making snow .
" Somebody suggested we take advantage of the wind .
You use the energy the most in the winter , " Fairbank said .
" That 's when the wind blows the most . "
But such a simple concept was n't so easy to execute .
It took more than three years to take the idea from conception to fruition .
Watch what it 's like on top of the giant turbine »
Before even placing an order for a turbine , the resort had to study everything from Federal Aviation Administration regulations to the structure 's effect on airplanes , birds and endangered species .
Once everything fell into place , Jiminy Peak was tasked to get 500 tons of parts and equipment up the mountain , via a two - mile - long gravel road .
" Once we got everything to the top of mountain , putting it together only took a couple days , but getting it up there was the biggest challenge , " Fairbank said .
In fall 2007 , the $ 4 million project was complete .
The turbine is nicknamed Zephyr , after the Greek god of the west wind .
And Zephyr is n't afraid to make its presence known .
The tower is more than 250 feet tall .
The hub adds 10 feet , and the blades extend an additional 123 feet , creating a 386 - foot green machine .
Zephyr works its magic to produce about a third of Jiminy Peak 's electric needs , shaving $ 450,000 a year from the resort 's energy bill .
To put that in perspective , the energy from the turbine is enough to power more than 600 homes .
And Zephyr 's power does n't stop there .
It has also drawn the interest of many visitors .
Louise Pinho did her homework to find out how effective the wind turbine really is .
" When you read about what it 's able to do for the resort , that it can take up to 33 percent off of their bills , then you realize that there is more of a need for this , " Pinho said .
" With what 's going on right now , we have to have some alternatives to our energy sources that we have available to us . "
But Pinho is n't blind to Zephyr 's visual and environmental drawbacks .
Studies show that wind turbines destroy the habitat that many animals live in .
Bats , which play a large role in consuming insects and pests , are an example of a species that 's most affected .
According to Thomas Kunz , a biology professor at Boston University , these bats are n't necessarily being struck by the blades of a wind turbine .
Their bodies are affected by a low - pressure system caused when the blades move through the air .
" They die from hemorrhaging , " Kunz says .
In areas close to wind turbines , " 80 percent of the bats that we know about today are killed in that fashion . "
Kunz says that specifically , migrating bats seem to be more affected , mainly during their fall migration , which lasts from late summer to early autumn .
At Jiminy Peak Mountain Resort , the turbine produces electricity year round , but more than 60 percent of its output takes place in the winter months .
Regardless , Fairbank is no stranger to negative feedback .
Some people in the community did n't want the turbine to obstruct their view of the mountains .
But he says that only a small part of the community complains .
In fact , some neighbors reap Zephyr 's benefit .
In the summer , when the resort 's demands are lower , Zephyr 's electricity trickles downhill to power local homes and businesses .
" So all those communities become green when we 're not using the power , " Fairbank said .
And when it comes to being green , this Massachusetts resort is n't new to the game .
Since 1985 , the company has implemented various environmentally friendly practices .
From recycling motor oil to heat lodges to installing waterless urinals , Fairbank says , the business is always looking for ways to conserve .
And that may be paying off .
In a time when many businesses are closing their doors , Fairbank said , " we 're 12 percent ahead of our best year ever . "

How is it that , that at questionable point of life , under 3 months , is being vociferously defended by the right - wing , yet the unquestionably alive , those that walk and talk , are acceptably slaughtered through our bombing ?
The fact is , that the only time late abortion occurs legally , and very seldom , period , is when there is a problem with the life of the pregnant woman , jeapordized or lost , by continuing the pregnancy .
How can the value of a fetus , under three months , supercede the actual , unquestionable life of that woman /
And why do n't the victims of the war WE ILLEGALLY STARTED , killing the 90 % innocent civillians be so distant from their outrages , these Right - wing Repugnants ?
How is it that it 's okay to bring a child into a life that is assured to be a misery , is better than prohibitting the continuation of preganancy ?
While in the fetus stage , being discontinued is actually much more compassionate .
Oh , that 's right , we were just not supposed to have sex , in the first place .

The response by Bible - thumping wing - nuts to this tragedy typifies what Dr. Phillip Zimbardo describes in The Lucifer Effect ( 2007 ) as “ the process of dehumanization by which certain other people or collectives of them are depicted as less than human … . ”
He regards this as “ one of the central processes in the transformation of ordinary , normal people into indifferent or even wanton perpetrators of evil … a ‘ cortical cataract ’ that clouds one ’s thinking and fosters the perception that other people are less than human …to see…others as enemies deserving of torment , torture , and even annihilation . ”
It is here that the danger of irresponsible media is exposed .
History ’s most abhorrent example , the “ final solution , ” was not the product of some inherent psychological deficiency in the German people .
To the contrary , as Zimbardo forcefully points out , it was the product of a deliberate campaign carried out in newspapers , on radio , in required texts of school children , and even in comic books , which “ sought to create the perception of Jews as a sub - human race that was a threat to the national state . ”
O'Reilly 's verbal character assaults go well beyond harmless words , especially when they are received by a less - than - stable , malleable mind of a wing - nut who perceives Dr. Tiller as the embodiment of evil .

As a follow - up to my last comment , consider the response coming from those from the other side of the women 's right to choose debate .
In a just received email , NARAL writes :
On behalf of NARAL Pro-Choice America and our affiliates , our prayers and thoughts are with Dr. Tiller ’s family and friends .
If you do n’t know very much about his background , for almost two decades Dr. Tiller and those individuals who helped provide care to his patients have lived under intense harassment tinged with persistent threats of violence .
Even under these adverse circumstances , Dr. Tiller never wavered in his commitment to providing abortion services and other reproductive health care to women and their families , often in the most difficult and heart - breaking circumstances .
Dr. Tiller ’s murder will send a chill down the spines of the brave and courageous providers and other professionals who are part of reproductive - health centers that serve women across this country .
We want them to know that they have our support as they move forward in providing these essential services in the aftermath of the shocking news from Wichita .

The ONLY thing that will make these CHRISTIAN FUNDAMENTALIST TERRORISTS stop their hate on Fox News is for the family of Dr. Tiller to sue Rupert Murdoch and Bill O'Loofah for all they 're worth .
As an aside , I believe that the Administration can now use Bush 's Terrorist Act to stop the hate mongering and terror - inciting being done on Fox News everyday .
It began at Palin 's Christian Fundamentalist Terrorist rallies and is now being continued via Fox News .
This country IS NO LONGER SAFE BECAUSE OF FOX NEWS AND IT'S VERY PSYCHOLOGICALLY DERANGED COMMENTATORS .

Bring on The Patriot Act immediately .
It 's time to use this act to stop the terror - inciting done by these rightwing nuts every day on Fox News .
There needs to be an immediate appeal and petititon to the Attorney General to investigate the role (s ) these anti-american ( remember : abortion is legal - " murder " is not ) these christian fundamentalist terrorist hate crimes and how much influence these Fox commentators have on an unbalanced individual 's mind .

The seriously deranged logic of protesting an abortion as murder and then going out and murduring a doctor , in church no less , baffles the normal mind .
Evidently , this individual does not have a normal mind - as so many uneducated , anti-democratic reighwingers .
We , the People , can wage our own war - directly upon Fox News - and it's hate - spewing , fear - mongering , murder - inciting anchors .
The People can get a list of every sponsor of the Fox Cable Network and begin a boycott immediately .
If anyone has access to this information , please post it here so we can circulate it to everyone we know .

While I respect Bill O'Reilly 's right to free speech , I say to us all that we must not only answer but pre-empt the next set of attacks with plenty of free speech of our own .
Brainwashing must be countered in force wherever it pops up .
It 's time to put a serious deprogramming plan in place .
This is the sort of thing that happens when we let O'Reilly and his ilk say their piece and we do not challenge it .

Dr Tiller did not break the law of man or God .
God does not recognize life until he breathes it into you .
But you anti choice , anti Constitution TERRORISTS have blood on your hands .
You protest the death of the unborn but cheer as you send living kids to war .
Not your kids but someone elses .
You cheered when Bush vetoed health care for children , but what the hell let that 8 year old die from tooth decay but save bunch of cells .
You cheer when a Muslim or Arab child is bombed .
Your fucked up minds think everyone must bow to your Christ of God will not save than .
I thought Bush was going to stop abortion ?
How did that work out for you assholes ?
Do n't want an abortion DON'T HAVE ONE .

The murdered ( martyred ? ) physician provided a grim - but necessary medical service ; even if the ` Forced - Existence ' zealots can't admit it , some pregnancies are too horribly deformed to be carried to term .
By using deadly violence to intimidate providers of legal - and necessary procedures , the Whack - O Religious Right who target legitimate family planning medical staff prove that they are no different from ( or any better than than ) the Q'uoran - spouting Terrorists who kill in the name of their perverted notion of ` The One True Faith ' .
Worse , because they claim to kill in the name of Christian love ...

Tiller the Baby Killer was a strong advocate ( obviously ) of late term abortion .
He physically and literally killed hundreds of infants in the ninth month of pregnancy .
He would jab medical devices into the child 's head and suck out the brain .
If that did n't work , and the child somehow made his or her way out , he would straggle the baby to death .
Saying that this guy is a monster is an understatement .
I do not agree with the murder of Tiller but , as the old saying goes , " what comes around goes around . "
Karma can really bit hard .

Chris wrote : " Typical liberalism -- shut down free speech .
I wonder how many of you have called for William Ayers or Keith Olberman to be shut down . "
------
Apparently Chris does not understand the difference between " free speech " and " hate speech " designed to dehumanize the " other . "
Consider , for example , the a Dec. 21 , 2005 column of that darling of the right , Ann Coulter .
“ I think the government should be spying on all Arabs , engaging in torture as a televised spectator sport , dropping daisy cutters wantonly throughout the Middle East and sending liberals to Guantanamo . ”
Appearing on CNBC ’s Kudlow & Cramer on February 7 , 2005 , when discussing whether the U.S. military was targeting journalists , Coulter said , “ Would that it were so ! ”
In a January 10 , 2005 article appearing in the New York Observer , Coulter was quoted as saying : “ I ’m getting a little fed up with hearing about , oh , civilian casualties .
I think we ought to nuke North Korea right now just to give the rest of the world a warning . ”
In Cruel and Unusual , Mark Crispin Miller quotes Coulter ’s earlier remark at a right - wing conference : “ We need to execute people like John Walker in order to physically intimidate liberals , by making them realize that they can be killed too . ”
Writing about Muslims on September 12 , 2001 for the National Review , Coulter said , “ We should invade their countries , kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity . ”
Glenn Beck is not one to be outdone by America ’s Eva Braun .
During a May 11 , 2006 Clear Channel radio broadcast of The Glenn Beck Program , Beck said : “ I say we nuke the bastards .
In fact , it does n’t have to be Iran .
It can be everywhere , any place that disagrees with me . ”
( That amounts not only to a call for violence but for nuclear genocide ! )
O'Reilly 's deceitful commentary borders on hate speech calculated to incite violence .
While Olbermann is quite outspoken in his critique of the hard right 's authoritarian mindset , I have never heard anything in his remarks that makes them comparable to O'Reilly .
I doubt seriously , Chris , that you have either .
To all the other right - wing Christians out there --- I have only one question .
Tell me , who would Jesus have bombed ?

Do you want the government to outlaw your right to your body and quality care ?
I hope your loved ones are not turned away from quality doctor care .
One of mine was after being stalked and raped by a policeman .
She was luckier than others and survived a nonprofessional abortion .
Remember Jesus stated , " He that is without sin among you , let him cast the first stone at her . "
Some religious fanatics still stone raped women and try to own women .
Who should own them as a slave ?
We know women with tubal pregnancies who would have died if ecclesiastical zealots had their way .
We knew women with high blood pressure that did die in pregnancy and chose their path .
Notice exodus describes no penalty for women who choose to terminate pregnancy , nor does any Bible passage .
I do n't see many women leaving the number of children they have up to someone else .
My grandmother let the church decide and had 18 pregnancies .
Women should be allowed to regulate their own bodies , starting with ovulation and contraception .
140 million orphan children and their mothers would love to be valued as much as embryos and feti are advertised .
Notice most Pro-Lifers act as if life ends at birth .
Are you willing to help mothers keep their children or to adopt ORPHANED children ?
My aunt almost orphaned 7 children while delivering a fetus that had n't a skull .
She was allowed choices .
In medicine , a fetus becomes a baby when it take its first breath .
Then , its siblings recognize it and it's named , christened , given citizenship , and celebrates its birthday .
The value of a embryo or fetus is up to the person doing the work to create a new being .
Unless you 're willing to become a surrogate , it appears the only way to give rights to embryos and feti is to take away the rights of men , women , and children .
Please value women and her children .
If you want to reply , please use correct terminology rather than fallacies , such as begging the question and ad hominems .

Sorry this is lengthy -- It is the Wiki on the nut from Oregon who shot Tiller in the '90's - - notice the nuts do not fall to for from the tree--HER DAUGHTER !
Make note that the Grant Pass area of Oregon is filled with crazies ..AND do n't forget that Dallas , Oregon at one time had the biggest population of KKK's this side of the Mississippi --- Rachelle Ranae " Shelley " Shannon ( born 1956 ) is a pro-life activist from Grants Pass , Oregon .
She assaulted Dr. George Tiller outside his abortion clinic in Wichita , Kansas on August 19 , 1993 , shooting him in both arms .
She is serving time in FCI Dublin .
Her projected release date is November 7 , 2018 .
At the time she attacked Tiller , Shannon had been a pro-life activist for five years and had written letters of support to Michael Griffin , who murdered David Gunn .
She called Griffin " the awesomest , greatest hero of our time . "
She traveled to the Wichita clinic , a site of frequent demonstrations by abortion - rights and pro-life activists , and shot Tiller with a semiautomatic pistol .

You do n't hesitate to defend the killing of that child .
You 're so caught up in the left - right dialectic its pathetic .
By the way Bush 's cabinet was loaded with Trotskyites who true to their communist icon advocated constant revolution as in the murder of innocents , ie ; Iraqis .

Did Bill O'Reilly kill the abortionist ?
NO .
Did Bill O'Reilly call for anyone to kill the abortionist ?
NO .
Hence , you have free speech .
Here is where the liberals ' relativism comes back to bite them -- what is " hate " speech to you is free speech to others .
Just because you disagree with it does n't make it " hate " speech .
This is the danger of " hate " ( aka thought ) crime laws and why they must be defeated .
The killer of the abortionist should be punished for his actions -- not his beliefs .
And people like you should n't take the death of anyone in order to try to shut down someone else 's free speech that you disagree with .

Like Justice Samuel Alito ? :

" When a case comes before me involving , let 's say , someone who is an immigrant ...
I can't help but think of my own ancestors , because it was n't that long ago when they were in that position . "
Conservatives found no objection when Alito described his own brand of empathy .

** Incidentally , Manson 's followers killed Sharon Tate when she was two weeks from giving birth -- sounds like Mr. Tiller 's kind of guy more than Mr. O'Reilly 's , does n't it ?
Justice Alito had shown before his confirmation that he had the ability to separate his empathy from the rule of law .
From what we know of Sotomayor , she does not have that ability .
You have no argument there .

Let me get this straight .
If O'Reilly says he thinks Tiller is doing wrong , but DOESN'T call for his death , then O'Reilly is responsible for " inciting " this nut to murder Tiller .
Yeah , right .
So if I disagree with Obama , or some senators policies and say they are wrong , and then some other nut shoots Obama or a senator then I guess I can be sued for " inciting " the nut to violence .
Hmmm ...
Not sure what that does for free speech or if that 's constitutional .
It is delusional , but not constitutional .
Wake up people .
This nut that murdered Tiller is a violent horrible man that does not represent the average pro-life viewpoints .
HE himself is a hypocrite , but you can't stereotype ALL pro-lifers by one nut 's actions .
Unless of course you are going to ' profile ' anyone who disagrees with your viewpoint .
( Hmm ... Does THAT constitute hate speech ? )
I am pro-life , that means I do n't like ANY killing .
AND I'm NOT ALONE .
If it 's a fetus , baby or adult , killing is WRONG period .
I live in Wichita .
I peacefully protested at his clinic .
I disagreed with Tiller , but he should NOT have been murdered .
Not only was it wrong and unjustifiable but it's about the most idiotic strategy a person could use to change the politics of abortion .
99.9 % of us " right wing prolifers " are like that .
It just gets me how many of the comments on this site BROADBRUSH anyone who is a Christian or is prolife as suddenly being in the same league as this nut who is in the 0.01 % of prolifers .

As an " independant/libertarian " , I think both the left AND the right are nothing but highly propagandized automatons , at least as far as the so - called political arena is concerned .
The fact that MANY of you are calling for an end to free speech and use of Bush 's tyrannical Patriot Act that Obama " forgot " to repeal , is evidence that even when you 're correct on an issue , you still serve as nothing more than Lenin 's " useful idiots " , calling for your own destruction by way of a militarized police state .
Any liberal democrat with half a brain ( and with the exception of the author of the article and a tiny handful of commentators , they appear to be in the minority here ) would be busy showcasing the INCREDIBLY OBVIOUS HYPOCRACY of condemning a woman 's right to choose an abortion and openly advocating the death and torture of human beings outside the womb .
The world of logic and reason gave him the rope , and Bill O has already tied the noose and hung himself on this one .
So why the HELL would you be on here calling for the government to use and abuse an unconstitutional presidential directive which WILL probably wind up killing and imprisoning many of YOU in the not too distant future , over an arguement that you 've already won ?
STOP BEING SELF - DESTRUCTIVE MORONS ... please .

The cognative dissonance of the religious right 's " sanctity of unborn life " arguement , met with their " Kill / torture anything that moves that is n't a pregnant American , christian , zionist , or neocon / sadist " arguement is so in - your - face ABSURD , and forever highlighted by unfortunate stories like this one , that anyone who 's pro-choice and has a voice in the media should n't have a problem convincing rational people of this ... key word , RATIONAL people ...

Hey , the ACLU is about allowing free speech , and are the best advocates for it .
They are also the best advocates for women 's rights , humanity 's rights .
So , excuse me , Chris , how is it that the sadness of a life that has lived in a tragic setting , full of poverty , or drug use in a home , or inadequate income for supporting another , the sadness from that circumstance to a child , and the child 's resulting life , with DESPAIR etched into their psyche forever , is it better to prevent the fetus from becoming the unsuspecting child , and the victim of circumstances , unacceptable for a child .
Whether human or not , and you can't say it is n't human , but what consciousness level could exist in the fetus ?
I honestly do not believe it could be more than that of goldfish .
Would I prefer to eliminate a goldfish from turning into a miserable child , with a life of misery ?
I will eliminate the goldfish / fetus .
Do I want to have a child , by giving birth and live forever , never seeing that baby / child / adult again in my life ?
A whole nother tragedy .
That experience has haunted , and deeply emotionally scarred women .
A child living in an orphanage ?
Sad .
The goldfish is gone .
The late - term is not done except to keep the mother 's health intact if in jeapordy , from the pregnancy .
So , do n't use that argument Righties !

But despite what you or O'Reilly says , Tiller was a baby killer .
He did n't kill fetus ' , he killed babies .
And when they came out and they were n't dead , he would drown them .
So , O'Reilly was right to speak against him , the assailant was wrong to murder him , but excuse me if I 'm not all broken up about it .

It 's amazing how the left wanders off in the wilderness when attempting to make an argument .
The ACLUnatics are n't about constitutional rights -- they 're about left wing fanatacism ( incidentally , where have they been while the couple in California have been told by the government they can't hold Bible study in their home with their neighbors ? ) .
Funny that you claim I do n't know you 're a liberal , yet you somehow know I 'm a conservative ( I am , proudly , by the way ) .
The fact that you do n't admit suggests perhaps --- shame ??
You then whine about conservatism being about " constitutional law . "
It is -- the original intent of the Constitution ( maybe you should study some ) .
Let me remind you of another important document -- the Declaration of Independence ( upon which the Constitution was built ) : LIFE , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
The founders had good common sense .
It 's just a shame so many leftists do n't .
It 's clear the radicals will use a man 's death to attempt to push their dead - upon - arrival agenda that the American people constantly reject yet have pushed in their face .
No surprise there .
What is surprising is the rapidity of the left 's dehumanization of a living baby , what with comparing him / her to a " goldfish . "
As with civil rights and slavery , in the end true human rights will win out -- not the radical view that " my property is my business . "
A separate human being is not property , and they are entitled to full constitutional rights .
You have yours , so why are you so obsessed with keeping it from others ?
Sick .
Lastly , a child who may be born in unfortunate circumstances does n't justify killing that child .
That 's a ridiculous , almost comical , argument .
A new poll released in May show Americans favor the pro-life view by an average of 14 % .
God -willing , this nightmare and shameful period of history will be over soon , and we can come to terms with what we 've done .

Funny that you claim I do n't know you 're a liberal , yet you somehow know I 'm a conservative
You may need to go back and re-read that , Chris .
I said you were a " phony ' conservative ' " , and that was clear from the phony " conservative " arguments you were trying to use here from the git .
So far , you 've failed to impress a single point upon me that would suggest you have a clue what conservatism actually means .
You then whine about conservatism being about " constitutional law . "
It is -- the original intent of the Constitution ( maybe you should study some ) .
Which " original intent " would that be ?
The part that originally intended for African - Americans to be 3/5's of a person , and the property of their owners ?
Or the part which requires equal protection for all ( 14th amendment ) , which phony " conservatives " tend to ignore when , for example , arguing that two men or two women have no " right " to be married ?
A new poll released in May show Americans favor the pro-life view by an average of 14 % .
I 'm surprised that more are n't pro-life , since they 're living and all .
Now if the poll had asked them if they were anti-choice , that 's another matter .
That said , 80 % also believed that Saddam Hussein had something to do with 9/11 at one point , and that he had WMD .
Did n't make 'em anymore correct about that , now did it ?
Good thing our Constitution is n't based on polls , eh ?
Thanks for playing , genius .

I suggest you study history concerning the 3/5 clause .
The purpose was to prevent more pro-slavery congressmen from getting into power , for while ( hypocritically ) blacks were n't considered people , they were counted in the population census .
Thus , the founders decided that rather than count them as a full person , counting them as 3/5 would cut down the population of the slave - holding states , thus limiting pro-slavery congressmen .
Just a little history lesson for ya , bud .
Oh , by the way -- the same Constitution ended importation of slaves .
Talking to the pro-abortion nuts is like talking to a brick wall .
They knit - pick and can't refute people 's arguments .
I 'll simply leave you with Fr. Pavone , who has put it best :

I 'm troubled by the entire article and thread .
I 'm essentially a pragmatic socialist , pro-choice , pro-free - speech citizen , and I know as a scholar that the bible is an anthology of stories that often contradict each other , and that it especially contradicts the pro-life movement 's assertion that life begins at conception .
Bill O' Reilly , much as I loath his smug , pasty persona , is merely a media everywhiteman , Rush 's pervy Jack Spratt .
But if some crazy guy reading Bradblog frequently and obsessively decided to off Tom Feeney or the former CEO of Diebold based on the heated ( even if slightly less so than target Bill's ) rhetoric occasionally encountered here , would you be liable , Brad ?
No .

For you God- believin ' folks : if God wanted the babies alive , he 'd inspire the mothers not to have abortions .

As a side note , it 's amazing to me how many people are suckered in by the hate - and - fear industry ( otherwise known as the GOP , Faux News , and the " liberal " media ) can't get past the sensationalism of these stories and get down to the point of it all - if we decided to take responsibility for one another and care of one another ( like your precious imaginary Christ taught ) - instead of looking for " evil " all the time , we might have a better chance of living happy and healthy lives .
Because who are we to judge evil ?
Read your bibles , bitches - it 's not your job .
Of course , since I 'm an non-believer , it 's not at all hypocritical for me to tell you how to live your lives , because I do n't submit to imaginary God 's imaginary authority , and you do .
I do believe we 're all in this together , and the more we isolate ourselves , the more ignorance takes over and the more we have incidents like this .
Dr. Tiller should not have been murdered - period .
I will be truly shocked if the person who committed this crime is n't a " pro-life " whack - job who is a huge fan of Fox News and Randall Terry .
But hey , unlike most zealot Christians , I 'm okay with being wrong about things .

Of Abortion , and Women as the Ultimate Source of Evil
The fetus only exists because of the woman 's body --- not yours , not that of some possibly corrupt and stupid politician in Washington , and not the body of some possibly ignorant and venal politician in a state legislature .
The right of the woman to control her own body when she is pregnant must be absolute up to the point of birth .
In terms of the political theory involved , the basic question is a stark and simple one : if you cannot control your own body , what other rights can you possibly have ?
If your body is not yours , what does it matter if you can freely express your political and religious convictions ?
The principle involved is similarly simple : as long as you are not violating anyone else 's rights , your right to control your own body is absolute .
Period .
For the reason indicated above , the fetus is not a person in the same sense the mother is : the fetus would not exist but for the woman who carries it .
The woman 's right to her own body must , in fact and in logic , take precedence over whatever rights you believe the fetus possesses , up to the time of birth .

From Honoring Dr. George Tiller by Rebecca Young : Dr. Tiller has always been a hero of mine .
Here is a man who has dedicated his life to women's health , to providing legal services to women who need them and to treating his patients with dignity and respect .
Here also is a dedicated father of four , grandfather of ten , husband and friend to many ...
And now here is a man who has given his life for his work , murdered at his place of worship .
No one should be killed simply for doing their job .
No one should be singled out for a campaign of harassment and violence as Dr. Tiller was for years ...
As one of only a handful of doctors in the United States who provide late term abortions , he has been a constant target of the fanatic anti-abortion movement .
He has been shot in both arms .
His clinic has been bombed .
He and his family have suffered death threats .
Yet he has persisted through all of this to serve those women who need him , who have nowhere else to turn .
And that , my friends , is true courage .
This fitting tribute cuts through the dehumanizing propaganda that spills from the lips of right - wing demagogues like Bill O'Reilly .
Their vicious propaganda is responsible in this case in the same manner that Nazi propaganda was responsible for the atrocities committed against Jews and racist propaganda during the Jim Crow period was responsible for the atrocities committed against African Americans .
Sad , that our friend Chris can't see that .

Since 2005 , Bill O'Reilly has waged jihad against Dr. George Tiller , dedicating 29 segments of his show to demonizing and dehumanizing Tiller , who he invariably called " Tiller the baby killer . "
As you can see from these video clip samplings of O'Reilly 's holy war , you do n't have to actually pull the trigger to help sponsor terrorism :

Big Dan .
Go look at wikipedia .
Evidently SEX REQUIRES BOTH A MAN AND A WOMEN !!!1 !
Women make an implicit contract with their child that they will take it to term once they create it just as men are held responsible for their children whether or not they decide later they did not want to create the child .
You are completely ignoring the rights of the child the woman already agreed to create and also the rights of the man who has just as much at stake as the woman because he may have taken care of the woman based on her taking it to term and he will be required to pay child support if she does have the baby .
The child is not part of the woman 's body .
It has it 's own organs , DNA , brain , thoughts and so forth .
It is identical to the version of itself that ends up being born .
Children born early are not worth less as people nor are children born late worth more being more .
Privacy has nothing to do with it .
If a woman wants to kill a child in the privacy of her home she is not allowed .
If she did not want to be in a situation where she wants to commit murder she should have planned ahead , something that abortion allows people to forego .

Sorry Brad Friedman .
You either have a very poor memory or a very selective one .
I agree that his murder is a heinous act .
But Brad , will you agree with me that aborting fetuses almost 9 months old is also a heinous act .
There is a reason that only 3 clinics in the entire country do it .
So please do n't make this guy out to be some kind of gift to womanhood .
Spare me your lame platitudes .
P.S Brad - see if you can post a comment without foul language .
Pretty immature of you .

The fact that he was not murdered is a ridiculous premise you put forth .

I know it will come as a shock to the anti-abortion crowd , but under Anglo - American common law , the killing of an unborn fetus was not considered murder or even a homicide .
Those legal words ( homicide / murder ) were reserved for the taking of a life after a live birth and prior to a natural death .

It says O'Reilly is n't responsible for what happened , and most would tend to agree ; but there is a dangerous new law that could land him in jail - the Hate Bill .
I 'm sure they would n't use it against him .
He 's well - supported by a large branch of the mainstream media .
But technically he could be charged under this bill as also responsible .
Morally he is , but the Hate Bill sets a seriously questionable precedence for freedom of speech in general .

Ok , whenever deformed people are murdered you are responsible .
You are a sick sick individual who would fit right into to Nazi society seeing as how the first thing they did was go after handicapped people .
To imply that handicapped people should hate themselves or end their lives really means you are an evil sick freak like all pro-abortionists .

As an addendum to my previous post in which I noted that under Anglo / American common law the death of an unborn fetus was neither murder nor homicide , I would add that the concept that life begins at conception is a religious one , not a legal one .
The entire anti-abortion crusade is predicated on the unfortunate belief by religious fanatics that they have a right to force others to accept their religious doctrine .
This is not to say that a state has no right to regulate the issue .
Under Roe v.
Wade , the state has a legitimate interest during the third trimester , but it is troubling to see the likes of Bill O'Reilly trying to become judge and jury by declaring Dr. Tiller to be a " murderer " --- opening the door to a vigilante executioner .
What is so troubling about the many fanatic anti-abortion crowd posting here and elsewhere is that they have lost sight of the fact that we are a nation of laws .
It is for our courts to determine whether a doctor has so much as violated our laws , let alone whether he or she is guilty of murder .
O'Reilly 's tirades are irresponsible journalism at its worse and a despicable incitement to the cold - blooded murder of Dr. Tiller .
Tries as you might , you cannot evade that basic truth .

Cann4ing : Scientifically it is a fact that there is no difference between the baby in the womb and the baby outside of it .
The woman 's uterus is just a container .
Scientifically we 've found far more evidence than ever before that the baby acts just like a baby inside the womb .
The religious dogma is that of feminism allowing woman to murder because it is just what happens to be convenient sometimes .
Ya , murder is sometimes convenient , that is why it is generally against the law .
If it was n't convenient no one would ever do it .
You can not call an opinion an incitement of an act .
You can not call into question free speech if it is n't a direct lie making someone think an action is necessary .
The fact is he killed babies and was killed by someone for it .
That someone will go to jail and yet none of this is relevant to whether or not murder ( abortion ) should be called murder .
It is murder and will be called murder .

ML @ 92 asked : if some crazy guy reading Bradblog frequently and obsessively decided to off Tom Feeney or the former CEO of Diebold based on the heated ( even if slightly less so than target Bill's ) rhetoric occasionally encountered here , would you be liable , Brad ?
First , I have n't argued O'Reilly 's " liability " in the matter , but rather reported on how he 'd demonized Tiller over and over as a " killer " who " executes babies " , etc .
Second , we have never demonized either Feeney or Diebold as " killers " in any way .
We have reported on independently verifiable information concerning the way they have conducted business .
Where O'Reilly repeatedly used ad hominem accusations that Tiller was committing violent acts of murder , and " exterminations " ( which would be illegal ) , without supplying evidence for same , he was doing little more than enflaming his base with incitement to take violent action in response , as I see it .
To equate substantive reportage on folks accused of breaking the law , or behaving irresponsibly , versus declaring someone akin to a Nazi exterminator carrying out an active " death mill " seems a tremendous stretch as far as I see it .
Not even close , in fact .
And , btw , I am always extremely careful with whatever I write here for the few thousand folks who read it ( versus the millions who tune in to O'Reilly on a daily basis ) to be careful about inciting anyone to acts of violence .
Though I have the tiniest fraction of the audience that O'Reilly does , I 'm constantly extremely careful in that regard , often obsessive about it , in fact .
O'Reilly has shown absolutely no similar inclination .
As they say in Spider - Man , with power comes responsibility .
I have not seen evidence that Bill O'Reilly has any understanding of that very correct point .

The point about aborting horribly deformed fetuses is that they would most probably be unable to live outside the womb , and that the life of the mother is at stake if brought to term .
That is purely life saving , and your suggestion that this is " sick " is extremely ill - considered .

Can be applied to remove the DANGEROUS CULT'S POWER SOURCE -- our airwaves .
And I have to take an unpopular side .
It is n't Bill O'Reilly who commit the murder .
( It 's called Murder , not Terrorism . )
If I had to be on a jury in Bill O'Reilly 's case , I would simply wait to see if he had gun shot residue on his hands , dna from a bloody knife , no ?
Nullification time .
People have choice .
You do n't have to become a psychopathic murderer .
As far as inciting people to acts of violence , it 's questionable .
What if doctors and cops starting rounding people up forcing them to take vaccines ?
Vaccines which are known to kill people and destroy their brain ?
Would that be domestic terrorism ?
It 'sad only a few years ago , all these types of comments would be considered mis-communications , or elevating it to something to be sued over or worst investigated .
Perhaps an apology being only needed at the first level .
( maybe the person was drunk )
Now with the Constitution gone anyone who speaks their mind ( even if it 's misguided ) is labeled a terrorist in some secret database .
It 's obvious the FCC needs an overhaul .
A way for feedback to have teeth into America 's most dangerous cult --- Corporate Media .
And the whole web / internet crackdown on misguided posts , needs to simply be moderated with common sense , by the owners of the blogs , instead of dictated to by government .
Word of mouth will quickly isolate those who we all deem as " too much " , " over the top . "
They shoot their own foot .
It 's a skill set very few have anymore .
Brad seems to get it right here in this thread , he knows his limits .
It 's getting to the point where if you " wish
someone dead " your basically saying you want them dead .
Utter nonsense .
While I defend O'Reilly here , as he has a right to be an idiot , I also believe it 's ultimately the woman 's right to choose --- not men , and I also believe we have a right to ban the asshole from our " public spectrum " , as well as a right to label corporate media what it is .
" A dangerous cult . "
Ignoring the criminal part of what has happened , should we not be working our ass's off to hold corporate media responsible by controlling the grant or denial of a frequency , and station ?

Men have no say , but men should if women can .
I think neither should have the ability to do it though .
" The man will also have to spend a large portion of his life paying for the child in some cases even if the child is not biologically his . " " --- as he should !
regarding men paying for children that are not biologically theirs , it does not happen a lot and is usually in the case of a man who was already caring for that child long before he found out it wasnt his , as such , it does not matter that the child is not biologically his as he was the father "
How can you say that ?
If the crime went undetected for a long time then what the mother did was even worse .
To say that fraud is ok as long as the fraudster gets away with it is preposterous .
" biased family courts fathers should financially care for their children , if they wanted to step up and be primary care giver , then they should fight for it and then if the mother works she'd be paying child support - when a couple with children separate , the man becomes single and the woman becomes a single mother - it isnt the courts that decree this so dont kid yourself there buddy "
The point about biased family courts is that they actually do almost always rule in favor of the mother .
I know you do n't care , but do n't be ignorant .
" a father should contribute money to the rearing of his child "
Well , he has like absolutely no say in whether or not it is born after it is conceived so why can't he just say until it actually is born that he does n't want it anymore and that if the woman wants to go through with it she can but he wo n't have any financial responsibility ?
Oh I know why we can't do that , we can't do it because it does n't unfairly discriminate in favor of women .
" i dont have to worry about being arrested for making a private decision to have a medical procedure because abortion is legal "
It is not a medical procedure anymore than shooting someone is .
It is legal , but it should be illegal .
" ( and just to bring some levity to this discourse , i do not have to attach a hose from my body to my whom to sustain life while i am inside of it either ... genius lol ) " You eat food out of it .
You breath the air inside of it .
It is really a similar thing .
An even better analogy though would be an astronaut since they actually do have tubes attached and such .
Of course , I would n't want to use that analogy .
Why would you care about something that does n't affect you ?
After all , you can't picture yourself inside a womb getting your brains sucked out .
Rarely is anyone who experienced anything like that going to come out and give their say on it .

______________________________
Really ?
So if a fetus that has been in utero for two months is removed from the womb , it can breathe and survive off its mother 's breast milk ?
If you are going to make illogical claims about science , Evan , you might try backing them up with a link to a scientific journal .
Next , when Bill O'Reilly or any other commentator said that Dr. Tiller was a murderer , they are no longer " merely expressing an opinion . "
It is a factual claim that the targeted individual --- here Dr. Tiller --- has committed a crime .
If untrue , the statement is not " protected " free speech , but , instead , amounts to libel .
Let 's consider just the second graphic in which O'Reilly describes Dr. Tiller as a baby killer .
If , legally , there was no difference between a baby after birth and a late term abortion , then Dr. Tiller would have been indicted by the relevant authorities for murder I and brought before the bar of justice .
The fact that Dr. Tiller had performed the procedure for over a span of years reflects that , in the eyes of the law , there is a very real difference between a late - term abortion and the premeditated killing of a baby after its live birth .
Yet O'Reilly took it on himself to be judge and jury , and , predictably , a nut case out there who listened to his tripe , took matters into his own hands .

While I am writing this the statesmen of the country are asking themselves if it is not time to make laws which shall restrict if they do not put a stop to immigration .
In 100 years Denver will be as big as New York and in the center of a vast population .
If the republic remains politically compact and does n't fall apart at the Mississippi river , Canada will be either part of it or an independent sovereignty , and the northern shore of the Gulf of Mexico will be the Riviera of the western continent .
I guess that there will be great political and social changes in our country before the year 1993 , and that these changes will be advantageous to the community at large .
I guess that before the next century shall end the functions and powers of our government will be greatly enlarged ; that railroads , telegraphs and many other things now held as private spoil will be public property ; that law , medicine and theology will be more reasonable than they now are ; that the inventions and discoveries will be greater than we have ever yet had , and that the welfare of mankind will be higher than it is in this age of confusion .

Kimi Raikkonen is convinced Ferrari will win races this season after the team 's promising performance at the Monaco Grand Prix .
The Italian squad endured a dismal start to the year , but seems to have turned the corner following the introduction of an upgrade package in Spain .
Raikkonen scored the team 's first podium of the season in Monaco , with Felipe Massa coming home in fourth to complete Ferrari 's strongest outing of the year .
Now the Finnish driver , who was disappointed with third position , reckons it 's just a matter of time before Ferrari wins again .
" I was n't too happy with the third place at the Monaco GP .
For sure it was the best result of the last times , but that was nothing new to me and we knew that we could arrive on a place on the top , " said Raikkonen .
" When the leaders in the championship are so far ahead in the classification , in the end it 's only a victory that counts .
Being back on the podium is a nice reward for the whole team .
The hard work of the last weeks finally bears some fruit , which is really positive for all of us .
" We know that we 're on the right way now : there are still some minor things to be done but sooner or later we will win .
" We 'll show up with further improvements of the F60 in the upcoming races and we hope we can then challenge the leaders even more , in the qualifying and in the race . "
Raikkonen , who started the race from second place , felt missing out on pole position was a big handicap for him .
" The Monaco qualifying is so much more important than on other tracks and we 've almost done a perfect job : we missed the pole by 25 thousandths of a second .
Not starting from the first position means that it 's very likely you wo n't win .
Furthermore the second position on the grid does n't help on this track .
" You start from the dirty side of the track and whenever I found myself in this position I always lost at least one position in the field , because the tyres spin a lot at the start .
In fact Rubens overtook me , which was really a shame .
If I had managed to stay behind Button I think I could have easily opened a gap .
" In the end it was difficult to fight for second position and then there was this story at the last pitstop , where we lost a couple of seconds , due to a problem with the right rear wheel .
When I took up the race again I was further behind the Brazilian than before .
" We brought home both cars and gained some important points .
There were many things at Monaco we can be satisfied with . "
Ok , who listened to President Obama 's press conference last night discussing his first 100 days in office ?
If not , track down a transcript .
First , despite the fact that the questions are scripted and it is not an open give and take forum , Obama is masterful at making one think it is an open and critical dialogue in which the best argument wins .
His rhetoric appeals to anyone who finds reasonableness a virtue --- which should be anyone .
Conservative pundits often point back to Reagan as the example of rhetorical master , but Reagan was a rhetorical master based on an ideological principle --- " Mr. Gorbachev Tear Down This Wall " or " Trust But Verify " when dealing with the " Evil Empire " .
Obama is a rhetorical master for the egg - head class .
We want rigorous debate , we want all sides heard , we come at this with no ideological blinders on , but instead let good argument and evidence win the day .
We listen hard , think even harder , and make up our minds based on reason and evidence .
He uses this rhetoric so much , we believe it .
Politics not by principle nor by interest , but politics as good conversation , where good is defined by the norms of academic debate in the ideal .
It is as if the intellectual culture of the University of Chicago has come to Washington .
Second , Obama seems completely sincere in his proclamation that he has enough on his plate dealing with two wars , a health care crisis , the need to improve education , bring us energy independence , and deal with a potential pandemic to also want take over the economy .
He told everyone last night that he would have loved nothing more than to have come into office and not had to deal with the economic crisis , but had he not dealt with it as he did , we would have faced the collapse of the entire financial system .
Government had to take over the banks and had to take over the auto - industry .
But his goal , he assured us , is to return the banks and the automobile companies to the private sector as quickly as possible .
Again , the rhetoric is reasonable , but also stresses the sense of urgency and responsibility with which the actions were taken .
Perhaps the debate could n't go on much longer because the need for action was immediate .
So even a reasonable person will cut off discussion and move to act based on the best information available to him .
If he did n't act as he has these first 100 days , to the best of his knowledge we would be in a much worse situation than we are with respect to the economy .
So perhaps the University of Chicago culture cannot quite make it to Washington --- at least the arguments of Chicago economists such as Cochrane or Zingales or Mulligan or Murphy or Becker .
Third , this does raise a broader issue about the relationship between ideological blinders and pragmatic politics --- either of the interest group or debate club variety .
When I was writing my book The Political Economy of Soviet Socialism : The Formative Years , 1918 - 1928 , I framed my contribution as bringing the economic way of thinking into a dispute among historians on whether the excesses of the War Communism period ( 1918 - 1921 ) were due to ideology or expediency , and whether the instability of NEP was due to the internal logic of interventionism or opportunism on the part of Stalin .
The historical narrative I presented was one in which an ideology confronts a refactory reality .
The tragedy of the Soviet Union was indeed due to an ideology , but we only come to know the " tragedy " of it because of the logic of economics that points out that this particular ideology cannot possible achieve what it sets out to achieve in this reality .
The tragedy is instead the unintended and undesirable consequence of policy steps .
But to the leaders who acted in 1917 and 1918 , and in 1921 , and again in 1928 ( and along the way ) their decisions were filtered through the ideological lens of Marxism .
There was revolutionary sincerity on the part of Lenin , Trotsky , Bukharin , Stalin , etc .
There was opportunistic politics as well , but those opportunities presented themselves precisely because the sincere belief system failed to achieve its goals and thus failure required explanation and action .
In short , ideology frames what is considered expedient .
And expedience is what is considered " reasonable " in a time of crisis .
I think our current policy path proves this interaction thesis once again .
The economists who have been studying our financial mess closest to those in power are sincere when they argue that had we not acted policy wise the way we have we would have faced financial ruin as a country ( and perhaps world - wide ) .
They sincerely believe the steps taken then and now are the only reasonable steps to deal with the crisis .
But what if they are wrong ?
They are wrong , the argument goes , because their analytical frame of reference ( the set of eyeglasses they are wearing to " read " the crisis ) is wrong .
So rather than fixing the crisis , they in fact are creating the crisis .
Is this debate taking place vigorously inside the Obama White House ?
Finally , how sincere does one believe the claim that the US government wants to return the banking system and the auto - industry to the private sector as quickly as possible really is ?
Whatever doubts one might have , one must admit that to egg - heads the professorial style that Obama adopts and the ease with which he speaks to us is pretty effective that he is a man of " reason " and not ideological emotions run amock all the while his administration is engaged in a series of hyperactive ideological moves to transform the US economy .
Obama is masterful in his rhetoric , but the consequences will be devastating in reality if the mainline of economic thinking ( from Adam Smith to F. A. Hayek and Milton Friedman ) is the more accurate portrayal of reality .
The most ambitous ideological dreams do run afoul of a refractory reality .
Palm needs the Pre to be a success
Palm 's make or break new smartphone , called the Pre , has had good reviews ahead of its US launch on 6 June .
The company , which hired many ex-Apple employees to build the device , needs the Pre to be a success in order to turn its fortunes around .
Once a giant of the smartphone sector , Palm has struggled in recent years to match Apple , Nokia and Blackberry .
Many reviews have said the phone is the first serious challenger to the iPhone in terms of design and usability .
CNET
We have n't seen so much buzz over a phone since the iPhone , but for the past six months , all eyes have been on the Palm Pre .
Despite some missing features and performance issues that make it less than ideal for on - the - go professionals , the Palm Pre offers gadget lovers and consumers well - integrated features and unparalleled multitasking capabilities .
Cnet says the Pre is " the most legitimate rival to the iPhone yet " .
BUSINESSWEEK
The phone has been designed to make organising your life simpler
If the Palm Pre had appeared a year ago , it might have turned the smartphone market upside down .
It would have beaten out Apple 's iPhone 3G and the iTunes App Store , Google 's Android , the BlackBerry Bold and Storm as well as BlackBerry App World , and possibly taken the spoils .
It is easy to forget that when the iPhone launched , it also had software and hardware issues .
The difference is that Apple was effectively pioneering a new market , so it had plenty of time to get the formula right .
Palm , a struggling company going up against surprisingly strong competition , faces a vastly more difficult challenge .
I am pulling for the Pre , but I would n't want to bet my iPhone on its success .
According to Business Week , the Pre is " way behind the iPhone on software " .
WALL STREET JOURNAL
I 've been testing the Pre for a couple of weeks , and I like it a lot , despite some important drawbacks that will have to be remedied .
I consider the Pre to be potentially the strongest rival to the iPhone to date , provided it attracts lots of third - party apps , which it sorely lacks at launch .
Whether the Pre is better than the iPhone depends on your personal preferences , though I 'd note that the new iPhone to be unveiled next week will have lots of added features that could alter those calculations .
The Journal says its " biggest advantage over the iPhone is ... a real physical keyboard that slides out from its curved body " .
NEW YORK TIMES
The Pre , which goes on sale Saturday , is an elegant , joyous , multitouch smartphone ; it 's the iPhone remixed .
The Pre 's all - new operating system , called Web OS , is attractive , fluid and exciting .
It borrows plenty from the iPhone  pinch or spread two fingers on the screen to zoom in or out , for example , or flick a list item sideways to delete it  but has its own personality .
The Pre will be a hit , but the iPhone is n't going away .
First of all , Apple 's lead of 20 million phones will only grow when the new iPhone 3.0 software ( and , presumably , a third iPhone model ) come out shortly .
The Times adds the Pre is not quite as simple as the iPhone .
Before legislation becomes law in France , it must pass the muster of the Conseil Constitutionnel : a group of jurists who determine whether each new law is consistent with the principles and rules of France 's constitution .
For the passage of Sarkozy 's unpopular " three strikes " HADOPI legislation , the approval of the Conseil was the final hurdle to cross .
If the council had approved the law , rightsholders in France would have been able to cast French citizens off the Internet with no judicial oversight , simply by alleging to the new HADOPI administrative body that they were repeat copyright infringers .
These citizens would then have their names added to a national Internet blacklist for up to a year , and ISPs would be subject to financial penalties if they gave these exiles access to the Internet .
Today , the Conseil declared the most important parts of HADOPI unconstitutional , and invalidated HADOPI 's ability to issue termination orders to ISPs .
In doing so , it seems to have effectively put an end to the central idea behind France 's Three Strikes law - the creation of an expedited ( and potentially due process - free ) administrative process for terminating citizens ' access to the Internet .
In a clear rebuke , the Conseil stated that the French legislature did not have the right to pass controls on Internet access to a non-judicial authority , as this would violate Article 11 ( the right of freedom of speech ) of the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man ; and that in bypassing judicial review , the law also violated Article 9 , which states that all are presumed innocent until declared guilty .
This stark recognition that HADOPI goes against two of the most basic , universal , human rights should give any government pause before considering adopting similar legislation .
Given the continuing failure of efforts to introduce HADOPI - like plans in New Zealand ( where the government backed down ) , Ireland ( where ISPs stood up ) , and now in France , will global policymakers now resist the media industries ' push for these wrong - headed termination proposals , and seek more reasonable and just solutions to the challenges these businesses now face in the digital age ?
Let 's hope that the French constitutional court 's rejection of HADOPI marks the final strike for " three strikes " .
Since its initial release in 1991 , the Python programming language has steadily grown in popularity .
Designed by Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum ( a.k.a. Python ’s Benevolent Dictator for Life ) , its conciseness , power , flexibility , portability , and large ecosystem of readily available libraries have gained it many converts .
Today it is used in a wide variety of diverse environments —
Google is powered by Python , as is the popular Web development framework Zope .
On UNIX / Linux it is also viewed by many as a modern replacement for Perl , which has historically been the " heavy lifting " scripting tool on those platforms .
Where I work , we use Python for a wide variety of intraweb , scripting , and automation tasks , including a large regression testing framework we use to test our software .
Python is not without its issues , however .
The most widely deployed implementation is interpreted ( i.e. it does n’t compile all the way down to native machine code ) , which has significant performance implications .
It also does not handle multithreaded code well , since parts of the Python interpreter are inherently single - threaded .
Python ’s lack of full multithreading support has become increasingly problematic as multi-core CPUs have become the norm .
Developers have typically worked around these limitations by coding performance - critical portions of the application in C or C++ ; the compiled C/C++ code is then called by the Python script .
While certainly workable ( and well supported by Python ) , this approach increases development times , complicates debugging , and hurts portability of high - performance Python applications .
Fast - forward to 2009 .
Guido is now a Google employee , and a team at Google has decided to take on the ambitious task of replacing much of the underpinnings of the Python language , with the goals of removing the interpreter performance bottlenecks and making true multithreaded Python applications possible .
All without hurting backward compatibility with existing Python applications … a rather tall order !
The project is code - named Unladen Swallow , and the team already has a detailed plan outlining its intended approach , which will occur in stages .
By mid-year , they intend to replace the existing Python interpreter with a more efficient one based on LLVM .
This has some immediate benefits — eliminating the relatively inefficient stack - based architecture of the current Python interpreter with the more efficient LLVM register - based architecture should result in significant performance gains .
Longer term , it paves the way for compilation to optimized native machine code , which has the potential to make Python performance comparable to that of other languages that compile to native machine code ( like C/ C ++ ) .
Once the transition to LLVM is complete , the team plans to tackle other optimizations and enhancements , including the multithreading issue .
Speaking as a long - time ( quarter of a century ! )
C/C++ developer and relatively recent convert to Python , I find the Unladen Swallow project a very exciting development .
If successful , I believe it will position Python to compete directly with C/C++ in the systems , applications , and gaming markets .
It could also accelerate Python ’s displacement of other scripting languages like Perl and PHP in the server infrastructure and Web application markets .
Furthermore , the portability of Python ( and its supporting libraries ) has the potential to make it much easier for developers to port applications between platforms : moving apps between Windows , Mac OS , and Linux could literally become as simple as recompiling a set of Python modules .
If Unladen Swallow pans out , I think it is entirely plausible that , in the not - too - distant future , we could even see a commercial cross- platform FPS game implemented entirely in Python — something that would be unthinkable with the current Python implementation .
Kudos to Google for its willingness to fund R&D efforts to improve a technology that has the potential to benefit everyone !
The English language is on the verge of adding its one millionth word and according to the Global Language Monitor , that word just might be " noob . "
The Global Language Monitor recognizes words once they 've been used 25,000 times by media outlets , social networks and other sources , and says the widespread use of English as a second language throughout Asia has resulted in its most dramatic growth since Shakespeare 's era .
The group currently predicts that the English language will hit the magic million mark at 10:22 am on June 10 , and " noob " - including , presumably , its synonyms " n00 b " and " newb " - could very well take the crown .
It 's not a lock for the title , however .
Other words in the running include " defollow " and " defriend , " which refer to the act of dropping Twitter and Facebook contacts , " greenwashing , " which describes the activities of companies attempting to appear environmentally friendly , and " chiconomics , " which has something to do with maintaining a fashionable lifestyle during times of recession .
" Despite having a million words at our disposal it is unlikely that we will ever use more than just a tiny fraction of them , " said Global Language Monitor Chief Analyst Paul Payack .
" The average person 's vocabulary is fewer than 14,000 words out of these million that are available .
A person who is linguistically gifted would only use 70,000 words . "
Of course , nailing down a specific one millionth entry in the English lexicon is an iffy proposition at best and some linguists have questioned whether such a determination can be made at all .
For my part , I must admit to a certain ambivalence over the possibility that a milestone so noteworthy might be achieved by leet - speak ; I realize that languages are organic and evolving but this feels vaguely regressive somehow .
Is n't it just a tiny bit sad that 400 years of progress has brought us from " Let me be cruel , not unnatural ; I will speak daggers to her , but use none , " to " QQ more , noob ? "

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
The Cibola National Forest surrounds the Plains of San Augustine in a remote and sparsely populated region of New Mexico .
Located roughly 90 kilometers ( 50 miles ) west of Socorro , New Mexico , the forest encompasses “ lowlands ” down to elevations of 1,500 meters ( 5,000 feet ) , and it drapes around a range of mountains with peaks as high as 3,425 meters ( 11,301 feet ) .
The mountains shelter the central valley from the radio frequency transmissions of civilization — such as the city of Albuquerque roughly 118 kilometers ( 73 miles ) to the northeast — making it a good location for radio astronomy .
In fact , the plains are home to one of the world ’s premier astronomical radio observatories , the Very Large Array ( VLA ) , a set of 27 identical radio dishes spread out across the plains .
Among the VLA ’s major contributions to space science and astronomy , it was here that NASA listened for the transmissions from the Voyager 2 spacecraft as it flew past Neptune in 1989 .
Some elements of the array are visible in this Landsat satellite image of the region from May 6 , 2002 .
Several faint lines are arranged in an inverted Y shape in the lower image .
The Y shape is punctuated in places by white dots .
The dots are the radio dishes .
With a diameter of 25 meters ( 82 feet ) , the dishes are slightly smaller than the resolution ( level of detail ) of Landsat 7 ( image pixels are 30 meters by 30 meters ) , but they show up in the image because their bright white surfaces make such a sharp contrast to the dark ground around them .
The inverted Y is the railroad tracks and service roads that connect the dishes .
The array can be rearranged by shifting the dishes to different configurations along the railroad tracks .
At the time of this Landsat image , the VLA was spread out in its widest configuration .
Every three months , the individual dishes are moved into one of four standard arrangements , giving astronomers access to different levels of detail and sensitivity to larger or smaller astronomical features .

A Sinn Fein spokesman in Belfast responded to questions from The Sunday Telegraph on behalf of all five of the party 's MPs .
He said : " It is widely known that Sinn Fein MPs travel regularly to London on Parliamentary business and utilise the accommodation that we rent when there .
We do not purchase properties at public expense and therefore do not profit from the expenses claimed as of right .
The rent we pay on these properties are all inclusive of parking , utilities , housekeeping etc and therefore you are not comparing like with like . "
British soldiers ' tortured and murdered 20 Iraqis , then covered it up with firefight claim '
British soldiers tortured and murdered up to 20 Iraqis in cold blood , the High Court was told yesterday .
It happened after a three - hour gun battle at an Army checkpoint near Basra , a lawyer claimed .
Rabinder Singh said a group of local men were taken prisoner and transported to an Army camp where they were beaten with a rusty tent pole , punched , slammed against walls , denied water , blasted with loud music and forced to strip naked in the presence of a woman – a humiliation for Muslim men .
Camp Abu Naji : MP
Ann Clwyd at the base where abuse allegedly happened
The next day , he said , only nine were still alive – and 20 corpses were returned to their families .
One was teenager Hamid Al - Sweady .
The Army claims the men all died in the initial gun battle , but Hamid 's uncle Khuder Al - Sweady and five survivors of the incident yesterday began a court battle in London to win an independent inquiry .
The clash in May 2004 came after insurgents launched a heavy attack on a checkpoint known as Danny Boy in Al Majar - al - Kabir – the town north of Basra where six military policeman had been murdered the previous year .
According to Army accounts , the soldiers were heavily outnumbered but fought back heroically , mounting a bayonet charge at one point , until the attackers were defeated .
The Army says only nine Iraqis were taken away alive for questioning .
But Mr Singh said that when the shooting was over , the British troops took bloody revenge .
He said : ' It is the claimants ' case that at least some of those captured were tortured and killed by British troops between 14 and 15 May 2004 , and that there has been no effective investigation into what happened to them in that 24 - hour period .
' This constitutes a substantive and procedural breach of the European Convention on Human Rights . '
He added : ' There is a lot of evidence from soldiers at the battlefield that there were more than nine that were taken alive .
' Many of the bodies of the Iraqis returned on 15 May 2004 were severely disfigured and some appeared to show marks of torture and mutilation . '
The Ministry of Defence says a tenmonth Royal Military Police investigation showed the 20 dead were killed in the initial battle .
The corpses were taken to be identified before being returned to their families , with no evidence of torture .
The hearing continues
I saw a picture today on the blog of another Dad I follow that made me laugh ; wince ; smile ruefully and then cross my legs , all in the space of seconds .
It is a rare thing that can encapsulate all of these emotions at one time , but this did .
It is a real life merit badge for those of us that have ‘ taken one for the team ’ , and ensured that we can no longer over - populate this ever shrinking planet of ours .
Do n’t get me wrong , population density of the planet was not the reason for this drastic decision .
Over -population of our house , however , was a major factor .
Our house is a 3 bed semi- detached Victorian cottage , quaint , previously tranquil , and a bit kooky .
I loved this place from the first time we saw it 7 , 8 or 9 years ago .
Incidentally have you noticed that the older you get , the less sure about dates you are .
I must have foreseen this coming , as I had our wedding date engraved on the inside of my wedding ring .
Anytime I am unsure , I just slip it off , take a sneaky peek , and another night on the couch is avoided .
Anyway I digress ( another thing that seems to be happening more and more ) , the house always seemed the right size until No3 , Mate , turned up .
At the moment Dawn has her own room at the end of the hall .
Initially this was to spare her all the tears and tantrums from No2 baby Katy , but since she turned 15 and has discovered boys , it is to spare us from all her tears and tantrums .
Katy and Mate share the bedroom next to ours , which has resulted in a fair set of adventures in itself , and a subject worthy of its own blog .
Our room is just one thin wall away , so no more TV in bed , well actually no more anything in bed .
Any declaration of our love happens downstairs , lest we wake the little buggers up .
Do n’t be too impressed by our al dente approach to matrimonials , the loudest thing is normally me falling over trying to get my trousers off before removing my trainers .
Foreplay is taking my socks off first , or whispering sweet nothings like “ they must be asleep by now ” , or “ Ok , whose turn is it ? ”
Another plus point of being downstairs is that you are only 4 steps from the fridge for the post - match beer ( and a glass of wine for the laydee ) , but on the downside we have laminate floors , so it can be a bit tough on the old knees .
So the decision was made , we did n’t want to move , so I was packed off to be neutered .
Scant regard was given to my feelings on this matter , once her mind is made up there is never any turning back ( unless she has forgotten her mobile , then we always have to turn back ) .
So callous and cavalier was her treatment of me that I was actually grateful that she had not made an appointment with a Vet for the procedure .
I could just imagine me in a room of tight lipped , steadfast women holding onto leashes , with their husbands on the other end , lolling on the floor with hound - dog expressions .
So off I went to the pre-procedure appointment , where they sit you down and try to talk you out of it and explain how serious it is .
I mean honestly , you are going to grab hold of my Crown Jewels , and then attack them with either a sharp knife or some laser - burny - thingy , and you feel the need to tell me it ’s serious – no shit Sherlock .
I had come prepared with a video clip on my phone of the kids hitting each other with plastic golf clubs from a BBQ brawl to convince him .
When he still looked dubious , I explained that my Wife was from Irish - Catholic stock , and that sealed the deal .
I had to return in 2 weeks , with someone to drive me home , and 2 pairs of clean and tight fitted boxer shorts .
That was the one thing that stood out , 2 pairs of pants , why ?
Was there going to be so much blood that the second pair would be needed to soak it all up , lest the next victim ( I mean patient ) would be scared off ?
I just could not figure it out .
V - day arrived , 6th January to be precise , and by God it was cold that winter .
Now I started to panic .
As all men know the cold is never kind to us , and here I was about to get my tackle out for an audience , and it was bloody freezing .
Do I walk into the room all cold and diminished , or do I involve myself in a bit of self - manipulation just before hand ( boom boom ) just to give a good showing ?
What if I went too far though , would it be sending the wrong signals to the Doctor ?
I must have been insane to be worrying about such an inconsequential thing , but it must have been self - denial ’s way of keeping me off the real issue of becoming a semi-eunuch .
I solved the dilemma by making sure the heating in the car was on full blast all the way there .
That just meant that I looked really red cheeked and embarrassed by the time I got there , but that seemed to be the lesser of two evils .
I ’m not sure I can bring myself to describe the operation ( which you are awake for ) in any detail .
I just do n’t think it would be fair to all those who are going to follow in my pantsteps , but needless to say it is not something I would ever like to repeat .
There was a lot of fumbling and tugging , but without the usual outcome , in fact the exact opposite .
The Wife drove me home , and to her credit she did well to hide the “ No balls now , we ’ll just see who ’s boss ” look .
I was told I had to stay in bed for two days , wearing the two pairs of pants , and not drive or lift anything .
I managed to substitute upstairs for downstairs ( no X - Box or DVD upstairs ) , and turn two days into four .
The only plus point was being able to shout for anything I needed .
Every time I asked for a beer , my wife would be all “ are you sure that is wise ? ” to which I would reply “ I became a gelding so you could stay in this house , the least I deserve is a beer ! ”
It was a tender couple of weeks to say the least , with me walking like John Wayne behind a smirking Wife every time we went to Tesco’s .
Another thing they had warned me about was that there might be some blood left in the tubes .
A piece of information I had stored in the furthest reaches of my mind , until when following the Doctor ’s orders , and emptying said tubes , everything had turned a day - glo pink !
A memory , I am sure , that will haunt me till my grave .
I recovered eventually , and I do n’t care what any Doctor tells you , it does feel a bit different now , not as full up I guess .
So I guess the moral of this story is , buy a big house from the off , as you never know what life is going to throw at you , or snip off you !
I must thank Russ , who posted the badge on the blog site he runs with his mate Jasper , “ Dads who mock the world ” .

Memphis Grizzlies guard O.J. Mayo has communicated with the U.S. Attorney 's office amid allegations that federal laws may have been violated when Mayo 's former adviser gave him money and gifts during his high school and college career , according to a source with knowledge of the case .
The source would not elaborate on Mayo's contact with federal authorities .
The development comes as the NCAA is looking into whether Mayo's brother Todd Mayo , a high school basketball player , also received improper benefits .
Dan Goodman , the deputy criminal chief of the U.S. Attorney 's office for the Central District of Los Angeles , said : " We could n't comment whether there 's an ongoing investigation or not . "
Federal authorities are investigating Rodney Guillory , the adviser , for possible tax evasion and misuse of charitable organization funds , according to reports .
The NCAA , Pac - 10 , FBI , IRS and U.S. Attorney 's office have been interested in speaking with Mayo since they began investigating questions raised in a May 2008 , " Outside the Lines " report that detailed how Mayo had accepted about $ 30,000 in cash and other benefits from Guillory .
The " Outside the Lines " report included an interview with former Guillory associate Louis Johnson , who said he helped Guillory provide Mayo with money , meals , clothes , a flat - screen television and other goods until 2008 , shortly before Mayo finished his freshman season at USC .
The gifts and cash began when Mayo was in high school at North College Hill in Cincinnati .
The 6 - foot - 4 Mayo left USC after his freshman season and was taken with the third pick in the NBA draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves .
After a trade , he played this season with the Grizzlies and averaged 18.5 points a game .
While Mayo has responded to inquiries from law enforcement , for more than a year he has declined requests to set up a meeting with NCAA investigators looking into the allegations .
After the " Outside the Lines " report aired , Mayo told reporters he planned to cooperate with the NCAA .
Mayo could not be reached for comment .
In a concurrent investigation , federal authorities are investigating whether Bill Duffy Associates Sports Management ( BDA Sports ) funneled up to $ 250,000 to Guillory in exchange for Mayo signing a contract with Duffy 's agency .
After he declared for the NBA draft , Mayo signed with agent Calvin Andrews of BDA Sports , but they split shortly after the " Outside the Lines " report aired .
Andrews was suspended from representing players for one year by the National Basketball Players Association in connection with the Mayo case .
Mayo is now represented by agent Leon Rose .
In the latest development of the NCAA 's investigation , the enforcement staff wants to know whether Guillory paid for a flight for Mayo's younger brother , Todd Mayo , from Los Angeles to Columbus , Ohio , in 2007 while O.J. Mayo was in summer school at USC , Johnson 's attorneys Anthony Salerno and David Murphy confirmed .
The attorneys also confirmed that NCAA investigators want to know whether Guillory paid for Todd Mayo's cell phone service while O.J. Mayo was in college .
Todd Mayo is a basketball player himself .
This past season he averaged 23 points a game as a junior at Houston High School in suburban Memphis .
Attorneys for Johnson confirmed on Wednesday that NCAA investigators asked Johnson about two documents from the " Outside the Lines " report that are linked to Todd Mayo .
One of the documents the NCAA is reviewing is a copy of a Nov. 4 , 2007 T - Mobile invoice charged to a nonprofit foundation run by Guillory .
Johnson told " Outside the Lines " that Guillory paid $ 192.33 for Todd Mayo 's cell service .
Johnson said Guillory paid for Todd Mayo's phone bill as a favor to O.J. Mayo and not as an attempt to " recruit " the younger Mayo .
Murphy said even though Todd was the recipient of the phone service , Guillory paid it to curry favor with the older Mayo brother .
" Given Todd Mayo's relationship to O.J. , any benefit that was given to Todd Mayo could reflect upon the [ NCAA investigation ] as it pertains to O.J. , " Murphy said .
Johnson 's attorneys further confirmed that the NCAA has a copy of another document that " Outside the Lines " obtained : a handwritten receipt with Todd Mayo's name on it , dated Aug. 2 , 2007 .
The receipt is from L.A. Traveling
Tours for the amount of $ 395.80 ( $ 345.80 for the ticket and $ 50 commission , the receipt says ) .
Johnson said Todd Mayo was visiting his brother , who attended summer school at USC during the summer of 2007 .
Johnson said he was with Guillory and Todd Mayo when Guillory purchased in cash the one - way ticket for Todd Mayo from Los Angeles to Columbus .
Todd Mayo lived in Ohio .
Even though Guillory paid for the ticket , according to Johnson , the receipt shows the purchaser 's name as " Ovinton Mayo . "
Johnson said Guillory made sure it appeared that O.J. Mayo had paid for his brother 's flight home .
" He needed [ the receipt ] to say that O.J. bought the ticket , " Johnson said Wednesday .
" It does n't have Rodney 's name on it ... because Rodney was deemed a runner by the NCAA and because there was a lot of scrutiny on him because of his relationship with O.J. "
The NCAA could rule that Todd Mayo received preferential treatment if it's proved that he received gifts from Guillory .
It was unclear how his high school eligibility or college recruitment could be affected by such a ruling .

The Brewster Projects are where Diana Ross , Mary Wilson , and Smokey Robinson grew up .
They were the first federally funded public housing development for African Americans , remnants of a time when black citizens faced restrictive covenants in land deeds that prevented them from moving into white neighborhoods .
The projects were built when the development of I - 75 displaced residents of the black neighborhood of Paradise Valley .
Last year at this time , people were still living in several of the towers until the housing commission shut operations down for good .
By June 2008 , the only people living in the towers were squatters and scrappers diligently removing all recyclable metals from the four towers and numerous low - rises .
All summer you could hear the terrible sound of refrigerators falling 14 stories and crashing on the concrete below .
Scrappers meticulously removed every aluminum window pane , sending down cascades of glass .
Different groups of scrappers claimed territory throughout the projects .
It was like the Wild West .
There 's copper in them buildings .
Not long ago , a Dutch journalist and her photographer were carjacked while reporting from what remains of the Brewster Projects .
That has n't been an issue for me .
I walk there .
This is a high - rise kitchen half deconstructed by scrappers .
They 'll be back .
I quickly became interested in what was left behind in the hundreds of walk - in closets throughout these projects .
This one smelled like it had been occupied very recently .
I can only assume the stolen gas tanks were just there as a way to get high as fuel for portable heaters and that the pack - n - play was there for a sleeping baby .
Some of the furniture looks like it has been there since the 1950s , when the high - rises were built .
Some of the occupants may have spent most of their lives in these rooms .
Of course this leads to the question : where did they all go ?
There are abandoned photographs in many rooms , small hints of the human beings who used to live in these dead buildings .
There are quite a few fake houseplants and fake flowers , deceptions of lingering life .
This was once a display board at the funeral for a beautiful baby boy .
It had several photographs of him playing , smiling .
Surrounding the typed words , " Family , " " Home , " and " Love , " were departing messages from those who attended his funeral .
" One Love --- Your Big Brother , G Mack " . . .
" Little man , I will miss u . "
It lay trampled on the same floor where the baby might once have played , or taken his first steps .
In the rush of eviction , it was left behind .
Some of the closets were full of things , but I was most interested in those where only a few items remained .
Like a hanger , a bible , and a bottle of cologne .
A 1960s suit jacket , still on the haberdasher 's hanger .
A cane , a fanny pack , and a cheap , blue faux - fur stole .
A creepy Styrofoam head with a church hat and part of a weave .
In one apartment I found an elderly woman 's record book , and on pages where she was n't keeping track of bills or crafting long lists of lottery numbers , she was keeping track of her love life .
This page reads , " I am going to buy our ring and ask him to marry me .
I know he going to say yes .
We are going to get marry in Sep .
We will go over to Ohio and get marry .
And later have a big dinner to let people know we are marry . "
On other pages she writes out her first name with his last name over and over like a schoolgirl .
I wo n't say how it ends .
This was her bedroom .
This was one of the offices where files were maintained .
To live in these projects you had to have a job but you could n't earn too much .
And you had to prove it with paystubs , tax forms .
Living with relatives who committed crimes could subject residents to eviction .
The housing authority kept detailed records about everything and just left these private files and reports in the buildings when they were abandoned .
* * * *
I talk about some of these things , and more , in an interview with Dick Gordon on today 's edition of The Story ( one of our favorite programs on public radio ) .
I 'm afraid it makes me out to be much more of an urban explorer than I actually am ( there are many , many people who do this stuff far more and far better than I do ) .
I just have a bully pulpit .
That said , I did get to spend part of yesterday driving around and exploring Detroit 's ruins with Camilo Jose Vergara .
That 's sort of like a foodie getting to hang out with Anthony Bourdain or a trekkie hanging out with William Shatner .
In other words , it was awesome .
If you 're visiting for the first time after hearing me on the radio , welcome .
On this website I write about far more than just buildings and the city where I live .
But you can read some of the things I 've written about Detroit here .
The story about the building with all the books on the floor is here and here .
The story of Detroit 's abandoned Belle Isle Zoo is here .
The photos of Detroit schools that appeared in Vice Magazine are here ( this post describes more recent adventures in schools ) .
And if you 're looking for hope , you might find some here .
NextBus Information Systems responds to this piece here .
Kind of .
When Steven Peterson created Routesy , an iPhone app that lets riders see Muni arrival times , the last thing he expected was to hear was that Muni ’s real - time arrival times were actually the property of a private company located in the East Bay .
But that ’s exactly what happened , when Alex Orloff , COO of a company calling itself NextBus Information Systems , contacted him in August , 2008 , demanding a “ straight revenue split ” or a “ data licensing agreement ” from Peterson .
In other words : this company says that the NextBus predictions generated by Muni — a public agency , owned by San Franciscans — do n’t belong to San Franciscans .
Want to use it ?
Sure , that ’s fine — they ’re happy to rent it back to you for thousands of dollars a month .
And the worst part is : even though their ownership claim is probably bogus , nobody ’s ready to fight it in court .
The story of how public data became the property of a private company — or maybe it did n’t — starts a few months ago with Steven Peterson , a San Franciscan web developer who wanted to build a better iPhone app because he rides Muni every day and likes data .
“ I used to live in the Union Square area and had to ride the 30 or 45 to CalTrain .
I realized that if I could come up with an app that could give me the precise time I needed to be at the bus stop , I could sleep 10 more minutes .
Then I realized that other people might want to sleep in , too , so instead of making it just for myself I made it for everyone . ”
Instead of letting us see when our buses are coming , NBIS locked the arrival times in an imaginary vending machine .
This would be like if advertising giant Clear Channel waltzed into the subway stations , tore down all the Muni maps , and then offered to sell them back to you at a steep markup .
A company called NextBus placed transponders on all Muni vehicles so they could be tracked ; their arrival predictions are displayed in stations , bus shelters , and in their own online and mobile applications .
But do n’t confuse NextBus with NextBus Information Systems ( NBIS ) — a separate company represented , at least in this case , by a guy named Alex Orloff who seems to be laying claim to the data produced by NextBus .
Last fall , after determining that the Routesy ’s user numbers were pretty low ( at that time , about 990 people had downloaded the $ 2.99 app from Apple ’s site ) , Orloff emailed Peterson again , saying “ I do n’t think there is a workable potential licensing arrangement for your application .
You do not make any recurring revenue and we typically quote a price in the tens of thousands of dollars per month to license the prediction data feeds . ”
He demanded an “ orderly shutdown process . ”
After Orloff made his shutdown demand , Peterson did a little digging of his own , and realized that though the company Orloff spoke for , NextBus Information Systems , shared a name with NextBus , the arrival - prediction company responsible for giving you news like “ Next 33 - Stanyan in 148 minutes , ” the affiliation between the companies was tenuous , at best .
He called Orloff ’s bluff , told him he had no right to shut Routesy down , and the conversation seemed to be over .
That is , until Orloff reared his head again about two weeks ago .
This time , he went to Apple , and in an email to the company dated June 12 , Orloff said
We demand that you do not approve any updates for the App Store application “ Routesy ” until the application developer has licensed the NextBus real - time prediction data from us , or removes the use of NextBus data from his application .
As I have mentioned numerous times in our previous discussions , NextBus Information Systems Inc. is the sole agent for commercial use of the NextBus real - time prediction data in the United States and has exclusive rights to distribution of this data to mobile phones .
The Routesy application downloads and republishes this copyrighted data which is damaging to us .
Apple complied with Orloff ’s requests , and since the 12th , Routesy , as an app , has been dead .
In an effort to revive it , Peterson fired back , offering to make Routsey free , in hopes of negating the argument that the data was being used in a commercial fashion .
Orloff ’s response :
Our Franchisee rights cover commercial use of the data , as well as exclusive rights to distribute the NextBus data to mobile phones .
Furthermore , we do not view free applications on the App Store as a non-commercial use of the data .
The Apple Store is currently using the tagline “ Your iPhone gets better with every new app . ”
If Apple wishes to promote iPhones by releasing a free version of Routesy , we would be happy to have Apple pay the licensing fees .
( Good luck sending Apple a bill for that , NBIS . )
This move does n’t just deprive Peterson of an opportunity to tinker — it deprives all San Franciscans of access to arrival times .
Instead of letting us see when our buses are coming , NBIS locked the arrival times in an imaginary vending machine .
This would be like if advertising giant Clear Channel waltzed into the subway stations , tore down all the Muni maps , and then offered to sell them back to you at a steep markup .
“ The outpouring of support I ’ve gotten since Routesy got killed has been amazing .
All these people , sending me messages of support over what is basically a broken app .
It ’s really heartwarming to see so many people so passionate about using public transportation .
This is the wrong city to mess with . ”
So , why does NBIS seem to speak for NextBus , and does a private company indeed own Muni ’s data ?
We asked NextBus about their relationship with NBIS .
They refused to comment , “ due to legal issues . ”
So , neither a confirmation nor a denial , eh ?
Peterson did us one better , and corresponded with Owen Moore , President and co-founder of Grey Island ( the company that owns NextBus ) .
Moore told Peterson that when Grey Island acquired NextBus Information Systems in 2004 , they made an agreement that says :
A franchise right has been granted to the seller of the Nextbus business , Nextbus Information Systems Inc. , for a period of 25 years , renewable for a further 25 years .
The franchise relates to advertisement and subscription services of Nextbus and it is agreed that the Company will contribute towards the development of any product as it relates to the Franchise Agreement , contingent upon the mutual agreement between Company and Nextbus Information Systems Inc .
Such development costs are to be borne equally by the parties , to a maximum potential contribution by the Company of US $ 200,000 .
To date , no development costs related to advertisement and subscription services have been incurred
.
But were those rights Grey Island ’s to promise to NBIS ?
Muni spokesperson Judson
True says otherwise .
In fact , he says that , no , Muni owns the data in question and that the public is , of course , entitled to access it .
In fact , he went even further : Muni is n’t just giving us all permission to access the data , they ’re also committed to finding ways to make it easier to get to it .
So that means that independent developers should have unfettered access to develop whatever nifty little apps they want .
When we told Peterson about True ’s statement to us , he was silent for a moment .
Then “ Awesome .
That .
Is. Awesome . ”
In the last few days , Peterson has been hard at work on a web - based version of his app , but is now hopeful that with Muni ’s statement of support the app can return to Apple .
But , while we ’d love to say that it ’ll be smooth sailing for Steven and his app from here on out , what we ’ve seen so far from NBIS suggests that this story is far from over .
We ’ll keep you posted .

BEIRUT — The headline was dramatic .
The strongly pro-Israel German weekly Der Spiegel offered bold “ new information ” it claimed came from secret sources and documents , stemming “ inside investigative sources who were working on the Rafic Hariri assassination .
Der Spiegel ’s breakthrough ‘ exclusive ’ with ‘ new evidence ' pointing to those who were guilty .
The headline screamed
BYE - BYE , HARIRI !
UN Report Links Syrian Officials to Murder of Former Lebanese Leader
By Erich Follath et al .
Publication date ?
October 24 , 2005 , nearly four years ago .
Yes , that particular Spiegel excloo came back in 2005 .
Syria was accused in the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri of being the ‘ real ’ assassins .
An international anti-Syria campaign was promptly launched by the Bush Administration and Israel to demonize its government .
Fast forward to the tense run-up right now , before the June elections .
This weekend , a new exclusive , secret , investigative report showing the real , real assassins was published by the same weekly , Der Spiegel .
Same author .
Same editor .
New target .
This time Der Spiegel ’s Erich Follath claims that the international committee investigating the assassination of former Prime Minister martyr Rafik Hariri has reached “ surprising new secret conclusions ” , this time pointing to Hezbollah .
The new Der Spiegel head line ( May 24 , 2009 )
BREAKTHROUGH IN TRIBUNAL INVESTIGATION
New Evidence Points to Hezbollah in Hariri Murder
By Erich Follath
The German weekly claims the target is now Hezbollah after the Tribunal pressured the Lebanese government to release four Lebanese Generals last month for lack of evidenceamid a swelling outcry in the international legal and human rights community .
After the generals ’ release , more questions are being raised such as why the four Generals were never charged if there was inadequate evidence , or release years ago or given a bail bond , house arrest , or allowed to face their accusers or even see the supposed evidence against them .
The credibility of the Tribunal diminished with each day the four remained jailed .
In many respects the 2009 Der Spiegel article is similar to the 2005 piece : " There are signs that the investigation has yielded new and explosive results ” , " Spiegel has learned from sources close to the tribunal and verified by examining internal documents that the Hariri case is about to take a sensational turn ” , " Intensive investigations in Lebanon are all pointing to a new conclusion , this time that it was not the special forces of Syria , but instead special forces of Hezbollah that planned and carried out Hariri's Feb. 2005 murder . ”
As in 2005 , Der Spiegel claims the investigators “ apparently want to hold back the information that they have been aware of for about a month ” .
Der Spiegel asserts that " According to the Lebanese security forces , all of the telephone numbers involved [ by the assassins ] apparently belong to the ' operational arm ' of Hezbollah . ”
Without an apology for the hatchet job on Syrian President Bashar Assad four years ago , Der Speigel ’s the new article adds demurely that President Assad is no longer a suspect .
“ Hardly anything suggests anymore that he was personally aware of the murder plot or even ordered the killing ” , Follath writes .
Ricocheting around Lebanon ’s capitol and on the Internet are comments questioning the timing of the Spiegel report as aimed to cause maximum damage to the Hezbollah - led opposition .
Who was the supposed source of the ‘ leaks ’ and why now , since the UN investigative office has taken great pains not to leak or politicize its work .
In contrast to former investigator Detlev Mehlis , Hasan Nassrallah has never been known to order the killing of rival politicians .
The 2005 - 2006 accusations against Syria were shown to be fallacious and based on a false witness .
Der Spiegel has a rumored long history with Israeli intelligence , the “ key ” eight phones were never in the hands of Hezbollah but rather a Muslim Sunni organization in Trablus as Detlev Mehlis claimed to have documented .
One claim that I find very odd is the suggestion that a senior Hezbollah member would call his girl friend on a secure line was ‘ on duty ” .
Der Spiegel ’s girl friend telephone call story is a bit awkward and very un-Hezbollah .
I know of two cases where female students at AUB became quite angry when their Hezbollah boyfriends up and disappeared from campus and did not even call them for a whole month .
When they returned “ from duty ” to resume classes both tried to explain that they could not make contact while ‘ working ’ .
Puzzling also is the German weekly ’s claim that it learned “ from sources close to the tribunal ” and “ verified by examining internal documents , that the Hariri case is about to take a sensational turn . ”
Der Spiegel does not make it clear if it was its source or Der Spiegel ’s editors who examined these documents .
If the latter , did the source to take these documents outside the very tight security building in The Hague ?
Surely , the investigation should be able to track this so - called source .
No evidence is offered by Der Spiegel for any of its “ revelations ” such as Hezbollah members who supposedly trained in Iran , bought phones , “ two men who report only to their superior ” ( who else would they report to ? ) etc .
How does Der Spiegel know all these secret things and why not offer some proof ?
How does Der Spiegel know , for example who reports to whom in Hezbollah ?
Does some of this highly secret information come to Der Spiegel via recently apprehended Israeli spy cells — passed on from the three Israeli intelligence agencies known to be here in Lebanon or sources connected with them ?
Too volatile for Lebanon ’s Campaign ?
So far none of Lebanon ’s political parties is taking Der Spiegel ’s story as credible .
MP Walid Jumblatt , Druze leader of the Progressive Socialist Party currently allied with the pro-US March 14th majority , commenting on the Der Spiegel article , warned in a Sunday speech dedicated to announce his Chouf candidates , that the article is " the game of nations that could , God forbid , derail justice and use it for things that we do n't believe in . "
The Saad Hariri-led Future Movement refused to comment on the article .
Lebanese Foreign Minister Fawsi Salloukh labeled it as “ totally false and all lies ” , Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem challenged Der Spiegel and the author of the report to show evidence .
“ This article is politicized and reminds us of ( former international investigator ) Detlev Mehlis ’s practices , ” Moallem added .
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said the report " was nothing but a new attempt to sow sedition among the Lebanese … .
This is a media fabrication that only lacked the stamp : ' Made in Israel ' , " Berri said .
Hezbollah Media Relations
Office issued a statement on Sunday in which it dismissed allegations published by Der Spiegel and broadcast by Al - Arabiyya Channel saying that it is nothing less than “ police fabrications ” .
The statement said , “ It ’s not the first time that a magazine or newspaper aimed at publishing such fabrications and previously Kuwaiti paper Al - Siyasa has repeatedly published such reports along with other dailies . ”
The statement continued “ It is nothing more than police fabrications cooked in the same black room that has been keen on fabricating such stories for over four years regarding the Syrians and the four Lebanese officers and others . ”
The statement added that “ publishing this report by Der Spiegel and promoting for it by Al - Arabiyya is suspicious in its timing and its political and psychological exploitation especially for two reasons :
First it is a pure fabrication aimed at influencing the election campaign in Lebanon on one side , and to deflect attention from the news about the dismantling of spy networks working for Israel on other … .
The report comes just two weeks ahead of a June 7 parliamentary election in Lebanon . ”
The German Embassy in Beirut claims not to have heard about the article and would have no comment .
Radiya Ashouri , Spokeswoman for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon ( STL ) says for the record : “ We do n’t know where the Der Spiegel magazine did get their information from and we do n’t know where they brought this story from .
No one in the prosecutor ’s office has spoken to the German magazine about anything .
We have a clear policy of not leaking any information about the tribunal through media outlets , and we have been stressing this since the beginning .
When Der Spiegel spoke about Bellemar ’s spokesperson , they meant me .
They emailed me and asked a few questions .
My answer was that the tribunal does not deal with investigation files through the media and adopts the policy of direct announcement by the part of Mr. Bellemar .
If we had something to say , we would have said it directly , not through media outlets . ”

The number of midwives worldwide would have to more than double to meet Millennium Development Goals of reducing maternal and infant deaths by 2015 , according to the International Confederation of Midwives ( ICM ) and World Health Organization on International Day of the Midwife .
Maternal mortality is the “ highest health inequity in the world with more than 99 percent of deaths [ in pregnancy and childbirth ] occurring in the developing world , ” World Health Organization ( WHO ) , World Bank , UN Children ’s Fund ( UNICEF ) and UN Population Fund ( UNFPA ) said in a joint statement .
In 2008 the agencies pledged to work with governments to fill the “ urgent need for skilled health workers , particularly midwives ” , the statement says .
WHO estimates that for the annual 160 million births worldwide it would take an additional 350,000 midwives to ensure that at least 95 percent of births were attended by trained health workers , thereby helping meet MDGs .
ICM estimates that there are 250,000 licensed midwives worldwide , with 13,000 in sub-Saharan Africa .
The region had more than half of the world ’s maternal deaths during pregnancy and childbirth in 2005 , according to WHO ’s latest compiled statistics .
Monir Islam , director of WHO ’s Making Pregnancies Safer Programme , said governments ’ failure to focus on midwifery has been deadly .
“ Starting in 1987 in an effort to make motherhood safer , countries invested in traditional birthing attendants , which has not reduced maternal and infant mortality . ”
He said : “ Traditional birthing attendants have their role in ensuring safe motherhood .
They have community standing and can promote nutrition , can prepare a woman for childbirth , but at the moment of birthing [ they ] should bring the woman to a trained health worker . ”
He said countries that invested in midwifery and emergency obstetric care , including Thailand and Malaysia , have been able to cut their maternal and infant deaths .
But he noted that midwifery training is still not enough to ensure safe childbirths .
“ It is also about employment , deployment , retention and giving midwives supplies .
What good is a midwife who comes to the clinic every day with no supplies ?
No gloves ?
Or those used to do tasks that auxiliary nurses could do ? ”
A health worker is considered a midwife only after completing a certified midwifery education programme to provide care during pregnancy , labour and the postpartum period , according to ICM .
WHO ’s Islam told IRIN that while Malawi has adequate training facilities , the majority of midwives are concentrated in cities while rural areas lack trained health workers .
He added that Botswana , Namibia , South Africa and Swaziland have good midwife coverage , whereas Francophone Africa countries are lagging .
WHO is working with governments to develop midwifery curriculums .
“ This will not happen overnight , ” said Islam .
“ But we need to take action . ”

I think we can all agree that the man who shot Dr. George Tiller is a domestic terrorist .
I know what Republicans think we should do with accused terrorists -- waterboard them .
So , let 's get it on .
Initial reports are that the suspect is an anti-abortion activist named Scott Roeder .
Good enough .
Let 's torture the son of a bitch .
Remember the people in Guantanamo
Bay were just detainees , they were not convicted of anything before we started the " enhanced interrogation " techniques .
Most of them did n't even have the verifiable criminal and terroristic history of Roeder who was previously arrested with bomb making material and has called murder of doctors " justifiable homicide " before .
So , if you can't waterboard Roeder , then who can you waterboard ?
He is the perfect candidate .
Also , in this case , there might literally be a ticking time bomb .
He 's been arrested for having bomb making material before !
And he 's a god - damned terrorist who just killed someone .
What more do we need ?
We can't afford to wait while there might be another ticking time bomb out there .
We should start with waterboarding him and work our way up to even more enhanced interrogation .
Now , some squeamish liberals who are soft on terrorism might disagree , but I 'm sure all of my conservative friends agree , right ?
Sean Hannity ?
Rush Limbaugh ?
Bill O'Reilly ?
You 're all on board for torturing this terrorist detainee , right ?
I 'm sure they 'll be on TV talking about it .
I 'm sure of it .
Because I know they do n't think waterboarding and torture is just what we do to Muslim detainees .
I know they 're men of their word and would torture anyone suspected of terrorism , no matter what their race or political affiliation is .
Right ?

ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - Pakistan ’s President Asif Ali Zardari said on Monday that the whereabouts of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden remained a mystery and there was a suspicion that he could be dead .
Speaking to international media , Zardari said U.S. officials had told him that they had no trace of the al Qaeda chief , although they habitually say he is most likely in Pakistan .
Pakistan ’s own intelligence agencies were no wiser , either , Zardari said .
“ There is no news , ” the president said .
“ They obviously feel that he does not exist anymore but that ’s not confirmed , we ca n’t confirm that . ”
Al Jazeera aired excerpts of an audio recording in March in which the speaker ’s voice sounded like earlier messages from bin Laden , who has eluded all efforts to catch him since al Qaeda carried out the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States .
Bin Laden , if he is still alive , turned 52 on March 10 , but he is known to suffer from ill - health .
There have been reports that he had died of natural causes in the past , but they have never been corroborated , and security analysts believe intelligence agencies monitoring jihadi websites on the Internet would have picked up some chatter .

The astros return home from a 9 - game road trip today having gone 5 - and - 4 against some quality teams .
While it was n’t a huge success , Houston appears to be performing better this year in inter league play than they have in the past few years .
I was especially happy going 2 - and - 1 against the Twins who I feel are a really solid and will take the battle for first place to the end of the season in the AL Central .
However , even though the Astros have six games at home against two more teams from the AL Central , do n’t expect it to be a cake walk .
First , they face Zach Grienke and the Royals .
Alot of people have been surprised by the Royals , but they have n’t shocked me .
I saw them coming along the last few years .
They have made some good trades and built up their minor leagues .
I picked up Grienke last year off of waivers on my fantasy team and I was n’t pleasantly pleased with how good he was .
His stuff is Filthy with a capital F .
Their offense has dropped off the past month and that has been the main reason for their decline .
The team is only hitting .252 with a .404 slugging and that is even lower on the road .
The stats say that this should be easy for the Astros , but my gut tells me that they are going to struggle especially since the majority of them have n’t faced Grienke before .
Tonight ’s game is going to be ugly .
After that , they have to face the Detroit Tigers who have quietly snuck into first place .
( Maybe not quietly for Tigers fans , but very quietly for those of us in Texas . )
They have the second best record in the AL ( 38 - 31 tied with the Yankees and two losses better than the Blue Jays ) and really only have one bust on their starters in Dontrelle Willis and I do think it was worth taking a chance on .
With Dontrelle ’s complex delivery , he needed to be brought up a little slower early on and the Marlins did not do that .
His arm is shot and his current stint on the DL appears to be a common appearance for the future .
Galarraga has n’t had a great season either , but the other three pitchers ( Verlander , Jackson and Porcello ) have been really good even with a shaky start to the season for Verlander .
Flip over to the offense and it does n’t look like they have a real solid team ( .262 average with a .420 slugging ) , but it is good enough to support their starting pitchers and make close games into wins .
Plus , they have a good coach in Jim Leyland .
I do n’t like the guy , but he has a good baseball mind and he has proven that you can rebuild a team that was a laughing stock five years ago .
Maybe the Lions should look into hiring him .
Prediction ?
I would expect the Astros to go 2 - and - 4 on this homestand and I would be happy if they break even .
I do not expect them to be on the positive side .
Draft Update
Ed Wade , Billy Heck and their scouting staff have been busy signing the Astros 2009 draft picks and they seem to be having good success .
The highest signing so far was their second pick , Tanner Bushue , an RHP out of South Central HS in Illinois who had a chance to visit Minute Maid before the draft and has links to his visit and draft day party on his high school team ’s web page .
Everything I have heard on this kid is that he is a good guy , smart as a whip and has some incredible movement on his pitches .
The first pick , Jiovanni Mier , is still in negotiations with Houston , but they have also signed their third and fourth picks in Telvin Nash and Jonathan Meyer .
Gone are the days when Houston could n’t get these guys ’ signatures on the dotted line .
Of course , I think that is a big reason they are going after high schoolers now , but the more I am reading about the top four players , the more I am hearing that they are bona fide talents and worth taking a chance on .
To date , Houston has signed 25 players .
Keep track of the signings on the 2009 Draft page .
The savviness of the Obama team at using the Internet and new media technology is widely credited with helping the once Senator from Illinois beat John McCain in the 2008 presidential election .
Now , the Republicans are belatedly trying to get in the game , and have issued an Request for Proposal ( RFP ) to rebuild the Republican 's online presence at sites like gop.com .
But already , the Republican RFP is getting savaged -- from right - wingers , who mock the proposal as ' crap ' or an ' elaborate joke . '
tech President collates some of the criticism .
Looks like Republicans still have a way to go .
Red State 's Erick Erickson is a bit circumspect , but see if you can suss out his take on the RFP by reading through the lines : " [ T ] here is no way any competent person would put together an RFP like this .
It 's crap .
It is not legitimate .
It is unprofessional .
It is illusory . "
The RFP is all buzz words -- " Flash , " " widgets " -- but little in the way of specifics .
No matter : the RNC wants all bidder to attach a firm price tag to their proposals .
How much is " some place the box has n't even reached " going for these days ?
On the Next Right , Dale Franks is holding on to some glimmer of hope : " Surely this is all some sort of elaborate joke .
Perhaps on Monday the RNC will tell us that they were just having us on .
Then , once we 've all had a good laugh , they 'll release the real RFP . "

Understanding the Effect
As with any complicated effect , I always start by looking at the DOM in Firebug and interact with the effect , watching for what changes take effect in the DOM .
What I noticed was the ( rendered ) DOM structure for the list of images was different to the delivered DOM ( i.e. the original markup sent ) .
This means that there ’s some significant initialisation code running .
This is n’t unexpected for an Apple effect , but there were big clues in to how to create this effect in the difference .
Most importantly the list of images ( in a < ul > element ) had additional < li > elements at the start of the list and at the end of the list .
There were two types : clone and empty .
The second big clue was the number of cloned elements on the end of the list : it matched the number of visible items in the carousel .
In the diagram below I ’ve tried to outline what ’s cloned in the list , and show what ’s visible .
You can see how the list shows 3 items at once , but there ’s 5 items in total .
So the first cloned section ( at the start of the list ) contains two clones and a single empty clone .
The end of the list has 3 clones – which represents real items 1 - 3 :
The Trick
Aside from building the DOM with the cloned nodes , the real trick is in the final panel of list items appearing .
Because we ’ve cloned the start of the list to the end of the list , when we scroll off the last items , it looks like we ’ve looped back round .
Once the animation completes , we change the scrollLeft position back to the real first items .
This scrollLeft is n’t visible to the user since the overflow is hidden , and so it creates the effect of being infinitely sliding from left or right ( since it also works the other way around ) .
Markup
Remembering that we want the effect to work without JavaScript turned on , we ’re going to use a pattern that we use fairly often for effects that scroll : overflows .
The default will be the overflow is visible , and we ’ll use JavaScript to change the element to overflow : hidden .
< div class= " infiniteCarousel " > < div class = " wrapper " > < ul > < li >...</ li> < li >...</ li> < li >...</li> </ul > </div > </div >
The CSS has been marked up in a way that the overflow is visible to start off with , and that the individual < li > elements are the same fixed width .
This is necessary to ensure that we always show complete images in the visible part of the carousel .
jQuery
Replicating the Effect
This is a reasonably advanced effect so we need to plan carefully what we ’re trying to achieve :
Markup that works without JavaScript ( done ! )
Initialisation & capture the height and width of the first carousel item ( required for calculations )
Create empty list items to pad to fill every page Generate cloned items on the start and end of the list Adjust the scroll left position to show the real first item Create goto method that supports forward and backwards Generate the next / prev links & bind goto calls
The completed example is also available if you want to skip through each step .
Initialisation
We ’re going to write the code as a plugin so we can release it out to the wild at some later point .
So this follows the typical plugin pattern :
( function ( $ ) { $.fn. myPlugin = function ( ) { return this .each ( function () { // plugin code } ; } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
This step is used to initialise the plugin and capture all the variables we need to create this effect .
This includes :
j Query instance of the overflow element Hiding the overflow jQuery instance of the list jQuery instance of the list items
The first item and it ’s width Number of visible items we can fit in the carousel ( rounded up via Math.ceil )
Current page ( defaults to 1 ) and the number of pages ( rounded up )
var $ wrapper = $ ( '> div ' , this ) .css (' overflow ' , ' hidden ' ) , $ slider = $ wrapper.find ( '> ul ' ) , $items = $ slider.find ( '> li ' ) , $ single = $ items.filter ( ' : first ' ) , // outerWidth : width + padding ( does n't include margin ) singleWidth = $ single.outerWidth ( ) , // note : does n't include padding or border visible = Math.ceil ( $wrapper.innerWidth( ) / singleWidth ) , currentPage = 1 , pages = Math.ceil ( $items.length / visible ) ;
Padding with Empty Items
During the screencast I said that we ’re making use of the repeat function from another tutorial – however that was wrong !
I must have used it for something else !
None the less , here is the repeat function , which we put outside of the plugin since it ’s a utility function :
function repeat ( str , n ) { return new Array ( n + 1 ) . join ( str ) ; }
The repeat function simple uses and array hack to repeat any string n times .
When we create the empty padding , we need to use modulus to work out how many new empty items we need to fill every page of our carousel with an item :
if ( ( $items.length % visible ) !=
0 ) { $ slider.append ( repeat ( '< li class = " empty " />' , visible - ( $items.length % visible ) ) ) ; $items = $ slider.find ( '> li ' ) ; }
Notice that we reinitialise the $ items variable .
This is to ensure it contains all of the items , including our newly created empty items .
Generating Clones
As per the diagram in the introduction , we need to clone the last page of items to the start of the list , and the first page of items to the end of the list .
These will be the items that we slide on to before we flip the scrollLeft position ( as per the trick above ) .
$items.filter ( ': first ' ) .before( $items.slice(-visible).clone( ).addClass ( ' cloned ' ) ) ; $ items.filter (': last ') .after ( $items.slice( 0 , visible ) .clone ( ) .addClass ( ' cloned ' ) ) ; $items = $ slider.find ( '> li ' ) ; // reselect
We ’re making using the slice method that jQuery has .
Notice that we first use it with a negative number :
$ items.slice ( - visible )
This means to take the last n items off the end of $items .
Otherwise we have to pass the start and end point , so the second instance we ’re saying from the start , 0 , and the third as the method is zero - based indices .
Reset Scroll Left
Since we ’ve created the clones at the start of the list , we need to shift the scroll left back to the real element , otherwise it would look like the carousel is sitting on the last page .
$ wrapper.scrollLeft(singleWidth * visible ) ;
Go To Method
The gotoPage method will handle going forward and backwards and handle jumping several pages at a time .
We ’re going to use the animate method and only animate the scrollLeft so that it smoothly scrolls .
We could add custom easin if we wanted at a later date .
We need to establish the following :
Direction we ’re going to slide Number of pages to slide
The relative scroll left value
Once the animation has completed , we also need to maintain the currentPage variable we created on initialisation .
If the page number is greater than the number of pages ( i.e. we ’re on our cloned first page ) , then reset the scroll left to the real first page , and set the page number to 1 .
Equally if we have hit the beginning of the list ( i.e. we ’re showing the cloned last page ) , then we reset the scroll left to the real last page , and set the page number to the total number of pages .
function gotoPage ( page ) { var dir = page < currentPage ?
- 1 : 1 , n = Math.abs( currentPage - page ) , left = singleWidth * dir * visible * n ; $ wrapper.filter ( ': not ( : animated ) ' ) .animate ( { scrollLeft : '+=' + left } , 500 , function ( ) { if ( page == 0 ) { $ wrapper.scrollLeft(singleWidth * visible * pages ) ; page = pages ; } else if ( page > pages ) { $ wrapper.scrollLeft(singleWidth * visible ) ; page = 1 ; } currentPage = page ; } ) ; return false ; }
Navigation buttons
Finally we need to add the buttons or links to page through the carousel and bind the gotoPage call .
We ’re also going to create a custom goto event that allows us to also jump to any page :
$ wrapper.after ( ' < a class = " arrow back " ><</a>< a class= " arrow forward " >></a>' ) ; $ ( 'a.back ' , this ).click ( function ( ) { return gotoPage( currentPage - 1 ) ; } ) ; $ ( 'a.forward ' , this ).click ( function ( ) { return gotoPage ( currentPage + 1 ) ; } ) ; // this currently refers to the element the plugin was bound to $ ( this ) .
bind ( ' goto ' , function ( event , page ) { gotoPage ( page ) ; } ) ;
Demo
That ’s it .
It ’s a fairly complicated plugin as J4D demos go .
There is also the jCarousel plugin that you could use ( though I ’m not sure if it has infinite scrolling ) – but obviously the idea here is to show you how it all comes together .

Applying innovative measurement techniques , researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology and the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) have directly measured the unusual energy spectrum of graphene , a technologically promising , two - dimensional form of carbon that has tantalized and puzzled scientists since its discovery in 2004 .
Published in the journal Science , their work adds new detail to help explain the unusual physical phenomena and properties associated with graphene , a single layer of carbon atoms arrayed in a repeating , honeycomb - like arrangement .
Graphene 's exotic behaviors present intriguing prospects for future technologies , including high - speed , graphene - based electronics that might replace today 's silicon - based integrated circuits and other devices .
Even at room temperature , electrons in graphene are more than 100 times more mobile than in silicon .
Graphene apparently owes this enhanced mobility to the curious fact that its electrons and other carriers of electric charges behave as though they do not have mass .
In conventional materials , the speed of electrons is related to their energy , but not in graphene .
Although they do not approach the speed of light , the unbound electrons in graphene behave much like photons , massless particles of light that also move at a speed independent of their energy .
This weird massless behavior is associated with other strangeness .
When ordinary conductors are put in a strong magnetic field , charge carriers such as electrons begin moving in circular orbits that are constrained to discrete , equally spaced energy levels .
In graphene these levels are known to be unevenly spaced because of the " massless " electrons .
The Georgia Tech / NIST team tracked these massless electrons in action , using a specialized NIST instrument to zoom in on the graphene layer at a billion times magnification , tracking the electronic states while at the same time applying high magnetic fields .
The custom - built , ultra - low - temperature and ultra- high - vacuum scanning tunneling microscope allowed them to sweep an adjustable magnetic field across graphene samples prepared at Georgia Tech , observing and mapping the peculiar non-uniform spacing among discrete energy levels that form when the material is exposed to magnetic fields .
The team developed a high - resolution map of the distribution of energy levels in graphene .
In contrast to metals and other conducting materials , where the distance from one energy peak to the next is uniformly equal , this spacing is uneven in graphene .
The researchers also probed and spatially mapped graphene 's hallmark " zero energy state , " a curious phenomenon where the material has no electrical carriers until a magnetic field is applied .
The measurements also indicated that layers of graphene grown and then heated on a substrate of silicon - carbide behave as individual , isolated , two - dimensional sheets .
On the basis of the results , the researchers suggest that graphene layers are uncoupled from adjacent layers because they stack in different rotational orientations .
This finding may point the way to manufacturing methods for making large , uniform batches of graphene for a new carbon - based electronics .
Several lawmakers and politicians in Iran have written to the country 's Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and called for the powers of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to be curbed .
Website Fardanews also reports that the letter suggests several ways in which the president 's powers could be curtailed .
As Supreme Leader , Khamenei has the ultimate legislative power in Iran .
Although he endorsed Ahmadinejad 's presidential candidacy in 2009 , the two men clashed in April 2011 when Khamenei reinstated a minister whom Ahmadinejad had forced to resign .
Some commentators claim that Khamenei has tacitly encouraged Ahmadinejad 's political opponents , and even considered a plan to replace the presidential office with an honorary post elected by members of parliament rather than the Iranian populace .
' Government of all the talents '
The letter comes just days after it emerged that Manouchehr Mottaki , the former foreign minister , Mostafa Pour - Mohammadi , a former interior minister , and Davoud Danesh - Jafari , the ex-finance minister , have written their own letter to the Supreme Leader .
Describing Iran 's situation is " sensitive and critical " , the missive urges Khamenei to set up a " government of all the talents " that would effectively curb the president 's power .
The new cabinet would be comprised of a group of chosen " wise men " made up of high - profile members of the executive , legislative and judicial branches , and would effectively govern the country until the next presidential elections , scheduled for June 2013 .
The scenario would see Ahmadinejad head the executive branch of the body , but his power would be diluted by other highly influential members of the cabinet .
News of the letter was disclosed by the pro-government daily paper , Iran .
A day after the report was published , Mottaki said the article was full of mistakes .
However Jafari and Pour - Mohammadi have yet to comment .
Ahmadinejad has received concerterd the country 's conservative factions for his handling of the country 's economy and inflation .
$ 3.99 for Choco Bites .
$ 5.69 for Tetley tea bags .
$ 1.59 for a can of pop and $ 1.39 for a muffin .
These small purchases , charged by a consultant from Alberta who earns $ 2,700 a day , are among the items at the heart of a spending scandal involving eHealth Ontario , the agency which is to implement electronic health records by 2015 .
High consultants ' bills are not unheard of in the private sector nor are six - figure bonuses such as the $ 114,000 received by eHealth CEO Sarah Kramer in March .
But when taxpayers are footing the bill , at a time of extreme job loss in Ontario , and when a public agency hands out nearly $ 5 million in untendered contracts , a political furor erupts .
Interim Progressive Conservative Leader Bob Runciman charged yesterday that the " buck stops " with Health Minister David Caplan and called for Kramer 's firing .
Kramer , hired on Nov. 3 , 2008 , earns $ 380,000 .
She is entitled to 15 months ' compensation if dismissed without cause , according to her contract obtained through freedom of information by the Progressive Conservatives .
Caplan , who defends eHealth 's progress since its inception in September 2008 , announced Monday that PricewaterhouseCoopers will review the agency .
The consulting firm conducted a review for eHealth earlier this year and found internal controls were " adequate . ''
Caplan has asked provincial Auditor General Jim McCarter to expedite his review of eHealth .
The Liberals ' actions are not good enough , said New Democrat MPP France Gélinas ( Nickel Belt ) .
All the facts are on the table , she said , yet McGuinty " prefers to launch another costly consultant review that is really more of a public relations exercise than anything else . "
Consultant Donna Strating makes $ 2,700 a day at eHealth .
She does not take the $ 50 per diem to which she is entitled , but charges for miscellaneous meals and snacks .
Fellow consultant Allaudin Merali , senior vice - president of corporate services at eHealth , pulls in $ 2,750 a day and collects $ 75 a day for expenses .
He has flown home to Edmonton 31 times over five months at a cost of nearly $ 21,000 .
" You wo n't find any cans of pop or Choco Bites in his expenses , they'd be covered in his per diem , " said eHealth senior vice - president Diane Allen .
Merali , who leaves eHealth this summer , discounted his May invoice by $ 1,000 to " ensure anything that he is not entitled to has been covered off , " said Allen .
Merali and Strating have declined to speak to the Star .
Allen said they are " working around the clock . ''

The freedom - of - information documents show yet another consultant , Chris Dingman , made $ 225 an hour , according to a statement of account for November 2008 .
Dingman billed for 48 hours for a total cost of $ 10,800 .
According to her time sheet , she billed two hours for " emails and scheduling . "
A rising number of women , stung by job losses and dropped insurance coverage , are turning to clinics and family planning agencies for routine gynecological exams , contraceptives and abortions .
As the economy worsens , some Planned Parenthood clinics are reporting a record number of abortions .
Other women ’s health agencies say they are experiencing heavier call volumes , more visits and more requests for abortion funding .
In addition , many women are postponing pregnancy and switching to longer - term contraceptives that can last up to five or 10 years , clinic officials report .
“ We are seeing poor women get poorer and we ’re also seeing low - wage women become poor , ” said Stephanie Poggi , executive director of the National Network of Abortion Funds .
“ The economy is definitely having an impact . . . .
We see a greater demand for assistance . ”
Quantifying the increase is difficult since the most recent statistics are several years old .
In California , the most recent data on abortions funded through Medi-Cal , which provides healthcare for the poor , is from 2005 , when the state paid for an estimated 94,600 abortions for poor women .

But those who field phone calls for assistance say many pregnant women tell them they are taking a hard look at the costs of raising a child .
At the Oakland - based ACCESS , which helps poor women who are seeking reproductive healthcare , about 72 % of calls are from women considering abortions , up from 60 % last year .
“ We are seeing women who have children , who in another economy would probably have their second or third child , but now ca n’t because they feel so insecure about maintaining their job or losing a job , ” said Destiny Lopez , the organization ’s executive director .
Lopez said most women recently getting abortions already have families , contrary to the stereotype of the childless abortion seeker .

“ Women are really having to make thoughtful decisions whether now is the right time to get pregnant or not , ” she said .
In Los Angeles County , Planned Parenthood has 15 % more patient cases than this time a year ago .
Mary - Jane Wagle , president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Los Angeles , said more women coming into their 15 clinics are seeking longer - term contraceptives .
In the first three months of 2009 , requests for intra-uterine devices -- which prevent pregnancies for five to 10 years -- were up 83 % over the same period in 2008 .
A recent Gallup Organization survey conducted for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reported that nearly one in 10 married woman indicated that the economy was a factor in their decision to postpone a planned pregnancy .
That same survey found that one in five women is more concerned about having an unintended pregnancy than a year ago and about one in five women is more conscientious about using birth control .
For women already struggling to make ends meet , paying for an abortion can be difficult , clinic officials said .
As they scramble for money -- and week after week passes -- the cost of an abortion increases from about $ 450 for a first - trimester abortion to $ 1,200 in the second trimester .
Advertisement
In some cases , delays in obtaining funding have forced even more difficult choices .
Lopez , whose Oakland - based group helps women in Northern and Central California , said some women who had decided to terminate early in their pregnancies instead have found themselves choosing between more difficult second - trimester abortions or continuing an unwanted pregnancy .
She said one woman from Kern County first called ACCESS when she was 11 weeks pregnant .
The woman said her insurance would n’t cover an abortion and she had tried for weeks to enroll in Medi-Cal , the state ’s healthcare system for the poor .
“ She waited five weeks for the Medi-Cal . . . .
By that point , she felt it was too late to personally go through with it , ” Lopez said .
“ This is a really good example of the barriers that are put in front of women who are trying to make responsible decisions early on . ”
Lopez said ACCESS helped the woman file a complaint about the delay .
Advertisement
“ It ’s not like women are making these decisions at the drop of a hat , ” Lopez said .
“ They are considering their life situations . ”
Although many counties say they are seeing an increase in the number of applicants and processing time , officials in both Kern County and Los Angeles County said pregnant women take precedence over other cases .
The demand for reproductive healthcare -- in particular Medi-Cal - funded abortions -- has pushed some clinics over the edge .
In Oakland , one of the country ’s oldest feminist health clinics -- Women ’s Choice Clinic -- closed its doors last month because it could n’t cover its bills , the result , its director said , of a growing Medi-Cal patient load , underfunded claims and a decrease in charitable contributions .
Advertisement
“ We ’re just a small little clinic , ” said Linci Comi , the clinic ’s director .
“ We ca n’t hold up the state .
We ’re always short of cash .
Medi-Cal is always slow pay , low pay , no pay .
We just got in the squeeze .
You reach a point where you ca n’t keep doing it . ”

While Somalia recently has been in the news for its notorious pirates , back on - shore the country continues to struggle through a years - long war that has intensified lately , and to seek some sort of functional unifying government .
Back in January , the Transitional Federal Parliament of Somalia elected moderate Islamist Sharif Sheikh Ahmed as President .
Ahmed has gained international backing in his efforts to bring an end to 18 years of civil conflict .
However , hard - line Islamist groups such as al Shabaab , Hezb al - Islamiya and others continue to reject the government and have been attacking its forces and civilians for years now , most of the fighting taking place in the capital city of Mogadishu .
The African Union Mission in Somalia ( AMISOM ) provides over 3,000 troops to maintain security where it can .
Since the start of this insurgency in December 2006 , nearly 17,000 civilians have lost their lives .

Previous studies found small cash incentives prompted few people to quit Bribing smokers with cash incentives helps them stop , US research suggests .
Smokers are three times more likely to kick the habit for at least six months when they are paid up to $ 750 ( £ 520 ) , a new study has found .
Nearly 900 General Electric workers took part in the test across 85 US sites .
The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine .
GE will launch a similar scheme in 2010 for all US employees , believing it will be cost - effective in the long term .
It aims to save some of the estimated $ 50 m spent annually on extra costs for smoking employees .
The company believes it will get back what it spends over three to five years , through reduced illness and increased productivity .
Financial incentives Previous studies had indicated that smaller financial incentives had little effect on quitting smoking , said Kevin Volpp of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , who led the research project .
If you 're able to get people smoke - free and keep them smoke - free for six months or more , there 's a fighting chance they can stay smoke - free on their own
Kevin Volpp
University of Pennsylvania " Incentive programs work if they 're well designed and adequately funded , " Mr Volpp told Reuters news agency .
" If you do a low - budget incentive program , it may have little effect . "
" Our study shows that if you 're able to get people smoke - free and keep them smoke - free for six months or more , there 's a fighting chance they can stay smoke - free on their own , " he said .
In the GE study , half the participants were given the financial incentive , while the rest were merely encouraged to join quit - smoking programmes .

TIME TO GET OUT THE WHEELBARROWS ?
ANOTHER LOOK AT THE WEIMAR HYPERINFLATION
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
" It was horrible .
Horrible !
Like lightning it struck .
No one was prepared .
The shelves in the grocery stores were empty .
You could buy nothing with your paper money .
– Harvard University law professor Friedrich Kessler on on the Weimar Republic hyperinflation ( 1993 interview )
Some worried commentators are predicting a massive hyperinflation of the sort suffered by Weimar Germany in 1923 , when a wheelbarrow full of paper money could barely buy a loaf of bread .
An April 29 editorial in the San Francisco Examiner warned :
" With an unprecedented deficit that 's approaching $ 2 trillion , [ the President 's 2010 ] budget proposal is a surefire prescription for hyperinflation .
So every senator and representative who votes for this monster $ 3.6 trillion budget will be endorsing a spending spree that could very well turn America into the next Weimar Republic . "

In an investment newsletter called Money Morning on April 9 , Martin Hutchinson pointed to disturbing parallels between current government monetary policy and Weimar Germany 's , when 50 % of government spending was being funded by seigniorage – merely printing money .

However , there is something puzzling in his data .
He indicates that the British government is already funding more of its budget by seigniorage than Weimar Germany did at the height of its massive hyperinflation ; yet the pound is still holding its own , under circumstances said to have caused the complete destruction of the German mark .
Something else must have been responsible for the mark 's collapse besides mere money - printing to meet the government 's budget , but what ?
And are we threatened by the same risk today ?
Let 's take a closer look at the data .
HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF -- OR DOES IT ?
In his well - researched article , Hutchinson notes that Weimar Germany had been suffering from inflation ever since World War I ; but it was in the two year period between 1921 and 1923 that the true " Weimar hyperinflation " occurred .
By the time it had ended in November 1923 , the mark was worth only one - trillionth of what it had been worth back in 1914 .
Hutchinson goes on :
" The current policy mix reflects those of Germany during the period between 1919 and 1923 .
The Weimar government was unwilling to raise taxes to fund post - war reconstruction and war - reparations payments , and so it ran large budget deficits .
It kept interest rates far below inflation , expanding money supply rapidly and raising 50 % of government spending through seigniorage ( printing money and living off the profits from issuing it ) .
. . .
" The really chilling parallel is that the United States , Britain and Japan have now taken to funding their budget deficits through seigniorage .
In the United States , the Fed is buying $ 300 billion worth of U.S. Treasury bonds ( T - bonds ) over a six - month period , a rate of $ 600 billion per annum , 15 % of federal spending of $ 4 trillion .
In Britain , the Bank of England ( BOE ) is buying 75 billion pounds of gilts [ the British equivalent of U.S. Treasury bonds ] over three months .
That 's 300 billion pounds per annum , 65 % of British government spending of 454 billion pounds .
Thus , while the United States is approaching Weimar German policy ( 50 % of spending ) quite rapidly , Britain has already overtaken it ! "
And that is where the data gets confusing .
If Britain is already meeting a larger percentage of its budget deficit by seigniorage than Germany did at the height of its hyperinflation , why is the pound now worth about as much on foreign exchange markets as it was nine years ago , under circumstances said to have driven the mark to a trillionth of its former value in the same period , and most of this in only two years ?
Meanwhile , the U.S. dollar has actually gotten stronger relative to other currencies since the policy was begun last year of massive " quantitative easing " ( today 's euphemism for seigniorage ) .
3
Central banks rather than governments are now doing the printing , but the effect on the money supply should be the same as in the government money - printing schemes of old .
The government debt bought by the central banks is never actually paid off but is just rolled over from year to year ; and once the new money is in the money supply , it stays there , diluting the value of the currency .
So why have n't our currencies already collapsed to a trillionth of their former value , as happened in Weimar Germany ?
Indeed , if it were a simple question of supply and demand , a government would have to print a trillion times its earlier money supply to drop its currency by a factor of a trillion ; and even the German government is n't charged with having done that .
Something else must have been going on in the Weimar Republic , but what ?
SCHACHT LETS THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG
Light is thrown on this mystery by the later writings of Hjalmar Schacht , the currency commissioner for the Weimar Republic .
The facts are explored at length in The Lost Science of Money by Stephen Zarlenga , who writes that in Schacht 's 1967 book The Magic of Money , he " let the cat out of the bag , writing in German , with some truly remarkable admissions that shatter the ' accepted wisdom ' the financial community has promulgated on the German hyperinflation . "
What actually drove the wartime inflation into hyperinflation , said Schacht , was speculation by foreign investors , who would bet on the mark 's decreasing value by selling it short .
Short selling is a technique used by investors to try to profit from an asset 's falling price .
It involves borrowing the asset and selling it , with the understanding that the asset must later be bought back and returned to the original owner .
The speculator is gambling that the price will have dropped in the meantime and he can pocket the difference .
Short selling of the German mark was made possible because private banks made massive amounts of currency available for borrowing , marks that were created on demand and lent to investors , returning a profitable interest to the banks .
At first , the speculation was fed by the Reichsbank ( the German central bank ) , which had recently been privatized .
But when the Reichsbank could no longer keep up with the voracious demand for marks , other private banks were allowed to create them out of nothing and lend them at interest as well .
4
A STORY WITH AN IRONIC TWIST
If Schacht is to be believed , not only did the government not cause the hyperinflation but it was the government that got the situation under control .
The Reichsbank was put under strict regulation , and prompt corrective measures were taken to eliminate foreign speculation by eliminating easy access to loans of bank - created money .
More interesting is a little - known sequel to this tale .
What allowed Germany to get back on its feet in the 1930s was the very thing today 's commentators are blaming for bringing it down in the 1920s – money issued by seigniorage by the government .
Economist Henry C. K.
Liu calls this form of financing " sovereign credit . "
He writes of Germany 's remarkable transformation :
" The Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933 , at a time when its economy was in total collapse , with ruinous war - reparation obligations and zero prospects for foreign investment or credit .
Yet through an independent monetary policy of sovereign credit and a full - employment public - works program , the Third Reich was able to turn a bankrupt Germany , stripped of overseas colonies it could exploit , into the strongest economy in Europe within four years , even before armament spending began . "
5
While Hitler clearly deserves the opprobrium heaped on him for his later atrocities , he was enormously popular with his own people , at least for a time .
This was evidently because he rescued Germany from the throes of a worldwide depression – and he did it through a plan of public works paid for with currency generated by the government itself .
Projects were first earmarked for funding , including flood control , repair of public buildings and private residences , and construction of new buildings , roads , bridges , canals , and port facilities .
The projected cost of the various programs was fixed at one billion units of the national currency .
One billion non-inflationary bills of exchange called Labor Treasury Certificates were then issued against this cost .
Millions of people were put to work on these projects , and the workers were paid with the Treasury Certificates .
The workers then spent the certificates on goods and services , creating more jobs for more people .
These certificates were not actually debt - free but were issued as bonds , and the government paid interest on them to the bearers .
But the certificates circulated as money and were renewable indefinitely , making them a de facto currency ; and they avoided the need to borrow from international lenders or to pay off international debts .
6
The Treasury Certificates did not trade on foreign currency markets , so they were beyond the reach of the currency speculators .
They could not be sold short because there was no one to sell them to , so they retained their value .
Within two years , Germany 's unemployment problem had been solved and the country was back on its feet .
It had a solid , stable currency , and no inflation , at a time when millions of people in the United States and other Western countries were still out of work and living on welfare .
Germany even managed to restore foreign trade , although it was denied foreign credit and was faced with an economic boycott abroad .
It did this by using a barter system : equipment and commodities were exchanged directly with other countries , circumventing the international banks .
This system of direct exchange occurred without debt and without trade deficits .
Although Germany 's economic experiment was short - lived , it left some lasting monuments to its success , including the famous Autobahn , the world 's first extensive superhighway .
7
THE LESSONS OF HISTORY : NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEE M
Germany 's scheme for escaping its crippling debt and reinvigorating a moribund economy was clever , but it was not actually original with the Germans .
The notion that a government could fund itself by printing and delivering paper receipts for goods and services received was first devised by the American colonists .
Benjamin Franklin credited the remarkable growth and abundance in the colonies , at a time when English workers were suffering the impoverished conditions of the Industrial Revolution , to the colonists ' unique system of government - issued money .
In the nineteenth century , Senator Henry Clay called this the " American system , " distinguishing it from the " British system " of privately - issued paper banknotes .
After the American Revolution , the American system was replaced in the U.S. with banker - created money ; but government - issued money was revived during the Civil War , when Abraham Lincoln funded his government with U.S. Notes or " Greenbacks " issued by the Treasury .
The dramatic difference in the results of Germany 's two money - printing experiments was a direct result of the uses to which the money was put .
Price inflation results when " demand " ( money ) increases more than " supply " ( goods and services ) , driving prices up ; and in the experiment of the 1930s , new money was created for the purpose of funding productivity , so supply and demand increased together and prices remained stable .
Hitler said , " For every mark issued , we required the equivalent of a mark 's worth of work done , or goods produced . "
In the hyperinflationary disaster of 1923 , on the other hand , money was printed merely to pay off speculators , causing demand to shoot up while supply remained fixed .
The result was not just inflation but hyperinflation , since the speculation went wild , triggering rampant tulip - bubble - style mania and panic .
This was also true in Zimbabwe , a dramatic contemporary example of runaway inflation .
The crisis dated back to 2001 , when Zimbabwe defaulted on its loans and the IMF refused to make the usual accommodations , including refinancing and loan forgiveness .
Apparently , the IMF 's intention was to punish the country for political policies of which it disapproved , including land reform measures that involved reclaiming the lands of wealthy landowners .
Zimbabwe 's credit was ruined and it could not get loans elsewhere , so the government resorted to issuing its own national currency and using the money to buy U.S. dollars on the foreign - exchange market .
These dollars were then used to pay the IMF and regain the country 's credit rating .
8
According to a statement by the Zimbabwe central bank , the hyperinflation was caused by speculators who manipulated the foreign - exchange market , charging exorbitant rates for U.S. dollars , causing a drastic devaluation of the Zimbabwe currency .
The government 's real mistake , however , may have been in playing the IMF 's game at all .
Rather than using its national currency to buy foreign fiat money to pay foreign lenders , it could have followed the lead of Abraham Lincoln and the American colonists and issued its own currency to pay for the production of goods and services for its own people .
Inflation would then have been avoided , because supply would have kept up with demand ; and the currency would have served the local economy rather than being siphoned off by speculators .
THE REAL WEIMAR THREAT AND HOW IT CAN BE AVOIDED
Is the United States , then , out of the hyperinflationary woods with its " quantitative easing " scheme ?
Maybe , maybe not .
To the extent that the newly - created money will be used for real economic development and growth , funding by seigniorage is not likely to inflate prices , because supply and demand will rise together .
Using quantitative easing to fund infrastructure and other productive projects , as in President Obama 's stimulus package , could invigorate the economy as promised , producing the sort of abundance reported by Benjamin Franklin in America 's flourishing early years .
There is , however , something else going on today that is disturbingly similar to what triggered the 1923 hyperinflation .
As in Weimar Germany , money creation in the U.S. is now being undertaken by a privately - owned central bank , the Federal Reserve ; and it is largely being done to settle speculative bets on the books of private banks , without producing anything of value to the economy .
As gold investor James Sinclair warned nearly two years ago :
" [ T ] he real problem is a trembling $ 20 trillion mountain of over the counter credit and default derivatives .
Think deeply about the Weimar Republic case study because every day it looks more and more like a repeat in cause and effect . . . . "
9
The $ 12.9 billion in bailout funds funneled through AIG to pay Goldman Sachs for its highly speculative credit default swaps is just one egregious example .
10
To the extent that the money generated by " quantitative easing " is being sucked into the black hole of paying off these speculative derivative bets , we could indeed be on the Weimar road and there is real cause for alarm .
We have been led to believe that we must prop up a zombie Wall Street banking behemoth because without it we would have no credit system , but that is not true .
There is another viable alternative , and it may prove to be our only viable alternative .
We can beat Wall Street at its own game , by forming publicly - owned banks that issue the full faith and credit of the United States not for private speculative profit but as a public service , for the benefit of the United States and its people .

The home secretary , Jacqui Smith , will publish plans this week for the destruction of the DNA profiles of nearly a million innocent people from the police national database .
The government 's response follows a ruling by the European court of human rights last year that the practice of retaining the DNA profiles was illegal .
In a retreat from plans to get round the judgment , first reported in the Guardian in February , the new proposals will also include the destruction of all physical samples , such as mouth swabs , hair and blood .
They will be published in a consultation paper on forensics .
Smith told the Observer today that there were genuine concerns over the size and scope of the DNA database .
" It is crucial that we do everything we can to keep the public safe from crime and bring offenders to justice , " she said .
" The DNA database plays a vital role in helping us do that .
However , there has to be a balance between the need to protect the public and respecting their rights .
Based on risks versus benefits , our view is that we can now destroy all samples . "
Of the 5.1 million people on the database , about 800,000 have no criminal conviction ; they may have been arrested and never charged , or taken to court and found not guilty .
After the court ruling last December which criticised the " blanket and indiscriminate nature " of the UK regime , Smith ordered the profiles of all young children to be removed immediately , and indicated that time limits would be introduced for those not convicted of any crime .
Civil liberty groups will be anxious to see how long the police are allowed to keep the DNA data before they are required to remove it .
While Home Office officials say the decision to destroy samples as well goes further than the European court ruling , critics say that the measures do not go far enough .
" The DNA database is already too big , " said Simon Davies , director of the campaign group Privacy International .
" We would argue that the samples of anyone convicted of even minor offences should be removed . "
The Conservatives , who have argued that allowing the government to store the DNA data of anyone questioned by the police " represents an unacceptable extension of the power of the state " , are unlikely to be content with the government 's retreat .
They would like to see England and Wales adopt a similar system to Scotland , which allows the DNA of adults charged with sexual or violent offences to be stored for three years .
The shadow home secretary , Chris Grayling , writing on theguardian.com after the European court ruling , said : " There is nothing to consult about .
The situation is straightforward .
It 's illegal .
So stop . "
Although no one concerned with the criminal justice system denies the importance of DNA forensic evidence , there are fears that officials will now attempt to collect stronger evidence of how the use of DNA evidence solves crimes , after the court said it would need " weighty reasons " to justify the current scale of the police database .
The Home Office says that between April 1998 and September 2008 , there were more than 390,000 crimes with DNA matches .
But its own evidence to the European court showed it did not have figures for any crimes solved by stored DNA data from unconvicted people .
A barrister in the case , Stephen Cragg , told the Guardian recently : " The majority of examples provided by the government involved matching suspects ' DNA with crime scene stains .
These cases did not involve samples retained from innocent people . "
A crowd of about 75 people gathered in front of a Michael Jackson star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame this afternoon , but it was actually the wrong star -- this one was for the former KABC radio personality of the same name .
Jackson 's real star near the front of Grauman ’s Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard was covered by scaffolding in preparation for the " Bruno " movie premiere so fans gathered at the other Michael Jackson star to light candles and place purple flowers .
Helene Kress , 43 , of Los Angeles described the time her daughter auditioned for a Disney dance troupe to Jackson ’s “ Rock With You . ”
“ She got the job because of that , ” Kress said , choking back tears .
“ He was so positive , how could you not love him ?
There ’s never going to be another Michael Jackson . ”
Kress said she learned of Jackson 's death while her daughter , Cheyenne Haynes , 13 , was at an audition and did not tell her until after they left .
“ I did n’t want her to know because I did n’t want her to get upset , ” Kress said .
Afterward , they headed for the radio personality 's star to join a prayer circle and sing “ We Are The World . ”
“ He ’s still here .
He is n’t going anywhere , ” Cheyenne said as she cried .
At the star for “ The Jacksons ” someone had scrawled “ 5 ” on top of the “ S . ”
A helicopter hovered overhead and people gathered on patios nearby , snapping photos .
LAPD officers directed passersby to join the circle or keep moving .

Compromises will be made by our elected Representatives .
We have to give them the public support to make the best compromise based on our needs and desires .
This is not President Obama 's fight - it is between us , the media and Congress - with a lot of misinformation supplied by the insurance industry and their defenders .
In conference calls with aides for President Obama , we 've been told that he is looking for us to clear the way and make it clear where the public wants him to go .
If you cannot bring yourself to call for single payer , then consider acting and asking for Expanded Medicare open to all .
But I hope you will consider calling for Single Payer as a step towards the best plan .
Now for the goodies .
I think that regardless of you " action levels " there is something in here that everyone can do .

Guerrilla Marketing Ideas
Do n't give up - Stay involved and take some action everyday .
One thing I did to make it very easy for me to do at least one thing a day was to buy some card stock for my printer and set up a post card template so I can print out 4 at a time .
They almost always have a big bold message on the front that simply reads " Support Single Payer Healthcare NOW " in big letters .
I generally leave the message side on the address side blank so I can write a personal note , but I also keep some with preprinted notes so all I have to do is address them to my target of the day if I am super busy on other things .
Postcards are relatively inexpensive to send and do n't have to go through anthrax scanning so delivery is not delayed .
I also keep an " Action Box " in my car - a small file box full of self printed fliers , bookmarks and info so when I know I wind up in town or the city ( I live in the middle of nowhere ) , I can alway leave something behind in waiting rooms or in books at the bookstore , etc. Guerrilla marketing .
Every book returned to my library has a single payer bookmark in it .
I even got some of that do it yourself plastic wrap so I can cover them to make them last longer should people decide to keep them .
Last summer I made 100 based on the bookmarks from Healthcare Now ! , printed on a really pretty card stock , wrapped them in plastic , went up to the school and borrowed a paper cutter to get nice clean even cuts and then went to the city for a regular shopping trip and spent an hour outside Barnes and Noble giving away bookmarks to customers as they left .
I 've bought a bunch of cheap CDs and burned tons of info on them and left them in doctors offices .
And my sneakiest plan ...
I write letters to myself , carry them around so they get that worn look and then drop them in waiting rooms - people waiting will read all kinds of stuff they would n't otherwise and everyone loves " spying " - reading others ' secrets even if they would never admit it themselves .
The opposition will sink to all kinds of lows with tons of money to keep the money in the hands of the insurance companies and care denied to many .
I do n't feel the least bit guilty at trying to do what little I can to circle behind and fight back .
Of course , I still do the real work of letters to the editor and calls to congress , but the Guerrilla stuff is kind of fun and does not take away from the other .

Send New Faxes and Send More Faxes
There is a new fax tool to send free faxes from 1 payer.net to Congress and the President .
Now you can write your own story .
Write about how health insurance scams have ruined your life .
Write about how loss of a job means loss of insurance means loss of health care .
Write about the anger you feel at the scummy insurance company rules and tricks .
You can write your free fax , add your name and contact information and send it to any or all members of the Senate Finance Committee as well as to the President .
Try it today .
Congress needs to hear your story .
MORE FAXES NEEDED .
As of this morning , you have sent nearly 30 thousand faxes to Congress and the President .
Yet somehow , the President and legislators do n't seem to get the message that you want Medicare For All and that Health Insurance is NOT Health Care .
So let 's step up the pressure and let 's make the message more obvious .
Now you can send a fax that tells the President how the insurance companies are trying to flimflam him and the Washington insiders .
You can tell the President that you can see through the insurance companies ' lies and ask him : Mr. President , you are a smart guy -- why does it look like you are buying the insurance companies ' transparent ploys to wring more money out of our already empty pockets ?
Why do you let them get away with that crap ?
Why do you aid and abet them in getting away with these lies ?
Come on , Mr. President , be the Leader we thought you would be .
Send your fax asking these questions today .
It will go to the President and to all members of the Senate Finance and Senate Health Committee .
DONATIONS URGENTLY NEEDED -- YOU HAVE BEEN SO GENEROUS BUT WE ARE FACING THE BIG GUNS
Your faxes are overwhelming the Washington fax machines time and time again .
We know they are getting through because today we received a bunch of them back ( by mistake ) from Rep. Rangel 's office .
We also know your phone calls are getting through because we have heard that Baucus ' office simply hangs up whenever anyone says ' single payer . "
So the message is being delivered .
Apparently , Washington insiders and Sen. ' K Street ' Baucus are doing their best to pretend that they do n't hear the message .
They are shouting desperately " I do n't hear you , I do n't hear you " like little kids on a playground .
SO MAKE MORE NOISE .
As you have heard , that means spend more money .
We are sending so many faxes that we have had to buy another fax line at $ 70 / month .
We are sending so many phone calls to offices with our automated voicemail delivery that we have had to buy another thousand credits each day at $ 60 / day .
We can only keep sending your message with your continued help and your donations .
Please donate today .
If everyone donates $ 25 , we will have enough for another couple of weeks of ads and faxes and phone calls .
So let 's see it -- $ 25 from each person who reads this message .
And remember . 20 % of your donations this week go to help the Baucus 8 .
So add a little bit for them too .
Thanks ,

BOSTON / LONDON ( Reuters ) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N , the fund manager that has been one of the biggest winners of the credit crunch , has snapped up Barclays Global Investors for $ 13.5 billion in a deal creating the world 's largest money manager .
The combined company , to be called BlackRock Global Investors , will have roughly $ 2.8 trillion of assets under management , more than double Black Rock ’s current size .
Barclays BARC.L , Britain 's second - biggest bank , will gain much - needed capital from the cash - and - stock deal .
BlackRock , founded 20 years ago as a bond investment firm , has managed to sidestep the toxic assets and vehicles that have laid low many competitors , giving Chief Executive Laurence Fink a reputation as one of the shrewdest asset managers on Wall Street .
The U.S. government selected BlackRock to manage troubled assets from Bear Stearns and American International Group Inc AIG.N .
The deal gives BlackRock exposure to exchange - traded funds , a product that has grown fast because it allows investors to buy assets easily that otherwise might be difficult to acquire , such as precious metals or foreign stocks .
Exchange traded funds also typically have low management fees , which many investors have taken more seriously after a brutal decline in asset values in 2008 .
“ Exchange - traded funds have been a growth area in an industry that ’s struggling for growth opportunities , ” said Ralph Cole , who helps manage $ 2.2 billion at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management in Portland , Oregon .
New York - based BlackRock grew from a one - room investment firm to the largest publicly traded asset manager in the United States , and now the world , through a series of acquisitions .
In 2006 , it bought Merrill Lynch & Co ’s asset management business for around $ 8.6 billion .
BlackRock is paying $ 6.6 billion in cash and the rest in stock .
It is raising $ 2.8 billion from the sale of 19.9 million shares to a group of institutional investors .
BlackRock did not identify them , but people familiar with the matter expected Middle East sovereign wealth funds to be among them .
The new share issuance helped push BlackRock ’s existing shares down $ 6.04 , or 3.3 percent , to end trade on the New York Stock Exchange at $ 176.56 on Friday .

CAPITAL FOR BARCLAYS
Barclays shares fell 4.1 percent to close at 292 pence , on concerns that the deal will leave the company more reliant on investment banking , which generates less - stable earnings .
But the deal also helps Barclays by shoring up its capital base .
The bank said that it was recording a net gain of $ 8.8 billion on the assets , which should lift its core Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio by 1.5 percentage points to around 8 percent .
Barclays refused aid from the British government last year as the financial crisis engulfed the industry , and sold shares to Abu Dhabi and Qatar instead .
Banks are under increasing pressure from regulators to keep asset management and investment banking businesses separate , while clients are keen to work with independent fund managers .
That means other banks are likely to split off their fund arms , and the asset management industry should consolidate .
The BlackRock deal scuppers the planned $ 4.4 billion sale of iShares , the exchange traded funds arm of BGI , to buyout firm CVC .
CVC has until June 18 to improve its offer , but it is unlikely to counterbid as it wanted iShares rather than all of BGI , a person familiar with the situation told Reuters .
It will receive a $ 175 million break - up fee .
Barclays , which bought the U.S. investment banking business of Lehman Brothers in September , said its trading performance up to the end of May had been “ generally consistent ” with trends it reported on May 7 .
The companies expect to close the deal sometime in the latter part of the fourth quarter .

DILUTION FOR B OF A , PNC
San Francisco - based BGI 's $ 1.5 trillion in assets will give BlackRock $ 2.8 trillion in assets under management , catapulting it to a dominant position with twice the assets of nearest rival State Street STT.N .
BlackRock was able to pay for the deal in part because its shares have performed relatively well recently .
The company 's shares are up 36 percent so far this year through Thursday 's close , roughly double the increase for the overall sector as measured by the Dow Jones U.S. Asset Managers Index .

Other new investors would get a stake of about 10.5 percent in BlackRock and the deal will dilute the stakes of Bank of America BAC.N to 34 percent from 49 percent and cut PNC Financial Services ' PNC.N holding to 23 percent from 33 percent , according to Reuters estimates .
BlackRock , which pays a $ 3.12 annual dividend , will review its dividend policy once it closes on the deal and has paid off short - term credit facilities , CEO Fink said on a call .
Barclays has agreed not to sell any of its BlackRock shares in the first year without the asset manager ’s consent , and no more than half its holding in the second year .
Barclays Chief Executive John Varley and Barclays President Bob Diamond will each get a seat on BlackRock ’s board .
Diamond will receive a net consideration of $ 36 million before any deductions from shares he holds in BGI .
He will have paid $ 10 million to acquire the shares since 2003 , Barclays said .
Other BGI staff are in line for a windfall from a lucrative employee share ownership plan .
If they exercise options , staff will own 9 percent of BGI .
Barclays was advised by its investment banking unit , Barclays Capital , and Lazard .
JPMorgan Cazenove served as Broker and sponsor to Barclays .
Citigroup and Credit Suisse were lead advisors to BlackRock .
Iran 's post-election political unrest claimed its first confirmed fatality yesterday when shots were fired at supporters of the defeated presidential candidate , Mir Hossein Mousavi , who had defied an official ban on a mass rally in central Tehran .
Basij militiamen loyal to the hardline incumbent , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , were said to be responsible for the shooting , which took place as hundreds of thousands of pro-Mousavi demonstrators marched through the city centre to Azadi ( Freedom ) Square demanding the result of last Friday 's election be annulled .
Photographs taken at the scene appeared to show one man dead and several others with bullet wounds .
Precise figures were not available , but some estimates suggested that more than 500,000 people were involved in the protest against the election " theft " .
Such large - scale protest has not seen in Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
" Mousavi we support you !
We will die but regain our votes , " shouted supporters , many wearing the green of the moderate 's election campaign and carrying signs with the message " Where is my vote ? "
Several vehicles were set alight in Tehran 's streets and there were reports that protesters had taken to city rooftops at nightfall , shouting " Death to the dictator " .
Last night protesters promised they would be back on the streets again today .
The presence of huge crowds on the streets – and reports of other fatalities – appeared to dash earlier predictions that the unrest of the past three days would fade away .
There was also a fresh twist when it was announced that Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , had ordered the powerful guardian council to investigate claims of election fraud .
Diplomatic sources said this was not a major shift , suggesting that Khamenei had merely warned Mousavi that he should proceed with his fraud complaints carefully , using only " legal " means available to him .
Khamenei , who stands at the apex of Iran 's complex political system , endorsed the election result on Saturday , dashing opposition hopes that he might be persuaded to order a recount or even annul the result .
The guardian council , comprised of 12 senior clerics , said it would rule within 10 days on two official complaints it had received from Mousavi and Mohsen Rezaie , another election candidate .
The council vets candidates and must formally approve results for the outcome to stand .
The interior ministry , which announced the election result on Saturday , and the president have rejected charges of fraud .
Ahmadinejad compared protesters to football fans angry that their team had lost .
Questions were asked though how 40 million Iranian votes had been counted and the results announced so soon after the polls closed .
Observers were stunned by the size of the Tehran rally , in defiance of a ban .
And there was no sign of the anger diminishing : " Many of my friends are in prison , " said Saman Imani , a student beaten by police .
" Iran is becoming a dictatorship .
Ahmadinejad is denying the Holocaust because he's as brutal as Hitler was . "
Ebrahim Yazdi , leader of the banned opposition Freedom Movement and a veteran of the revolution , warned that Ahmadinejad 's attacks on his opponents had opened a " Pandora 's box " which had led to a deep crisis within the regime .
" The result of such a crisis now is that the rift among the ... personalities of the revolution is getting deeper , " he said .
" It is also between people and their government ... a rift between state and the nation .
It is the biggest crisis since the revolution . "
Further reports tonight spoke of people in Isfahan , Ahwaz , Zahedan , Yazd and Mashhad shouting " Allahu Akbar [ God is great ] " in support of the Tehran demonstrations .
Mohammad Khatami , the reformist ex-president and a backer of Mousavi , attacked the government for banning the rally .
Ahmadinejad delayed a visit to Russia but was due to arrive tomorrow .
Concerned governments around the globe were watching the situation closely .
" The implications are not yet clear , " said David Miliband , the foreign secretary .
The US president , Barack Obama , said he was " deeply troubled " by the post-election violence .
" It is up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran 's leaders will be .
We respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States being the issue inside of Iran , " he said , adding that Washington wanted to pursue a " tough , direct " dialogue with Tehran .

Huntsman will need a very large compound in Beijing
He said congressional Republicans failed to score political points for opposing the bill - only three Republican senators supported it - because the public saw them as objecting to being shut out by Democrats from helping write the bill rather than as taking a principled stand .
The governor said congressional Republicans are being frustrated by a lack of credibility on the party 's No. 1 tenet : fiscal responsibility .
" That 's why no one is paying any attention , " he said .
" Our moral soapbox was completely taken away from us because of our behavior in the last few years .
For us to now criticize analogous behavior is hypocrisy .
We 've got to come at it a different way .
We 've got to prove the point .
It ca n't be as the Chinese would say , ' fei hua , ' [ or ] empty words . "
... Mr. Huntsman , who was in Washington for a meeting of governors , said the failure of Republican leaders in Congress to move beyond " gratuitous partisanship " has left it to the party 's governors and other state officials to come up with " big , bold solutions and ideas " that will win over voters and revive the party .
A few days ago David Plouffe looked over the motley array of Republicans positioning themselves for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination -- Newt Gingrich , Pyush Jindal , Mitt Romney , Sarah Palin , Tim Pawlenty , Mike Huckabee ... and he said none of them had enough connection to the political mainstream to be of concern .
He then mentioned that Utah 's current governor , Jon Huntsman , Jr. is " the one person in that party who might be a [ serious ] potential presidential candidate .
" Huntsman is a mainstream conservative who has lately come under fire from the dominant Cheney / Limbaugh teabagger wing of the Republican Party .
Despite an 84 % approval rating -- the highest of any Republican governor in the U.S. -- Huntsman 's mainstream attitudes towards science , the environment , Obama 's stimulus package , immigration , and even gay people , has not endeared him to the stalwarts of the Party of No Huntsman , who announced a couple weeks ago he would not be running for a third term as governor , did his Mormon missionary work in Taiwan , is fluent in Mandarin and adopted a little Chinese girl he found abandoned in a vegetable market 10 years ago .
Today President Obama announced that he will appoint Huntsman ambassador to China .
Assuming that the obstructionists in his own party do n't torpedo his confirmation , this pretty much takes Huntsman , the son of a billionaire , out of contention for the 2012 GOP nomination .
The mainstream policies Huntsman has advocated have endeared him to moderates in the GOP and to independent voters but there is no room for that kind of talk as far as the party 's current dictators are concerned .
Huntsman 's civil unions approach for gay couples has driven the far right off the cliff and by signing a regional initiative setting up a cap - and - trade effort to reduce global warming , he is looked on by the extremists as a traitor to the GOP .
Speaking in Shanghai in 2006 about the need for close cooperation between the U.S. and China on environmental issues , he used all the wrong words as far as the radical right is concerned : " good stewards of the Earth " translates in Republican - speak as not supporting unrestricted development and market - based capitalism .
They abhor him .
A right - wing hate group in Kent County , Michigan ( the Republican Party ) withdrew a speaking invitation to Huntsman because of his mainstream views .
The crazed bigot who leads the local party , Joanne Voorhees , wrote in the local newspaper that " The voters want and expect us to stand on principle and return to our roots .
Unfortunately , by holding an event with Governor Huntsman , we would be doing the exact opposite .
" Huntsman has refused to kiss up to the national extremists in his party and got into hot water with them when he told thethat he blames the GOP 's dire straits on the low quality of congressional leaders the party is stuck with .
He says he does n't know them and has never met them .
" I do n't listen or read whatever it is they say because it is inconsequential -- completely . "
Mike Pence , one of those leaders and one of the least competent and most ideologically extreme of any elected official in America , claims that GOP leaders " are n't as incompetent as they might appear .
" Even in that interview Huntsman used a Chinese phrase to describe Republicans :
On the other hand , as Adam Green pointed out today at Open Left , let 's not get too carried away with Huntsman , the way Obama just did .
Huntsman is clearly better than intellectual midgets and knee - jerk obstructionists like Eric Cantor , Paul Ryan , Carrie Prejean , Jim DeMint and Mike Pence but what kind of a bar is that ?
OK , he thinks Mormons should be allowed to buy booze on Sundays , gays should be separate but almost equal , and he even speaks a foreign language .
Better than most Republican elected officials -- but still ... a Republican .
Al Giordano makes an interesting case about 3 dimensional chess and how Obama is strengthening his ties with Mormons in swing states like Colorado , Arizona and Nevada with Mormons who will be pissed off that the Mormon - hating evangelicals will again deny Bishop Romney the Republican presidential nomination for only one reason : his funny underpants .
Unless the GOP plans to just bite the bullet and run Rush Limbaugh -- after all a great many hate talk show hosts have been elected Republican members of Congress , including J.D. Hayworth and Mike Pence -- the Republicans are going to have to find a new face to present to the public in 2012 .
The frontrunner for the Republican nomination for governor of Georgia , John Oxendine , is perfect for the GOP , threatening to run Planned Parenthood out of Georgia when he 's elected .
He bragged that he had painted his son's nursery " Confederate Gray . "
Another secessionist like the kook in Texas , here 's Oxendine 's tweet from last week :

Advertisement Civil liberties groups have reacted angrily to US President Barack Obama 's decision to revive military trials for some Guantanamo Bay detainees .
Mr Obama has previously denounced the Bush - era judicial system , but in a statement said new safeguards would ensure suspects got a fairer hearing .
New rules include rejecting statements obtained from harsh interrogations and limitations on using hearsay evidence .
There are still 240 detainees at the US base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Barack Obama branded the original military trials an enormous failure Mr Obama halted the controversial military commissions as one of his first acts on taking office in January , saying the US was entering a new era of respecting human rights .
" It 's disappointing that Obama is seeking to revive rather than end this failed experiment , " said Jonathan Hafetz , a national security attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union .
" There is no detainee at Guantanamo who can not be tried and should n't be tried in the regular federal courts system .
This is perpetuating the Bush administration 's misguided detention policy . "
Kenneth Roth , head of Human Rights Watch , said : " By resurrecting this failed Bush administration idea , President Obama is backtracking dangerously on his reform agenda . "
Campaign statement
On the campaign trail last year , Mr Obama had branded the military commissions " an enormous failure " .
But in the statement issued on Friday , he said he had supported their use as one avenue to try detainees , and in 2006 had voted in favour of them .
He said he had opposed the tribunals used by George W Bush 's administration because they had failed to establish a legitimate legal framework and undermined swift and certain justice .
The extra safeguards for detainees include a ban on evidence obtained by harsh interrogation ; restrictions on hearsay evidence ; giving detainees more leeway to choose their own lawyers and protecting detainees who refuse to testify , the statement said .
Mr Obama said he was seeking more time so that the new procedures could be implemented .
Text : Obama statement Obama 's balancing act Justin Webb on Guantanamo Send us your comments " These reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution , while bringing them in line with the rule of law , " he said .
" This is the best way to protect our country , while upholding our deeply held values . "
But Geneve Mantri , of Amnesty International , said Mr Obama 's message was confusing .
" It was clear from his announcements soon after he reached the White House what he was going to do , " he said .
" Now it is somewhat confusing what the administration 's standard is or what their policies are . "
Zachary Katznelson of Reprieve , which represents a number of Guantanamo Bay detainees , told the BBC that the president was making a " fundamental mistake " .
" He is taking a gravely , truly flawed system , tinkering at the edges and hoping that the world is somehow going to see this as legitimate , as open , as fair - it's not going to happen , " he said .
In contrast , Mr Obama found support for his decision among his opponents .
" I am pleased that President Obama has now adopted this view , " said Republican Senator John McCain , who lost the presidential election to Mr Obama .
Ari Fleischer , who was George W Bush 's first press secretary , said President Obama " should acknowledge his campaign criticisms were wrong " .
" With some minor changes , he really is following the same path President Bush pursued , " he said .
Pragmatic style
The BBC's James Coomarasamy in Washington says that although some are disappointed , for others it is further evidence of Mr Obama 's pragmatic style of leadership , one that recognises the need to balance the change he has promised with the reality he has inherited .
Mr Obama has said he wants the Guantanamo Bay camp closed by 2010 .
Shortly before his announcement , US officials said that Algerian detainee Lakhdar Boumediene had left Guantanamo Bay for France .
Mr Boumediene was arrested in Bosnia in 2001 and was held for seven years .
He was cleared of any wrongdoing in November .
US MEDIA REACTION TO OBAMA'S DECISION Obama officials have been dispatched to insist to journalists ( anonymously , of course ) that Obama 's embrace of " new and improved " military commissions is neither inconsistent with the criticisms that were voiced about Bush 's military commission system nor with Obama 's prior statements on this issue .
It is plainly not the case that these " modifications " address the core criticisms directed to what Bush did , nor is it the case that Obama 's campaign position on this issue can be reconciled with what he is now doing .
Salon 's Glenn Greenwald thinks Obama has performed a big U - turn .
President Obama , and the country at large , is finding out that George W Bush 's most controversial policies were not born of ideological delusion , American arrogance , or missionary zeal .
They were imperfect but sound ( with the exception of our ties to Riyadh ) responses to complicated threats .
But the validation of the last president runs a very distant second to the most compelling aspect of all this : the drama over CIA interrogations and Guantanamo will hopefully serve to set the administration on a more serious national security course .
And it would be helpful if the American public finally dropped moral outrage as the preferred mode of political argumentation .
Abe Greenwald , writing in Commentary magazine , thinks that now is " a good time to be George W. Bush " .
The revival of the commissions seems to be directed at the often referred to " third category " of detainees , those whom the government believes are too dangerous to let go but are unable to try .
The American Prospect 's Adam Serwer speculates that the new proposals are a way of " getting round " the US constitution .
Let me see if I 've got this right :
The previous extra-legal system was n't up to snuff because it was n't codified enough ?
The new ! improved !
Obama - era secret trials will be better because they are swifter and more certain ?
Seriously ?
The introductory statement alone , to me , undermines the whole premise that this is by any stretch an acceptable substitute for time - tested United States criminal code prosecution .
FireDogLake 's Gregg Levine has his doubts about the new Obama military tribunals .

LAWRENCE , Kan . - Despite calamities from economic recessions , wars and famine to a flu epidemic afflicting the Earth , a new study from the University of Kansas and Gallup indicates that humans are by nature optimistic .
The study , to be presented Sunday , May 24 , 2009 , at the annual meeting of the Association for Psychological Science in San Francisco , found optimism to be universal and borderless .
Data from the Gallup World Poll drove the findings , with adults in more than 140 countries providing a representative sample of 95 percent of the world 's population .
The sample included more than 150,000 adults .
Eighty - nine percent of individuals worldwide expect the next five years to be as good or better than their current life , and 95 percent of individuals expected their life in five years to be as good or better than their life was five years ago .
" These results provide compelling evidence that optimism is a universal phenomenon , " said Matthew Gallagher , a psychology doctoral candidate at the University of Kansas and lead researcher of the study .
At the country level , optimism is highest in Ireland , Brazil , Denmark , and New Zealand and lowest in Zimbabwe , Egypt , Haiti and Bulgaria .
The United States ranks number 10 on the list of optimistic countries .
Demographic factors ( age and household income ) appear to have only modest effects on individual levels of optimism .

New Revelations about Stasi Spy Kurras Soviets Had Help during Checkpoint Charlie Standoff
In recent weeks , Germany has been taking a hard look at its Cold War history after it was revealed that a Stasi spy shot and killed student demonstrator Benno Ohnesorg in 1967 .
Now new details reveal that the same officer spied for the Soviets during the 1961 Checkpoint Charlie standoff .
The latest : Henry Blodget 's analysis : NYT finally begins to bow to reality .
Earlier : Along with cutting newsroom salaries 5 % , the New York Times ( NYT ) cut 100 jobs on the business side of the company today .
Here 's the memo :
Dear Colleagues ,
In a note just distributed , Arthur and Janet informed us that the company , regrettably , must take even more aggressive steps to control our costs .
Clearly , our course is not getting any easier .
The recession , especially the deteriorating advertising climate , is exacting a bitter toll , despite all that we have already done to reduce spending .
This morning , we notified about 100 employees on the business side of The Times that their jobs were being eliminated .
We thank these dedicated colleagues for all they have contributed to The Times over the years .
The broader announcement today outlines a temporary salary reduction for the remainder of the year for all non-union employees , including the top leadership of the company .
It is our hope that these cost - cutting measures will allow us to avoid further layoffs .
The details of the salary reduction will be communicated to you shortly by your senior managers .
Although employee pay will be cut by 5 % for the remaining three - quarters of the year , you will be entitled to 10 additional personal days off over the nine months .
Next year , we plan to return salaries to their current levels .
Of course , such a decision depends on the state of our business .
In addition , we will be asking that our Guild - represented colleagues make a similar sacrifice .
The Company plans to discuss this with the Guild leadership this afternoon , in a spirit of shared sacrifice and as a way to otherwise avoid layoffs in the newsroom .
Navigating this difficult passage for our business has not been easy .
We need to do what we can to reduce spending in the face of falling revenues .
At the same time , it is vital we do everything possible to maintain the quality and reach of the journalism that is the hallmark of The Times and to support the resourcefulness and competitive edge of the Media Group 's business operations .
Decisions such as today ’s underscore the scale of the challenges facing us as we confront not only the structural changes reshaping our industry but also the deepening global recession .
We honor those who will no longer work alongside us and extend our gratitude to them for their contributions .
Further , we want to thank every one of you who are sacrificing a portion of your pay over the remainder of the year .
Sincerely ,
Scott , Bill , Martin & Andy

Game Rules
In the new Oct. 2017 version , the price of a ticket has been increased to $ 2 from $ 1 .
The numbers picked for the prizes consist of 5 numbers picked at random from a pool of 70 numbers ( the White Numbers ) .
Then a single number ( the Mega Number ) is picked from a second pool that has 25 numbers .
If the results of these random number selections match one of the winning combinations on your lottery ticket , then you win something .
Cash Value of a Game
If you win the Jackpot , you have the option of either accepting 30 annuity payments ( A cash amount that is paid annually ) , or you can take a lump sum " cash value " payment .
If you take the annuity , you will get a series of payments that will increase at 5 % per year .
The total of these 30 payments will approximately equal the advertised size of the Jackpot .
( This assumes you are a single winner and not sharing the Jackpot with someone else .
Taxes will subsequently be subtracted / withheld from these payments . )
If you take an immediate cash payment instead of the 30 year annuity , you will get about one half ( before taxes ) of the advertised " annuity " value of the game .
Lower interest rates will increase this fraction while higher interest rates will decrease the cash payout .
The following table shows the relative amounts that you would receive given various interest rates .
For the calculations below , an advertised " annuity " value for the Jackpot of $ 100,000,000 is assumed .
( The $ 100,000,000 could be your share of a shared Jackpot . )
The amounts in the table can be directly scaled for any arbitrary Jackpot size .
( All amounts are BEFORE taxes . )
Interest Immediate First Payment Last Payment
Rate Cash Payout If Take Annuity If Take Annuity
3.0 % $ 60,506,809 $ 1,505,144 $ 6,195,375
3.5 % 56,062,409 1,505,144 6,195,375
4.0 % 52,053,422 1,505,144 6,195,375
4.5 % 48,431,551 1,505,144 6,195,375
5.0 % 45,154,305 1,505,144 6,195,375
6.0 % 39,488,405 1,505,144 6,195,375
8.0 % 30,912,469 1,505,144 6,195,375
( All results rounded to the nearest $ 1 )
Note that the cash value of the Jackpot is normally about one half of the advertised value of the Jackpot .
For the rest of this web page , we will just refer to these exact values as " about one half " instead of the above exact values .
As an example of scaling for different sized Jackpots , if the interest rate is 4 % and the advertised annuity Jackpot is $ 300,000,000 , then multiply the results in the 4 % row by 3 to get the corresponding instant cash payout amount or annual annuity payout amounts .
Combinatorics Calculations
In any combinatorics problem where all possible outcomes are equally likely , the probability of a successful outcome is determined by finding the number of successful combinations , and then dividing by the total number of all combinations .
There are nine possible configurations that will win something in the Mega Millions Lottery .
For each of these , the probability of winning equals the number of winning combinations for that particular configuration divided by the total number of ways the Mega Millions numbers can be picked .
Mega Millions Total Combinations
Since the total number of combinations for Mega Millions numbers is used in all the calculations , we will calculate it first .
The number of ways 5 numbers can be randomly selected from a field of 70 is : COMBIN ( 70,5 ) = 12,103,014 .

12,103,014 combinations there are COMBIN ( 25,1 ) = 25 different ways to pick the sixth number ( the “ Mega ” number ) .
The total number of ways to pick the 6 numbers is the product of these two partial calculations .
Thus , the total number of equally likely Mega Millions combinations is 12,103,014 x 25 = 302,575,350 .
We will use this number for each of the following calculations .
Jackpot probability / odds ( Payout varies )
The number of ways the first 5 numbers on your lottery ticket can match the 5 White numbers is COMBIN ( 5,5 ) = 1 . The number of ways your final number can match the Mega number is : COMBIN ( 1,1 ) = 1 . The product of these is the number of ways you can win the Jackpot : COMBIN ( 5,5 ) x COMBIN ( 1,1 ) = 1 . The probability of success is thus :
1/302,575,350 = 0.000000003304961888 .
If you express this as “ One chance in ?? ? ” , you just divide “ 1 ” by the 0.000000003304961888 , which yields “ One chance in 302,575,350 ” .
Match all 5
White numbers but not the Mega number ( Payout = $ 1,000,000 )
The number of ways the 5 first numbers on your lottery ticket can match the 5 White numbers is COMBIN ( 5,5 ) = 1 . The number of ways your final number can match any of the 24 losing Mega numbers is : COMBIN ( 24,1 ) = 24 .
( Pick any of the 24 losers . )
Thus there are COMBIN ( 5,5 ) x COMBIN ( 24,1 ) = 24 possible combinations .
The probability for winning $ 1,000,000 is thus 24/302,575,350 = .0000000793190853121 or “ One chance in 12,607,306.25 ” .
Match 4 out of 5
White numbers and match the Mega number ( Payout = $ 10,000 )
The number of ways 4 of the 5 first numbers on your lottery ticket can match the 5 White numbers is COMBIN ( 5,4 ) =
5 . The number of ways your fifth initial number can match any of the 65 losing White numbers is COMBIN ( 65,1 ) = 65 .
The number of ways your final number can match the Mega number is : COMBIN ( 1,1 ) = 1 . The product of these is the number of ways you can get this configuration : COMBIN ( 5,4 ) x COMBIN ( 65,1 ) x COMBIN ( 1,1 ) = 325 .
The probability of success is thus : 325/302,575,350 = 0.0000010741126136 or “ One chance in 931,001.08 ” .
Match 4 out of 5
White numbers but not match the Mega number ( Payout = $ 500 )
The number of ways 4 of the 5 first numbers on your lottery ticket can match the 5 White numbers is COMBIN ( 5,4 ) =
5 . The number of ways your fifth initial number can match any of the 65 losing White numbers is COMBIN ( 65,1 ) = 65 .
The number of ways your final number can match any of the 24 losing Mega numbers is : COMBIN ( 24,1 ) = 24 .
The product of these is the number of ways you can get this configuration : COMBIN ( 5,4 ) x COMBIN ( 65,1 ) x COMBIN ( 24,1 ) = 7,800 .
The probability of success is thus :
7,800/302,575,350 = 0.0000257787 or “ One chance in 38,791.71 ” .
Match 3 out of 5
White numbers and match the Mega number ( Payout = $ 200 )
The number of ways 3 of the 5 first numbers on your lottery ticket can match the 5 White numbers is COMBIN ( 5,3 ) = 10 .
The number of ways the 2 losing initial numbers on your ticket can match any of the 65 losing White numbers is COMBIN ( 65,2 ) = 2,080 .
The number of ways your final number can match the Mega number is : COMBIN ( 1,1 ) = 1 . The product of these is the number of ways you can get this configuration : COMBIN ( 5,3 ) x COMBIN ( 65,2 ) x COMBIN ( 1,1 ) = 20,800 .
The probability of success is thus : 20,800/302,575,350 = 0.0000687432 or One chance in 14,546.89 ” .
Match 3 out of 5
White numbers but not match the Mega number ( Payout = $ 10 )
The number of ways 3 of the 5 first numbers on your lottery ticket can match the 5 White numbers is COMBIN ( 5,3 ) = 10 .
The number of ways the 2 losing initial numbers on your ticket can match any of the 65 losing White numbers is COMBIN ( 65,2 ) = 2,080 .
The number of ways your final number can match any of the 24 losing Mega numbers is : COMBIN ( 24,1 ) = 24 .
The product of these is the number of ways you can get this configuration : COMBIN ( 5,3 ) x COMBIN ( 65,2 ) x COMBIN ( 24,1 ) = 499,200 .
The probability of success is thus : 499,200 /
302,575,350 = 0.001649837 or “ One chance in 606.12 ” .
Match 2 out of 5
White numbers and match the Mega number ( Payout = $ 10 )
The number of ways 2 of the 5 first numbers on your lottery ticket can match the 5 White numbers is COMBIN ( 5,2 ) = 10 .
The number of ways the 3 losing initial numbers on your ticket can match any of the 65 losing White numbers is COMBIN ( 65,3 ) = 43,680 .
The number of ways your final number can match the Mega number is : COMBIN ( 1,1 ) = 1 . The product of these is the number of ways you can get this configuration : COMBIN ( 5,2 ) x COMBIN ( 65,3 ) x COMBIN ( 1,1 ) = 436,800 .
The probability of success is thus :
436,800/302,575,350 = 0.001443607 or “ One chance in 692.71 ” .
Match 1 out of 5
White numbers and match the Mega number ( Payout = $ 4 )
The number of ways 1 of the 5 first numbers on your lottery ticket can match the 5 White numbers is COMBIN ( 5,1 ) =
5 . The number of ways the 4 losing initial numbers on your ticket can match any of the 65 losing White numbers is COMBIN ( 65,4 ) = 677,040 .
The number of ways your final number can match the Mega number is : COMBIN ( 1,1 ) = 1 . The product of these is the number of ways you can get this configuration : COMBIN ( 5,1 ) x COMBIN ( 65,4 ) x COMBIN ( 1,1 ) = 3,385,200 .
The probability of success is thus :
3,385,200/302,575,350 = 0.011187957 or “ One chance in 89.38 ” .
Match 0 out of 5
White numbers and match the Mega number ( Payout = $ 2 )
The number of ways 0 of the 5 first numbers on your lottery ticket can match the 5 White numbers is COMBIN ( 5,0 ) =
1 . The number of ways the 5 losing initial numbers on your ticket can match any of the 65 losing White numbers is COMBIN ( 65,5 ) = 8,259,888 .
The number of ways your final number can match the Mega number is : COMBIN ( 1,1 ) = 1 . The product of these is the number of ways you can get this configuration : COMBIN ( 5,0 ) x COMBIN ( 65,5 ) x COMBIN ( 1,1 ) = 8,259,888 .
The probability of success is thus : 8,259,888/302,575,350 = 0.0272986 or “ One chance in 36.63 ” .
Probability of winning something
If we add all the ways you can win something we get :
1 + 24 + 325 + 7,800 + 20,800 + 499,200 + 436,800 + 3,385,200 + 8,259,888 = 12,610,038 different ways of winning something .
If we divide the result by the 302,575,350 , we get .0416757 as a probability of winning something .
1 divided by 0.0416757 yields
“ One chance in 23.99 ” of winning something .
Alternately , the probability of not winning anything is 1 - .0416757 = 0.9583243 which is about 23 out of every 24 tickets .
Corollary
You can get a close estimate for the number of tickets that were in play for any given game by multiplying the announced number of “ winners ” by the above 23.99 .
Thus , if the lottery officials proclaim that a given lottery drawing had 5 million “ winners ” , then there were about 5,000,000 x 23.99 ~= 120,000,000 tickets purchased that did not win the Jackpot . ( " ~= " means " approximately equal to " )
Alternately , there were about 120,000,000 - 5,000,000 ~= 115,000,000 tickets that did not win anything .
Probability of not matching anything
Match 0 out of 5
White numbers and not match the Mega number
The number of ways 0 of the 5 first numbers on your lottery ticket can match the 5 White numbers is COMBIN ( 5,0 ) =
1 . The number of ways the 5 losing initial numbers on your ticket can match any of the 65 losing White numbers is COMBIN ( 65,5 ) = 8,259,888 .
The number of ways your final number can fail to match the Mega number is : COMBIN ( 24,1 ) = 24 .
The product of these numbers is the number of ways you can get this configuration : COMBIN ( 5,0 ) x COMBIN ( 65,5 ) x COMBIN ( 24,1 ) = 198,237,312 .
The probability of failing to match anything is thus :
198,237,312/302,575,350 = 0.65516676 or just under two times out of every 3 tickets .
Note :
This web page had over 50,000 hits for the large Jackpot on Jan. 4 , 2011 .
If this is representative of what happened at Mega Millions headquarters , I extend my deepest sympathy to their computers .
Probability of multiple winning tickets ( multiple winners )
given “ N ” tickets in play
Note :
All calculations assume that the numbers on any given ticket are picked randomly .
In practice , many people pick numbers based on family birthdays , etc. , and thus many tickets will have a preponderance of low numbers .
As a consequence , the probabilities of a single Jackpot winner will be somewhat lower and the probabilities of no winner or multiple winners will tend to be slightly higher than the numbers shown below .
Also if the numbers picked in the drawing are clustered at the high end of the 1 - 70 range , there will tend to be relatively less “ partial match ” winners .
The reverse will hold true if the drawing numbers cluster in the low end of the number range .
The above chart shows the probabilities of “ No Winners ” , “ One Winner ” , and “ Two or more Winners ” for various numbers of tickets in play .
Each entry in the following table shows the probability of “ K ” tickets holding the same winning Jackpot combination given that " N " tickets are in play for a given Mega Millions game .
It is assumed that the number selections on each ticket are picked randomly .
For example :
If 200,000,000 tickets are in play for a Mega Millions game , then there is a 0.1128 probability that exactly two of these tickets will have the same winning combination .
Note :
You can get a rough estimate of the number of tickets in play as follows .
If the preceding Mega Millions game had no Jackpot winner , then find the difference in the annuity Jackpot amount for the prior game vs. the current annuity Jackpot amount .
The number of tickets in play is approximately three quarters ( 0.75 ) of this number .
( Technically , this " 3/4 " is variable .
If interest rates are low , the ratio will be greater than 3/4 .
And vice versa , if interest rates are high , the ratio will be less than 3/4 . )
For example , if the preceding game had an advertised annuity payout amount of $ 200,000,000 and the current game has an advertised annuity payout amount of $ 280,000,000 , then there are about ( 280,000,000 - 200,000,000 ) x 0.75 = 80,000,000 x 0.75 = 60,000,000 tickets in play for the current game .

Prob. = COMBIN ( N , K ) x ( Pwin^K ) x ( Pnotwin ^ ( N - K ) )
Where :
N = Number of tickets in play
K = Number of tickets holding the Jackpot combination
Pwin = Probability that a random ticket will win ( = 1 / 302,575,350 = 0.000000003305 )

Sample Calculation to Find the Expected Cash Ticket Value
Considering the Number of Tickets
That are in Play
For this example we will assume the cash value of the Jackpot is $ 400,000,000 ( The advertised value of Jackpot would be about double this . ) and there are 300,000,000 tickets in play for the current game .
Probability values are from the “ 300,000,000 ” row above .
The calculated value of a ticket includes the possibility that you will share the Jackpot with someone else .
The first calculation is : “ What is the probability that the jackpot will be won ? ”
This is simply ( 1.00 – the probability that no one will win ) = 1.00 – 0.3710 ~= 0.6290 .
Thus the expected cash Jackpot payout by the lottery is $ 400,000,000 times 0.6290 = $ 251,590,404.62 .
( All actual calculations used full precision )
If there are 300,000,000 tickets in play , then we divide the $ 251,590,404.62 by 300,000,000 to get an average cash Jackpot payout per ticket of $ 0.8386 .
The other smaller prizes add $ 0.24698 to this amount to give an " expected before tax , cash value of $ 1.0856 .
( And remember , you paid $ 2 for this ticket . )
These calculations can be used to form a table that shows the expected cash return per ticket ( = expected cash value per ticket ) .
For example if the cash value of the jackpot is $ 400,000,000 and there are 300,000,000 tickets in play , then the ticket ’s expected cash value is fractionally under $ 1.09 .
The following table shows the " Expected Before Taxes Cash Value " of a $ 2.00 ticket .
( includes $ 0.24698 for the smaller prizes )

1000 0.34 0.44 0.54 0.63 0.73 0.82 0.92 1.02 1.11 1.21
The calculations above use the " cash value " of the Jackpot .
The " cash value " is usually about one half of the advertised Jackpot amount .
Thus the " expected value " of your $ 2 ticket will be on the left side of the table unless the advertised Jackpot is over One $ Billion .
( That 's a " B " )
We can also see what happens to the expected value of a ticket if a buying frenzy should develop at this point .
Let ’s assume that 400 million more tickets are sold .
At $ 2,00 per ticket , the lottery takes in $ 800 million .
This $ 800 million is divvied up multiple ways .
( For example , see the 6 " winners " in the " 3rd Thoughts " section at the end of this web page , allocations for the smaller prizes , etc . )
Only about $ 200 million of the new cash input goes to the Jackpot allocation .
( The rate of increase in Jackpot amount for a given new cash input is based on historical Mega Million data which can be seen at
Thus the game has been transformed into 700 million tickets in play for a cash jackpot that is now worth $ 600 million .
If we follow the 700 million ticket row to the right until we reach the $ 600 million column , we find an expected cash jackpot value of $ 1.02 .
The buying frenzy has decreased the expected cash value of a ticket from $ 1.09 to $ 1.02 .
And remember , you paid $ 2.00 cash for the " privilege " of participating in this ( con ) game .
For this example we will assume the cash value of the Jackpot is $ 400,000,000 ( The advertised value of Jackpot would be about double this . ) and there are 300,000,000 tickets in play for the current game .
Probability values are from the “ 300,000,000 ” row above .
The calculated value of a ticket includes the possibility that you will share the Jackpot with someone else .
The first calculation is : “ What is the probability that the jackpot will be won ? ”
This is simply ( 1.00 – the probability that no one will win ) = 1.00 – 0.3710 ~= 0.6290 .

( All actual calculations used full precision )
If there are 300,000,000 tickets in play , then we divide the $ 251,590,404.62 by 300,000,000 to get an average cash Jackpot payout per ticket of $ 0.8386 .

( The increase in the advertised annuity would be about double this - or about $ 400 million . )
The cash Jackpot is now worth $ 400 million plus $ 200 million = $ 600 million .
( The advertised annuity value would be about double this - or about 1.2 Billion . )
Thus the game has been transformed into 700 million tickets in play for a cash jackpot that is now worth $ 600 million .

Before Tax Return on Investment
It is interesting to calculate what the long term expected return is for each $ 2.00 lottery ticket that you buy
The first task is to construct a table where each row lists the winning combination , the payout , the probability of this payout , and the contribution to the expected return ( Equals payout times probability . )
The probabilities are the same ones we derived earlier .
An average $ 228,000,000 cash payout ( decline the annuity ) is assumed for the Jackpot .
( Could be your portion of a shared Jackpot . )
( Note that this " cash payout " is about one half of the advertised Jackpot amount .

Total for last 6 rows 0.1569
( Used for after tax calculation )
Total for last 8 rows 0.24698
( Used for before taxes , non Jackpot , cash value calculations )
Thus , for each $ 2.00 that you spend for Mega Millions tickets , you can expect to get back about $ 1.00 .
Of course you get to pay taxes on any large payout , so your net return is even less .
Expected after tax return on your $ 2.00 ticket investment
when a large Jackpot is in play
While the above calculation represents an average Mega Millions game , we might ask what the expected after tax return on your investment might be if a huge Jackpot exists .
The following analysis assumes the annuity value of the Jackpot is $ 2 Billion ( that ’s a “ B ” ) and there are 600 million tickets in play .
The cash value for any Jackpot is about one - half the annuity value which brings the real value down to $ 1,000,000,000 .
All prizes of $ 10,000 and above are reduced 40 % to allow for federal and state taxes .
Do n’t forget that a large prize will throw you into a top tax bracket .
First , we check the expected value of a ticket in the table that we calculated earlier .
Follow the 600 - million row until you come to the $ 1,000 million column .
The expected cash value of a ticket is $ 1.68 .
This included $ 0.1569 for the smaller prizes ( no taxes for prizes under $ 10,000 ) so $ 0.1569 has to be subtracted back out .
This leaves $ 1.53 for the 3 largest prizes .
However , this has to be reduced by 40 % for taxes .
This leaves an expected after tax value of the jackpot of $ 0.9164 .
Finally we add the $ 0.1569 back in again to get an expected after tax return of $ 1.07 for your $ 2 cost of your ticket .
And this is for an advertised $ 2 Billion Jackpot .
The following shows the actual numbers for the Oct. 23 , 2018 Mega Millions game .
Announced annuity value : $ 1.6 billion
Actual cash value : $ 903 million ( Interest rates were still relatively low )
Number of tickets in play : 370 million ( Less than the usual buying frenzy )
The relatively higher cash value and relatively low number of tickets should have " enhanced the expected value " .
The actual calculated expected after tax value was still only $ 1.24 for a $ 2.00 ticket .
For this particular game , the expected after tax loss for every $ 2 ticket that you bought was $ 0.76 .
Megaplier
Some states use a Megaplier feature to increase non-jackpot prizes by 2 , 3 , 4 or 5 times .
It costs an additional $ 1 for the Megaplier play .
The Megaplier number is randomly picked using the probability table below .
If your state has a “ Megaplier ” and if your state follows the probabilities posted on the Mega Million web site , then a calculation can be made for the expected return if you pay an additional $ 1.00 to participate in the Megaplier play .
To find out the expected return , we construct a table to calculate the average expected multiplier .
Multiple Odds Probability Contribution
2 1 in 3 0.333333 0.666667
3 2 in 5 ( 1 in 2.5 ) 0.4 1.2
4 1 in 5 0.2 0.8
5 1 in 15 0.0666667 0.333333
Totals 1.000000 3.0
Contribution = “ Multiple ” times “ Probability ”
1.0 has to be subtracted from this 3.0 because you would win “ 1 unit ” of the sub prizes just from your simple ticket purchase .
This leaves a “ bonus contribution multiplier ” of just 2.0 .
Thus we have calculated that the average multiplier is 2.0 .
We then multiply the average extra expected return for all the sub-prizes ( previously calculated ) by this 2.0 to get the expected return if you buy the “ Megaplier ” option .
( 0.0793 + 0.0107 + 0.0129 + 0.0137 + 0.0165 + 0.0144 + 0.0448 + 0.0546 = 0.24698 ) x 2.0 = $ 0.494
Thus if you pay another $ 1.00 to buy the Megaplier option , your expected before tax return is $ 0.494 .
( The after tax return would be less than this . )
Just the Jackpot
The new version of Mega Millions provides still another way to play the game .
You can pay $ 3 for 2 quick picks that only participate in the Jackpot prize .
( You do n't have to worry about matching any of the other combinations . )
If there is an advertised Jackpot of $ 1 billion then the cash value of the Jackpot is about $ 500 million .
If there are 500,000 tickets in play , the expected before tax value of one ticket for just the Jackpot only is 0.808426 .
However you get 2 tickets which brings the expected value up to $ 1.616852 .
The bad news is that you paid $ 3 to get something worth $ 1.62 .
If you win , you will pay 40 % of your winnings back in taxes - which leaves an expected after tax value of $ 0.97 .
( And you paid $ 3 for this privilege . )
Percentile Expected Returns on Ticket Purchases
The average return per $ 2.00 ticket includes the extremely low probability that you might win a large prize – for example $ 10,000 or more .
As a practical matter , it is unlikely that you will ever buy enough tickets ( fork out enough money ) to ever have much of a chance for any of the large prizes .
Thus it is probable that all you will ever get back from your ticket purchases are piddling small amounts .
The percentages for these small amounts can be calculated .
The table below shows the percentage chances for various “ piddling returns ” .
If you spend $ 1,000 to buy 500 tickets ( = 1 ticket for each of 500 Mega Millions games = 1 ticket per Mega Millions game , 2 times a week for 4.8 years ) there is a :
49.79 % chance that you will get back $ 64 or less
58.41 % chance that you will get back $ 68 or less
69.82 % chance that you will get back $ 74 or less
78.81 % chance that you will get back $ 80 or less
89.56 % chance that you will get back $ 92 or less
94.96 % chance that you will get back $ 116 or less
98.04 % chance that you will get back $ 280 or less
99.02 % chance that you will get back $ 554 or less
99.52 % chance that you will get back $ 572 or less
99.90 % chance that you will get back $ 750 or less
Even if you buy 500 tickets , your chance of winning a $ 10,000 or larger prize is less than 1 chance in 1,000 .
2nd Thoughts
The 2015 fatality rate per 100 million Vehicle Miles Traveled in the U.S. was 1.12 .
Alternately , if you “ played ” Russian Roulette 100 times per day , every day for 83 years , with Mega Millions Jackpot odds , you would have better than a 99 % chance of surviving .
3rd Thoughts
A lottery is a “ Zero- sum game ” .
What one group of participants gains in cash , the other group of participants must lose .
If we made a list of all the participants in a lottery , it might include :
1 ) Federal Government ( Lottery winnings are taxable )
2 ) State Governments ( Again lottery winnings are taxable )
3 ) State Governments ( Direct share of lottery ticket sales )
4 ) Merchants that sell tickets ( Paid by the lottery organizers )
5 ) Lottery companies ( Hint : They are not doing all this for free )
6 ) Advertisers and promoters ( Paid by the lottery companies )
7 ) Lottery ticket buyers ( Buy lottery tickets and receive payouts )
The winners in the above list are :
1 ) Federal Government
2 ) State Government ( Taxes )
3 ) State Government ( Direct share )
4 ) Merchants that sell tickets
5 ) Lottery companies
6 ) Advertisers and promoters
And the losers are :
( Mathematically challenged and proud of it )
The 2015 fatality rate per 100 million Vehicle Miles Traveled in the U.S. was 1.12 .
https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812318 .
If you drive one mile to the store to buy your Mega Millions ticket and then return home , you have driven two miles .
Thus the probability that you will join this statistical group is 2 x 1.12 / 100,000,000 = 0.0000000224 fatalities per vehicle mile .
This can also be stated as “ One chance in 44,642,857 ” .
Thus , if you drive one mile to ( and return from ) the store to buy your Mega Million ticket , your chance of being killed ( or killing someone else ) is nearly 7 times greater than the chance that you will win the Mega Millions Jackpot .
Alternately , if you “ played ” Russian Roulette 100 times per day , every day for 83 years , with Mega Millions Jackpot odds , you would have better than a 99 % chance of surviving .

Poor history teachers .
Rarely a week goes by without a debate on how schoolchildren should be learning about the past .
Here , historian Margaret Macmillan shows how subjective history can be , by presenting four versions of the past 450 years .
History is the past so therefore it cannot change .
Wrong , quite wrong .
History has changed , is changing now , and will continue to change .
We find out new things all the time .
Archaeologists are sifting through gardens and rubbish dumps to find out what people who are long dead grew and ate ; archivists turn up bundles of long forgotten papers or families root through their attics .
We start with facts and solid objects , of course , but in writing history we move beyond them very quickly .
Looking at the events of our own time , we do so through a variety of lenses - liberal , conservative , radical , religious , feminist .
We do the same with the past .
So let 's take one important period in British history and see how historians might tell the story in different ways without , of course , getting the facts wrong .
See if you can guess what the viewpoints are in each version .
RISE AND FALL OF AN EMPIRE
The golden age of the Tudors brought unity to a divided England and peace with Scotland .
The arts flourished - Shakespeare , Holbein , Purcell - and reflected the vigour and pride of a bold and brave people .
Henry VIII stood up to Rome and his glorious daughter Elizabeth saw off the might of the Spanish empire .
English seafarers roamed the world , discovering new routes and laying the foundations for the British Empire .
Monarchy was restored by Charles II While the 17th Century brought civil war , peace came again with Charles II who wisely decided to compromise with Parliament .
In the 18th and 19th Centuries Britain , safe behind its navy , grew powerful and prosperous .
Its manufactures flooded the world , its money built railways and ports across the globe , and its empire brought peace and prosperity to millions of Asians and Africans .
In the 20th Century , though , Britain exhausted itself standing up to the threats from the Continent , first from the Kaiser in the 1914 - 1918 war and then in the even more deadly struggle against the dictators .
Its empire crumbled and by the end of the century Britain was again a small power .
Yet its institutions , even its fashions , remain models for much of the world .
That was the standard viewpoint , seeing history as a glorious story .
Next is ...
CLASS EXPLOITATION
History is driven by economic forces not made by individuals .
At the start of our period , England was dominated by a feudal aristocracy whose wealth and power rested on ownership of land .
The Tudors gradually brought the great lords under control and allowed a merchant class to grow .
The Elizabethan explorers were driven by their search for profits and that was to remain the guiding motive for the creation of the Empire .
Even Henry VIII 's break with Rome was about wealth , not religion : he and his supporters wanted to get their hands on the Church 's enormous wealth .
The world wars of the 20th Century were largely about economic mastery of the globe
By the 17th Century , the growing middle - class was chafing under monarchical and aristocratic rule : that 's what the Civil War was about .
The triumph of Parliament was a victory for the middle classes which took support from the farmers and workers and then turned around and betrayed them .
Although the 18th Century saw the renewed dominance of the landed aristocracy , by the 19th Century Britain was changing fast .
The great growth of industry produced hugely powerful industrialists and a large middle class who mercilessly exploited the working classes .
Although the workers reacted by organizing themselves and might one day have seized power in a revolution , they were bought off by increased wages and benefits , largely financed by Britain 's ruthless exploitation of its Empire .
The world wars of the 20th Century were largely about economic mastery of the globe .
Britain may have defeated Germany but in the end it could not withstand the challenge from the new capitalist superpower , the United States .
That was according to the Marxists , who put economics at the centre of the story .
Now who 's speaking ?
A TERRIBLE HUMAN COST
Life for the ordinary English man and woman for the past centuries was miserable and short .
Until the middle of the 19th Century , life expectancy for the lower classes , most of them peasants but also artisans and small shopkeepers , was about 30 years .
Their children had little education and few chances to rise out of the class into which they were born .
They could not vote or hold office .
The courts existed to protect the propertied classes and punishments for even minor crimes were savage .
The Reformation was a mixed blessing for them .
On the one hand Protestantism brought the notion that every man - note not every woman - had the right to interpret the scriptures in his own way ; on other it brought the dissolution of the monasteries which , for all their faults , had provided a minimum of charity for the poor .
The industrial revolution spread from Britain to elsewhere
The results of the Industrial Revolution of the 19th Century were equally mixed .
Yes , it provided jobs in the new industries but at a terrible human cost .
Think of the descriptions in Dickens ' novels of the factories and slums of Victorian England .
Eventually a strong trade union movement brought political and social reforms but class still matters today when it comes to living standards and opportunities .
Yet we should not write off the lives of the lower classes as impoverished in all senses ; they had rich traditions and culture , folk wisdom , and strong social institutions which have helped them to survive .
That was a social interpretation of the period , that looks at what happened to the poor and the powerless .
Next ...
LATIN AND GREEK SCHOLARS
Women 's voices from the past are sometimes hard to hear because they were part of a patriarchal society in which power and property and authority were the preserve of men .
We know something about elite women in the Tudor period .
It was possible , as it had always been , for such women to gain power and influence through men .
The Renaissance also brought with it the idea that education , at least some education , was desirable in a woman .
Elizabeth I or Lady Jane Grey knew the Latin and Greek classics that had been rediscovered .
For women lower down the social ladder , we must read between the lines , in wills for example or by looking at illustrations , to discover that women often shared in the work of their husbands in the small crafts or in the fields .
It was not until the Enlightenment of the 18th Century that women started to claim their share of the human rights that were being talked about .
The great changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution opened up new jobs for lower - class women as they did for men but women of the middle and upper classes largely remained confined to their roles as wives and mothers .
The pill finally gave women control over their own bodies
A few pioneering women such as Florence Nightingale forced their way into the professions and the universities .
By the 20th Century , women were organizing themselves to demand their independence from social and legal restrictions .
The two World Wars , when women 's contributions to the struggle were essential , helped to bring change to a male - dominated society .
After 1945 , the development of new methods of contraception , most notably the pill , finally gave women control over their own bodies and liberated them from the fear of unwanted pregnancies .
Guess what ?
That was the feminist view .
WHICH VIEWPOINT IS BEST ?
It would be easy to write other perspectives : a history of beliefs as Britain moved from a religious age to a secular one ; of the gradual triumph of Parliamentary democracy ( actually these days perhaps not so easy ) ; or from a scientific perspective showing the change from the time when we believed that the sun went around the earth to the decoding of the genome .
We could even focus on something like food , and show the roast beef and beer of " Merrie England " evolving into the hummus and chardonnay of today .
None of these perspectives is wrong , but on their own they give only a limited view of a much more complicated past .
You can legitimately write histories of a particular aspect of the past as long as you are clear that that is what you are doing .
Where I have trouble is with mono - causal overviews of the past or single explanations for a period or for change .
I think you can write good general histories of , say , 20th Century Britain , in which you try and give as complete a picture of it , from high politics to fashion .
Such histories have been written and written well by , for example , Peter Clark in Hope and Glory .
You get the portrait of an age in the round .
History is always changing its shape and that is why it is endlessly fascinating .
Margaret Macmillan is a professor of history at the University of Oxford .
She is also author of The Uses and Abuses of History , published by Profile Books .
Below is a selection of your comments .
The " spin " on history depends on who wins .
If the Battle of Bosworth had gone the other way , schoolchildren would now be reading about the kind , handsome , straight backed Richard Third .
Even Winston Churchill said " history will be kind to me , for I will write the history books . "
Bill Walker , Portsmouth
It 's very true , we learnt a narrow version of history at school , all those years ago , it 's so much more realistic to see history from lots of points of view .
We 're always learning , hopefully .
Rosy in Oz , Kempsey Australia
A very good article that for me reinforces the virtue and value of teaching history as more than a catalogue of mere dates , battles , and so called " important persons . "
There is no richer subject for human learning than history .
Using it as a foundation , all other disciplines may be taught with greater effect , for is it not so that all disciplines have a history and a record of there development which constitutes the body of their knowledge ?
In addition , history , no matter what your point of view about it , is also the ideal medium to teach writing and good communication .
It is no wonder the Greeks and Romans held it in high regard .
Would that we could do that same .
George Ewert , Desert Hot Springs , California , USA
History changes in that history is our understanding of the past .
Also , Margaret Macmillan is trying to show four viewpoints that some people hold .
Nowhere does she claim that these are the only viewpoints that exist or , regarding the anglo - centric - ness , that any of them are her own .
Natalie , Michigan , USA ' History ' , as many percieve it , does not exist , what most of us regard as history is rather the fragments of the past that still exist .
There is no definitive truth , there is no ' historical fact ' , every piece of evidence we base our understanding on is subject to the bias of its author and our own understanding .
These different ' viewpoints ' simply choose to focus on certain aspects of the past as we know it , often ignoring evidence which is contrary to their own opinion .
History by definition , is a perception .
As a Professor of History at Oxford I am sure that Margaret is fully aware of all of this .
Of course Margaret writes from an English perspective , she is ( I assume ) English , how could she write from any other viewpoint ?
Dave , Canterbury Fascinating reading .
I was taught the standard viewpoint at school and am reminded of why I dropped history as soon as possible .
I have since gone on to discover real history - i.e. history written by individuals rather than brainwash created by state committees .
I sincerely hope history teaching in the UK has diversified and moved on from the drivel I was the recipient of in the 70s and early 80s .
J Bro , Bangkok , Thailand " The peril is in the absolute banning of a version " ( thanks Bruce ) , but also in offering to students one monolothic version .
Probably the most important thing about history is for students to understand how it is constructed .
This does not entail , as some misguided people think , that just any history will do .
Not at all .
The construction has to pass many " tests " regarding the amount , kind and weight of evidence in its favour , in order for the historical community to pay any real attention to it .
In this sense , its just as if not more important for students to understand history as historiography as it is for them to know what it is that happened in the past .
Mimi Bick , Santiago , Chile
As a social studies teacher , I 've always stressed that you cannot get a balanced view of any subject simply by referring to one source .
I encourage my students to find different viewpoints on any subject they 're looking at - any individual work will always have its inherent biases .
The same holds true not just of history , but of everything in life - a case in point is the history currently being written in the Middle East , or any modern political crisis .
You can not get a clear view of the real world if you are shackled to viewing it through only one commentator 's viewpoint .
It 's like the old axiom " question everything " .
If someone tells you that one view is the truth , find out what others have to say about the same subject .
Tom , Christchurch , NZ History has always been written by the winners .
What is the difference between the French Resistance in WW2 and the Insurgents in Iraq ?
they are / were both fighting the foreigners who invaded their country .
Mike , Carleton Place , Ontario , Canada
This underlines the value of history : teaching invaluable skills of interpretation / analysis .
As far as I am aware , history teachers do n't teach any prescribed version of history in schools today .
Children use sources and are encouraged to draw their own conclusions .
History is a matter of individual perspective .
Suhayl , London Could n't one argue that as there is no way of proving any historical truth outside of ' text ' that all of these viewpoints are nothing more than narratives ?
Is n't it fascinating how all points of ' proof ' in this article are taken as historical truths without question ?
If anything , surely historians must remember to question not only their viewpoint on the past , but also their basis for proving it .
Mark Hurst , Leicester I may be old - fashioned but only the first version gives a narrative of events which provides a context allows the remaining aspects of history to be understood .
I learned history in the late 50's / Early 60's but even though our history was closest to the first version we studied events as diverse as the Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601 ( still the foundation of the law relating to Charities today ) and the great Chartist movement , Peterloo , the foundation of the Co-operatives .
It is too easy and glib to write off the traditionalist approach to history as our glorious past - it may been true in Victorian times but in the living memory of any person reading this story , yet it is used as a pretext to teach history empathetically so that a generation is growing up who have no clear idea of how we got to where we are today - and we should all be aware of what happens to those who ignore the lessons of history ...
Paul Soper , London , UK Margaret started off in great style and I thought ; now we 're going to get it 'as it was ' .
Not so !
She fell into the trap that most writers of history do do - she named the piece '
Four takes on British History then completely ignored the contributions or otherwise made by the other partners in the ' United Kingdoms ' and we ended - up with ' Britain from the view - point of the English ' .
Good , but not good enough !
Jim Currie , Funchal , Portugal Interesting article - but the " social interpretation " makes a blunder , repeating the idea that life expectancy in earlier times was only 30 years or so .
Technically true - but numbers like this come about only because the very high infant and childhood mortality rate brings down the average .
If you survived your first 5 years you stood a good chance of living until you were 60 or 70 , except in times of famine , plague , etc .
The idea that medieval people were " old at 30 " is nonsense .
Many died before they were 20 , but once past that milestone they stood a good chance of living until what even we today would consider an old age .
Adrian Dunn , Worcester , UK
This is something I have understood for a very long time and it is great to see it put so well in writing .
This applies to everything that is depicted by a persons ' story of an event or time .
As individuals we would all tell a different story of the same event , whether it be because of different experiences or because of personal beliefs .
Perhaps people who believe so strongly and aggressively about things they have learnt about our past and present history may give them something to think about before making such an ill formed judgment of ' our world ' .
Sally - Anne Gates , Swansea
One perspective I would like to see is from the perspective of slavery .
There have been recent noises regarding apologies about slavery and how terrible it was but never seen in the context of the people responsible for it .
Why for instance is Queen Elizabeth the first known as the virgin queen and not the mother of the African slave trade in this country ?
It seems normal for Hitler and Stalin to be mentioned inseparably from their crimes against humanity .
Why does that not happen with out historical " heroes " .
Duncan , London , UK Hmmm ... an article about " British " History which is entirely anglo - centric ?
I wish I could say I was surprised .
Duncan Kennedy , Inverness , Scotland
In none of those " alternatives " did history change .
So I challenge the notion that " history is changing all the time " .
All you have done is change the viewpoint to give a different narrative , all of which are valid .
You could have written a " fashion viewpoint " or a " sports viewpoint " but history wont have changed .
John , Epsom Margaret ,
Do you know why there is very little teaching , if any , on Celtic history in the school syllabus ?
Given that the name Great Britain itself is a translation of ' large Britain ' from the time of the Celts it is an astonishing omission and a considerable insult to exclude this whole period ( which is much longer in duration that the history which is currently taught ) .
The negative PR campaign by Roman historians to belittle the Celtic culture , which in many ways was far more civilised than that of their own ( respect for women , elderly , young ; devolved power structure , road construction , gold mining ) and relative lack of documents are not sufficient excuses .
How about batting for the home side ?
David Navas , London , England I 'm surprised that Margaret Macmillan has made such a fundamental error .
Of course history does not change .
It is our knowledge and interpretation of it that changes as new facts emerge .
Phil , Portsmouth
All versions should be taught ( perhaps in a fashion not quite so biased as each of these are ) .
The peril is in the absolute banning of a version .
Adults and children must be given the opportunity to see the past from various angles to be able to generate a full view , and to develop ideas for the future .

AS TIBETANS around the world this week marked the advent of the new year of the Earth Ox , many did so in a spirit of mourning rather than jubilation .
The festival fell just before a bloodstained anniversary season : 50 years since the Chinese suppression of an uprising that saw the Dalai Lama , their spiritual leader , flee into exile in India with some 100,000 followers ; 20 years since protests that led to the imposition of martial law in the capital , Lhasa ; one year since ugly and murderous anti-Chinese riots in Lhasa that brought a sharp and lasting security backlash .
The fact that so many troops are still needed , merely to prevent commemorative protests , suggests that China 's Tibet policy is in need of an overhaul .
China 's officials seem to be contemplating nothing of the sort .
Indeed , they may believe things are going their way .
A year ago Tibet seemed a real threat to China 's hopes of presenting the Beijing Olympics as an unblemished celebration of its achievements .
As the Olympic torch was carried round the world , it was met from London to Delhi by protests against Chinese rule in Tibet .
Yet the Olympics themselves passed with no serious protest or international boycott .
Since then Tibet has slipped down the international agenda .
In her first overseas visit as secretary of state , Hillary Clinton recently stopped in Beijing to beseech China 's co-operation in fixing the world economy and stopping the planet from frying .
In the apparent belief that China , oddly , will not pursue such aims out of its own self - interest , she forbore from harping on issues such as human rights and Tibet .
Chinese diplomats , meanwhile , are cock - a- hoop at a concession they wrung last October from Britain , whose government had hitherto been the only one not formally to recognise China 's “ sovereignty ” in Tibet , accepting instead only its “ suzerainty ” ( ie , de facto control ) over the region .
Apparently unaware of the importance of the issue to both China and exiled Tibetans , Britain changed policy in a bland and obscure statement published on the internet .
At talks with the Dalai Lama 's representatives in Beijing the following week , China , perhaps not coincidentally , hardened its position even further .
The talks , in which China has never appeared sincere in offering any compromise to the exiles , now seem more futile than ever .
Himalayan clouds
Yet the refusal to talk to the Dalai Lama comes at a cost .
This week , in both what China misleadingly calls the “ Tibet Autonomous Region ” and in adjoining provinces , security has been intense ( see article ) .
Foreigners have been kept out .
Tibet has been closed .
China can easily quash any protests by those foolhardy enough to mount them .
But repression is hardly the way a successful , modern power wants to govern .
In 1959 the Dalai Lama 's escape from his homeland produced a myth : that he had conjured up a belt of cloud to hide his retinue from the Chinese air force .
At the time , The Economist scoffed at this ( see article ) .
“ The real cloud ” , we argued , “ was evidently the unity of the Tibetan people in their hatred of Chinese military rule . ”
Sadly , despite all the economic advances , despite the easing of Chinese policy after the Cultural Revolution , and despite ( indeed , because of ) the influx of Han Chinese into Tibet , that assessment remains largely true today .
Sadly , too , the Chinese explanation for unrest remains unchanged : in 1959 , as now , it was blamed on a “ few reactionaries manipulated by foreign powers ” .
The chief reactionary , of course , is the Dalai Lama himself , whom China still vilifies .
It seems to believe that its Tibet problem will be solved with his passing .
In fact , it is more likely to worsen .
The Dalai Lama , unlike many of his followers both in Tibet and in a remarkably cohesive exiled population , accepts Chinese rule .
He demands merely that “ autonomy ” should have substance .
And for all China 's accusations against him , he has never wavered in his insistence that his followers pursue their aims peacefully .
China may one day come to regret spurning his moderating influence .

AFTER almost a fortnight of high alert and a five - day shutdown of ghostly calm , Mexico City this week began gingerly to return to its normal metropolitan bustle .
Fears that swine flu might be a deadly epidemic have subsided : testing has shown that it was responsible for fewer than 50 of the 159 deaths that it was reported to have caused in Mexico .
So far it seems to be barely more contagious than normal influenza , and is treatable with antiviral drugs .
On May 6th Mexico City 's municipal government lifted a weeklong ban on restaurants seating customers .
The national government allowed universities , high schools , churches and museums to reopen from the following day , while primary schools will do so on May 11th .
Mexicans are dispensing with their face masks , and breathing a sigh of relief .
As they do so an inquest is starting into the authorities ' handling of what has turned out thus far to be a fairly mild bug .
To some , the official reaction was both tardy and excessive .
The first patient known to have had swine flu , Édgar Hernández , a small boy in a village in the eastern state of Veracruz , saw a doctor on April 2nd .
The first confirmed death — Adela María Gutiérrez , a 39 - year - old woman in the southern state of Oaxaca — occurred on April 13th .
But the authorities did not send samples abroad for genomic analysis , the process that eventually identified the new virus , until April 22nd .
They did not acquire the technology to test for themselves for another week .
“ They should have analysed the samples immediately , ” says Laura Moreno Altamirano , a professor of public health at the National Autonomous University of Mexico .
“ Then they would have known that the virus was n't so aggressive , and they would n't have had to implement all these measures . ”
Those measures included closing schools , football stadiums , gyms , cinemas , bars and nightclubs ; cancelling concerts , plays , festivals and church services ; limiting restaurant services to takeaway and delivery ; and augmenting a public holiday by a day to create the five - day shutdown .
This shutdown hit the economy hard .
Because of its close links with America 's economy , and especially its crippled car industry , Mexico had already slid into a deep and worsening recession .
In February output shrank by 10.8 % compared with the same month last year , the worst number since these figures began to be collected in 1993 .
Agustín Carstens , the finance minister , said that the swine - flu outbreak will lop an extra 0.3 % from GDP this year .
Some private estimates are much higher .
The government has announced $ 1.3 billion in tax breaks and spending to help offset these losses , which will be financed with borrowing .
But the damage to Mexico 's image abroad , and therefore to its tourism industry and food exports , may be long - lasting .
Hotel occupancy has fallen to single digits .
Several airlines have stopped flying to the country .
Eight countries , including China and Russia , have banned some Mexican farm products .
( China this week allowed a plane chartered by the Mexican government to pick up 71 Mexican citizens whom it had quarantined , although they had no flu symptoms . )
The episode has also exposed inequalities in Mexico 's health services .
Many patients , particularly those in poor rural areas , receive dubious care or no care at all .
Poorer people often prefer to buy drugs at a pharmacy instead of losing a day's work dealing with the public - health bureaucracy , says Verónica Baz of CIDAC , a think - tank in Mexico City .
Local media reported several cases of ambulance drivers refusing to transport patients , and of hospitals lacking antiviral drugs .
Rogelio Pérez Padilla , the director of the National Institute for Respiratory Diseases , admits there were “ time lapses in distribution ” from the government 's strategic reserve of 1.8 m doses .
But in a big developing country of 110 m people , “ some delays were to be expected , ” he said .
The critics , of course , enjoy perfect hindsight .
Miguel Ángel Lezana , the government 's chief epidemiologist , notes that between 1,500 and 1,800 Mexicans typically die of flu each year during March and April .
There was no reason to suspect a new virus , he says , until a spike in cases among the young and healthy appeared towards the end of the flu season in early April .
The subsequent fall in the number of cases is because of the government 's decisive action to impede the spread of the infection , according to José Ángel Córdova , the health minister .
Public opinion seems to agree .
Polls show that around 70 % of respondents approve of President Felipe Calderón 's handling of the swine - flu outbreak and of his overall performance .
His government will soon be held to account , in a mid-term Congressional election on July 5th .
The sickly economy , and doubts about whether Mr Calderón is winning a battle to tame violent drug - trafficking gangs , have given the opposition plenty of ammunition .
But the polls show his conservative National Action Party starting to cut what was a double - digit lead for the formerly ruling , centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party to around five points .
It is a Mexican instinct to rally round the leader at a time of trial .
As normality returns , Mr Calderón will have to persuade his people that his government 's actions saved lives .

The Palestinians get up Lieberman 's nose
A BILL to outlaw expressions of grief or mourning on the anniversary of Israel 's independence is unlikely , in the end , to get onto Israel 's statute book .
Even if it did , it would probably be struck down by the Supreme Court .
Still , the bill 's endorsement on May 24th by the cabinet committee on legislation sent a shudder through liberal circles in the Jewish state — and appalled Palestinians everywhere .
For it was a sign that the anti-Arab campaign of the new foreign minister , Avigdor Lieberman , earlier this year was not just electoral hype .
“ This is a Zionist and patriotic bill , ” said Alex Miller , a parliamentarian in Mr Lieberman 's party , who submitted it .
Palestinian Israelis who mark Israel 's independence day as their people 's nakba ( catastrophe ) “ exploit the democratic and enlightened character of the State of Israel in order to destroy it from within ” — and would be punishable under the bill by up to three years in prison .
Next on the agenda of Mr Lieberman 's party , Yisrael Beitenu ( Israel Our Home ) , is a “ loyalty law ” to require an oath of allegiance to the state on pain of forfeiting citizenship , or , in a less draconian version , welfare benefits .
This , too , is aimed at citizens of Arab origin who make up a fifth of Israel 's 7 m people .
Yisrael Beitenu 's success in the election in February , when it came third with 15 of the parliament 's 120 seats , made Mr Lieberman the kingmaker .
Tzipi Livni , leader of the centre - left Kadima party , which won most seats but struggled in vain to form a ruling coalition , wooed him assiduously , turning a blind eye to his views on human rights but making much of his acceptance of a two - state solution for Israel and Palestine .
But Mr Lieberman plumped for his “ natural allies ” such as Binyamin Netanyahu 's Likud on the hard right .
As Mr Netanyahu 's foreign minister , Mr Lieberman now plays down his previous acceptance of the two states , which the prime minister balks at .
Opponents of the Palestinian state have joined Mr Lieberman 's cohorts in defending the nakba bill .
“ In this Knesset [ parliament ] ” , observes a veteran Arab - Israeli member , Ahmad Tibi , “ anything that 's anti-Arab can pass , even if it says the sun rises in the west . ”
As if to prove his point , on May 27th a private member 's bill was passed at a preliminary reading to make it a crime to publish opposition to Israel 's existence as a Jewish and democratic state , if such publication is likely to lead to “ acts of hatred or contempt or disloyalty to the state . ”
But the Labour party , Mr Netanyahu 's junior coalition partner , says it will leave the government unless the nakba bill is withdrawn .
Three of Mr Netanyahu 's ministers oppose it .
It may yet be buried .
Having won re-election amid allegations of fraud , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad yesterday tried to show that he also controlled the streets where the Khomeinist regime first seized power in the 1979 revolution .
The show was less than impressive .
Despite efforts by the Ansar Hezbollah ( Militants of the Party of God ) and security services to manufacture a large crowd , the massive Maydan Vali-Asr ( Hidden Imam Square ) was unfilled .
The official news agency put the number at " several hundred thousands " while eyewitnesses ...
This may come as a surprise , but I will today write about a programming language for which no Free Software implementation exists , the J programming language .
J does not stand for the J dirty word ( Java ) , but is the full name of the language .
I first heard about J while solving some problems on the Project Euler challenge .
One of the problems to be solved was “ given that C( n , p ) is the number of ways to take p items amongst m items , find the number of C( n , p ) greater than one million for n between 1 and 100 inclusive . ”
This was a very easy problem .
I coded my solution using Python and , out of curiosity , looked at how other people did it .
I saw someone mentionning its J solution :
+/1e6<,!/~>:i.100
Wow , 17 characters !
As I was in disbelief , I gave it a try and installed a copy of J on my GNU / Linux laptop .
I cut and pasted the expression , and it gave me 4075 , the expected solution .
Let me describe how it works .
First of all , expressions are evaluated from right to left .
i.100
will generate a list of all integers from 0 to 99 ( the 100 first non-negative integers ) .
Then , the increment operator is used , so the part
>:i.100
leads to the list of numbers from 1 to 100 .
The rank of the increment operator is zero , which means that it operates on individual items , not on lists .
Since we give it a list as argument , each member of the list will be incremented , and give the new 1 to 100 list .
The C(n , p ) operator in J is written as
p ! n
However , we want to apply it for every p and n in 1 to 100 .
The tilde ( ~ ) modifier means that we want the left argument of the !
function to be the same as the right argument .
The slash ( / ) modifier means that we want to build a table .
Without it , the !
operator would be applied to the first item of the left argument and the first item of the right argument , then to the second item of the left argument and the second item of the right argument and so on .
Here , it is applied to every combination of its left and right arguments , meaning that the result is a 100x100 table :
!/~>:i.100
Now , the coma ( , ) transforms the 100x100 table into a 10000 elements flat list :
,!/~>:i.100
Now , we want to select all the elements greater than one million .
For that , we will compare each element to 1e6 ( one million in scientific notation ) .
Since the left argument is a plain number and the right argument is a list ( the 10000 long list we obtained ) , the result will be a 10000 items list containing either 0 ( false ) or 1 ( true ) :
1e6<,!/~>:i.100
Ok , so we now have a 10000 items list containing 0 ( smaller than one million ) or one ( greater than one million ) .
To find out the number of ones , we only have to sum up the items .
Using the plus (+ ) operator and the slash ( / ) modifier , an addition will be inserted between every item of the list :
+/1e6<,!/~>:i.100
That ’s it .
To the computer literate people , it looks a lot like APL without the special characters and the need for a special keyboard .
No surprise , J and APL have both been designed by Kenneth E. Iverson .
J is very efficient while working on large sets of data .
Its table operator and its rank analysis almost entirely obviates the need for explicit loops .
For example , if you want to multiply the 100 first prime numbers , you can use the p : operator which returns the n-th prime number ( starting with 0 , which returns 2 , 1 returns 3 , 2 returns 5 , 3 returns 7 and so on ) :
*/p:i.100x
Team Fortress 2 has already been on the market for 18 months , but the multiplayer shooter from Valve Software did n’t reach the peak of its popularity until last weekend — thanks in part to this month ’s release of Meet the Spy , the latest in a series of machinima shorts Valve produces to introduce the game ’s characters .
Up until last week , Valve ’s director of business development , Jason Holtman , told me in a conference call , TF2 was hitting maximum concurrency numbers of 32,000 players ; over Memorial Day weekend , however , that more than doubled to 68,000 .
( The single best sales day was also last weekend . )
Like the game itself , Valve ’s video series is a clever reworking of traditional first - person shooter conventions , eschewing realistic violence and macho fantasy for cartoonish graphics and ironic wit .
( In Meet the Sniper , TF2 ’s ruthless Aussie marksman gets flustered by his disapproving parents . )
Meet the Spy is by far the most ambitious installment , depicting a trio of befuddled squaddies who try to locate an enemy agent in their midst , only to be undone by comic mishap and a surprisingly romantic plot twist .
The series was originally based on monologues that Valve writer Erik Wolpaw drafted for internal use , first as audition scripts , then as a reference guide for the voice actors ultimately hired to record the in - game dialog .
According to editor and director Marc Scapparo , the plan was always to evolve these movies over successive installments , from mere character sketches to full - fledged shorts .
Working with a Wolpaw script , Scapparo and his team spent a month capturing in - game footage for Spy , then another month enhancing it in post - production .
As with Valve ’s games , the video was constantly screened to test audiences , and iterated according to their feedback .
In the original version , for example , the Red spy was unmasked as the Blue spy , which confused many early viewers , especially those not familiar with the game — sending the team back to the studio for a story overhaul .
“ Humor ’s pretty subjective , ” as Wolpaw put it to me .
“ [ But ] if someone does n’t understand what they saw , that ’s a pretty objective [ problem ] . ”
While Meet the Spy was just a single element in the promotion of Team Fortress 2 ’s latest update , it ’s certainly one of the most buzzed about .
TF2 lead developer Robin Walker partly attributes this popularity to the fact that Scapparo and Wolpaw are members of the game ’s development team , not external marketers .
In the Valve development philosophy , he said , “ marketing is a game design problem . ”
Then there ’s the buzz you get from unauthorized distribution :
Though it was officially put on Steam , Valve ’s online distribution service , on May 19 , a leaked copy had already been uploaded dozens of times and seen by countless gamers days earlier .
Denying persistent Internet rumors to the contrary , Walker told me the video was not intentionally leaked by the company .
However , he added , “ We regard [ the leak ] as an unbridled success , ” pointing to the additional burst of press it provoked .
The developers even added a last - minute knowing wink to the final product .
If you look carefully at the alarm system in the beginning , the “ Intruder Alert ” signal sits alongside a new warning message : “ Leaked Video . ”

I am an amateur beekeeper .
Since discovering the incredible intricacies of their lives and habits , I have been doing a lot of reading and question asking .
Particularly , I have been looking at Colony Collapse Disorder ( CCD ) .
Varroa mites are neither new or especially more prevalent lately .
In countries that have had them for many years , they have never been a colony threatening problem -- more an annoyance , from all the data I could find .
New Zealand had an outbreak , but seems to have eradicated it now .
Even when the mites were found , we did NOT have massive bee deaths .
Now I find that rather strange , if Varroa was the sole cause , there should have been issues .
I read that Bayer is being taken to court in the EU , over selling chemicals that they knew were harmful to bees and bats (! ) which are also dying in masses in the US .
hmm ?
Also affected are small vertebrates ( mice , voles and whatever other native fauna eat the bugs ) .
I believe that the GM pollens combined with physically affecting pesticides , allows the Varroa mite to prey more heavily on already weakened bees .
Recently , last autumn , just before the moratorium on GM crops was supposed to come up for discussion , in Victoria , Australia , it was lifted without public assent , and done very quickly by the state government .
Suspiciously so , I believe .
Western Australia followed suit recently also .
The 258 GM R/R Canola crops were dud :-)
The highest yield was , ( feel very free to laugh very loud ) 1 whole tonne per hectare !
[ hectare ( ha ) = 2.47 acres , or 10,000 square meters ]
Next best was 0.65 tonnes / ha .
Rather a low average indeed .
That aside , the Kool - Aid crew of farmers , who have seen and heard Moe Parr mr Murray and even Percy Schneider , and still (? ) think they know better , and that Monsanto and Dow always tell the truth ... are pushing to put in ten times the area of the same dud Canola , from 100 + growers in 285 sites , to 1,000 on heaven knows how many places .
The bees I am affiliated with are run on native trees , and occasionally on organic only orange trees .
Almonds , clovers and lucerne are n't so good for them ; too many pesticides are being used .
The keepers who are happy to lose bees to those issues can .
We wo n't .
Now , as we have no Varroa , and until recently had no GMO either , it will be of great interest to see if the bees on the canola areas begin to die off .
I firmly believe they will , and that maybe this fact would be enough to STOP GMO plants being further approved in my country , and hopefully elsewhere in the world too .
I am adding some info on the Bayer story , and the bats die off also .

What is the fastest RC aircraft ?
Amazingly , gliders .
The non-powered planes can , in skilled hands , whip up a speed of over 300 mph from a relatively slow wind .
That 's a velocity of around 8 x the speed of the air driving it .
It 's called Dynamic Soaring , or DS , and it requires some specific land and weather conditions , experience and the cojones to slice your precious RC plane through extreme wind shears .
If you have a long hill or ridge and the wind is hitting it at a right angle , the air that moves over the top causes an eddy on the leeward side , a steady , spinning whirlpool of air underneath the wind shooting over the ridge .
If you can hit it right , you can power the glider over the ridge and then dip it down into the torrent of air running in the opposite direction .
Flip the plane 180º , over and over , and you 'll build up speed .
The video above shows a glider clocking an astonishing 392 mph from a wind gusting to just 45 m ph .
Think of it as somewhere between surfing a big wave and pumping a skateboard around a half - pipe .
Of course , it 's not easy .
Bill Patterson , author of the rather splendid site DS Zone , was flying at a relatively sedentary 150 mph and " made the mistake of making too large of a correction while the plane was still in the boundary layer at the bottom , and the v-tail blew off . "
Go take a look at both his very clear Flash animation which explains just how this all works , and catch some of the videos of these gliders in action .
Even watching a little thumbnail QuickTime video will tighten your stomach in the same way as staring down a high , steep mountain precipice .

Tweney noted when he sent the link , " This is extremely cool . "

New South Wales police have laid charges against two men arrested in a major operation targeting the Hells Angels Bikie gang in Sydney today .
Police say they seized drugs , a Taser , knuckledusters , a baton , computers and financial documents when they searched 31 properties across Sydney at the same time yesterday morning .
They say they also seized a car linked to the fatal bikie brawl at Sydney Airport .
A clubhouse in Petersham was also searched and two men were arrested in Sydney 's west .
The men , aged 41 and 36 , have been granted bail and will face court accused of drug supply and possession .
The Commander of the Gang Squad , Mal Lanyon , says 260 officers from the state and national crime commissions and the police force were involved .
He says they are part of a cross - border investigation into the large - scale manufacture of amphetamines and ecstasy by the Hells Angels .
" We have targeted right across the whole outlaw motorcycle gang - every single rank has been targeted , " he said .
Police have warned today 's raids will lead to more arrests .
Meanwhile Premier Nathan
Rees says police are well advanced towards making their first application to have specific motorcycle gangs declared illegal criminal organisations .
His announcement comes as the Government is preparing to extend its month - old anti-bikie laws to make it an offence for declared gangs to recruit new members .
Mr Rees says police believe the motorcycle gangs have been drawing members from a number of lower - profile youth street gangs , including ' the Muslim Brotherhood movement ' and ' the Parra Boys ' .
" This new offence will help stamp out recruitment and poaching until the message finally sinks in : ' do n't join bikie gangs ' , " he said .
" We are deadly serious about cracking down on motorcycle gang - related crime .
" This is the second wave of laws in our drive to eliminate motorcycle gang violence in New South Wales . "
It feels like receiving unwrapped Christmas presents .
The PR and Marketing team of Geithner and Co. have been doing a good job disclosing Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœnon - publicÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ stress test data so far !
It seems that the grand total of $ 65 b is warranted .
Does this number take into account the conversion of preferred into common shares ?
If not , add another $ 70 b and the markets are still OK with this .
Perhaps its Trichet who will steal todayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s headlines .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s expected that the ECB will lower rates to 1 % and announce a lengthening of the maturity of its refinancing operations to one year .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s an innovative approach to pushing banks costs down and energizing the Euro - zones economy .
This would not be the quantitative approach that the BOE and FED are taking , but by attacking the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœroot of the causeÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ , it gives them a more transparent exit strategy unlike any others that have Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœNOTÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ been presented .
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 14 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in another Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
The surprises keep on coming , yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ADP print continues to signal that job losses remain Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœextraordinarilyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ high and at levels that Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœremain supportive of a deep recessionÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ ( - 491 k vs. - 645 k ) , but the surprising part is that the pace of deterioration has Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœsignificantly Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ improved .
Analysts agree that the lower than expected pace of job losses can be attributed to the broad based improvements that we have been witnessing of late .
Digging deeper , all of the sub-sectors ( small , medium and larger employers ) posted improvements , while both the goods and the service sectors recorded a slower pace of job elimination .
Even the revisions were on the positive side ( Mar. to - 708 k vs. - 742 k and Feb. - 681 k vs. - 706 k ) .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a step in the right direction and supports the renewed optimism theory of late .
However , there is a big Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœbutÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ that should be applied .
Firstly , the magnitude of the monthly losses is enormous and tomorrows NFP will be no exception .
Secondly , the market expects the pace of growth to be Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœveryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ slow hopefully starting later this year and finally , all this excess pool of labor will eventually pressurize Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœactualÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ wage levels and this must have an impact on growth , which will only compound the situation we now face .
The USD $ currently is higher against the EUR - 0.20 % , GBP - 0.13 % , CHF - 0.66 % and JPY - 0.87 % .
The commodity currencies are mixed this morning , CAD - 0.33 % and AUD +0.97 % .
Canadian data yesterday exceeded all expectations .
Albeit volatile data , it was a strong improvement m/m. Canadian building permits exploded to the upside in Apr. ( +23.5 % vs. +2.3 % ) .
Residential permits rose + 5.0 % , m / m ( the 1st - gain in 7 - months ) , with both single - family and multi-family intentions increasing .
However , the rise in non-residential permits ( +48 % m /m ) was the dominant variable , which can be attributed to the Federal stimulus effect that is lifting the institutional component ( Government and Educational buildings ) .
With both European equities and commodities outperforming yesterday the loonie managed to pare early morning losses on stress test headlines .
Like all risk related currencies , expect the loonie to seek guidance from Trichet communiquÃƒÂ© and the much anticipated stress test announcements this afternoon .
The currency rise has been fast and brutal over the last week , catching many investors off side .
Technically the move has been too swift despite what ever is revealed this week .
The market should expect a retracement back towards the 1.1850 level soon .
Perhaps tomorrowÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Canadian employment number will be the catalyst .
Everyone it seems is full of surprises .
The AUD managed to print a 7 - month high after Australian employers unexpectedly added workers last month and the jobless rate dropped ( +27.3 k , m / m and +5.4 % vs. +5.7 % ) .
Australian fundamentals have been strong going into this recession and now that global optimism is growing one should expect better buying of this risk currency on pull backs ( 0.7556 ) .
Crude is higher in the O/N session ( $ 57.62 up +128c ) .
Oil finally broke out of its stale trading range yesterday after both the API and EIA reports reveled that supplies of crude and gas are declining or are less than expected in the US , who happen to be the worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s largest consumer .
On Tuesday , API stated that crude inventories dropped by - 1 m barrels , and gas declined by - 2.9 m barrels last week .
Combine this with the surprising ADP jobs report and they have been able to give the black stuff another jolt .
YesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s EIA release was Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœbullishÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ in respect to the other reports of late .
Crude supplies rose +605 k barrels to +375.3 m last week ( a new 19 - year high ) , but less than the forecasted + 2.5 m gain .
This headline has been able to motivate the bulls once again .
Meanwhile gas supplies fell - 167 k to +212.4 m vs. a +500 k gain .
Distillate fuel ( heating oil and diesel ) , rose + 2.43 m barrels to +146.5 m , the highest print in 32 - months .
I am sure OPEC is breathing a sigh of relief , for the moment anyways .
Gold continues its rally as a safe heaven alternative ahead of any surprising non-leaked stress tests results ( $ 914 ) .
Analysts point to strong gold fundamentals that should push prices beyond their recent highs , as speculators believe that the worst of the global recession may be over .
The Nikkei closed 9,385 up +408 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,955 up +75 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,466 up +75 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s eased 5 bp yesterday ( 3.20 % ) and another 2 bp in the O/N session ( 3.22 % ) .
We are back to trading the supply and demand push - pull by the US government and the Fed .
The Fed continued its buy back program yesterday ( the 16th time of its $ 300 b program ) , concentrating on the shorter end of the curve in the morning , while later dealers managed to cheapen the curve as the market managed had to absorb another $ 22 b in the 10 - year bucket .
With the abundance of supply and the pickup in economic activity , dealers will not support the longer end of the curve .
Today we get another $ 14b of 7Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s .
How long will it be before we see 3.25 % for 10 Ã ¢â‚¬â „¢s ?

Hurry and make an offer :
The reclusive son of JRR Tolkien has broken his silence to admit fears that fans of his father 's work may be " put off " by the verse form of his latest posthumous publication .
Responding via fax to a series of questions about The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún , published for the first time today , Christopher Tolkien expressed the hope that it would show a different side to the author of the much - loved classic The Lord of the Rings .
The 500 - stanza poem is closely modelled on the Elder Edda , a collection of Norse myths preserved in a 13th - century manuscript , a pedigree Christopher Tolkien described as " unknown territory " for most people .
" I dare say that a good many will be instantly put off by the very idea of ' long narrative poems in verse ' and pursue it no further , " he said .
It was equally possible that their form will lend them an " unexpected impact , " he continued .
" My hope is that some of those who appreciate and admire the works of my father will find it illuminating in respect of Old Norse poetry in general , in his own treatment of the fierce , passionate and mysterious legend , and in this further and little known aspect of him as both philologist and poet .
Above all I hope they will take pleasure in this poetry . "
Christopher Tolkien , who as a child was paid two pence by his father for every mistake he could find in The Hobbit , and as an RAF pilot during the war contributed suggestions to the progress of The Lord of the Rings , worked from a manuscript which he believes his father wrote in the early 1930s .
JRR Tolkien taught Old Norse alongside Anglo - Saxon at Oxford university , giving lectures and classes on Norse language and literature for at least 13 years .
Telling in verse the story of Sigurd the Völsung and the fall of the Niflungs – also adapted by Wagner into the Ring cycle – The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún sees the hero Sigurd kill the dragon Fafnir ( a slaying which may have influenced Tolkien 's writing of Bilbo's encounter with Smaug in The Hobbit ) , take his gold and rescue the Valkyrie Brynhild from her imprisonment on a rock surrounded by fire .
Love , magic , jealousy , and , eventually , tragedy in the murder of Sigurd and the suicide of Brynhild ensue .
" My father left one manuscript , and that was complete ; there were no more than a few pages of earlier writings , and all other drafting has disappeared .
The manuscript is in good clear handwriting , written out without corrections , and obviously intended to be a final fair copy .
A few minor changes were made to it much later , " said Tolkien , who was appointed as his father 's literary executor and has over the past 36 years devoted himself to editing and publishing his father 's unpublished works , including The Silmarillion and a 12 - volume History of Middle - Earth .
" My ' editing ' consists very largely of explanation and clarification . "
Tolkien , 84 , has lived in France since 1975 , where wild rumours have suggested that he guards his property from obsessive fans of his father 's work with a wild boar – a canard he dismissed as nonsense .
" In the full form of the story I keep not one , but a whole troop of wild boars , expressly in order to chase off Tolkien fans who are imagined to lurk in the woods that surround my house , " he said .
" There are indeed many wild boars in these parts , but I do n't think they would be at all suitable as guardians even if I wanted them . "
Two years ago Tolkien completed and published his father 's unfinished tale of Middle - Earth The Children of Húrin , which went on to sell more than 1 m copies in English .
Speculating about what his father , who died in 1973 aged 81 , would have made of his immense popularity today – over 150 m copies of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings have sold worldwide – Tolkien said he " might have been in turns delighted , charmed , amused , puzzled , disquieted , baffled , indignant , but , finally , comprehensively astounded " .

A French official on Tuesday ruled out earlier reports that signals for the Air France flight 447 ’s black boxes have been detected .
Commander Christophe Prazuck told BBC Brasil that in the past days “ various signals have been detected by the French marine but none of which are from the black boxes . ”
Prazuck said many signals were detected but upon closer examination , investigators found that they do not belong to the Air France jet that crashed into the Atlantic on June 1 .
“ Till this moment , the black boxes have neither been detected nor found ” , the commander said .
The two recorders are essential to help determine what happened to the crashed jet that plunged into the ocean killing all 228 people on board .
The black boxes ' locator beacons , known as pingers , will emit signals for only another eight days .
After that , it could become impossible to locate the black box flight recorders and discover what happened to the Airbus A330 which crashed approximately four hours after taking off from Rio en route for Paris .
Searchers have been combing an area with a radius of 50 miles in the hope of detecting signals from the boxes that can be heard only up to about two miles .
The Airbus A330 plane fell into the Atlantic after running into thunderstorms en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris .

GOP Congressman Who Said Republicans Need To Be More Like the Taliban Now Says Obama Causing Unemployment On Purpose

BBC News , Darfur
Many have sought refuge in camps around Al - Fashir Two months after key international aid agencies were expelled from Sudan , the UN is cautiously optimistic about the humanitarian situation in Darfur .
Visiting the region , the UN 's emergency relief co-ordinator said there was no hard evidence that more people had died because of the disrupted aid effort .
However , John Holmes said the situation remained fragile .
In March , 13 foreign aid agencies were expelled after Sudan 's President Omar al - Bashir , was indicted for war crimes .
No one is claiming that Darfur is on the mend .
As we arrived in the middle of a sandstorm at a makeshift camp outside the town of al - Fasher , a lorry packed with fleeing civilians drove in .
Most of the life - saving gaps have been met
John Holmes
Some optimism from UN expert
The families onboard spoke of heavy fighting nearby in the past few days .
Some 40,000 people have sought refuge in the camp this year alone .
But John Holmes , the UN 's senior humanitarian official , was keen to point out that , despite the recent expulsion of key international aid agencies , the humanitarian situation had not deteriorated as dramatically as many had feared .
The UN and the Sudanese government have filled many gaps .
Mr Holmes said there was " no hard evidence " that anyone had died because of the expulsion of aid agencies .
" I think most of the life - saving gaps have been met but of course some services have been reduced in some places so you can't exclude that there have been extra deaths .
But we have no evidence of that at the moment , " Mr Holmes told the BBC .
Unpredictable
The dramatic expulsion of 13 foreign aid agencies followed the announcement that Sudan 's president was being indicted by the International Criminal Court .
The impact in Darfur has been serious .
But Mr Holmes said that recently there had been signs of much greater flexibility from the Sudanese authorities .
Privately , other UN officials went further , arguing that the operating environment had actually improved , and welcoming the fact that the Sudanese government was being forced to take more of a role in the relief effort .
Still , Darfur remains a dangerously unpredictable place - plagued by conflict , with no comprehensive peace deal in sight , and with a third of the population unable to go home .

Holding a PSP
Go , it 's hard not to fall in love with the hardware , or at least develop a little crush on it .
The system feels nice and sturdy , with a beautiful screen and clear sound .
It feels like what it is : an expensive piece of consumer electronics equipment .
The problem — and this might be a good problem to have — is that the hardware is already largely redundant .
Sony 's big move to digital is where the real news lies , and what people are forgetting is that there is no need to upgrade to take advantage of what Sony is offering .
Starting with the launch of the PSP Go , all PSP games will be available both as UMD releases and purely digital downloads .
The PSP Go ships with 16GB of storage and no UMD drive , making it seem like the perfect platform for gaming on the go .
Of course , so is your existing PSP system .
You can download a limited number of UMD games directly to your Pro Duo card right now , and when that number increases all it takes is more storage to take advantage of it .
You do n't need $ 250 worth of hardware to go digital : buy a second - hand PSP , slam in a large Pro Duo card , and there you go .
The value and audacity of what Sony will be offering has nothing to do with the hardware and everything to do with the ubiquity of downloadable games and content .
Sony already offers the ability to download video from the PlayStation Network directly with your existing hardware , and that allows you to keep your larger screen and ability to play your classic games .
Not to mention you can take advantage of inexpensive used games that exist on UMDs .
Sure , the system is slightly bigger and does n't support bluetooth , but you wo n't have to buy new cables .
The value of the " classic " PSP systems has never been better .
The biggest challenge facing the PSP
Go is that its price is way too high for what you get over and above the standard PSP system .
Having a sliding screen is nifty , but that screen is smaller .
Being purely digital is great , but there 's no reason you can't simply stop using the UMD drive in your existing system .
John Koller spoke about helping retailers by changing the margin structure of the PSP
Go , meaning that retailers may be enjoying a higher mark - up on the hardware than they usually see when selling hardware , which also explains the higher price .
The question is , what happens when Walmart decides to forgo that margin and sell the unit as a loss - leader , as it does every other piece of gaming hardware it sells ?
GameStop is still left out in the cold , since it can't count on your wife picking up meatloaf while you buy electronics .
This is why the PSP
Go may not do well at retail : the hardware is simply a nifty redesign of a system many of us already own .
It 's a little smaller .
It supports bluetooth .
That 's pretty much it .
Even if the system shipped with a faster CPU or more memory , developers would never spend time and money supporting a system with such a tiny installed base ; why fracture development ?
Unfortunately Sony and many pundits have the PSP Go confused with the service that Sony is offering with the PlayStation Network .
Your existing model will take advantage of the new digital ecosystem just fine .
The value of these moves for Sony is a more direct line to consumers with both games and content , and downloads that can't be traded in or bought used .
The value for consumers is ease of use and convenience .
None of these things require you to upgrade to new hardware .
Take the PSP
Go out of the picture entirely and it's still a very exciting time for Sony 's portable platform .
Sony is going to be delivering great content , online , bypassing retail completely if you decide to download your games .
While the DSi may be flirting with smaller games , and the iPhone is now seeing some games take up a moderate amount of space , Sony 's strategy is a clear movement to a purely digital platform .
This is being kicked off with the release of the PSP's Gran Turismo game , and the LittleBigPlanet demo I saw on Koller 's PSP was amazing .
A new Rock Band with classic gameplay is likewise a head - turner , along with the rest of Sony 's upcoming titles for the platform .
The feature set , price , and game catalog of the PSP is very hard to beat , especially if you pick up an inexpensive used system .
The gaming world is once again excited about the PSP platform , and Sony is taking a strong leadership position when it comes to bringing its devices together and selling games directly to consumers .
Forget about the PSP
Go unless you 're in love with hardware that 's shiny and new ... not that there 's anything wrong with that .
Sony 's newest PSP iteration wants to take on the iPod touch , and frankly the software and content support for Apple 's media players makes the iPod line an intimidating foe ; Sony 's strength with the PSP has always been with gaming .
The smaller screen and somewhat cramped controls of the PSP
Go may actually make the system a worse platform for games , not a better one .
Existing PSP owners should n't feel slighted by the new hardware : the system they already have is about to get much , much better as a digital device .
Sony does n't need to launch hardware to begin its assault on retail - sold games , although it certainly got us all talking .
It 's remarkable how the threat of poverty can focus the mind .
It had all started with such promise .
After years working in London as a writer , I decided to follow in my grandparents ' agricultural footsteps and get back into farming .
They had grown hops in Herefordshire , where my family has lived for more than 500 years .
My wife , Emma , is a city girl so it took me a long time to persuade her , but eventually she agreed .
We found a farmhouse with some land and moved with our children .
But the dream of country living soon turned into a nightmare .
The land came with a tumbledown farmhouse originally built in the 1500s – a rare example of a Welsh longhouse built in England .
It needed a lot of work , but we knew nothing of the building trade .
It was a total disaster .
We built up debt that would make the Royal Bank of Scotland weep and we were haemorrhaging money on the farm .
I became completely emotionally and psychologically run-down and lost all direction .
I needed a way out .
Inspiration struck on the farm .
I saw the river , and the fat pigeons in the trees , and the hedges hung with lipstick - red hawthorn berries .
I thought , how great to be able to eat only what nature provided – for free .
I had a romantic notion that throwing myself at nature would be a healing force .
So I decided to spend a year living off wild food as a modern - day hunter - gatherer .
And I did n't want just to survive – I wanted to thrive .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
I went into my " wild life " with blind ignorance .
A typical English amateur , I could just about pick out a field mushroom and knew how to make bramble jelly .
I was a hopeless fisherman but did know how to shoot and skin rabbits .
I refused to do any research – I thought , if I sit down and work out how much carbohydrate I need each day I 'll be so overwhelmed by worry I would never do it .
I spent a lot of my time in the kitchen , honing new recipes .
There were some great successes , including my herby squirrel burgers .
I shot the squirrels , skinned them ( which is like a particularly hard round of tug - o - war ) and minced them with chopped hedge garlic , wild thyme and wild chervil .
They were delicious , as was my pigeon and burdock salad .
Of course , there were as many disasters as there were triumphs .
This was a story of food heaven and food hell .
Heaven was the feeling of being outside with my dog and my gun in one of the most beautiful parts of England , with a sense of freedom I had n't felt since childhood .
Hell was almost removing myself from the gene pool by eating poisonous mushrooms .
I was out picking chanterelles and must have picked up something else , though I 'm not sure what .
I woke up at about two o'clock in the morning , feeling as if somebody was applying a defibrillator to my chest .
My heart was beating out of its cage and I was unable to move for about five hours .
I was n't thinking straight and decided I did n't want to wake anybody so just lay there until , eventually , my heart rate slowed .
It took weeks before I was right again .
There were some disasters in the kitchen , too .
There are some plants that are supposedly edible but that you would struggle to eat .
Docks are an example .
They 're terrible – bitter and metallic .
The worst time was August , when the spring greens are past their best , there are restrictions on what you can shoot and other predators are at their busiest so the rabbits have been taken .
That 's when I started eating snails .
I 'd had French snails but these were common - or - garden snails , which are n't quite the same .
The best thing about wild food is that you 're eating superfoods without thinking about it .
It 's madness that we 're eating berries from the Amazon when there are rosehips in our hedges .
My thinking became much clearer because my mind was n't clogged up with so much carbohydrate and the sugar rush of the Western diet .
My hearing and eyesight improved and I could run faster .
I normally suffer from seasonal affective disorder and always feel tragically low at the end of summer .
But I realised that because I was propelled by the seasons as a hunter - gatherer I moved from day to day without worrying about the future .
I also lost a lot of weight .
The children , Tristram and Freda , thought that it was frankly embarrassing that Dad had " gone hobo " .
My wife is a vegetarian and , like my children , refused to have anything to do with my crazy diet .
Her attitude to the kitchen also changed dramatically .
I always thought it had been " our " kitchen but it suddenly became hers when she banished me because I was constantly covered in blood and guts from my hunting expeditions .
Pulling out the innards of a small animals produces unbelievable quantities of gore .
The best day of my year came about four months in , when I suddenly realised I had become part of the landscape rather than looking over it .
I could feel a connection to every animal and plant around me and it was then that my hearing and eyesight suddenly felt more acute .
I remember seeing a buzzard and , instead of looking at it like a bird watcher , I saw a rival .
I had developed a competitive relationship with other predators .
To celebrate the end of my year of wild food , I organised a special meal for family and friends .
I cooked wild mushroom soup , wild duck with blackberry sauce or trout stuffed with aniseed and garlic mushroom stuffing , served with roast silverweed chips and steamed sorrel and mashed burdock .
Then blackberry kissel , a kind of Russian jelly .
We washed it down with a choice of wines I had made – sloe , dandelion or blackberry .
It went down very well .
I knew I must have been doing something right because suddenly the children were asking if they could have some .

Nature 's larder : Foraged favourites
Burdock
The roots , thinly sliced , can be boiled as a vegetable dish .
Or you can add dandelion leaves , water and honey and brew your own dandelion and burdock beer .
Delicious .
Pignut
In the wild larder of Britain the pignut , which has a taste somewhere between coconut and parsnip , is a sweet treat .
They are the roots of the pignut plant and can grow as big as golf balls .
Delicious roasted .
Snails
The ultimate in slow food , but they take a lot of preparation .
I collect them and purge them for a week by giving them a diet of grass before boiling them .
These are not for everyone , and many people would be turned off by their gristly consistency but I compare them to liver .
Hairy bittercress
This unobtrusive " weed " is a member of the brassica family .
It has leaves that are peppery - hot and makes an excellent ingredient in any wild spring salad .
Have you managed to fix up a feast using ingredients from the wild ?
Should more of us take to the outdoors to forage for our food ?

The Consolation of Boethius
by Sanderson Beck
Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius was born into a Christian aristocratic family , learned Greek and translated many works into Latin , wrote books on arithmetic , geometry , music , and theology , became Consul of Rome under King Theodoric in 510 , had the honor of his two sons becoming joint Consuls in 522 when they were chosen by Theodoric and the eastern Emperor Justin , after which he was selected for the high position of magister officiorum , when suddenly he was accused of treason for defending the Roman Senate and the falsely accused Albinus and put in prison in 523 by Theodoric 's command .
In the context of this situation of his drastic fall from the heights of fortune , Boethius wrote while in prison the Consolation of Philosophy .
After about a year 's time in which the work was completed , he was brutally executed .
The chronicle Anonymous Valesii states in articles 85 - 87 :
The king began to show anger against the Romans whenever there was opportunity .
Cyprian , who was then Referendarius and afterwards Count of the Sacred Largesses and Master of Offices , driven by greed , laid an information against Albinus the Patrician that he had sent letters to the Emperor Justin hostile to Theodoric 's rule .
Upon being summoned before the Court , Albinus denied the accusation and then Boethius the Patrician , who was Master of Offices , said in the King 's presence : " False is the information of Cyprian , but if Albinus did it , both I and the whole Senate did it with one accord .
It is false , my lord , Oh King . " Then Cyprian with hesitation brought forward false witnesses not only against Albinus but also against his defender Boethius .
But the King was laying a trap for the Romans and seeking how he might kill them ; he put more confidence in the false witnesses than in the Senators .
Then Albinus and Boethius were taken into custody to the baptistery of the Church .
But the King summoned Eusebius , Prefect of the city of Ticenum , and without giving Boethius a hearing , passed sentence upon him .
The King soon afterwards caused him to be killed on the Calventian territory where he was held in custody .
He was tortured for a very long time by a cord that was twisted round his forehead so that his eyes started from his head .
Then at last amidst his torments he was killed with a club .
1
Something of Boethius ' and his father - in - law Symmachus ' characters and the consequences of Theodoric 's action are described in the History of the Wars V , i , by the Byzantine historian Procopius who lived at the time of their death .
Theodoric reigned thirty - even years and after having inspired terror in all his enemies died leaving among his subjects a keen sense of regret at his loss .
And he died in the following manner .
Symmachus and Boethius his son- in - law , both of noble and ancient lineage , were leading men of the Roman Senate and had been Consuls .
Their practice of philosophy , their unsurpassed devotion to justice , their use of their wealth to relieve the distress of many strangers as well as citizens , and the great fame they thus attained caused men of worthless character to envy them .
And when these laid false information against them to Theodoric , he believed them and put Symmachus and Boethius to death on the charge of plotting a revolution , and confiscated their property .
And when Theodoric was dining a few days afterwards his servants placed before him the head of a large fish .
This seemed to Theodoric to be the head of Symmachus newly slain .
Indeed with its teeth set in its lower lip , and its eyes looking at him in a dreadful frenzied stare , it had a most threatening appearance .
Greatly alarmed at this extraordinary portent and shivering with cold , Theodoric hastened to his bed , and bidding his servants pile clothes upon him he rested a while .
But later he revealed all that had happened to his physician Elpidius and wept for his sin against Symmachus and Boethius .
Then having lamented and felt great sorrow for the calamity , he died not long afterwards --- this being the first and last act of injustice he had committed against his subjects --- and the reason of it was that he had not , in the case of these two men , made the thorough examination he as accustomed to make before passing judgment .
2
Boethius ' contribution and skill in translating Greek works into Latin is implied by Cassiodorus in a letter to him in the name of Theodoric in which he also requests a sundial .
In your translations Pythagoras the musician , Ptolemy the astronomer , are read by the Italians ; Nicomachus the arithmetician , Euclid the geometer , are heard by the Ausonians ; Plato the theologian and Aristotle the logician dispute in Roman voice ; nay , you have given back the mechanician Archimedes in Latin to the Sicilians .
And whatever disciplines or arts the eloquence of the Greeks has taught through various men , Rome has received on your authority alone in the speech of the fatherland .
These you have rendered clear with such luminous words and marked with such propriety of expression that anyone who had learned them both might have preferred your work .
3
Boethius wrote in one of his own books that his goal was to translate and make commentaries on all of Plato and Aristotle to show their essential agreement , but due to his early death only some of the Aristotle was he able to pass on to the Western world which for seven centuries had very little other knowledge than his work on logic .
If we take the view of Boethius ' Philosophy we could say that by Providence and his fate he had to write without the use of his library his own version of philosophy .
He wisely used his own circumstances of exalted fortune contrasted with wretched misfortune to show the transcendental character of Philosophy over the changeable nature of the human world .
In doing so he gave to the Middle Ages the Consolation of Philosophy from a Christian which shows by philosophical reasoning and divine intelligence the highest good to which all things move in spite of and beyond the trials and tribulations of temporal fortune .
While barbarians were gradually civilizing western Europe and many Christians were retreating into monasteries , the spirit of the times produced the Consolation of Philosophy so that they could understand that fortune was a changeable illusion and that they could go within to find the highest good and realize that they were moving in that divine direction .
Boethius ' Consolation was destined to become one of the most popular books of the Medieval period .
In the twentieth century Schepss and Engelbrecht recorded that there is close to four hundred manuscripts .
This is more than the very popular Roman de la Rose and Geoffrey of Monmouth 's Historia .
Beginning in 1471 the Consolation was printed apparently at Savigliano and followed with editions at Nuremberg , Toulouse , Cologne , Louvain , Ghent , Lyons , Venice , Basel , Strassburg , and other places .
The translations through the ages are numerous and often accompanied by commentaries and occasionally charts and diagrams .
4
English translations were done personally by such notable people as King Alfred , Chaucer , and Queen Elizabeth I. Dante called Boethius , " The blessed soul who exposes the deceptive world to anyone who gives ear to him . "
In looking at the Consolation of Philosophy from the viewpoints of history and education , two important questions arise .
Why was Boethius ' work read so much for so long , and what did it have to teach these people ?
And secondly , why has the work been so ignored in recent times ?
To answer these we must examine the message of the book .
Boethius is bewailing his fate in prison after his fall from fortune , when Philosophy makes her appearance in a gown made of her own hands which shows a Pi on the lower border and Theta on the upper with rungs in between to how one may ascend from the Practical to the Theoretical or divine ( Theos ) .
Boethius complains of his unjust sufferings , and Philosophy promises to cure him using a gentler means until he is ready for the sharper remedy .
She uses a dialectical method to determine his disease , for the Philosophy of Plato stated that the remedy for the ignorance of not knowing is teaching while the remedy for the double ignorance of thinking that one knows when one does not is therapy .
When questioned as to the guidance of the universe , Boethius responds that he does know that God overlooks
His work , but he does not know how the universe is governed or to what end .
Philosophy seems surprised to find that he who knows the beginning of all things should not know their end .
Boethius is able to remember that he is a man , which he defines as an animal , reasoning and mortal .
This Philosophy diagnoses as the chief cause of his sickness , that he has forgotten who he is , what the aim and end of all things is , and how the universe is guided ; but thanks to the " Giver of all health , " he still has a " true knowledge of the hand that guides the universe , " and " from this tiny spark the fire of life shall forthwith shine upon you . "
5
The gentler remedy begins as Philosophy shows how changeable Fortune herself owes Boethius nothing just because she has withdrawn what she had loaned to him .
This does not really console him , and Philosophy indicates that " these are not the remedies for your sickness , but in some sort are the applications for your grief which chafes against its cure . "
6
Philosophy suggests that it is his attitude which makes things appear wretched while the one who endures all with a calm mind finds oneself blessed .
She chides him , " Why , then , O mortal men , do you seek that happiness outside , which lies within yourselves ? "
7
She teaches him that happiness is found by mastering oneself , which fortune can never take away .
Philosophy discusses the various desires of men for riches , gems , beautiful clothes , servants , which are really only good in themselves and do not actually extend their goodness to their possessor .
All other things of God are satisfied by their own intrinsic good ; only human who should be above other creatures lowers themselves to seek value in worthless things .
Yet humans unlike animals have the ability to know themselves .
Philosophy shows the vicissitudes of power , position , and fame , and how they have no intrinsic good since they are often used for evil .
Philosophy now suggests that Boethius let Fortune and her friends depart for he has found his most precious friends , as she reveals that it is through Love that the natural and human forces of the universe are guided :
" All these are firmly bound by Love , which rules both earth and sea , and has its empire in the heavens too .
If Love should slacken its hold , all mutual love would change to war ; and these would strive to undo the scheme which now their glorious movements carry out with trust and accord .
By Love are peoples too kept bound together by a treaty which they may not break .
Love binds with pure affection the sacred tie of wedlock , and speaks its bidding to all trusty friends .
O happy race of mortals if your hearts are ruled as is the universe , by Love . "
8
Now Boethius has received the greatest comfort and is eager for the sharper remedy .
Philosophy indicates her transcendental awareness and causative relationship to Boethius ' mind when she says , " I knew it when you laid hold upon my word in silent attention , and I was waiting for that frame of mind in you , or more truly , I brought it about in you .
" 9
Philosophy is leading him to the true happiness of which his soul dreams , but first must show it in a picture of words " so that , when that picture is perfect and you turn your eyes to the other side , you may recognize the form of true happiness .
"
10
Philosophy reveals the true goal of humans as " the highest good " whereas people usually only seek pa rtial aspects of the good :
The trouble of the many and various aims of mortal men bring them much care , and herein they go forward by different paths but strive to reach one end , which is happiness .
And that good is that , to which if any person attain , one can desire nothing further .
It is that highest of all good things , and it embraces in itself all good things ; if any good is lacking , it cannot be the highest good , since then there is left outside it something which can be desired
Therefore happiness is a state which is made perfect by the union of all good things .
This end all people seek to reach , as I said , though by different paths .
For there is implanted by nature in human minds a desire for the true good ; but error leads them astray towards false goods by wrong paths .
11
Then Philosophy shows the vanity of riches , honorable positions , political power , fame , noble birth , desires of the flesh , and how they lead people astray from what is their true good .
Through dialectic it is determined that the highest good includes happiness , satisfaction , power , glory , and veneration .
As Philosophy 's pupil Plato in his Timaeus suggests always calling upon God at the beginning of any enterprise , Philosophy and Boethius agree to call upon the Father of all in order to be able to find out what is the highest good .
The prayer concludes :
Grant them , O Father that this mind of ours may rise to Your throne of majesty ; grant us to reach that fount of good .
Grant that we may so find light that we may set on You unblinded eyes ; cast
You from there the heavy clouds of this material world .
Shine forth upon us in Your own true glory .
You are the bright and peaceful rest of all Your children that worship You .
To see
You clearly is the limit of our aim .
You are our beginning , our progress our guide , our way , our end .12
In examining the relationship between God , the good , and happiness in this light it is found " that the highest Deity must be full of the highest , the perfect good .
But as we have laid down that true happiness is perfect good , it must be that true happiness is situated in His Divinity .
" 13 God as the fountain - head of all things has not received Its good from outside , but it is the essence that comes from It .
God rules the universe for the highest good , and all things move toward that good according to their own will be being obedient to the helmsman of good .
Book IV discuses the question that if God is good , then what is evil and where does it come from since it can't come from God .
Philosophy shows how those who are good are strong because everyone seeks the good , and the ability to attain it is evidence of power while the evil are weak because they have not attained it .
Those who are called evil are not capable of all , because they have limited themselves by their desire to a partial reality , and thus do not attain happiness or the highest good .
From God 's viewpoint everything is really good , because those who are called evil and who suffer punishment for their actions are really receiving the correction that is good for them , and good actions even in spite of adversity receive their reward in the strength of virtue which is a lasting good .
Philosophy explains to Boethius that whereas Fate is the order of temporal things , these are a result of Providence where they are " unified in the intelligence of the mind of God . "
14
When Boethius wonders about chance , Philosophy declares that there is no such thing since God controls everything in order .
Boethius then questions about free will .
Philosophy states that the reasoning of human nature indicates freedom of judgment .
Boethius cannot reconcile God 's omniscience with human free will and gives a long argument over this common perplexity .
If God knows what is going to happen , then how can human choice be free since it appears to be predestined .
To answer this Philosophy must go beyond human reason to divine intelligence and explains how something can be known without the knowledge being the cause of it .
In sum God knows what will happen because
It is aware of all the possibilities of human free choice no matter which ones are takes .
I liken this to an ant crawling up a tree .
God is the tree and a human is the ant who chooses which route of branches to follow .
God is able to know beyond the fleeting temporal dimension through the consciousness of the Eternal Present from which vantage point one can see all the past , the present , and future possibilities and probabilities , so once the choice is made God knows the results .
" It is constant in preceding and embracing by one glance all your changes .
And God does not receive this ever - present grasp of all things and vision of the present at the occurrence of future events , but from Its own peculiar directness .
"
15
The conclusion is that human free will is validated , that life is ethical in that there is the responsibility of accepting the consequence of actions , that prayer is efficacious because God does constantly act in the world through Providence , and that the highest good is worth striving for because it is the only true happiness .
Thus , therefore , mortal humans have their freedom of judgment intact .
And since their wills are freed from all binding necessity , laws do not set rewards or punishments unjustly .
God is ever the constant foreknowing overseer , and the ever - present eternity of Its sight moves in harmony with the future nature of our actions , as it dispenses rewards to the good , and punishments to the bad .
Hopes are not vainly put in God , nor prayers in vain offered : if these are right , they can not but be answered .
Turn therefore from vice : ensue virtue : raise your soul to upright hopes : send up on high your prayers from this earth .
If you would be honest , great is the necessity enjoined upon your goodness , since all you do is done before the eyes of an all - seeing Judge .16
Thus the piety of the Medieval times was given the philosophical reasoning for its faith .
They were encouraged to seek the intrinsic good rather than worldly goals .
Evil was seen to be a corrective lesson while suffering from wrong was virtuous .
Since
God rules the universe through Love , prayer to the source of all good was found to lead to true happiness .
How often do historians look back to see what artifacts they can find to judge an epoch of humanity by its extrinsic wealth ?
Who can say that this inward period of humanity did not prepare the way for the productiveness of the Renaissance like a person quiets one 's consciousness in contemplation and prayer before creating a great work of art or literature or science ?
The Middle Ages were difficult times politically and economically , but who can estimate how much happiness they inwardly received from the Consolation of Philosophy ?
In our own times the build - up of extrinsic products and wealth has become so burdensome that we are polluting ourselves with its waste .
Yet a shortage of food and economic difficulties are bringing a change of fortune to many people .
The good in this is that it is awakening people to their responsibility .
Many people are suffering from the disease of materialism and will be realizing their lack of happiness .
This is just a personal point of view , but it seems to me that the cure i soon going to be applied through therapy and teaching as people realize that divine Love does rule the universe and that they can live in harmony through this consciousness of Love , that the ever constant goal is the highest good and that by asking God for the highest good of all concerned continuous blessings are experienced .
In times of adversity consolation from Philosophy is much appreciated .

Now remember , I had precious little experience drawing caricatures at the time , but I figured , the owners of this firm must have had an " eye for talent " , and would n't have hired me if they thought I could n't do the job .
I was sorta right .
Before I began , the owner of the business gave me a brief " tutorial " on the methods and materials the caricaturists in his firm used .
The tools of the day were a Sharpie Rub - a - Dub® marker for black line work , and Chartpack ® markers for colors .
The drawings were done on 8 1/2 " x 11 " index card stock , pre-printed with the name of the company .
I was also given my very own lap board to lean on as I drew .
After showing me a few tips of the trade my boss assigned me to my first day of drawing caricatures for the general public , or as I came to know them , The Great Unwashed .
The caricature cart was located , as I mentioned , in a very popular tourist area filled with shops , restaurants , and street performers .
As my first day approached , I felt extremely excited , and extremely nervous .
I was excited to be getting paid for drawing cartoons , but nervous I would n't be good enough .
As it turned out , I need n't have felt either emotion .
The " excitement " of being paid for drawing all day dissipated as soon as I realized how little me and my fellow artist were being paid compared to what the owners of the venue were raking in .
True , we were making more than we would have been flipping burgers or cleaning toilets , but not much .
I also realized that drawing cartoons for yourself was a lot more fun than drawing screaming kids and drunks all day and night .
Having the above mentioned people arbitrarily judge your work based on how cranky / drunk they were was no fun either .
As for my fear of not being " good enough " , I had nothing to worry about .
While some of my co-workers were wonderful cartoonists and really enjoyed their jobs , the majority were hacks .
Their drawings would have shamed a 7 year old , not that they cared .
As long as the rubes paid for their crappy drawings they were content .
In comparison to them , my stuff was ready for the cover of MAD magazine .
As the Summer of my first caricature tour of duty wore on , I settled in and realized that while there were some good aspects to the job , there were downsides as well .
Such as :
• It was HOT !
Given my pale , Irish ancestry , I ideally should be kept in a cool , dry place , away from direct sunlight and humidity .
No such luck .
By day we were seated outside with no shade , while the Sun baked down on us .
Nights were cooler , but then we became a biting insect all - you - can - eat buffet .
• The food was awful !
Sure , I could have packed a lunch for myself , but that would have required some forethought , so I dined from the food court at the location we were at .
After a Summer of greasy fast food fare , my stomach and I were no longer on speaking terms .
My wallet was a lot lighter too .
• The clientele left something to be desired .
The ideal subject for a caricature is a secure person with a good sense of humor .
Why vain , insecure people with self - image issues want a caricature of themselves is beyond mortal understanding .
Time and again someone would sit down with a HUGE honker and say , " Do n't give me a big nose " .
People with glasses did n't want them in the pictures , and of course , tubs of lard all wanted to be skinny .
In all seriousness , it was truly heartbreaking when someone with a true birth defect or some other physical problem was coerced into having a drawing done .
It was awkward for the subject and the cartoonist .
You can't insult them by exaggerating their problem , but to leave it out of the drawing or idealize them would make it seem like you were passing judgement on their disability .
The worst ?
People who talked their BLIND friends or family members into getting a caricature !
Why would someone who can't see want a cartoon of themselves ?!
• There were other negatives to the job : Parking , maneuvering through crowds , not to mention roaming clowns .
The worst thing though , were the HECKLERS !
I suppose in any job where you are out there exposing your " talent " to the general public , you are opening yourself to the puckish wit of passerby .
A day did n't go by where some yahoo would stumble up , look over my shoulder , and make a witty , derisive comment about my drawing .
The problem was n't with anyone making a witty comment ( I 've made one or two in my time ) , it was the complete lack of originality !
Over and over again I heard , " Hey , SHE does n't have a mustache ! " , and , " Wow , you 're makin ' them look ugly ! "
The subject of the drawing could n't see their portrait till I was finished , so their heightened anxiety just added to the onlookers fun .
Other winners included less pithy comments like , " She does n't have 3 eyes ! "
Get the joke ?
Why would I draw someone with 3 eyes ?!
Jocularity at its finest !
( I know I 've forgotten some of the comments that retail caricaturists hear daily , so if any other caricaturists out there have any comments , please post 'em in the comments section . )
One of my favorite comments , that always left we scribblers scratching our head was , " It 's not supposed to look like ya !
It 's a caricature ! "
That was always a puzzler to me .
A lot of you reading this will think I am a spoiled brat , whining about some petty annoyances on what appears to be a pretty easy job .
You may be right .
There are a lot worse gigs out there , and I 've had a bunch of 'em ( Gas station on a freezing Christmas Eve , anyone ? ) .
If you do think I am being a whiner , pick up a pen and start drawing funny pictures of your friends and loved ones .
Then get back to me .
In our last thrilling installment , I detailed how a young , inexperienced cartoonist ( me ) had figured out a way to earn money " " .
I had hooked up with a local caricature firm , and was going to be doing cartoon portraits of tourists and the like at a popular tourist trap in downtown Boston , MA .

Seth wrote a post back in December that really touched a nerve on a ubiquitous problem that I see pop up nearly every day .
His point was about the High Cost of Now – and his key insight :
More than ever , there ’s a clear relationship between how new something is and how much it costs to discover that news .
But what I began to think about is not the High Cost of Now , but instead the High Cost of Information .
They ’re very similar , but the salient feature of the problem that he was looking at was the time - sensitivity of information , whereas the problem I ’m looking at is the general tendency for us to jump headlong into collecting and categorizing information without thinking about why we ’re doing it .
I ’ll explain by an example : There ’s a turtle in a pond somewhere in Southeast Asia .
I could spend a lot of time giving details on the turtle , where it ’s located , why it ’s in the pond , and so on , and if you ’re wondering about all those details , your eye is on the wrong ball .
The turtle , or anything about the content of that statement , really is n’t the important bit .
It ’s just a piece of information that I ’ve added to all of the other bits of information you ’re lugging around .
That piece of information is worthless on its own ; information without a context carries no value whatsoever .
The only reason that statement becomes valuable is if it changes your behavior or decisions somehow .
Adding more details to that statement does n’t necessarily make it more valuable , either .
Obviously , the real point is n’t about that statement or turtles .
It ’s about the amount of time we invest in gathering information that ’s not worth the cost we spend gathering it .
A few actual examples :
I ’ve heard people complain about the fact that iTunes only allows you to rate songs in whole star increments .
What if a song is three and a half stars rather than either three or four ?
What if it ’s between three and a half and four ?
There ’s a convention in many planner designs ( including my own ) in which the smallest increment of time that they ’ll give room for is 15 minutes .
This frustrates some people , and I ’ve been asked on multiple occasions “ What if I only spend 5 minutes on a task and want to track that ? ”
One of the many reasons people use digital task / time management systems is that it allows them to see what they did six months ago fairly easily , whereas paper systems would require you to look in an archived notebook to do the same task .
That ’s just inefficient .
People like the idea of applications / programs that show them where they ’re spending their time .
But this information rarely makes people change their behaviors to become more effective .
Despite the fact that it ’s not making an effective difference , people continue to track their time well after the placebo period .
I wrote this post Friday and let it percolate because it was n’t ready yet .
In the meantime , I stumbled across this post on SvN , and it illustrates what I ’m talking about rather clearly :
In our review yesterday we discovered that [ we ] were tracking everything in detail , but not really learning anything .
Why ?
We were tracking for the sake of tracking , not tracking for the sake of learning .
We were n’t really sure why we were tracking what we were ” ” but we kept on doing it because , well , momentum is a powerful force .
It became an exercise in seeing how organized we could get in spite of what we actually needed .
Our extensive use of categories and tags and custom fields and pulldowns could give us a whole lot of report - friendly information , but it did n’t give us any useful information .
Information without insight is junk .
That ’s what we had .
Plenty of it .
Here we have the nice , prolific folks at 37 Signals who fell into the Research Trap that catches many of us : collecting information for the sake of information instead of thinking about what we ’ll do with the information we ’re collecting .
What ’s not being accounted for is the amount of time , energy , and resources invested into making sure that we have precise , retrievable information .
Precision and archival come at a cost – and this is where Seth ’s question can be raised all over again : are the benefits of precision and archival worth their costs ?
Adding tags and metadata , then sorting , categorizing , and layering those tags and metadata , is another clear example of this tendency at play .
What ’s great about tags is that they allow us to categorize our information in an ad hoc way , but that ad hoc-ness sometimes comes at a high cost when we recognize that we ’ve been labeling the same types of information in different ways .
And there we are , trying to remember what tags we used and dealing with the cognitive dissonance of information that ’s sorted differently .
Instead of thinking about what relevance the turtle in the pond has for us , we ’re thinking about what kind of turtle it is .
In an earlier post , I wrote about why GTD contexts are not worth the time for me .
Instead of helping me structure my workflow , I found that context served to be an additional piece of information for me to manage , and managing that information was n’t value - added .
So , rather than continuing to monkey with the system , I dropped them for a more lean framework .
[ This framework is discussed in the product I ’m working on . ]
But here again , we see the High Cost of Information cloaked within a rationalization about what an efficient system looks like .
I ’m not saying that contexts are not worth the time for everybody , but really look at what you ’re getting out of them .
The last trend I ’ll discuss is our tendency to over - research information when we should instead be creating from and / or understanding the information we already have .
As I mentioned a while ago , this tendency to research is often a prop we put in the way of doing the creative stuff we need to be doing .
But the basic rationalization for this tendency is the idea that more information is better than less information .
And that idea is wrong .
More information is not inherently better .
More information will not necessarily help you make decisions or understand things any better than less information .
Moreover , more information can create more work for either no gain or substantially diminished returns .
The truth is that there will always be more information to gather , and the only time you ’ll have a complete informational picture is when it ’s too late .
Yet we still spend a lot of our time collecting , organizing , archiving , and rereading information that wo n’t actually change our behavior or help make decisions .
How does knowing you spent seven minutes on a task from 10:00 to 10:07 change your behavior or help make decisions better than knowing that you did two specific tasks between 10:00 and 10:15 ?
Is it really worth taking the time to rate a song in half star increments when the cost of storing music data is cheaper than the soft costs of you spending the time to rate and sort songs by halves ?
Is it really worth the amount of fiddling that digital task / time management systems tend to foster just so you can know what you did six months ago – especially when most of the time , we care about this only when dealing with others , in which case , the information is probably in your sent email archive anyway ?
I ’m not saying that there are n’t times and places when more information is really valuable , and I ’m also not saying that you should just keep winging it through ignorance .
Far from it .
But here ’s the bottom line : if you ca n’t ask yourself the basic questions that you ’re hoping the information will answer , you probably should n’t be collecting information – you should be asking yourself what questions you need answered .
If those questions are worth the high cost of information , then you ’re golden ; otherwise , the juice is n’t worth the squeeze .
Leave the turtle sitting in the pond in Southeast Asia – you ’ve got more worthwhile things to be thinking about and doing .
A Scientific Look at David Bowie's Package
As most know , each Walmart is home to several throw away DVD bins .
Today , I present you with my saturday morning find of dvd bin gold , LABYRINTH !
For those unfamiliar with the awesome that is Labyrinth , the movie is a Jim Henson production starring David Bowie as Jareth , the Goblin King , though the Goblin Drag - Queen might be more appropriate .
The movie is about Sarah :
Surprise , surprise , the goblins ( accompanied by david bowie 's penis ) take her brother ( toby ) away .
For the rest of the movie , basically crazy shit happens involving both midgets and goblins , but the focal point has got to be David Bowie and his uncanny ability to bust into song and cock thrust , but do n't take it from me , I have a coworker that was at a Neil Gaiman signing way back when he was promoting Mirrormask , a movie he did with Dave McKean .
It 's a project through the Jim Henson Company done on a shoestring budget in the general spirit of Dark Crystal and Labyrinth .
There , Gaiman said that the JHC actually housed him and McKean in Jim Henson 's old house in London which had n't been redecorated since Henson passed away .
One night they found a 3 hour rough cut of Labyrinth and watched it " for inspiration " .
Apparently there was so much Bowie crotchitude in this screener , that Henson deserved an editing award just to keep the movie below an " R " rating .
Also he said the un-cut dance sequence was the most unintentionally funny piece of film making he 'd ever seen .
Bowie 's bulge was practically demanding it's own trailer on the set ...
* note - not found on DVD
still you doubt me , on with the pictures I say !
Upon further study , pondering topics of christianity , the theories of relativity , and Rob Schneider films , I 've come to the conclusion that Mr. Bowie 's groin is the center point of a dimensional warp that leads to a place where everything is fucking magical .
1689 edits were necessary to keep Labyrinth from an R-rating .
Have you teleported out of David Bowie 's Junk ?
Back to the only site that take 's an indepth .
scientific look at a gay man 's unit ...
Clearly , a baby turtle is hidden in there as David Bowie once again busts out the " No I do n't stuff my Hanes " face .
Upon further study , pondering topics of christianity , the theories of relativity , and Rob Schneider films , I 've come to the conclusion that Mr. Bowie 's groin is the center point of a dimensional warp that leads to a place where everything is fucking magical .
This is where most scholarly individuals succumb to the power of David Bowie 's crotch mystery .
I however am not willing to give up just so easily .
I am going to break this mystery wide open with both sweaty hands ready to salivate all over the sweet , sweet taste of throbbing victory .
Moving on you can see that the mystery only becomes more mind bending as David Bowie 's crotch continues to enlarge .
You may pass this off as being only an optical illustion so to the skeptics I present the next image .
and here is the undeniable proof that there is something unworldly eroti ... STRANGE about David Bowie 's crotch .
As you can clearly see in this second picture , David Bowie 's crotch is larger than it was before .
Also take note of Bowie 's gasp of disbelief when he is questioned about stealing Lenny Kravitz 's crotch stuffing technique .
Professor Hoggle gets an intimat ... er a close look at David Bowie 's crotch .
Please note the nondescript size of David Bowie 's crotch in this first image .
One night when Sarah is on the rag , she proclaims : " I wish the goblins would come take you away .
Right now .
" Surprise , surprise , the goblins ( accompanied by david bowie 's penis ) take her brother ( toby ) away .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Federal Reserve sought to hide its involvement in Bank of America Corp ’s acquisition of Merrill Lynch as Merrill ’s financial condition worsened , the top Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said on Wednesday .
The entrance to a Bank of America branch is pictured in New York May 7 , 2009 .

The Fed “ engaged in a cover - up and deliberately hid concerns and pertinent details regarding the merger from other federal regulatory agencies , ” Representative Darrell Issa said in a statement released to Reuters .
Bernanke has in the past denied any inappropriate pressure on Bank of America .
Fed spokeswoman Michelle Smith on Wednesday referred to a letter Bernanke sent Representative Dennis Kucinich on April 30 and later testimony in which he offered an “ unconditional assertion ” that he did not ask Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis to withhold information regarding Merrill .
“ The Federal Reserve acted with the highest integrity throughout its discussions with Bank of America , ” Bernanke wrote to the Ohio Democrat , who chairs a subcommittee on the Oversight panel .
The Democrat who heads the committee , Edolphus Towns of New York , has called Bernanke to testify on Thursday .
“ I am not going to prejudge these issues .
We are not even close to finishing the Bank of America - Merrill Lynch investigation at this point , ” Towns said in a statement .
Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has also been called to testify before Congress next month about the Bank of America - Merrill Lynch transaction .
His planned appearance was confirmed in an e-mail from Jenny Rosenberg , an aide to Towns , who said no date had been set for Paulson ’s testimony .
After rescuing Bank of America in January , U.S. regulators tightened their grip on the bank with a secret agreement that contributed to the ongoing shakeup of its directors and executives , the Wall Street Journal said , citing people familiar with the matter .
At least some of the bank ’s ratings also were lowered by regulators earlier in the year , the people told the paper .
Bank of America could not be immediately reached for comment on the Journal report .
The paper , citing internal documents , added that Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Chairman Sheila Bair wrote to Bernanke before the aid to the bank was unveiled to express the FDIC ’s “ discomfort ” with the deal .
POLITICAL FOOTBALL
Democrats on the panel have focused on whether Bank of America ’s Lewis illegally misled investors about Merrill ’s finances , while Republicans have zeroed in on whether the Fed and former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson inappropriately pressured Lewis to seal the deal .
The issue has become a political football as lawmakers look to blame someone for the troubled deal amid taxpayer anger over the billions of dollars the government infused into banks to try to ease the world financial crisis .
A Democratic source close to the committee said Republican members leaked documents just before a hearing earlier this month where Lewis testified .
“ They framed the story by looking at only a few of the documents , ” said the source , who was not authorized to be quoted on the matter .
Some Democrats believe Bank of America ’s Lewis had to know about Merrill ’s deepening losses and that Lewis was threatening to pull out of the deal as a way to get more assistance from the Fed .
Still , the Democratic source said , “ The Fed does not come out smelling like roses . ”
Kucinich said what is remarkable about the situation was that the Fed required no changes in the bank ’s leadership or conditions on the billions that did go to Bank of America .
The bank , which did not return a phone call seeking comment , has taken $ 45 billion in bailout funds from the government .
Other documents released by the committee earlier this month revealed that a Fed analysis found deficiencies in the due diligence conducted by Bank of America prior to the Merrill deal .
PRESSURE , DISCLOSURE
Earlier this month , the same panel questioned Lewis about whether he was pressured to complete the deal with Merrill , which lost $ 15.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
Lewis told the lawmakers that Bernanke never asked him to keep secret any information the bank wanted to disclose to shareholders .
The committee has obtained a number of emails and documents from the Fed about its behind - the - scenes role in the merger , which was quickly brokered late in 2008 amid turmoil in the U.S. banking sector , according to sources familiar with documents .
The sources declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter .
The sources said documents showed the Fed tried to keep some information about the Bank of America deal secret from the Office of Comptroller of the Currency , the North Carolina - based bank ’s direct regulator , and from the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The bank is also regulated by the Fed .
In one email cited , then - Merrill Lynch chief financial officer Nelson Chai wrote to then - Merrill CEO John Thain , about a discussion he had just had with New York Federal Reserve official Arthur Angulo :
“ His hope is that there is no disclosure prior to ( Bank of America ) quarterly announcement .
We told him this was current plan . ”
That behavior “ raises important questions ” about whether the Fed can work collaboratively with other regulators and should gain additional power , as proposed in the Obama administration ’s financial regulation plan , the sources said .
Documents obtained by Republican panel members suggest that the Fed pushed Bank of America to complete the deal by threatening to fire Lewis and the board , according to the sources .
They cited a December 20 , 2008 email in which Jeffrey Lacker , president of the Richmond Fed , said he had spoken to Bernanke about Bank of America potentially trying to get out of the deal by claiming that a “ material adverse change ” ( MAC ) had occurred .
“ Just had a long talk with Ben ( Bernanke ) .
Says that they think the MAC threat is irrelevant because it ’s not credible .
Also intends to make it even more clear that if they play that card and they need assistance , management is gone , ” Lacker wrote , according to the sources .
Bernanke ’s term as Fed chairman expires in January .
TTC Dream Map : Click to enlarge .
After critiquing several of the TTC fantasy maps out there , we decided that it was high - time to create our own .
Keep in mind , this map is complete fiction and entirely unrealistic .
It builds upon some of what the TTC has proposed or is currently working on , like the Downtown Relief Line and the Spadina - University expansion , but it also completely ignores Transit City and the forthcoming LRT lines .
Since the map is based on the current TTC route map , it also includes the map ’s distortions , and is thus not to scale .
Bloor - Danforth - Scarborough Line
Ding - dong the fucking witch is dead !
Yes , this map kills off the much hated Scarborough RT line and replaces it with an extension of the Bloor - Danforth line .
In the east , the Scarborough section of the line now extends to the University of Toronto ’s Scarborough campus and to the Metro Toronto Zoo ( yay ! ) and in the west , the line now stops at the Etobicoke Ikea ( no more shuttle buses ) and Sherway Gardens .
An expansion of the Bloor - Danforth line to Sherway Gardens is n’t entirely unrealistic , but replacing the Scarborough RT with a subway line is downright crazy .
Extension of the Spadina - University Line
The TTC is already working on expanding the Spadina - University line to Vaughan .
The TTC plans to complete the project by 2015 .
Sheppard - Downtown Loop
The Sheppard - Downtown line takes the preexisting Sheppard line and combines it with the proposed Downtown Relief Line .
While it ’s highly unlikely that the two lines would ever become a loop , it ’s probable that if the Downtown Relief Line is built it may one day be extended to meet the Sheppard line .
There ’s one obvious problem with the loop : in the east , the loop crosses through several ravines , which would make construction costly and difficult , though not impossible .
In the west , it looks like there are huge distances separating some of the stations on Sheppard Avenue West .
However , although long , the distortions in the route map ’s design make the distances look larger than they are .
Eglinton Line
An Eglinton subway line is unlikely to ever be built , as an Eglinton LRT is part of the Transit City plan .
The big advantage of the line is that it provides subway access to Pearson Airport .
Etobicoke Line
Out of all the new lines and extensions , the Etobicoke line is probably the most superfluous .
While it provides access to GO stations , parks , malls , the waterfront , Pearson Airport , and northern Etobicoke , it also travels large distances through relatively low density areas .
Update :
This map was originally published with several errors , they have since been corrected .
Loan officers , she said , pushed customers who could have qualified for prime loans into subprime mortgages .
Another loan officer stated in an affidavit filed last week that employees had referred to blacks as " mud people " and to subprime lending as " ghetto loans . "
Shameful and sickening .
Sickening .
And people wonder how a person of color could have the " gall " to claim more intimate knowledge of such things than an average white male justice .
The New York Times , in a recent analysis of mortgage lending in New York City , found that black households making more than $ 68,000 a year were nearly five times as likely to hold high - interest subprime mortgages as whites of similar or even lower incomes .
( The disparity was greater for Wells Fargo borrowers , as 2 percent of whites in that income group hold subprime loans and 16.1 percent of blacks . )
FINANCIAL PRODUCTS SAFETY COMMISSION
The idea of the Commission is based on the model of the Consumer Product Safety Commission , which does n't care about a company 's campaign donations when it considers lead paint in toys .
They do n't care about a Fed Chair 's legacy , a company 's books , or it 's pension plan , or it 's OSHA infractions , or it 's HR filings : all they care about is the end product and its danger to the consumer .
If an item 's dangerous , they recall it .
... The agency has the authority to develop uniform safety standards , order the recall of unsafe products , and ban products that pose unreasonable risks .
In establishing the Commission , Congress recognized that " the complexities of consumer products and the diverse nature and abilities of consumers using them frequently result in an inability of users to anticipate risks and to safeguard themselves adequately . "
Insert " the complexities of financial products and the perverse nature of institutions providing them " and begin to see why such a commission is needed .
And it is n't just the infinitely insane inventions and evolutions of the industry that give pause .
It 's also the various physical and legal jurisdictions .
For example , products are n't regulated based on what they are , so much as who provides them .
The subprime mortgage market provides a stunning example of the resulting fractured oversight .
In 2005 , for example , 23 percent of subprime mortgages were issued by regulated thrifts and banks .
Another 25 percent were issued by bank holding companies , which were subject to different regulatory oversight through the federal system .
But more than half – 52 percent , to be exact–of all subprime mortgages originated with companies with no federal supervision at all ,
Warren points out this results in 1 . greater loopholes and 2 . regulatory arbitrage - because an agency will be loathe to crack down when an entity can simply morph or move from its jurisdiction ; reducing the potency ; and therefore , the necessity of that agency .
People may complain about the costs of such a commisssion :
The evidence clearly shows that CPSC is a cost - effective agency .
Since it was established , product - related death and injury rates in the United States have decreased substantially .
The CPSC estimates that just three safety standards for three products alone–cigarette lighters , cribs , and baby walkers–save more than $ 2 billion annually .
The annual estimated savings is more than CPSC ’s total cumulative budget since its inception .
Imagine what a FPSC would have saved us .
( CNN ) -- A California woman accused in the rape and murder of 8 - year - old Sandra Cantu fought tears Tuesday as a judge read the charges against her in a brief court appearance .
Melissa Huckaby is charged with killing 8 - year - old Sandra Cantu , who was a friend of her own daughter .
Wearing red jail scrubs over a white T - shirt , Melissa Huckaby , 28 , flinched at the mention of Sandra 's name .
She is charged with killing Sandra , who was a friend of her own daughter .
The Sunday school teacher 's lip quivered and a single tear rolled down her cheek as the judge read special circumstances alleged against her -- that the murder was committed in conjunction with a kidnapping , the performance of a lewd and lascivious act upon a child , and rape by instrument .
Huckaby did not enter a plea or speak during the appearance .
Public defender Ellen Schwarzenberg , who appeared in court with Huckaby , said she would not enter a plea at that time , adding she had spoken with Huckaby " very briefly . "
Read the complaint ( PDF )
The matter was continued for arraignment on April 24 .
Schwarzenberg requested a gag order be imposed in the case , but the judge put off that matter until April 24 as well .
Huckaby will remain in the San Joaquin County Jail without bond .
Huckaby is undergoing a medical evaluation as part of another case , an alleged petty theft being handled in a mental health court , Willett said .
Asked whether that would affect the murder case , he said , " Obviously , any mental health issues would have an effect on this case . "
Schwarzenberg said she hopes people will not rush to judgment in the case until all the facts are known .
If convicted as charged , Huckaby faces the death penalty or life in prison without parole , San Joaquin County District Attorney James Willett told reporters after the hearing .
A decision on whether to seek the death penalty will be made later , he said .
Sandra 's body was found April 6 , stuffed into a suitcase and submerged in a pond at a dairy farm .
Huckaby was arrested Friday night after questioning by police .
Sandra was last seen alive March 27 in the mobile home park where she lived with her family -- the same mobile home park where Huckaby lives with her own 5 - year - old daughter .
The two children were close friends and played together frequently , police said .
Huckaby is the granddaughter of Clifford Lane Lawless , pastor of Clover Road Baptist Church near the mobile home park , and she taught Sunday school at the church , police said .
The church was searched as part of the investigation into Sandra 's disappearance and death .
Before her arrest , Huckaby acknowledged to a newspaper reporter that she owned the suitcase that contained Sandra 's body .
But Huckaby said the suitcase had been stolen .

How To Undelete Deleted Files Using TuneUp Utilities :
The process is really simple .
You just go to the file recovery and destruction tab and choose the Undelete Tab .
The next option that shows up are the details of the hard disks on your computer .
You can choose the particular hard disk from which the file was deleted and say " Next . "
The next screen has a search criteria box .
Here , you can use wild cards to narrow your search .
For example , if you are searching for a jpeg image file , you can put the search criteria as [ *. jpeg ] .
Once you 've specified the file type , click on " Next . "
This starts the recovery process and you are shown a list of files that match your criteria .
Once you 've identified the specific file that you want restored , you just have to click on the " Restore " button and choose the path you want the file to be restored to and voila !
you have your file that you 'd thought you had deleted permanently .
Its so ridiculously simple - also a reason why you should be concerned - especially when you are deleting sensitive confidential data .
You would n't want someone recovering that data and possibly using it against you in some way .
Here is where the Shredder option can be extremely handy and useful .
How To Shred Files Securely Using TuneUp Utilities :
In the TuneUp 2007 version , once installed on your PC , you have a right click option available that shows up the Shredder option .
All you have to when you want to securely delete a file is right click on the particular file and choose the " TuneUp Shredder " option .
Doing so takes you to a window that shows a couple of options such as the deletion method and the number of repetitions .
There are 3 deletion methods available in the TuneUp software , ( 1 ) Fast Delete ( 2 ) Secure Delete in accordance with DoD and ( 3 ) Secure Delete , Gutmann method .
You can choose either one of these options depending on the level of secure deletion that you desire .
You can also choose the number of repetitions to ensure that the files are overwritten and made irretrievable .
Apart from the TuneUp option that I 've described above , there are innumerable undelete and shredder softwares available .
I cannot personally testify as to the efficacy of these programs , however TuneUp worked pretty well for me .
I do n't know about the 2009 version , but I 'd think it would be better .
There is a trial version that is available .
So , one can test it out .
In this day and age where data is valuable and can be misused , one needs to be aware of such valuable software that can help you safeguard your private data .
Telecommuting is one thing but how about actually being there .
Imagine you ’re working from New York and you need to check up on a production plant in Seattle .
Imagine being able to walk around the building in Seattle while sitting at your desk in New York , talking to people around the remote office , going in and out of meetings in the conference room , even keeping a close eye on the production line .
Well Menlo Park , CA based Willow Garage is making that possible with their Texai communication systems .
Now humans can actually inhabit a robot - like unit ( think Avatar minus the blue skin and magical trees , or Surrogates ) .
That ’s right you can take over a robot in Seattle , check up on that production plant , then inhabit another robot in Florida and visit the warehouse there , then posses another robot in California and attend a shareholders ’ meeting ( practically in person ) … you get the picture .
The possibilities are endless .
Sanford Dickert , good friend of DaniWeb and Texai Product Director at Williow Garage , blew - away the crowd of techies on Tuesday night as he presented at the Tech NY Meetup in NYC .
First he remotely visited Willow Garage ’s offices in Mountain View and walked around the halls there saying hello to the crew .
Then , in a few seconds and a couple of clicks , he inhabited a Texai robot at the home of the creator of Texai robots in Indiana for a quick chat .
Here ’s a video from Tuesday night ’s event ( excuse the amateur video , I ’m no pro ) : [ YOUTUBE ] gW9HVhWtC5Y [ / YOUTUBE ]
I have a feeling that remote presence can really catch on and become one of those technologiesyou can’t live without –especially for companies .
There are so many applications for robots like the Texai .
I can already think of a bunch : Medical doctors visiting patients , corporate meetings and countless job - related activities , fun and R - sports ( R for remote or Robotic or RidiculouslyAwesomelyCool ) .
I can only imagine the enormous amounts of money that can be saved from reducing [ or eliminating ] the need for travel .
Not to mention the G - Factor here , yes I ’m talking Green , as in reduced emissions and all that save - the - planetness you get from less driving , less flying , etc .
So how can you get one of these puppies ?
Well , you ca n’t buy one , not yet from Willow anyway .
Williow Garage does not have pricing on the Texai yet .
They are focusing on using the [ Texai ] platform to “ gain experience with remote presence , and explore any related issues or concerns . ”
But you sure can make one .
Yes it ’s open source and it is rather simple ( for a true nerd ) to make .
All you need are some parts from Steve Wozniak ’s garage .
Most of the Texai is made from off - the - shelf parts such as a Logitech Orbit webcam with pan / tilt / zoom and built - in mic ( for communication ) , a wide angle video camera ( for navigation ) a computer monitor , speakers , two laser range finders and a decent PC ( Texai runs Ubuntu Karmic on an Intel Core 2 Duo with 8 GB of RAM ) .
Then you ’ll need something for mobility ( motors , gears , etc. ) .
The Texai uses a “ Smart Caster ” from Willow Garage ’s PR2 robot but if you are into robotics you can build your own , it ’s like making pizza ( well not really ) .
For parts and robotics kits Willow Garage recommends this site .

Texai ’s software is based on the ROS open - source meta-operating system as well as commercially available video - conferencing software ( such as Skype ) .
The interface can be designed to run from any browser window ( see picture below ) so you can pretty much control this from your browser enabled mobile phone .
Here is an official video about the Texai :

The Texai is strictly a remote - presence / communication robot so it does not give you arms or allow the user to grab or move things ( too bad , could have had some fun with that ) but they do make another bot called the PR2 ( Personal Robot 2 ) .
Here ’s a video on the PR2 ( very interesting ) :

The Adventures of a Pythonista in Schemeland /26
by Michele Simionato
June 11 , 2009
Summary
In this episode I add another item to the macro programmer toolkit ( macros taking macros as arguments ) and I bring an argument in favor of good old parentheses .
Advertisement
Macros taking macros as arguments
There is no limit to the sophistication of macros : for instance , it is possible to define higher order macros , i.e. macros taking other macros as arguments or macros expanding into other macros .
Higher order macros allow an extremely compact and elegant programming style ; on the other hand , they are exposed to the risk of making the code incomprehensible and pretty hard to debug .
I have already shown an example of macro expanding into a macro transformer in episode 22 , and explained the intricacies of the tower of meta - levels ; in this episode instead I will consider a much simpler class of higher order macros , macros taking macros as arguments .
Moreover , I will spend some time discussing the philosophy of Scheme and explaining the real reason why there are so many parentheses .
Scheme as an unfinished language Most programmers are used to work with a finished language .
With finished , I mean that the language provides not only a basic core of functionalities , but also a toolbox of ready - made solutions making the life of the application programmer easier .
Notice that here I am not considering the quality of the library coming with the language ( which is extremely important of course ) but language - level features , such as providing syntactic sugar for common use cases .
As a matter of fact , developers of the XXIth century take for granted a lot of language features that were uncommon just a few years ago .
This is particularly true for developers working with dynamic languages , which are used to features like built - in support for regular expressions , a standard object system with a Meta Object Protocol , a Foreign Function Interface , a sockets / networking interface , support for concurrency via microthread and native threads and multiprocesses and more ; nowadays even Javascript has list comprehension and generators !
Modern finished languages spoil the programmer , and this is the reason why they are so much popular .
Of course not all finished languages are equivalent , and some are more powerful and / or easier to use than others .
Some programmers will prefer Python over Java , others will prefer Ruby , or Scala , or something else , but the concept of finished language should be clear .
On the other hand Scheme , at least as specified in the R6RS standard - I am not talking about concrete implementations here - is missing lots of the features that modern languages provide out the box .
Compared to the expectations of the modern developer , Scheme feels very much like an unfinished language .
I think the explanation for the current situation is more historical and social than technical .
On one hand , a lot of people in the Scheme world want Scheme to stay the way it is , i.e. a language for language experimentations and research more than a language for enterprise work ( for instance a standard object system would effectively kill the ability to experiment with other object systems and this is not wanted ) .
On the other hand , the fact that there are so many implementations of Scheme makes difficult / impossible to specify too much : this the reason why there are no standard debugging tools for Scheme , but only implementation - specific ones .
Even if the Scheme language has been left unfinished - does not matter if by choice or out of necessity - it has been equipped with a built - in mechanism enabling the user to finish the language according to his / her preferences .
Such a mechanism is of course the mechanism of macros .
Actually , one of the main use of macros is to fill out the deficiencies left out by the standard .
Most people nowadays prefer to have ready - made solutions , because they have deadlines , projects to complete and no time nor interest in writing things that should be made by language designers , so they dismiss Scheme immediately after having having read the standard specification .
However , one should make a distinction : while it is true that Scheme - in the sense of the language specified by the R6RS standard - is unfinished , concrete implementations of Scheme tends to be much more complete .
If you give up portability and you marry a specific implementations you get all the benefit of a " finished " language .
Consider for instance PLT Scheme , or Chicken Scheme , which are two big Scheme implementations : they have support for every language - level feature you get in a mainstream language and decent size libraries so that they are perfectly usable ( and used ) for practical tasks you could do with Python or Ruby or even a compiled language .
Another option if you want to use Scheme in an enterprise context is to use a Scheme implementation running on the Java virtual machine ( SISC , Kawa ... ) or on the .NET platform ( IronScheme ) .
Alternatively , you could use a Scheme - like language such as Clojure , developed by Rich Hickey .
Clojure runs on the Java Virtual Machine , it is half lisp and half Scheme , it has a strong functional flavour in it , and an interesting support to concurrency .
It also shares the following caracteristics with Python / Ruby / Perl / ... : it is a one - man language ( i.e. it is not a comprimise language made by a committee ) with a clear philosophy and internal consistency ; it is language made from scratch , with no preoccupations of backward compatibility ; it provides special syntax / libraries for common operations ( syntax conveniences ) that would never enter in the Scheme standard .
Such caracteristics make Clojure very appealing .
However , personally I have no need to interact with the Java platform professionally ( and even there I would probably choose Jython over Clojure for reason of greater familiarity ) so I have not checked out Clojure and I have no idea about it except what you can infer after reading its web site .
If amongst my readers there is somebody with experience in Clojure , please feel free to add a comment to this article .
I personally am using Scheme since I am interested in macrology and no language in existence can beat Scheme in this respect .
Also , I am using for Scheme for idle speculation and not to get anything done ;-)
Two second order macros to reduce parentheses A typical example of idle speculation is the following question : can we find a way to reduce the number of parentheses required in Scheme ?
Finding tricks for reducing parentheses is a pointless exercise per se , but it gives a reason to teach a few other macro programming techniques - in particular second order macros taking macros as arguments - and to explain why parentheses are actually good and should not be removed .
In episode 25 I defined a recursive cond - macro taking less parentheses than a regular cond , using an accumulator .
Here I will generalize that approach , by abstracting the accumulator functionality into a second order macro , called collecting - pairs , which takes as input another macro and a sequence of arguments , and calls the input macro with the arguments grouped in pairs .
That makes it possible to call with less parentheses any macro of the form ( macro expr ... ( a b ) ... ) , by calling it as ( collecting - pairs ( macro expr ... ) a b ... ) .
Here is the code implementing collecting - pairs : ( def - syntax collecting - pairs ( syntax - match ( ) ( sub ( collecting - pairs ( name arg ... ) x1 x2 ... )
#'( collecting - pairs " helper " ( name arg ... ) ( ) x1 x2 ... ) ) ( sub ( collecting - pairs " helper " ( name arg ... ) ( acc ... ) )
#'( name arg ... acc ... ) ) ( sub ( collecting - pairs " helper " ( name arg ... ) ( acc ... ) x ) #'( syntax - violation ' name " Mismatched pairs " '( name arg ... acc ... x ) 'x ) ) ( sub ( collecting - pairs " helper " ( name arg ... ) ( acc ... ) x1 x2 x3 ... )
#'( collecting - pairs " helper " ( name arg ... ) ( acc ... ( x1 x2 ) ) x3 ... ) ) ) ) collecting - pairs can be used with many syntactic expressions like cond , case , syntax - rules , et cetera .
Here is an example with the case expression : > ( collecting - pairs ( case 1 ) ( 1 ) ' one ( 2 ) ' two ( 3 ) ' three else ' unknown ) ) one Using a second order macro made us jump up one abstraction level , by encoding the accumulator trick into a general construct that can be used with a whole class of cond - style forms .
However , collecting - pairs cannot do anything to reduce parentheses in let - style forms .
To this aim we can introduce a different second order macro , such as the following " colon " macro : ( def- syntax : ; colon macro ( syntax - match ( ) ( sub ( : let - form e ) ; do nothing #'e ) ( sub ( : let - form e1 e2 ) ( syntax - violation ': " Odd number of arguments " #' let - form ) ) ( sub ( : let - form patt value rest ... expr ) #'( let - form ( ( patt value ) ) ( : let - form rest ... expr ) ) ( identifier ? #' let - form ) ( syntax - violation ': " Not an identifier " #' let - form ) ) ) )
The colon macro expects as argument another macro , the let - form , which can be any binding macro such that ( let - form ( ( patt value ) ... ) expr ) is a valid syntax .
For instance ( let ( ( name value ) ... ) expr ) can be rewritten as ( : let name value ... expr ) , by removing four parentheses .
Here is a test with let* : ( test " colon - macro " ( : let* x 1 y x (+ x y ) )
2 ) The latest version of the aps package provides a colon : form in the ( aps lang ) module .
In the following Adventures I will never use collecting - pairs and : since I actually like parentheses .
The reason is that parens make it easier to write macros with pattern matching techniques , as I argue in the next paragraph .
The case for parentheses Paren - haters may want to use collecting - pairs and the colon macro to avoid parentheses .
They may even go further , and rant that the basic Scheme syntax should require less parentheses .
However , that would be against the Scheme philosophy : according to the Scheme philosophy a programmer should not write code , he should write macros writing code for him .
In other words , automatic code generation is favored over manual writing .
When writing macros , it is much easier to use a conditional with more parentheses like cond than a conditional with less parentheses like cond- .
The parentheses allows you to group expressions in group that can be repeated via the ellipsis symbol ; in practice , you can write things like ( cond ( cnd ? do - this ... ) ...) which cannot be written with cond- .
On the other hand , different languages adopt different philosophies ; for instance Paul Graham 's Arc uses less parentheses .
This is possible since it does not provide a macro system based on pattern matching ( which is a big minus in my opinion ) .
Is it possible to have both a syntax with few parentheses for writing code manually and a syntax with many parentheses for writing macros ?
Clearly the answer is yes : the price to pay is to double the constructs of the language .
Python is an example of such a language with a two - level syntax : it provides both a simple syntax , limited but able to cover the most common case , and a fully fledged syntax , giving all the power you need , which however is used rarely .
For instance , here a table showing some of the most common syntactic sugar used in the Python language : Simplified syntax Full syntax obj.attr getattr ( obj , ' attr ' ) x + y x.__add__(y ) c = C( ) c = C.__new__( C ) ; c.__init__ ( )
In principle , the Scheme language could follow exactly the same route , by providing syntactic sugar for the common cases and a low level syntax for the general case .
For instance , in the case of the conditional syntax , we could have a fully parenthesized __cond__ syntax for usage in macros and cond syntax with less parens for manual usage .
That , in theory : in practice Scheme only provides the low level syntax , leaving to the final user the freedom ( and the burden ) of implementing his preferred high level syntax .
Since syntax is such a subjective topic , in practice I think it is impossible for a language designed by a committee to converge on an high level syntax .
This is a consequence of the infamous bikeshed effect .
The bikeshed effect is typical of any project designed by a committee : when it comes to proposing advanced functionalities that very few can understand , it is easy to get approval from the larger community .
However , when it comes to simple functionality of common usage , everybody has got a different opinion and it is practically impossible to get anything approved at all .
To avoid that , the standard does not provide directly usable instruments : instead , it provides general instruments which are intended as building blocks on that of which everybody can write the usable abstractions he / she prefers .
On the other hand Lisp - like languages designed by a BDFL ( like Arc and Clojure ) provide a high level syntax , which is the one the BDFL like .
You may try it and see if you like it .
Good luck !

A high - rise tower for animals in the industrial heartland of Leeds is offering a unique solution to the decline of urban wildlife .
Can it work ?
Rising 40 feet ( 12 metres ) above canals once lined with textile mills and factory chimneys could soon be another kind of tower - a high - rise for all creatures great and ( mainly ) small .
If the plans come to fruition , the structure aims to encourage a variety of species to " reclaim their urban landscape " .
It is the vision of a small team of architects , a vertical solution to a horizontal desire to offer shelter to creatures in urban areas where space on the ground is tight .
The man behind the project , 26 - year - old Neil Oxlee , hopes his " man-made tree " will provide a habitat for bats , birds , butterflies , insects and even foxes .
House proud : Neil Oxlee 's design beat entries from around the world
He says the different species would thrive off each other like they would in a woodland environment , with minimal human involvement .
" I 'm not an animal expert , if it goes further we 'd need to get a wildlife expert on board ... to see exactly which ones eat the other ones .
There 's a food chain there .
" It would evolve from there ... there may be a few extra design factors to take into account .
This is a concept . "
Mr Oxlee 's towers - to be built from recycled materials - draw inspiration from three nearby Italianate towers which are 200 years old and stand 80 feet ( 25 m ) tall .
' Striking design '
The design , by Garnett Netherwood Architects , beat more than 30 entries in a competition run by Holbeck Urban Village , a business community backed by Leeds City Council .
The towers are a brilliant idea , says wildlife presenter Chris Packham Organisers say they launched the competition because bird song has all but vanished from many cities and towns and wildlife generally is in decline .
Marketing officer Leanne Buchan says the " village " community wanted to respect the bio-diversity of the area during its regeneration .
Otters have returned to the area for the first time in 30 years and she hopes to see butterflies , bats and bees plus swifts , house martins and other nesting birds , attracted by raised beds .
" We went on tour with a conservation officer to see what wildlife to invite in and sustain once here , and what was needed from the habitat , " she says .
" Part of it is for people to enjoy the wildlife around them , but it 's more about taking responsibility for things ... to safeguard it for future generations . "
The winning tower design would be " striking " , she says , and could well become an iconic piece of architecture .
THE URBAN WILDLIFE SQUEEZE Swifts , house martins and collard doves fell 15 % from 1994 to 2006 - house sparrows by a third Allotments - valuable green spaces in urban areas - have declined by 80 % in 50 years
The natterjack toad is found at only 50 sites in England , a fall of 80 % in the last century
The small tortoiseshell butterfly has declined 81 % between 2003 and 2007 Urban land cover in England is projected to rise more than 1 % to 11.9 % by 2016 Source : Natural England
And conservationists will ensure they attracted the right animals and assess whether to fence off the towers .
House sparrow numbers are down 64 % in 25 years , the UK 's 17 species of bat are all now protected by law and there are just 56 butterfly species remaining in Britain , figures show .
Few know that better than presenter Chris Packham , who is joining BBC 2's wildlife programme Springwatch .
He thinks the towers are a " brilliant " idea , partly because modern urban houses do n't have holes to double up as nests .
" Hopefully there will be room for bats , small nesting birds like great tits or blue tits and insects , " he says .
Other towers built for barn owls have managed to also attract kestrels , he adds , and there is no reason why this design should n't work , although it wo n't be to every animal 's liking .
" Foxes and badgers are quite wary and do n't want to be disturbed by dogs or people , so they tend to go to railway cuttings and embankments or quiet gardens , " he explains .
These fantastic tower block designs provide all the needs for an aspiring city dweller
Peter Nottage
Natural England Conservation group Natural England believes the " fantastic " design could potentially prove as successful as garden bird boxes , and has offered its expertise to help .
Peter Nottage , regional director for Yorkshire and Humber , says wildlife should be recorded before a project goes ahead that could change its balance .
" It 's important to carry out surveys so we know what 's living there , how it could be affected or how the design could be developed to enhance the habitat for the existing wildlife .
" We 'd want to make sure that anything rare was protected and given the opportunity to thrive .
" These fantastic tower block designs provide all the needs for an aspiring city dweller - a trendy home made from renewable materials , somewhere close to the best food and watering holes and a place to socialise .
" In the right places and after careful planning , there is no reason why these towers could not provide homes for wildlife . "
He said those most likely to benefit are nesting birds , with nooks and crannies for insects , and other less mobile animals .
A selection of your comments appears below .
This may be a good idea but how will the towers be protected from the human wildlife .
They are the type of thing the local denizens will love to vandalise .
Peter , Cheltenham , UK
One thing seems badly missed , all these animals at the bottom of the food chain need large areas of greenery , forest etc to survive .
They disappear as the food is not available to them .
The foxes live on the plant eaters .
Without large numbers of them , no meat eaters are possible .
Also , most animals will not live close to each either , is a rabbit or bird going to live in the same tower as a fox ?
It seems neat , but the massive loss of countryside is the problem that this cannot fix - more ' birdhouses ' does n't really fix anything ...
David Huntley , Canada , ex-UK
It is a simple but an excellent idea .
The concept is not new as it is used commonly in skyscrapers in Metros .
For vertically mobile birds , insects and animals including monkeys , it should be an easy success .
For other land animals it may need guard rails to keep them from falling .
These will have to be close to water bodies which can be frequented by the animals .
We will also have to have a way of cleaning the animal refuse and those animals which will die .
I do not know how we can keep roots from penetrating deep into the walls and weakening them .
I am sure more issues will be found when these towers are made .
But I am also sure some ways will be found around most .
All said , it is worth a try .
Sanjay Sood , Bangalore I 've seen something similar to this in an area close to me , using renewable resources with minimum effort .
Fantastic - looking structures .
Trees .
Liam , Gillingham , Kent
At first this seemed an appealing idea , until I thought of the magnificent trees where I live that provide this same habitat free of charge .
I think you need a plant - a- tree - in - the - city campaign , not a tower campaign .
With all your magnificent gardeners , trees would flourish .
Mary Cowmeadow , Plymouth , Michigan , U.S.A .
At last someone with common sense and vision , do not let town councillors or MPs get involved or it will take years and cost a fortune .
This is the best thing I have read in a long time , hope other towns / cities take it up

Daylight Atheism readers undoubtedly remember Kent Hovind , a bottom - feeder creationist with a degree from a diploma mill and a phony $ 250,000 offer for anyone who could offer “ proof of evolution ” .
You probably also remember that Hovind is currently serving a ten - year prison sentence for federal tax evasion .
But what you might not know is that Hovind ’s son , Eric , has a blog of his own – and judging by a recent post , the wingnut apple does n’t fall far from the crazy tree .
The post , titled “ Welfare Poem ” , is an unabashedly racist piece of drivel , written in deliberately broken English and demonizing immigrants as lazy , shiftless parasites .
Here ’s an excerpt ( brief , since I ca n’t stand to quote much from garbage like this ) :
Finally , white guy moves away ,
Now I buy his house , and then I say ,
‘ Find more aliens for house to rent . ’
And in the yard I put a tent .
Send for family they just trash ,
But they , too , draw the welfare cash !
Everything is very good ,
And soon we own the neighborhood .
We have hobby it ’s called breeding ,
Welfare pay for baby feeding .
Surely this is what Jesus would have wanted !
I do n’t know who originally wrote this racist filth , but a Google search for “ welfare poem ” finds that the number - two result is a copy of the poem quoted approvingly at the white supremacist website Stormfront .
Hovind ’s post ends with a bogus quote claiming that immigrants make more in welfare than retirees make in pension – as Snopes points out , this was originally written about Canada , not the U.S. , and it was n’t even true then .
You may have noticed I linked to a Google cache version of the page , because Hovind later deleted the original post after he realized that he was going off - script .
Ardent creationists are n’t supposed to be racists ; it shines a light on parts of their movement ’s history that they ’d just as soon see forgotten .
Lest you think the Curse of Ham is just a relic of ancient history , here ’s the father of the modern creationist movement , Henry Morris , in a book that was republished as recently as 1991 :
“ Yet the prophecy again has its obverse side .
Somehow they have only gone so far and no farther .
The Japhethites and Semites have , sooner or later , taken over their territories , and their inventions , and then developed them and utilized them for their own enlargement .
Often the Hamites , especially the Negroes , have become actual personal servants or even slaves to the others .
Possessed of a genetic character concerned mainly with mundane matters , they have eventually been displaced by the intellectual and philosophical acumen of the Japhethites and the religious zeal of the Semites . ” ( source )
In his carefully phrased non-apology , Hovind claimed that his original post was meant to express only “ a simple dislike for lazy people who USE the government , do not work , and expect to get paid for doing nothing ” .
This would only have been plausible if the poem had n’t so prominently depicted people of color as the sole perpetrators and referred to them as “ trash ” who wear “ turbans ” and who want to “ own the neighborhood ” by breeding prolifically and driving white people away .
Sentiments like this always bubble up from the sewers whenever racists think decent , good - hearted people are n’t watching .
Hovind ’s hasty backpedaling shows that he got caught red-handed , and knew it – but the next time this ignorant , hateful creationist claims to be a moral authority , remember his words .
WASHINGTON ( AP )  President Obama on Tuesday challenged Congress to pay for new increases in federal benefit programs as it goes rather than sink the nation deeper into a debt , calling it a matter of public responsibility .
Republicans lashed back that Obama is no voice of fiscal restraint as the deficit soars .
The president 's plan would require Congress to pay for new entitlement spending , such as health care , by raising taxes or coming up with budget cuts — a " pay - as - you - go " system that would have the force of law .
Under the proposal , if new spending or tax reductions are not offset , there would be automatic cuts in so - called mandatory programs — although Social Security payments and some other programs would be exempt .
Not noted by the president : Tuesday 's plan is a watered - down version of the so - called " PAYGO " rules proposed just last month in his own budget plan .
That version would have required , on average , all affected legislation to be paid for in the very first year .
The new plan only requires such legislation to be financed over the coming decade .
That mirrors congressional rules and reflects the likelihood that health care reform will add to the deficit in the early years .
Obama said the principle is simple : Congress can only spend a dollar if it saves a dollar somewhere else .
" It is no coincidence that this rule was in place when we moved from record deficits to record surpluses in the 1990s — and that when this rule was abandoned , we returned to record deficits that doubled the national debt , " Obama said , flanked at the White House by supportive Democratic lawmakers .
" Entitlement increases and tax cuts need to be paid for , " he said .
" They 're not free , and borrowing to finance them is not a sustainable long - term policy . "
Republican leaders , critical of the Obama - championed $ 787 billion stimulus package and other deficit spending , called the president disingenuous .
" It 's as if the administration and these Democrat leaders are living in an alternate universe , " said House Republican Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia .
" The quickest way to save money is to stop recklessly spending it . "
The pay - as - you - go rules would not apply to discretionary spending — the portion that Congress decides how to spend each year — which accounts for almost 40 % of the budget , said Peter Orszag , the administration 's budget director .
Obama 's call for binding legislation comes as a reward to moderate - to - conservative " Blue Dog " Democrats who are big believers in pay - as - you go .
Their votes were crucial to passing a congressional budget blueprint that generally follows Obama 's budget .
The House and Senate already have their own PAYGO rules , but have routinely found ways around them .
For example , a bill to effectively double GI Bill education benefits was enacted last year because of a loophole in congressional rules .
Obama 's " PAYGO " plan would also require future tax cuts to be financed by tax increases elsewhere in the code , though exceptions are made for extending President George W. Bush 's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts , as well as other tax cuts that are scheduled to expire .
The federal deficit is on pace to explode past $ 1.8 trillion this year , more than four times last year 's all - time high .
The deficit figures flow from the deep recession , the Wall Street bailout and the cost of the economic stimulus bill .
Obama has defended the massive stimulus plan as essential to helping pump some life back in the economy , one that is still shedding jobs but showing more signs of life in recent weeks .
" The fact is , there are few who are n't distressed by deficits , " Obama said .
He said restoring a pay - as - you - go method under law would force lawmakers to deal not just with the politics and crises of the day , but also remain fixed on the nation 's long - term financial health .

Reportée une première fois , la visite en France du Premier ministre israélien Netanyahou est annoncée pour le 24 juin .
Cet homme , à la tête d’un gouvernement extrémiste composé de va-t - en - guerre affichés et de racistes notoires , constitue non seulement un grave danger pour la paix mais il est le symbole même de sa négation .
Reçu par le Président Barak Obama , il a réaffirmé face à lui son opposition absolue à tout arrêt de la colonisation des terres palestiniennes ainsi que sa volonté de passer outre le droit international pour le règlement du conflit israélo - palestinien .
Non seulement il ne veut pas la paix mais il entend mener , aussi bien dans les Territoires palestiniens que dans la région même , une politique qui tient en un mot : le fait accompli .
Sa réception par le Président français est totalement négative alors que celui- ci tient un double langage : s’il lui est bien difficile de s’affranchir du droit international en paroles , dans les faits il soutient activement une vision totalement autre .
En témoigne notamment son engagement forcené pour « rehausser » les relations entre l’Union européenne avec Israël , et ceci sans poser la moindre condition .
L’ide même de mettre un terme à l’impunité dont bénéficie Israël lui est étrangère .
La visite , dans ces conditions , du Premier ministre israélien constituera pour ce dernier un encouragement à poursuivre cette politique et aboutira à la légitimer .
C’est ce que cherche Netanyahou en venant en France et c’est ce que Sarkozy va lui offrir .
C’est pourquoi cette visite constitue un défi grave lancé contre la paix et contre les Palestiniens .
Si le président français voulait promouvoir la paix dans cette région , alors il n’enchainerait pas les visites des dirigeants israéliens actuels à Paris en excluant , à l ’inverse , toute idée de discuter avec le Hamas qu’il tient pour un mouvement « terroriste ».
C’est pourquoi cette visite n’est en rien une visite favorable à la paix .
Ce n’est pas son objectif .
Et c’est pourquoi nous sommes opposés à la présence à Paris de ce bien sinistre personnage .
Travailler à la paix au Proche - Orient suppose une toute autre approche .
Ce n’est pas en soutenant les faucons qu’on y parviendra .
C’est l’évidence même .
En conséquence , l’AFPS appelle à manifester contre sa venue .
Elle appelle les démocrates et les pacifistes à se rassembler le 23 juin à 18 heures 30 au Métro Franklin Roosevelt ( angle avenue Montaigne et Champs - Elysées )
.
Ensemble , il faut dire deux fois « Non ! »
Non à la politique de Netanyahou
Non à la dérive dangereuse de la politique française au Proche - Orient
Ce double « Non » sera le meilleur moyen d’agir et de dire « Oui » pour la paix au Proche et au Moyen Orient !
Useful TRUTH
' Truth about Moldova ' from another angle ...
Added by GordonAten on Jun 02 , 2009 | Visited by 7071 | Voted by 89 persons
This link from the Truthsquare site I am referring to , was sent to me by a Moldovan girlfriend of mine , a sweet and smart lady of the new generation that has recently opposed the incumbent communist regime in Moldova .
As I 've traveled within the past five years a few times in Romania and in Moldova and talked to both her relatives , simple people from the Moldovan countryside , and to many other people , I 've made up my own impressions about the Moldovan events that suddenly ' enjoyed ' two articles on the front page of Financial Times within a week : one about the imminent economic collapse of the country 's economy and other - about the political side of the events and Romania 's role in it .
As I am not very well acquainted with the economy of Moldova ( though something must be really wrong there , if in the poorest country in Europe prices for food and services and real estate are higher than in many European countries ! ) , I will mostly focus on the Moldo - Russia - Romania issues .
The small Moldova has suddenly got its extreme importance , because of far reaching geopolitical implications in case somehow its status changes .
This region is potentially even more dangerous than Yugoslavia , as the recent history has left explosive traces in respect of borders , religious and cultural divisions : Romania has got a big part of Hungarian territories and several millions of Hungarians within , Ukraine has got a piece of Poland and even more questionably and illegally parts of Big Moldova - Southern Bassarabia and Northern Bucovina , Moldova has Transnistria with its separatist pro-Russian sentiments , there is a Moldova region in Romania , which also used to be a part of the big Moldova principality , not far from here there is the Crimean peninsula , which was also given to Ukraine in a doubtful way - you name it .
Then , there are disputes between languages and religions .
If something explodes on this minefield , the shock - waves of such a change may have a long lasting devastating effect .
It would be logical to assume that if the countries from this region want to preserve peace and stability , no provocative actions or declarations should be undertaken .
So , what and who stands behind the recent unrest in Molodva ?
The opposition , which definitely had nothing to gain from these provocations ?
Far from that .
A wise man will analyze what has happened in reality and would realize that President Voronin just smartly used these events , about which he undoubtedly had been informed in advance by Putin and Moldovan security services ( otherwise that security services have to be dismissed ) , to successfully discredit the opposition .
Three sides could have gained from the events in Kishinev , had they been more violent and had they led to a forced change of power in Moldova : Romania , Russia and Transnistrian region of Moldova , the latter two having ultimately similar interests .
Romania could have finally made a breakthrough in its intentions to get a stronghold in Moldova and ' re - uniting ' the country , and Russia would have received a ' second Kaliningrad ' region in the back of Ukraine , which in its turn also seems like falling apart from economic and political chaos .
It means that the events in Moldova was probably a rare case when the interests of the Russian special services coincided with interests of Romanian special services , and since Soviet KGB had a lot of good contacts in socialist Romania , those links have proved to be useful once more .
If that is right , then Russia is playing a dangerous game being lured into a trap , like Afghanistan .
Russia now is in pretty bad shape economically and demographically to withstand a shock - wave that might cause fires until the Urals and Far East .
Besides , Transnistria is already living on Russia 's ' drug needle ' , being indebted more than a billion of dollars for energy supplies ( they say , that Transnistria is getting money from its population for gas , but never pays the gas to Gazprom ! - a golden mine for local and Russian mafia ! ) .
As for Romania , this seems to be a more complicated story .
Romanian President Basescu 's desire to add a big part of Moldova to his country is quite obvious .
If a few years ago he openly supported Voronin ( in 2005 ) , now he even does n't try to hide his ambitions to get Moldova .
But can it be really done ?
And should it be done ?
Yes , it can and no , it can not .
And it should n't !
It cannot , because there are no clear historic grounds for this , the question of ' who was first and who was bigger and more important ' being quite disputable .
While surfing internet about the history of Moldova and history of Romania ( for example , Wikipedia ) , one may notice that actually Moldova has not less rights to consider itself a truly independent and unique state .
Especially the last few hundred years have left a huge imprint on Moldova 's history , which was quite unfair to this heavenly piece of land with kind , simple and open people .
Another specific of Moldova is that it has been populated by many nations , who liked the welcoming people , mild climate and excellent wines and foods : Russians , Ukrainians , Poles , Armenians , Germans , Austrians , Jews , Bulgarians , Turks ( Gagauz ) , the last two having their own regions and wide groups of villages .
There were so many Jews in Bessarabia that the Jewish movement Bund was even considering creation of a Jewish land there about 100 years ago ( by the way , they say the current Foreign Minsiter of Israel is from Moldova ) .
And last , but not least , the impact of Russian culture and Russian Orthodox church are so great until now , that ignoring this and making parallels with unification of East and West Germany would be a big mistake .
Some other reasons and considerations make a unification of Moldova and Romania quite impossible nowadays :
Moldovans have a kind of fear that in case they unite with Romania , they will be treated as second class population , and quite often Romanians give grounds to think like that ;
The medium and big size businesses are not interested in getting under neighboring state 's umbrella .
The bigger market is evidently very attractive , but the unification may become a threat to their property and operations , especially in those cases , when this property was acquired by fraud ;
Moldovans are mostly those who left the country in search for better life .
So , the fate of their country is again in hands of Russian speaking population .
After some years of Romanian language revival , now Russian language is becoming again predominant on the streets of Kishinev , in cinemas , etc .
Ask someone not in Kishinev , but , say , in Balti , or Cahul , or Comrat , if they consider themselves romanians , and they would just laugh at you .
Only a minor part of mostly young students studying in Romania may truly consider themselves Romanians ;
Neither Ukraine , nor Europe or Turkey would like to get an even bigger and stronger Romania , which is already a source of many troubles and headaches in the EU .
Thus , when President Voronin so courageously rebuffs President Basescu's and Romania 's attacks on Moldova 's identity , he proves himself as a well - informed and supported politician .
More than that , Voronin 's image as a true statesman only gains , especially compared to those ' politicians ' who claim that only uniting Moldova with Romania will save the country , who are perceived to be either political losers or traitors ( what a true politician wants to come to power to disintegrate his own country ?! ) .
And Yes , it can , because :
Romania has massively given its passports to Moldovans .
And though it was more a way for Moldovans to get into Europe without visa , sooner or later this double citizenship may play its role .
During their 10 years in power communists have failed to deliver any sensible rise in living standards , with corruption and economic hardships leading people to believe that their only rescue may be to rapidly become a part of EU through Romania .
During their 10 years in power communists have mostly used force and internal political pressure , completely ignoring not only the importance of building a sustainable and long - lasting democratic system of checks and balances , but also having failed to promote a state policy of national dignity and proud .
There are so many talented people in that country , there are so many unique places and products in Moldova - but they failed to simply ' market ' it and make Moldovans feel proud of being Moldovans .
That is why the recent events in Moldova not only exposed a huge gap and misunderstanding between old style dogmatic communists ( even with a few younger party members on their list , who are blindly and obediently following indications of the old elite ) , and the new free internet generation , but also showed how far from true democracy and rule of law Moldova is , which in combination with an ailing and deformed economy may bring the country to a collapse and annihilation .
To avoid this , communists should review their policy ( if at all possible ) and start promoting and supporting a new national smart political elite .
And no , Moldova should n't unite Romania , because the history and political circumstances have finally given this small beautiful and special nation a unique opportunity to build a state , so why lose it ?
Because the EU and Romania , Russia and Ukraine - all would only win from having a neutral stable Moldova , which is an ideally located bridgehead for any kind of business between Europe and former Soviet Union .
Because a review of borders in this region may not end with reviewing the borders of Moldova only .
Is n't it true ?
The recent release of Overlord II reminds me how fundamentally I enjoy playing the mirthful villain .
A role I can never really take on in a game like KOTOR or Fallout where villainous actions tend to be sadistic or cruel in very concrete terms , the more whimsical and candy - coated my trip to the dark side , the happier I am .
This approach is defined by Bullfrog ’s Dungeon Keeper , a classic PC game by any definition .
I would have words with anyone who suggests that malevolence with comedic overtones has ever been quite so well explored .
Pistols at dawn , I would say , and then in a very Dungeon Keeper fashion I would shoot them in the back , cackeling with glee as I waited for cavorting imps to drag their carcass to the graveyard .
Casting the player in the role of an evil disembodied hand taked with creating an impervious and trap laden dungeon was , frankly , a stroke of genius .
If I were to chart Peter Molyneaux ’s career on graph paper , here is the mountain peak .
What helped to define and separate DK was that it did not put the player into the role of construction worker so much as architect .
While creatures were not exactly autonomous , they would carry about their own mischief outside of direct intervention , even at times to the detriment of the player .
The strategy of laying out an imposing and sophisticated dungeon became a critical foundation of the game , and one had to make sure that it was appropriately devised to serve many needs .
At any moment , one had to manage their finances , make sure enemies were blocked out of sensitive areas , keep fighting minions separated and create easy access to key services .
I suppose when you write it out like that , it can be hard to understand precisely why this is fun , but a dungeon should n't just be a big haphazard cavern .
It should be a home ; an evil home .
Embracing the pleasure of evil , and sometimes just taking a minute to slap an imp around for just no good reason at all , was a new and devilishly welcome exploration of gameplay .
Though Bullfrog was folded a few years later and much of its staff sent to the pits to work on Harry Potter games ( true ) before the completion of DK 3 , the original still stands apart , and is my Classic Game of the Week .
In his baggy shorts hanging below the knees , Puma sneakers and spiky hair , Wang Kangkang is hip to the present , clueless about the past .
Although he comes often to see the nightly ceremony of the Chinese flag being lowered at Tiananmen Square , he does n’t know what happened here in 1989 and does n’t really care .
“ Well , it happened before I was born , ” the 19 - year - old said , looking down at his sneakered feet as the crowd shuffled out of the vast expanse of concrete on a balmy evening .
“ In any case , it ’s history .
Why should we dwell on the past ? ”
On June 4 , 1989 , hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed as the army made its final push to crush a student - led pro-democracy demonstration in Tiananmen Square .
As the 20th anniversary approaches , the government has fortified its extraordinary information blockade on the bloody crackdown .
Anybody in the country trying to search on the Internet for information about the square , one of Beijing ’s most popular tourist attractions , is likely to get the message “ This page can not be displayed . ”
Advertisement
But to a large extent , the efforts are overkill : Apathy as much as censorship has pushed the events of 1989 into the dark recesses of history .
The young Chinese -- one graying activist calls them “ the stupid generation ” -- remain willfully ignorant about the past .
The pro-democracy demonstrations of 1989 , to many of the young , seem so , well , 1980s -- a reflection of a time when communism was collapsing into the rubbish heap of concrete that was the Berlin Wall .
From the perspective of 2009 ’s global economic crisis , the Chinese system that represses political choice and speech in exchange for economic freedom does n’t look too bad to young people here .
“ Our generation does n’t feel so much pressure as our parents .
Even the global recession has n’t hit us much .
It shows what a good country China is , ” said Hou Jue , 26 , who along with his friend Wang is studying to be a bartender .

Although he lives only a few blocks from Tiananmen Square , he acknowledges that he is “ not too clear ” about 1989 ’s events and does n’t feel a need to learn more .
“ If the government tells us as Chinese citizens we should not know about something and should n’t be searching material , we should be responsible and obey , ” Hou said .
The activists of the 1980s , many of them still involved with political issues , despair over the attitudes of the younger generation .
“ This is the stupid generation .
They were raised on Coca - Cola and Western movies and they ’re very isolated from their country ’s history , ” said Zhang Shihe , 56 , a blogger and political activist .

Phelim Kine , a senior Asia analyst for Human Rights Watch , said the indifference of young Chinese about Tiananmen Square was more a result of censorship than willful ignorance .
“ People ca n’t care if they do n’t know , ” Kine said .
But many do know and still do n’t care .
Zhou Shuyang , 23 , who works in marketing for a European company , speaks fluent English and is tech - savvy enough to get around the “ Great Firewall of China ” and read whatever she likes online .
Advertisement
But she fully supports the government ’s efforts to restrict the information .
“ If there is too much freedom , all sorts of false rumors can spread on the Internet , ” she said .
“ It ’s not easy to control such a big and diverse country as China . ”
Zhou added , “ For me right now , I feel satisfied with my life , my country .
I seldom think about politics . ”
If anything , when young Chinese raise their voices , they are more likely to be chanting patriotic slogans , demonstrating in favor of their government rather than against .

The largest mass gathering in Beijing in recent memory came a week after the May 12 , 2008 , quake in Sichuan province , when tens of thousands of mourners poured into Tiananmen , raising their fists and shouting , “ Stand up , China . ”
“ The whole square was filled with people crying , shouting , waving flags , ” recalled Zhou , who said it was the only time in her life she had attended a demonstration .
At times , the intense patriotism of the younger generation spills over into outbursts of nationalism .
That happened last year in the run-up to the Summer Olympics in Beijing when free - Tibet protests disrupted the relay of the Olympic torch , infuriating many Chinese .
During the height of the demonstrations in April , the website anti-cnn.com was launched by a recent engineering graduate of Beijing ’s Qinghua University to protest what he believes is anti-China bias in the Western news media .
It still receives about 500,000 hits daily and is the best - known of many new websites catering to young nationalists .

“ They call us the post - 1980s youth , the April youth , the Olympic torch generation or the ‘ Bird ’s Nest ’ generation , ” said the website ’s founder , 24 - year - old Rao Jin , referring to the Olympic stadium .
( Or rather , he “ wrote . ”
The interview was conducted by e-mail at his request . )
“ Our patriotism springs from a heartfelt love for the motherland , a belief in Chinese traditional culture , pride in being Chinese and confidence in China ’s future . ”
That confidence was reflected in a poll published last year by the Washington - based Pew Research Center , which found 86 % of Chinese satisfied with their country ’s direction .
It was the highest rate of satisfaction among 24 countries surveyed .
( By contrast , 23 % of Americans described themselves as satisfied with their country ’s direction . )
“ The younger the people , the more they support the Chinese government , ” said Xu Wu , who first wrote about what he calls the Chinese “ cyber-nationalists . ”
A Beijing native who was a student at Tiananmen in 1989 , Xu believes that the government can’t necessarily count in the long term on the support of the fenqing , or angry youth , as they are sometimes known .
Advertisement
“ They are like a double - edged sword without a handle : very difficult to control , ” Xu said .
A prolonged recession that leaves large numbers of young people unemployed , for example , could radically change their sentiments .
Michael Anti , 34 , a Nanjing - born blogger , also believes that the younger generation is just biding its time .
“ The Chinese are very practical , ” he said .
“ They know if they protest right now it will destroy their middle - class lifestyle .
But when the timing is right , nobody will refuse democracy . ”

Eliot Gao and Nicole Liu of The Times ’ Beijing Bureau contributed to this report .
Many readers will recall that on March 16 , 2009 , I posted an article titled Perspective of an Anonymous Patent Examiner .
That post was and has been one of the most popular posts ever on the IPWatchdog.com Blog .
Therefore , I was quite pleased to receive another e-mail from the same anonymous patent examiner over the weekend .
Not only is this type of exchange good for readership , but it is refreshing to hear that there is at least one patent examiner who is concerned about where the Patent Office is heading and is interested in trying to fashion solutions .
In reality , there are probably many patent examiners who are concerned about the current state of affairs at the US Patent Office .
I know retired patent examiners and officials who have left the Patent Office share this concern as well .
It is easy to lose sight of the fact that there are people within the Patent Office who do still care when the allowance rate is so low , application pendency is on the rise and there are reports that due to sham quality control some examiners have flat out stopped issuing patents altogether .
In any event , what the anonymous patent examiner had to say this time will shock you no doubt .
It seems that the budget crisis is so bad at the USPTO that the HVAC system will not be operating on Sundays any more .
Unbelievable !
The anonymous patent examiner had much more to say than to simply explain that things are getting extremely bad at the USPTO .
The examiner also presented an interesting idea with respect to how to try and handle the backlog .
I like what he / she wrote , and this patent examiner would like to hear our thoughts .
I am not 100 % sure I would fashion a plan that is the same as suggested , but I have suggested something quite similar and I think it is an excellent place to start any debate on how to both get back to being the patent granting authority and address the backlog all at the same time .
So , without further ado , here is the message I received from the anonymous patent examiner :
I am writing because things have gotten worse at the PTO and I wanted to get your opinion as a Patent Attorney on a potential solution that I came up with .
Last week a memo was sent to everyone in the office that indicated that the maximum overtime hours would be reduced for revenue generating , patent examining activities and that on Sundays the office will be not be using HVAC systems in all the PTO buildings at the Carlyle campus .
These actions show how dire the PTO ’s budget situation truly is .
However , as an examiner who is truly interested in issuing quality patents and who converses with applicant ’s and applicant ’s representatives on a weekly basis to accomplish this goal , I present the following pilot program which would solve the PTO ’s , applicant ’s , and applicant ’s representatives problems .
The pilot program would require the applicant to draft the invention ’s entire application except for the claims , with or without the assistance of an attorney .
After paying a higher fee in excess of the current base patent filing fees , the applicant has the option to have one independent claim drafted by an examiner who would potentially examine that patent .
The one claim would be drafted only after the examiner has had a preliminary interview with the applicant , the applicant ’s representative , or both and has completed a search of the prior art .
The search is done in an effort to determine the line between the disclosed invention ( as opposed to the claimed invention ) and the prior art .
Along with the one independent claim , the applicant will receive prior art that reads on the disclosed invention and an argument as to how the independent claim overcomes the prior art .
Under this program the standard examiner production requirements would have to be halved or quartered due to the time required to do preliminary interviews and draft a quality independent claim , but the number of cases allowed per year by an examiner on this program would be higher than the allowance rate in the examiner core , because this examiner ’s only job is to do quality searches based on disclosures and draft allowable claims .
This pilot program would put the burden of examination back on the examiner ( unlike the Accelerated Examination Program ) , the burden of disclosing the invention as detailed as possible on the applicant ( especially in pioneering and cutting edge inventions ) , and the burden of case prosecution mostly on the attorney ( who still has to draft dependent claims , other statuory class embodiments and file other prosecution related documents ) .
Additionally , instead of working with claims that are initially rejectable the applicant starts with an allowable claimed invention and works towards broadening the one independent claim ’s language and considering what to claim in dependent claims .
Having drafted independent claims off the record for applicant ’s and applicant ’s representatives on several occasions , I know that this saves everyone time and leads to a better claimed invention .
Furthermore , while the claims I ’ve drafted are usually substantially specific , I ’ve never had an applicant argue that I did n’t adequately describe their invention .
Therefore , having seen claims that overcome the prior art of record both cited , known , and obvious and that overcome any 101 issues ( regardless of the current interpretation of 101 ) , it is a lot easier to arrive at broader claims that are still allowable .
I guess I just would like to know what your opinion of this program is and whether your colleagues would be open to such a program .
So let the debate begin .
I will be following up with my thoughts and ideas over the next day or two .
Google India told a court in India on Monday that it was not liable for defamatory posts on Blogger , as it is not a party to an agreement between Google , the parent company of both Google India and Blogger , and those who use the blogging service .
The Indian company made the statement in connection with a case filed by Ashwin Mehta , a cardiologist in Mumbai , alleging that he had been defamed by some blogs that used Google 's Blogger service .
Mehta has also filed for damages to be paid by Google India .
The blogging service cannot monitor and control what is being posted all the time , Google India told the Bombay High Court , according to people present in the courtroom .
Google India also argued that it was not liable in the case as Blogger is owned by parent company Google .
In an earlier order , a judge of the High Court restrained Google India from hosting any blog that defamed Mehta .
The current submission by Google India came up in connection with an appeal against that order .
The next hearing of Google India 's appeal is July 7 .
Pointing out that Google India is a subsidiary of Google , Mehta 's lawyer Yatin Shah said on Tuesday that Google 's stand will hurt affected individuals in India , as it suggests that they will have to approach U.S. courts for any remedies .
Foreign Internet companies when dragged to court in India have typically tried to pass the blame to their parent company in the U.S. , said Sabu Mathew George , an activist .
" This is a legal fiction as these same Internet companies tell the U.S. Congress that they are bound by local laws in China and other countries that they operate , " George said .
George complained last year to India 's Supreme Court that some Internet companies including Google were promoting techniques and products for selecting the sex of babies in India through advertising and links on their search engines .
Such advertisements are illegal in India .
Google said it is not able to comment as the case is in progress .
The cases Google and some other Internet companies are facing in India also bring into focus the issue of the liability of intermediaries for third - party content .
Google has in the past objected to provisions in India 's Information Technology Act 2000 which made intermediaries like ISPs ( Internet service providers ) , website hosting companies , search engines , email services , and social networks , liable for their users ' content .
Section 79 of the Act held network service providers liable unless they can prove that the offense or contravention was committed without their knowledge or that they had exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such offense or contravention .
A new Information Technology ( Amendment ) Act 2008 , passed in December , has however amended the provision of Section 79 to free intermediaries of liability for any third party information , data or communication link made available or hosted by the intermediary .
" By and large intermediaries have been removed from liability , " said Pavan Duggal , a cyber law consultant and advocate in India 's Supreme Court , in an interview last week .
The onus of proving that the intermediary has not shown due diligence , or that the offense or contravention was done with the connivance of the intermediary now shifts to the individual complainant , Duggal added .
The amendment blocks out effective remedies for ordinary users , as they will not have access to records of the intermediary , and will never be able to prove that the intermediary conspired or abetted in the commission of an offense , Duggal added .
The new law however still requires Google to pull down content that is found objectionable , Shah said .
Kojima ’s mystery site has been updated once again , but this time the timer is gone .
The site is now the official E3 2009 site .
It opens with the clouds shown yesterday then pans down to a graffiti wall .
On this wall there are a few things .
First it says E3 Expo 2009 June 2 - 4 , 2009 LA Convention center .
Now for the more interesting stuff .
There are two posters on the wall one for the upcoming game Metal Gear Solid : Rising , and when selected pulls up the poster full screen .
The second poster is more of a mystery all it says is “ MASK ” ?
Who are you ?
When selected another screen pops up with a picture of a mask and some music playing that is all .
Will this be revealed at the Sony conference ?
Who knows , but it does look like there is plenty of room to add more posters to that wall .
As well as the posters there is updates scrolling acrossed the bottom of the screen .
So be sure to stay tuned to PSLS for any breaking news .

Historical note ( Jan. 7 , 2014 ) -
This ancient post still gets several hundred to a thousand page views per month !
And , unsurprisingly , the Clojure community still replies to the criticisms therein with ... only insults .
This is what comes of a product fundamentally brain - damaged at birth .
I find
Clojure is the False Lisp , which Reeketh of the Cube Farm .
I do n't care if everybody really is more productive in Clojure than in Common Lisp .
The latter is not my standard of comparison ( Symbolics Genera , the state of the art , is .
Or , if you want something that is distinctly inferior but is currently available on the market : Mathematica . )
Clojure is the gutted and zombie - reanimated corpse of a dream .
The cult of Good Enough which seems to pervade all of modern computing has finally chewed its way through to the Lisp community , with Clojure as the result .
I am tired of this abomination being hailed as the future of Lisp .
Aficionados of real Lisps , such as myself , will keep hoping , dreaming , and working on systems which do not betray the original virtues of the language .
Edit : Update
Ahmadinejad , beware :
The registration for the Iranian presidency race was completed Saturday night , with quite a few interesting figures arriving at the election head headquarters over the weekend to try their luck and enjoy free publicity .
Among the candidates , that included were a man dressed as a cowboy and a Saddam Hussein lookalike , was a 12 - year - old boy who according to local media reports was the only one to submit a written work plan as to his policies should he be elected .
Iranian Elections Conservative rival raps Iran president on economy Associated Press Former head of Iran 's elite Revolutionary Guards Mohsen Rezaei accuses President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of pushing country ' on edge of a precipice ' , vows to ' save ' economy if elected Conservative rival raps Iran president on economy
Reporters were surprised to see Mouzuni arrive at the election headquarters with his father .
But despite his young age , they treated him like an ordinary candidate and presented him with questions about Israel and the Iranian nuclear program .
As for Israel , there is no doubt that the child has been inspired by his current president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , in regards to ways to solve the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
According to Mouzuni , " I will buy Hawaii , Obama 's birthplace , from the United States and lease it to Israelis who will go live there – so that they do n’t kill the children in Gaza . "

' A president does n't have to know everything '
And what about the Iranian nuclear plan ?
The reporters asked the boy if he knew the meaning of " yellow cake " – one of the stages in the uranium enrichment process .
He replied that " a president does n’t have to know everything about nuclear energy and know how to enrich uranium himself .
He must know how to manage things . "
He added , " I have a lot of respect for the other candidates , but my goals are more important . "
The young candidate has already begun thinking about his future coalition , saying that " if my candidacy is approved I will appoint Ahmadinejad as my first deputy . "
He also promised not to appoint his father as a minister in his future government , and noted that his natural voters were " all the mothers of children " .
Jews cannot file candidacy
Some 250 candidates have filed the required forms for the presidential race – a drop compared to the last elections , which saw more than 1,000 potential candidates .
Over the past five days , every Iranian meeting several requirements was given the opportunity to submit his candidacy .
Those registering must be politicians or clerics , Shiite Muslims who are loyal to the values of the Islamic revolutions .
Jews , being members of a minority , cannot submit their candidacy .
The Guardian Council of the Constitution is expected to release the final list of approved candidates within 10 days .
The council is comprises of six legalists and six clerics who are not elected , but directly and indirectly appointed by Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the final say on every matter concerning the country .
Two more famous people who joined the presidency race on Saturday were former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi , who is considered the most serious candidate in the reformist movement , and former Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karroubi , who has small chances of winning .
Ahmadinejad himself filed his candidacy on Friday and said that he was " filled with hope " as to his chances to be reelected .
Meanwhile , Koresh Mouzuni is already making plans for the day after the elections .
Should the Guardian Council of the Constitution fail to approve his candidacy , he said , " I plan to start preparing for the next presidential elections . "
Cybercriminals have begun attacking a critical hole that Microsoft patched in its Internet Explorer 7 browser last week , corroborating the company 's warning that the vulnerability would be easy to exploit .
The exploit code is spread through a booby trapped Word document that ultimately installs information - stealing malware on unpatched machines , according to researchers .
The vulnerability is one of two IE flaws Microsoft patched last week .
The company warned at the time that " consistent exploit code " for the remote execution flaws was likely .
The attack is fairly primitive at the moment , because it involves the spamming of Word documents .
Security experts expect that to change .
" There is absolutely nothing preventing attackers from using the exploit in a drive - by attack ( and we can , unfortunately , expect that this will happen very soon ) , " Bojan Zdrnja , a handler at the Sans Internet Storm Center wrote here .
He went on to say the exploit code was the result of reverse engineering Microsoft 's patch .
The exploit code does have its innovations , however .
It funnels pilfered data to a website in China through an encrypted channel , for instance .
It also uses heavily obfuscated shell code and garbage collection , presumably to cover tracks .
The attack exploits MS09 - 002 , a remote execution flaw that is the result of improper handling of errors when attempting to access deleted objects .

The dollar slid to its weakest point since late September on Tuesday even as Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner , in Beijing , tried to reassure the Chinese government that its investments in $ 1 trillion of United States debt were secure .
But in the currency markets , investors who flocked to the safety of the dollar at the height of the financial crisis are beginning to shun the currency on concerns over inflation and the prospect of big buyers of United States debt losing their taste for Treasury notes .
The United States dollar index , which measures the dollar against other heavily traded currencies , fell to 78.41 .
One euro was worth about $ 1.43  its strongest position against the dollar since December .
Recent statements by Chinese officials have heightened fears that China will scale back its purchases of Treasury notes , which could make it more expensive for the United States to raise money .

A former official in the George H.W. Bush White House estimates that the bloated public and private debt in the US works out to $ 250,000 for every man , woman and child in the country .
David Walker , the former US Comptroller General , says that the federal debt level is approaching $ 55 trillion and if you add in the what is owed on the state and local levels — plus personal household debt — it adds up to $ 75 trillion in obligations .
Walker , who now heads the Peter G. Peterson Foundation , named for the co-founder of the Blackstone Group , warned that without fiscal restraint , Uncle Sam may be guaranteeing that our future is not as prosperous as our past .
At the $ 75 trillion deficit level a family of four owes $ 1 million , he said .
Earlier this year Walker wrote on Politico.com : “ Social Security and Medicare alone are already underfunded by about $ 44 trillion , or $ 146,000 per American , in today ’s dollars , and this number is growing on auto pilot every year by about $ 2 trillion , or $ 6,600 per American . ”
President Obama probably did n't anticipate that his brief dismissal of marijuana legalization during the online town hall would light up a potent movement of support for decriminalization .
The fact that he even addressed such a controversial and oft - ignored topic impressed some .
But the way he seemed to deride the question angered manywho quickly expressed their dissent online in website comments , on blogs and throughout social networks .
" There was one question that was voted on that ranked fairly high and that was whether legalizing marijuana would improve the economy and job creation , " the president said during the town hall , amongst a thunder of laughter from the crowd .
" And I do n't know what this says about the online audience . "
More laughter .
" The answer is , no , I do n't think that is a good strategy to grow our economy , " Obama said .
No further explanation given .

His short response was not only disconcerting for marijuana supporters but also a bit perplexing .

" She 's gone .
She now belongs to the ages , " Ryan O'Neal tells PEOPLE of the iconic TV star
Farrah Fawcett , who skyrocketed to fame as one of a trio of impossibly glamorous private eyes on TV’s Charlie ’s Angels , has died after a long battle with cancer .
She was 62 .
Fawcett died at 9:28 a.m. PST on Thursday at St. John ’s Heath Center in Santa Monica , Calif .
She was with longtime partner Ryan O’Neal , friend Alana Stewart , friend and hairdresser Mela Murphy and her doctor Lawrence Piro .
She had recently returned to St. John ’s for treatment of complications from anal cancer , first diagnosed three years ago .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
“ She ’s gone .
She now belongs to the ages , ” O’Neal tells PEOPLE , also confirming that she received the last rites of the Catholic Church .
“ She ’s now with her mother and sister and her God .
I loved her with all my heart .
I will miss her so very , very much .
She was in and out of consciousness .
I talked to her all through the night .
I told her how very much I loved her .
She ’s in a better place now . ”
Added O’Neal : “ She was with her team when she passed … Her eyes were open , but she did n’t say anything .
But you could see in her eyes that she recognized us . ”
Though O’Neal recently said that he and Fawcett had planned to wed , they did not tie the knot .
“ There just was n’t time , and Farrah was n’t in any condition to do it , ” says O’Neal .
Friends and family plan to honor Fawcett with a funeral service at a Catholic cathedral in Los Angeles in the next few days .
Like so much about Fawcett ’s life – including her bumpy relationship with O’Neal – her heroic struggle to beat the disease was closely followed by her legion of fans .
“ I ’ve watched her this past year fight with such courage and so valiantly , but with such humor , ” Fawcett ’s Charlie ’s Angels costar Kate Jackson told PEOPLE in November 2007 .
O’Neal , in particular , remained a steadfast supporter of Fawcett , who , despite her frailty , spent the last months of her life filming a TV documentary chronicling her illness , including several trips to Germany to undergo experimental treatment .
Fawcett is survived by her son with O’Neal , Redmond , 24 , who is currently serving a jail term in California after repeated drug offenses .
Redmond was not there at Fawcett ’s side when she died , but spoke to his mother on the phone and told her “ how much he loved her and asked her to please forgive him that he was so very , very sorry , ” O’Neal tells PEOPLE .
Texas Charmer
Blonde , blue - eyed and petite – and with a trademark mane as flowing and famous as the M.G.M. lion ’s – the Corpus Christi , Texas , native was born Feb.
2 , 1947 , the younger daughter of an oil - field contractor and his homemaker wife .
A magnet for male students at the University of Texas at Austin , Fawcett eventually set off for Hollywood .
Quickly noticed by casting agents , she began landing small parts in forgettable movies , such as 1970 ’s Myra Breckinridge , based on a gender - bending novel by Gore Vidal .
Her role : an ingenuous blonde .
In 1973 , Fawcett married actor Lee Majors , forever known as Col. Steve Austin on TV’s The Six Million Dollar Man .
Three years later , she appeared in the cult sci- fi film Logan ’s Run and began her stint with costars Jackson and Jaclyn Smith on Charlie ’s Angels .
Well - coiffed and scantily clad , the threesome created an instant sensation , with a weekly following of 23 million fans .
Fawcett moved on after just one season .
By then , she was already a phenomenon , having donned a one - piece red bathing suit and a perfect smile for her legendary pin-up poster , which sold a still - record 12 million copies .
“ I became famous almost before I had a craft , ” Fawcett told The New York Times in 1986 , four years after her divorce from Majors .
( By then , she was already involved with Ryan O’Neal . )
“ I did n’t study drama at school .
I was an art major .
Suddenly , when I was doing Charlie ’s Angels , I was getting all this fan mail , and I did n’t really know why .
I do n’t think anybody else did , either . ”
Bumpy Film Career
Though she left TV for what was assumed to be greener pastures – feature films – Fawcett ’s initial three big - screen vehicles all crash - landed .
Her first , 1978 ’s Somebody Killed Her Husband , was lampooned in MAD magazine under the title , Somebody Killed Her Career .
It took some serious dramatic TV roles , including that of a battered wife in 1984 ’s The Burning Bed ( which earned her an Emmy nomination ) , as well as starring in small - screen biopics about pioneering photojournalist Margaret Bourke - White and ill - fated Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton , for Fawcett to bounce back .
“ What would you do if someone said to you , ‘ You ’re so popular right now that you can be on the cover of every magazine , but if you do that , you might get overexposed and a backlash will develop ’ ? ”
Fawcett told The Times after she had emerged from one of the valleys of her career .

The theory that everyone in the world is six friendships away from everyone else is regarded by many as a myth .
So what happens when the theory is put to the test ?
The thought that all 6.9 billion people on the planet could be closely connected to one another through their network of friends has a long - held fascination .
For decades , scientists have tried to prove that the world is made up of social networks that are ultimately interconnected .
The theory that there were " six degrees of separation " between everyone - with each degree being a person they knew - entered the mainstream when John Guare wrote a play of that name , followed by a 1993 film starring Will Smith .
The following year , a group of US students came up with the party game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon , apparently after a late - night viewing of back - to - back films starring the actor .
They began to pick random Hollywood names and then connect the actors to Bacon via films in which both had appeared .
IT 'S A SMALL WORLD
In 1967 , Stanley Milgram asked 160 people in Nebraska to get a parcel to a named person in Boston
He found that some people have three links of separation , some have 100 and some have none
In 1973 , American sociologist Mark Granovetter discovered society is made up of clusters of people , with strong and weak links British photographer Andy Gotts spent eight years taking pictures of 115 actors linked by friendship
That sparked a website , a board game and a book , and the phenomenon was born , although many dismissed its accuracy .
So how true is it ?
Recreating a famous experiment done in the 1960s , 40 parcels were given to people randomly picked around the world , as part of a BBC programme testing the " six degrees " theory .
They then had to try and get the parcel to a scientist called Marc Vidal based in Boston , via someone they knew on a first - name basis .
Three of the parcels made it to Mr Vidal , and on average took six steps to get there .
Organisers of the experiment believe the other 37 chains broke because of the apathy of individuals who failed to send the parcel on .
One that made it started off in the remote village of Nyamware in Kenya , where Nyaloka Auma gave it to her aunt in Nairobi .
Margaret Owino then sent it to a friend in New York state who used to live in Nairobi , who in turn sent it to another friend in Boston .
Eventually it arrived in the hands of the right person , through seven people in total .
The parcel went from Nyaloka Auma to Marc Vidal in six steps
Its success , and the fact that two other parcels also reached their destination within six links , proves that the theory can work , even if it does not always .
There have been many other attempts to test how " small " the world really is .
Last year , Microsoft examined its instant - messenger network of 30 billion electronic conversations between 180 million people .
Its researchers concluded that any two people are on average apart by 6.6 degrees of separation , meaning that they could be linked by a string of seven or fewer acquaintances .
Swine flu spread
The six degrees theory has had a huge impact on other areas of science .
When mathematician Steven Strogatz and his PhD student Duncan Watts set out to investigate why some crickets chirp in unison the young Australian got inspired by his father 's words in a phone call : " Did you know that you are only six handshakes from any person on Earth ? "
Watts thought this might explain why his crickets are such good synchronizers but he had no idea that this question would lead him to a major discovery in an emerging branch of research - network science .

Or catch up using the iPlayer
If the phenomenon applies to cricket synchronisation , what are the consequences for the way disease spreads throughout a human population , or the dynamics of markets , he asked .
These sorts of questions seem to have something to do with networks .
Teaming up with Strogatz , the two scientists used data from the online trivia game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon to see if there was a mathematical basis for this complex set of relationships .
They discovered a formula for the invisible links that make the big world small , and another scientist Albert - Laszlo Barabasi examined the importance of hubs in how networks evolved .
A new discipline - network science - was established and other scientists gladly applied these universal laws to other kinds of networks , such as the world - wide web , the growth of cities , global travel , sexual relations between people , wealth and property distribution , and protein molecules in cells .
If I start with my favourite protein and I ask what does it interact with , I 'm now back to basically a problem of six degrees of separation
Marc Vidal , who is road - mapping human cells Professor Alex Vespignani , of Indiana University , says network theory is having a huge impact on predicting how swine flu will spread .
His work is being used by the European Community and authorities in the US .
How people go from one place to another - what he calls mobility networks - is at the heart of his predictions , and involve long - range journeys ( such as by plane ) , short - range commutes , and how we move around small spaces like the workplace or the home .
" We can identify the pathways along which the disease will spread and therefore the next places to observe the cases .
" That gives you time and where you can focus .
With limited resources you need to make choices and focus on certain routes .
Network theory can tell you and it's not just about looking at the obvious . "
WHY KEVIN BACON ?
Name loosely rhymes with ' separation '
Students who invented the game watched two of his films that night Bacon said in an interview that he had worked with everyone Marc Vidal , the " target " of the parcel experiment , is creating the first " roadmap " of the human cell - how proteins interact - in order to find the origin of disease .
" If I start with my favourite protein and I ask what does it interact with , I 'm now back to basically a problem of six degrees of separation - who is connected to whom . "
Although scientists may disagree on how much emphasis they give network theory , it is now a well established principle .
And it 's all down to Kevin Bacon .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I used to play a variant of this game when I was on the train from London to Southampton to visit my folks for the weekend .
I used to sit in the smoking carriage - though I did n't smoke because the people were friendlier there and it was next to the bar .
The idea was to identify a mutual acquaintance - something we were able to do probably 3/4 of the time .
( Though , to be fair , geography and lifestyles narrowed the field considerably . )
Alex C , London
The six degree theory may explain how mathematics and astronomy calculations have run a parallel course in separate cultures like the Mayas , the Egyptians , the Minoans in Crete , China and India .
Their application of mathematics and astrology in the construction of pyramids and temples , as well as their water distribution systems can't be explained by the " random chance " theory or a common provider .
William F Pennock , Puerto Rico
The parcel experiment is n't particularly sound - it might tend to over estimate the length of such chains .
I might be six degrees ( or less ) of separation from a specified person in Boston ... but I probably do n't know the exact form of that chain in advance - so I do n't know which of my friends to send the parcel to .
I might send the parcel to a friend in Pennsylvania ( on the assumption that its closer than me to Boston ) without knowing that one of my good friends in the UK actually knows the named person in Boston .
The instant messenger analysis is a bit more sound as they can find the most efficient chain of links between 2 people .
Martyn Gay , London I think it is impressive that 3 out of 40 parcels made it to the Professor at an average of 6 steps .
However , the Professor is presumably a well known figure , in a well known institution .
In other words he is likely to be a " well connected " individual in the literal sense .
Kevin Bacon is likewise substantially more connected than the average .
The theory falls down when we talk about isolated individuals in remote communities .
That said we spend a lot of time and effort building connections .
For instance , we are all connected ( or used to be ) by the phonebook .
Gordon Lewis , Reading , UK Finally , the billions of pounds spent by the UK government for GCHQ to have complete visibility of internet traffic will enable the UK to be the foremost country in the investigation of this theory .
Clark Ellis , Sheffield I started writing a book about this very subject in Jan of this year , I have set myself the challenge of meeting 7 people admire using the 6 degrees theory , so far I am on step 3 with 3 of them and step 2 with the other 4 .
It will be interesting to see how it all pans out .
Derek Devayya , London I fall into the 6 degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon .
My ex housemate went to school with a girl .
This girl 's brother ended up in Hollywood working on films as a make up artist .
He worked on films involving Angelina Jolie , who I am pretty sure would know Kevin Bacon .
Andrew Johnson , Guildford I once had the opportunity to meet with Kevin Bacon to discuss the whole phenomena , but decided that it might be better if a friend of mine was to question him ... who in turn asked a work colleague ... who asked her brother - in - law ...
Richard , Sheffield Milgram 's experiment was a really terrible piece of science : the methodology was bad and the data analysis was bad .
First , the methodology does n't measure the right thing .
As Martyn Gay says , it will tend to overestimate the length of the chain between two people because , at each stage on the chain , it 's likely that the package wo n't be forwarded in an optimal way .
Second , as the chain gets longer , it 's increasingly likely that somebody will not bother to forward the package .
Therefore , only looking at the packages that actually arrived at the destination biases toward small chains and gives an underestimate of the average chain length .
So , all that Milgram 's experiment actually tells us is that the average number of links between two people is smaller than some number that 's bigger than six .
And that 's no information at all because every number is smaller than some number bigger than six .
David Richerby , Leeds , UK Facebook is surely a useful medium to prove this theory .
Eddie , York I think the theory works quite well for most people in the developed world .
Not sure how it would apply to Amazonian rainforest dwellers .
I live in South Africa and I 'm not particularly well connected , yet I can get to almost any celebrity or world leader within 6 degrees - even Sadaam Hussein !
Joe de Lange , cape town Mathematicians had thought about this long before Kevin Bacon fans .
Your journalists should look up " Erdos number " , which was described in The American Mathematical Monthly in 1969 .
Richard Tobin , Edinburgh
This is an interesting parlour game that I 've played many times , on the basis that a handshake and a proper face to face conversation establish the necessary connection .
The key to connecting oneself to people , some of whom can be reasonably recent historical figures is to find people who are ' nodes ' .
If you 've ever met your MP , that will get you a long way .
If you know someone , who knows someone , who knows someone who has been a guest of Parkinson , or Jonathon Ross etc , then you really are in business .
I can get Mohammed Ali in four , Tony Blair in two [ so George Bush in three ] , the Queen in three , and amazingly , frighteningly , Adolf Hitler in three !!!
John Francis , London Something that was strange when a friend of mine moved up from London was he , his friend and I coming to the realisation that though we are all from different parts of the country that we have a sizable number of shared friends , or friends who 've worked together .

Advertisement Prime Minister Gordon Brown has gone back to YouTube for a Labour election broadcast , two weeks after his much criticised expenses reform webcast .
He said voters ' choice on 4 June was between his plan to " grow our way out of recession " and public service cuts .
Mr Brown has been seeking to regain the initiative with a new schools policy .
But those efforts were hit when John Prescott , apparently referring to the expenses broadcast , joked the PM had the " worst bloody smile in the world " .
Speaking on the campaign trail in York Mr Prescott - who was deputy PM for ten years under Tony Blair - told reporters : " I have worked with Gordon Brown for an awfully long time .
" He must have the worst bloody smile in the world , but the man has got the ability and the intellect to get on with the job . "
' Big fuss '
Asked later about his comments , Mr Prescott said : " Only the British media would make such a big fuss about a bit of street theatre on the campaign trail .
" Gordon , and indeed myself , do not have the best smiles in the world but , as I also said in York , he is the best man for the job , making the big decisions to lead us out of this recession . "
There was much speculation about Mr Brown 's leadership over the bank holiday weekend after a week in which the government suffered a shock defeat in the Commons over the issue of Gurkhas ' rights of settlement .
Mr Prescott 's impression of the PM's YouTube appearance And Mr Brown had to drop a key proposal for reforming MPs 's expenses - announced to some surprise on the Downing Street website and YouTube only two weeks before , in the face of widespread opposition .
Some Labour
MPs were unhappy at the way the proposal was announced - while others criticised the PM 's appearance during the broadcast .
One , Gordon Prentice , said it had been " too horrible to watch " .
Communities Secretary Hazel Blears wrote in an article : " Promote your message via YouTube if you want to .
But it is no substitute for knocking on doors " - she later denied it was an attack on Mr Brown .
' Same values '
But Mr Brown had insisted he would continue to use the internet as an important information tool .
The party political broadcast , due to go out on TV channels later , appeared on YouTube and the Labour Party website .
In it Mr Brown is shown at the G20 summit , in New York , addressing Congress in Washington and features shots of wind turbines , apprentices and homes - accompanied by a voiceover from the prime minister .
He is also shown shaking hands with US president Barack Obama with whom he says he " shares the same values " including a desire to build a stronger society .

Harriet Harman
Harman : ' I do n't want to be PM ' Analysis : Elections may ease woes Analysis : What is Blears up to ?
He adds : " You ca n't cut your way out of recession - you have got to grow your way out of it . "
Earlier in a round of interviews with the BBC and other broadcasters before the weekly cabinet meeting , Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said the prime minister was focusing on the issues she said were important to Britain - the swine flu outbreak and the economy .
She said she expected Mr Brown to be prime minister when the general election was called - due by next June - adding : " I hope he will be .
I think it 's the right thing for this country if he is .
And I expect him and I want him to be prime minister after that election . "
Mr Brown was the " sort of politician that we need leading our country " at a time of economic crisis - " helping people through difficult times and building for the future as well " .
Divided , weak
The prime minister was at a school in south London earlier to announce plans to allow parents to trigger council intervention in unsatisfactory schools in England .
Gordon Brown talking to pupils during a school visit Meanwhile the prime minister 's spokesman has said he retains full confidence in Hazel Blears , who , he said , was " horrified " at suggestions that her article had been an attack on Mr Brown .
The No 10 spokesman added : " The prime minister is satisfied that the cabinet is supporting the agenda he is setting out , that they are working together , that the cabinet is coming together to deal with the big issues facing the country . "
But at the launch of the Conservatives ' local election campaign on North Tyneside , Mr Cameron said the government now had a " time horizon " .
He said : " They will be trying to get through the next few days , the next weeks , trying not to fall apart and that is not good for the country . "
He added : " People feel frustrated , people have to put up with a divided , weak , disorientated government . "
Ms Blears ' article in the Observer raised eyebrows over her YouTube reference and also a comment that all ministers had " a collective responsibility for the government 's lamentable failure to get our message across " .
However she went on to issue a statement saying that any suggestion she was criticising Mr Brown 's leadership was " completely wrong " .
Mr Brown 's deputy Harriet Harman , who has repeatedly found herself at the centre of leadership speculation , told the BBC : " I do n't want to be prime minister and I do n't want to be leader of the party . "
There were also stories that Labour backbenchers wanted Alan Johnson to replace Mr Brown .
But the health secretary told the BBC he had no " aspiration " to be party leader and said he believed Mr Brown was " a man for these times " who was doing a better job " than I could do it or anyone else " .

" It was a bright cold day in April , and the clocks were striking thirteen . "
Sixty years after the publication of Orwell ’s masterpiece , Nineteen Eighty - Four , that crystal first line sounds as natural and compelling as ever .
But when you see the original manuscript , you find something else : not so much the ringing clarity , more the obsessive rewriting , in different inks , that betrays the extraordinary turmoil behind its composition .
Probably the definitive novel of the 20th century , a story that remains eternally fresh and contemporary , and whose terms such as " Big Brother " , " doublethink " and " newspeak " have become part of everyday currency , Nineteen Eighty - Four has been translated into more than 65 languages and sold millions of copies worldwide , giving George Orwell a unique place in world literature .
" Orwellian " is now a universal shorthand for anything repressive or totalitarian , and the story of Winston Smith , an everyman for his times , continues to resonate for readers whose fears for the future are very different from those of an English writer in the mid-1940s .
The circumstances surrounding the writing of Nineteen Eighty - Four make a haunting narrative that helps to explain the bleakness of Orwell ’s dystopia .
Here was an English writer , desperately sick , grappling alone with the demons of his imagination in a bleak Scottish outpost in the desolate aftermath of the second world war .
The idea for Nineteen Eighty - Four , alternatively , " The Last Man in Europe " , had been incubating in Orwell ’s mind since the Spanish civil war .
His novel , which owes something to Yevgeny Zamyatin ’s dystopian fiction
We , probably began to acquire a definitive shape during 1943  44 , around the time he and his wife , Eileen adopted their only son , Richard .
Orwell himself claimed that he was partly inspired by the meeting of the Allied leaders at the Tehran Conference of 1944 .
Isaac Deutscher , an Observer colleague , reported that Orwell was " convinced that Stalin , Churchill and Roosevelt consciously plotted to divide the world " at Tehran .
Orwell had worked for David Astor ’s Observer since 1942 , first as a book reviewer and later as a correspondent .
The editor professed great admiration for Orwell ’s " absolute straightforwardness , his honesty and his decency " , and would be his patron throughout the 1940s .
The closeness of their friendship is crucial to the story of Nineteen Eighty - Four .
Orwell ’s creative life had already benefited from his association with the Observer in the writing of Animal Farm .
As the war drew to a close , the fruitful interaction of fiction and Sunday journalism would contribute to the much darker and more complex novel he had in mind after that celebrated " fairy tale " .
It ’s clear from his Observer book reviews , for example , that he was fascinated by the relationship between morality and language .
There were other influences at work .
Soon after Richard was adopted , Orwell ’s flat was wrecked by a doodlebug .
The atmosphere of random terror in the everyday life of wartime London became integral to the mood of the novel - in - progress .
Worse was to follow .
In March 1945 , while on assignment for the Observer in Europe , Orwell received the news that his wife , Eileen , had died under anaesthesia during a routine operation .
Suddenly he was a widower and a single parent , eking out a threadbare life in his Islington lodgings , and working incessantly to dam the flood of remorse and grief at his wife ’s premature death .
In 1945 , for instance , he wrote almost 110,000 words for various publications , including 15 book reviews for the Observer .
Now Astor stepped in .
His family owned an estate on the remote Scottish island of Jura , next to Islay .
There was a house , Barnhill , seven miles outside Ardlussa at the remote northern tip of this rocky finger of heather in the Inner Hebrides .
Initially , Astor offered it to Orwell for a holiday .
Speaking to the Observer last week , Richard Blair says he believes , from family legend , that Astor was taken aback by the enthusiasm of Orwell ’s response .
In May 1946 Orwell , still picking up the shattered pieces of his life , took the train for the long and arduous journey to Jura .
He told his friend Arthur Koestler that it was " almost like stocking up ship for an arctic voyage " .
It was a risky move ; Orwell was not in good health .
The winter of 1946  47 was one of the coldest of the century .
Postwar Britain was bleaker even than wartime , and he had always suffered from a bad chest .
At least , cut off from the irritations of literary London , he was free to grapple unencumbered with the new novel .
" Smothered under journalism , " as he put it , he told one friend , " I have become more and more like a sucked orange . "
Ironically , part of Orwell ’s difficulties derived from the success of Animal Farm .
After years of neglect and indifference the world was waking up to his genius .
" Everyone keeps coming at me , " he complained to Koestler , " wanting me to lecture , to write commissioned booklets , to join this and that , etc .  you do n’t know how I pine to be free of it all and have time to think again . "
On Jura he would be liberated from these distractions but the promise of creative freedom on an island in the Hebrides came with its own price .
Years before , in the essay " Why I Write " , he had described the struggle to complete a book : " Writing a book is a horrible , exhausting struggle , like a long bout of some painful illness .
One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven by some demon whom one can neither resist or [ sic ] understand .
For all one knows that demon is the same instinct that makes a baby squall for attention .
And yet it is also true that one can write nothing readable unless one constantly struggles to efface one ’s personality . "
Then that famous Orwellian coda .
" Good prose is like a window pane . "
From the spring of 1947 to his death in 1950 Orwell would re-enact every aspect of this struggle in the most painful way imaginable .
Privately , perhaps , he relished the overlap between theory and practice .
He had always thrived on self - inflicted adversity .
At first , after " a quite unendurable winter " , he revelled in the isolation and wild beauty of Jura .
" I am struggling with this book , " he wrote to his agent , " which I may finish by the end of the year  at any rate I shall have broken the back by then so long as I keep well and keep off journalistic work until the autumn . "
Barnhill , overlooking the sea at the top of a potholed track , was not large , with four small bedrooms above a spacious kitchen .
Life was simple , even primitive .
There was no electricity .
Orwell used Calor gas to cook and to heat water .
Storm lanterns burned paraffin .
In the evenings he also burned peat .
He was still chain - smoking black shag tobacco in roll - up cigarettes : the fug in the house was cosy but not healthy .
A battery radio was the only connection with the outside world .
Orwell , a gentle , unworldly sort of man , arrived with just a camp bed , a table , a couple of chairs and a few pots and pans .
It was a spartan existence but supplied the conditions under which he liked to work .
He is remembered here as a spectre in the mist , a gaunt figure in oilskins .
The locals knew him by his real name of Eric Blair , a tall , cadaverous , sad - looking man worrying about how he would cope on his own .
The solution , when he was joined by baby Richard and his nanny , was to recruit his highly competent sister , Avril .
Richard Blair remembers that his father " could not have done it without Avril .
She was an excellent cook , and very practical .
None of the accounts of my father ’s time on Jura recognise how essential she was . "

Part I : Rights are not '
' Rights ' is a very confusing word , because it has been thrown around so often in so many ways and by so many people with different motivations .
Almost everyone has a slightly different idea of the word " rights . "
So it is valuable to nail down a definition of what we are actually talking about .
We must be aware of the differences between rights , liberties , responsibilities , opportunities , guarantees , contracts and privileges .
Many people use rights interchangeably with some or all of these other words , but the word rights can represent something that is both unique from those other words , and universal to humanity .
In order to do that , we first discuss what rights are * not* .
Notably , a functional definition of the word ' rights ' is not any of those other words , but something that is often related to , in conjunction with , or the foundation of those other words and their importance , thus the confusion .
Rights are not privileges .
A privilege is something that someone else grants to you .
They retain final control and decision over what kind of access , the duration , and the nature of the privilege .
Importantly , the grantor of the privilege must also be the owner of what the privilege gives access to .
I cannot grant you the privilege of entering someone else 's home .
It is not mine to grant .
I do n't own the home .
But for my own home , I have the right to choose who to allow in my home , and what behavior they will engage while there .
If they fail to abide by the terms of the privilege , the privilege is revoked , and I toss them out on their butt .
Many people seem to believe that privileges are rights , that a right means someone else dictates who , what , when , where , and why of access .
Privileges are not rights , because they are an invitation , voluntarily offered , and voluntarily agreed to , rescindable at any time by both parties .
If you accept the privilege of entering my home on my terms , and come in only to find you despise me and my house , you leave .
You decline the privilege at any time .
Rights are not contracts .
A contract is an agreement between two entities to exchange goods or services within certain rules .
Both parties agree to the rules , agree to the exchange , and then participate in the exchange .
While it is possible to contract for the protection to exercise a right , the rights themselves are not contracts .
So , for example , if I own a car , and that car is representative of my rights , the car does not cease to exist because I do n't have a maintenance contract on the car .
The contract does n't define or create the car .
The contract merely is a method of exchanging service .
Likewise , rights exist whether anyone agrees to any exchange of goods and services for those rights .
The right does n't cease to exist simply because no one has promised it .
To this end , the Bill of Rights is not a contract .
It does not promise an exchange of services between government and citizens .
It supposedly offers some protection to exercise rights .
But it does not create them itself .
It 's just a piece of parchment .
Rights are also not guarantees .
This one confuses many people because the Constitutional Bill of Rights was supposedly written as a " guarantee " that the government will do or not do certain things to people in the course of its duties .
But a guarantee is an extended contract agreement .
It is a promise of restitution should the guarantor fail to uphold his side of an agreement .
When you get a guarantee on a product or service , the seller is making a promise that if the product fails , it will be replaced at their expense .
Rights are not guarantees because they are not contracts either .
The Bill of Rights does not promise any restitution if a right is violated , although the Constitution does provide for a method of seeking it .
Restitution and compensation are aspects of contract , not an aspect of a right itself .
Most importantly , the Bill of Rights cannot replace a right taken away .
It did not create them to begin with , and thus can not replace them .
It 's just a piece of parchment .
Rights are not opportunities .
This is easily demonstrable but noting that every person has the right to defend themselves from violent attack , but that does not mean every person will have the opportunity .
Likewise , every person has the right to enter into an agreement to buy a widget , but that does not mean a widget will be available to buy .
Many people believe that everyone has a ' right ' to food , clothing and shelter , and that by calling it a right , food , clothing , and shelter will always be available at every opportunity to provide it .
What this really means is that no one can be denied the opportunity to seek food , clothing , and shelter , but no amount of words or even rights can ensure it will actually happen .
Opportunities are really just the starting points of contracts .
Opportunities are the openings people seek and find to engage in agreements and exchanges .
The right to seek opportunities is inherent in each individual .
There is no guarantee the opportunities will actually exist .
Rights are not responsibilities .
Responsibilities are a voluntarily agreed obligation .
When one enters into a contract to exchange goods or services , you take upon yourself responsibilities .
Your responsibilities are to fulfill your aspect of the agreement .
When you fail to fulfill you obligation , the agreement is breached .
While people have the right to accept responsibilities , the responsibilities themselves are not rights .
If the responsibilities are unacceptable , each person has the right to reject the contract , and by extension the responsibilities of the contract .
That eliminates all the aspects of contracts and agreements that are often confused as rights .
Now we get meaty .
Rights are not really liberties , either .
This one is tough because liberties in and of themselves are incredibly nebulous .
Functionally , a liberty is a behavior or activity that is universally respected within a culture .
Ideally , the Bill of Rights should be called the Bill of Liberties , as in , " these are the behaviors and activities that are universally respected within our culture , and we 've written them down . "
Liberties vary from culture to culture , and even within subsets of a culture .
Liberties are far more social constructs than they are governmental edicts , although they often overlap .
In our culture , determining one 's own marriage partner is a liberty .
Seeking education is a liberty .
Procreation is a liberty .
Choosing and participating in a religion is a liberty .
These are often confused as rights because the seed of any liberty is a right .
In essence , a liberty is a right that has been publicly proclaimed and recognized within a society .
Thus while all liberties are rights , not all rights are liberties .
Rights are not ' freedom from ' '
The most egregious misuse of the word ' rights , ' however , is the idea that a right is a ' freedom from ' ; that a person has a right to be ' free from ' second hand smoke , or ' free from ' having to see homosexuals .
These are not individual rights , but a sneaky way of re-labeling restrictions on other people 's behavior preemptively .
Many people are attracted to the idea because it is a way of eliminating many of the annoying behaviors of other people while still standing on the moral truncheon of ' rights . '
But it is a dangerous place and a misrepresentation of rights .
Simply replace the target of the ' freedom from ' with something not so politically correct , and the truth of this stance becomes apparent .
No one , for example , has a ' right to be free of those coloreds , ' or a right to be ' free from those fatties , ' or ' free from those automobiles . '
When the target of a ' freedom from ' is changed , it 's easy to see it is not a right , and not a freedom , but an unjustifiable restriction on other people .
It is a preference shrouded in a righteous mask .
And rights are not grants .
They are not presents that one human can give to another wrapped in paper and ribbon .
Governments are made of up humans , and if one human can ' grant ' another human rights , then those two humans are no longer equal .
One has more ' rights ' over the other , by the fact that he can add or remove rights at will .
Regardless of how this authority is derived , either by force , or declaration , or Immaculate Conception , or even popular vote , the idea that one or more people can create or deprive another of rights destroys the concept of rights as a valid political concept .
There are , of course , many people who love nothing less than to destroy rights as valid political concept , because the idea of rights being universal , ubiquitous , and utterly equal is destructive to the people who would control others at any cost .
When each person has the same core equality as any other person , it is far easier to question and challenge those who would order others around .
Free people should never have the question , ' By what right have you done this ? ' far from their lips .
In Part II , what rights really are !

He is married with children living somewhere in the Texas Hill Country , and is also a moderator in the Strike The Root forum .
Functional Rights : The Elephant in the Parlor
A one sentence truth gebl 'ht to four - thousand words .
by Scarmig
The most comprehensive modeling yet carried out on the likelihood of how much hotter the Earth 's climate will get in this century shows that without rapid and massive action , the problem will be about twice as severe as previously estimated six years ago - and could be even worse than that .
The study uses the MIT Integrated Global Systems Model , a detailed computer simulation of global economic activity and climate processes that has been developed and refined by the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change since the early 1990s .
The new research involved 400 runs of the model with each run using slight variations in input parameters , selected so that each run has about an equal probability of being correct based on present observations and knowledge .
Other research groups have estimated the probabilities of various outcomes , based on variations in the physical response of the climate system itself .
But the MIT model is the only one that interactively includes detailed treatment of possible changes in human activities as well - such as the degree of economic growth , with its associated energy use , in different countries .
Study co-author Ronald Prinn , the co-director of the Joint Program and director of MIT 's Center for Global Change Science , says that , regarding global warming , it is important " to base our opinions and policies on the peer - reviewed science , " he says .
And in the peer - reviewed literature , the MIT model , unlike any other , looks in great detail at the effects of economic activity coupled with the effects of atmospheric , oceanic and biological systems .
" In that sense , our work is unique , " he says .
The new projections , published this month in the American Meteorological Society 's Journal of Climate , indicate a median probability of surface warming of 5.2 degrees Celsius by 2100 , with a 90 % probability range of 3.5 to 7.4 degrees .
This can be compared to a median projected increase in the 2003 study of just 2.4 degrees .
The difference is caused by several factors rather than any single big change .
Among these are improved economic modeling and newer economic data showing less chance of low emissions than had been projected in the earlier scenarios .
Other changes include accounting for the past masking of underlying warming by the cooling induced by 20th century volcanoes , and for emissions of soot , which can add to the warming effect .
In addition , measurements of deep ocean temperature rises , which enable estimates of how fast heat and carbon dioxide are removed from the atmosphere and transferred to the ocean depths , imply lower transfer rates than previously estimated .
Prinn says these and a variety of other changes based on new measurements and new analyses changed the odds on what could be expected in this century in the " no policy " scenarios - that is , where there are no policies in place that specifically induce reductions in greenhouse gas emissions .
Overall , the changes " unfortunately largely summed up all in the same direction , " he says .
" Overall , they stacked up so they caused more projected global warming . "
While the outcomes in the " no policy " projections now look much worse than before , there is less change from previous work in the projected outcomes if strong policies are put in place now to drastically curb greenhouse gas emissions .
Without action , " there is significantly more risk than we previously estimated , " Prinn says .
" This increases the urgency for significant policy action . "
To illustrate the range of probabilities revealed by the 400 simulations , Prinn and the team produced a " roulette wheel " that reflects the latest relative odds of various levels of temperature rise .
The wheel provides a very graphic representation of just how serious the potential climate impacts are .
" There 's no way the world can or should take these risks , " Prinn says .
And the odds indicated by this modeling may actually understate the problem , because the model does not fully incorporate other positive feedbacks that can occur , for example , if increased temperatures caused a large - scale melting of permafrost in arctic regions and subsequent release of large quantities of methane , a very potent greenhouse gas .
Including that feedback " is just going to make it worse , " Prinn says .
The lead author of the paper describing the new projections is Andrei Sokolov , research scientist in the Joint Program .
Other authors , besides Sokolov and Prinn , include Peter H. Stone , Chris E. Forest , Sergey Paltsev , Adam Schlosser , Stephanie Dutkiewicz , John Reilly , Marcus Sarofim , Chien Wang and Henry D. Jacoby , all of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change , as well as Mort Webster of MIT 's Engineering Systems Division and D. Kicklighter , B. Felzer and J. Melillo of the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole .
Prinn stresses that the computer models are built to match the known conditions , processes and past history of the relevant human and natural systems , and the researchers are therefore dependent on the accuracy of this current knowledge .
Beyond this , " we do the research , and let the results fall where they may , " he says .
Since there are so many uncertainties , especially with regard to what human beings will choose to do and how large the climate response will be , " we do n't pretend we can do it accurately .
Instead , we do these 400 runs and look at the spread of the odds . "
Because vehicles last for years , and buildings and powerplants last for decades , it is essential to start making major changes through adoption of significant national and international policies as soon as possible , Prinn says .
" The least - cost option to lower the risk is to start now and steadily transform the global energy system over the coming decades to low or zero greenhouse gas- emitting technologies . "

WASHINGTON , June 15 ( UPI ) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says there may be a link between the use of ADHD drugs and sudden cardiac death in healthy children .
The federal agency said the possible connection between attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder medications and children 's cardiac problems was found during a study that was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry .
But , the FDA said that because of the study 's limitations , parents should not stop a child 's stimulant medication , but should discuss the situation with the prescribing healthcare professional .

The FDA said it " can not conclude that the data in the study affect the overall risk - benefit profile of stimulant medications used to treat ADHD in children . "
" The FDA continues to review drug safety information for stimulant medications used to treat ADHD so that we can give health care professionals and families the most up - to - date drug safety information available , " said Dr. Janet Woodcock , director of FDA 's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research .

In August 2006 , travelers yachting through the Tonga Islands discovered pumice floating on the ocean surface .
The pumice resulted from an underwater eruption of the marine volcano Home Reef .
Although the pumice eventually floated away , the new volcanic island could still be seen by satellites in the fall of 2006 .
On October 4 , 2006 , the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer ( ASTER ) on NASA ’s Terra satellite observed the newly emerged Home Reef .
This image shows two views of the volcano .
The larger image uses a combination of light visible to human eyes and infrared light .
In this picture , dark blue indicates relatively clear water , light blue - green indicates water mixed with sediment , and the white ring around the island shows rocky material .
The inset image shows temperatures on and around the island , with bright yellow being the warmest and dark purple being the coolest .
Both images indicate a warm plume from the island that moves in a northeasterly direction before splitting in two .
The exact origin of this plume is uncertain .
It could result from underwater volcanic activity , but it might also result from solar heating of pumice remaining in the area .
The island itself sports volcanic lakes , some as warm as 64.7 degrees Celsius ( almost 150 degrees Fahrenheit ) .

" Obama Calls on World to ‘ Stand Up to ’ North Korea " read the headline .
The United States , Obama said , was determined to protect " the peace and security of the world . "
Shades of doublespeak , doublethink , 1984 .
North Korea is a small place .
China alone could snuff it out in a few minutes .
Yet the president of the U.S. thinks that nothing less than the entire world is a match for North Korea .
We are witnessing the Washington gangsters construct yet another threat like Slobodan Milosevic , Osama bin Laden , Saddam Hussein , John Walker Lindh , Yaser Hamdi , José Padilla , Sami al - Arian , Hamas , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and the hapless detainees demonized by former secretary of defense Rumsfeld as " the 700 most dangerous terrorists on the face of the earth , " who were tortured for six years at Gitmo only to be quietly released .
Just another mistake , sorry .
The military / security complex that rules America , together with the Israel Lobby and the banksters , needs a long list of dangerous enemies to keep the taxpayers ’ money flowing into its coffers .
The Homeland Security lobby is dependent on endless threats to convince Americans that they must forgo civil liberty in order to be safe and secure .
The real question : who is going to stand up to the American and Israeli governments ?
Who is going to protect Americans ’ and Israelis ’ civil liberties , especially those of Israeli dissenters and Israel ’s Arab citizens ?
Who is going to protect Palestinians , Iraqis , Afghans , Lebanese , Iranians , and Syrians from Americans and Israelis ?
Not Obama , and not the right - wing brownshirts who today rule Israel .
Obama ’s notion that it takes the entire world to stand up to North Korea is mind - boggling , but this mind - boggling idea pales in comparison to Obama ’s guarantee that America will protect " the peace and security of the world . "
Is this the same America that bombed Serbia , including Chinese diplomatic offices and civilian passenger trains , and pried Kosovo loose from Serbia and gave it to a gang of Muslim drug lords , lending them NATO troops to protect their operation ?
Is this the same America that is responsible for approximately 1 million dead Iraqis , leaving orphans and widows everywhere and making refugees out of one - fifth of the Iraqi population ?
Is this the same America that blocked the rest of the world from condemning Israel for its murderous attack on Lebanese civilians in 2006 and on Gazans most recently , the same America that has covered up for Israel ’s theft of Palestine over the past 60 years , a theft that has produced 4 million Palestinian refugees driven by Israeli violence and terror from their homes and villages ?
Is this the same America that is conducting military exercises in former constituent parts of Russia and ringing Russia with missile bases ?
Is this the same America that has bombed Afghanistan into rubble with massive civilian casualties ?
Is this the same America that has started a horrific new war in Pakistan , a war that in its first few days has produced 1 million refugees ?
" The peace and security of the world " ?
Whose world ?
On his return from his consultation with Obama in Washington , the brownshirted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that it was Israel ’s responsibility to " eliminate " the " nuclear threat " from Iran .
What nuclear threat ?
The U.S. intelligence agencies are unanimous in their conclusion that Iran has had no nuclear weapons program since 2003 .
The inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency report that there is no sign of a nuclear weapons program in Iran .
Whom is Iran bombing ?
How many refugees is Iran sending fleeing for their lives ?
Whom is North Korea bombing ?
The two great murderous , refugee - producing countries are the U.S. and Israel .
Between them , they have murdered and dislocated millions of people who were a threat to no one .
No countries on earth rival the U.S. and Israel for barbaric , murderous violence .
But Obama gives assurances that the U.S. will protect " the peace and security of the world . "
And the brownshirt Netanyahu assures the world that Israel will save it from the " Iranian threat . "
Where is the media ?
Why are n’t people laughing their heads off ?
Leading scientists call foul in the use of kids aged 6 to 10 as subjects in genetically modified foods trials , claiming a severe breach of medical ethics , specifically the Nuremberg code .
[ social_buttons ]
“ We are writing to express our shock and unequivocal denunciation of the experiments being conducted by your colleagues which involve the feeding of genetically modified Golden Rice to human subjects . ”
A formal letter of protest calling for an immediate end to the GM food experiments was sent by 22 scientists to the Tufts University School of Medicine , relating the unethical nature of the trials to a breach of the medical ethics code .
The Nuremberg code states that children under the age of 10 are not legally capable of giving consent to participation in experiments .
“ It is completely immoral to feed this rice to children without proper safety testing …
It ’s like putting a new drug on the market with no toxicology or safety trials . ” – Prof David Schubert , Salk Institute of Biological Studies
Children in the US and China were fed “ Golden Rice ” ( modified to have enhanced levels of beta carotene ) , which has not been through animal trials for safety testing .
The project manager of the Golden Rice Organization claims no breach of etiquette , saying the experiment was reviewed by an ethical review panel .
He also admitted to what seems like kid-bribery to me : “ Children were rewarded with school bags and pencils and paper as a thank you for participating . ”
The protest letter goes on to state the concerns of the scientists :
“ It is a genetically modified product which has not been shown to be distinctive , uniform and stable over time .
It has never been through a regulatory / approvals process anywhere in the world .
There is now a large body of evidence that shows that GM crop / food production is highly prone to inadvertent and unpredictable pleiotropic effects , which can result in health damaging effects when GM food products are fed to animals . ”
“ Our greatest concern is that this rice , which is engineered to overproduce beta carotene , has never been tested in animals , and there is an extensive medical literature showing that retinoids that can be derived from beta carotene are both toxic and cause birth defects . ”
The experiment was funded and administered by the US National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) .

As the annual International Whaling Commission meeting stumbles to a close , unable to negotiate a compromise between whaling opponents and people who've killed more than 40,000 whales since 1985 , scientists say these aquatic mammals are more than mere animals .
They might even deserve to be considered people .
Not human people , but as occupying a similar range on the spectrum as the great apes , for whom the idea of personhood has moved from preposterous to possible .
Chimpanzees , gorillas and bonobos possess self - awareness , feelings and high - level cognitive powers .
According to a steadily gathering body of research , so do whales and dolphins .
In fact , their capacities could be even more ancient than our own , dating to an evolutionary explosion in brain size that took place millions of years before the last common ancestor of the great apes existed .
" If an alien came down anytime prior to about 1.5 million years ago to communicate with the ' brainiest ' animals on Earth , they would have tripped over our own ancestors and headed straight for the oceans to converse with the dolphins , " said Lori Marino , an evolutionary neurobiologist at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center .
The idea of whale personhood makes all the more haunting the prospect that Earth 's cetaceans , many of whom were hunted to the brink of extinction in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , are still threatened .
At the annual International Whaling Commission being held this week in Portugal , officials failed to curb the continuing killing of some 1,000 whales every year , mostly by hunters from Japan , Norway and Iceland .
Many scientists say populations are still too fragile to support commercial hunting or , in the case of Japan , " scientific research " that appears to kill an especially high number of pregnant females .
Mortality from hunting , however , may be the least of the whale 's worries .
Industrial pollution has suffused their bodies with heavy metals and toxins .
Noise pollution drowns out the vocalizations on which whales rely to find food and navigate .
Overfishing punches holes in oceanic webs of life .
Whales and dolphins are also accidentally caught in nets and struck by ships .
Such collisions appear to be pushing the North Atlantic right whale to oblivion , and the IWC says that ship strikes " should be reduced to zero as soon as possible . "
But though the U.S. has set speed limits off its northeast coast , the World Shipping Council has fought such measures internationally .
It 's also possible that Navy sonar tests , which may have caused mass beachings in the Bahamas , are to blame .
The U.S. Supreme Court has struck down restrictions on the tests .
And though President Obama has noble intentions on ocean policy , pollution and overfishing is a global problem .
In the midst of this , research has continued on whales and dolphins , which have long been difficult to study .
Whales can't be kept in captivity .
Scientists require expensive ships and tools that , despite their sophistication , produce relatively low - resolution readings of whale life .
Most findings come from bottlenose dolphins , killer whales , sperm whales and humpback whales — the species that scientists have painstakingly studied for a few decades , and now continue their work with improved gene sequencing and song analysis tools .
In these four species , scientists see considerable social complexity and individual distinction .
They talk of whales and dolphins in terms of cultures and societies , and say cetaceans possess qualities of personhood .
They say the same is likely true of other species , who simply have n't been studied yet .
" It 's only due to our lack of knowledge that humans remain this exclusive species , " said Shane Gero , a Dalhousie University marine biologist .
" We 're getting a lot of long - term studies in cetaceans , hitting multiple generations , and we 're finally able to get at these questions . "
Though there 's still more evidence for primate than cetacean personhood , Gero said accumulating research " will start tipping the scales . "
Gero trained under Dalhousie University biologist Hal Whitehead , who started studying whales in 1977 .
Researchers from his lab and that of St. Andrews University biologist Luke Rendell , another former Whitehead student , have studied sperm whales around the world .
They 're responsible for much of what 's known about the whales ' social behavior , which involves wide variations in group formation , hunting and child - rearing .
Groups even appear to communicate in their own unique dialect .
" Based on what we know , I 'd guess that cetacean culture is intermediate between humans and chimpanzees .
Not in material culture , but in most other respects , " said Whitehead .
Culture is an especially important measure of personhood in whales , since it 's difficult to administer the sorts of tests that have found chimpanzees to be capable of basic math , altruism , laughter and complex communication , the latter of which can be neurologically imaged in real - time .
But if cetaceans can't take these tests , they have met one critical laboratory benchmark of higher cognition : self - recognition .
With Wildlife Conservation Society cognitive scientist Diana Reiss , Lori Marino showed that bottlenose dolphins can use mirrors to investigate marks hidden on their bodies .
" When they look in the mirror , they 're saying , ' That 's me , ' " said Marino .
" They have a sense of self through time . "
And in a much - celebrated first documented example of tool use in marine mammals , a family of dolphins in Australia uses sponges to hunt .
Cetaceans even surpass most primates in their use of sound .
" We 've known for some time now that the communication systems of these animals is more complex than we can imagine , " said Marino .
" People are starting to use some interesting statistical methods to look at their vocal repertoires , and they 're finding structural complexity that suggests there may be something like grammar , syntax , even language . "
Fueling the evolution of cetacean communication is an ability , observed in dolphins , humpback whales and sperm whales , to pass songs and codas between generations and individuals .
" One of the ways in which dolphins are unusual among mammals is their ability to imitate sounds .
Most apes are barely able to modify the sounds that they make vocally , based on what they hear , " said Peter Tyack , a biologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute .
" To be able to learn sounds and incorporate them is really important for human communication . "
According to Tyack , the individually distinctive calls of dolphins may even be equivalent to names .
" That 's an open research question , " he said .
In addition to cultural evidence , researchers who 've studied cetacean brains — many of which are among the largest in the animal kingdom — have found highly developed analogues to human structures .
Whale brains appear to have undergone massive growth about 30 million years ago , a process linked in primates to the development of complex cognition and culture .
" The parts of the brain that are involved with processing emotion and social relationships are enormously complex , and in many cetaceans even more highly elaborated than in the human brain , " said Marino .
" If we assume that the limbic system is doing what it 's doing in all mammals , then something very high - level is going on . "
As for the nature of a whale 's inner life , it 's difficult to say but possible to speculate .
" My strong suspicion is that a lot of sperm whale life revolves around social issues , " said Whitehead .
" They 're nomadic , live in permanent groups , and are dependent on each other for everything .
Social structure is vital to them .
The only constant thing in their world is their social group .
I 'd guess that a lot of their life is paying attention to social relationships . "
These relationships would be " interestingly different from ours , for a variety of reasons , " continued Whitehead .
" There 's nowhere to hide , they can use sound to form an image of each other 's insides — whether you 're pregnant , hungry , sick .
In a three - dimensional habitat , it 's probably much harder to say something is mine , or yours , whether it 's a piece of food or a potential mate . "
Tyler Schulz , another researcher in Whitehead 's lab , recently refined a method for linking sperm whale codas to the individual who composed them .
That should help researchers get an even better appreciation of personal traits .
" He found that in one group , most of the animals had a similar repertoire of calls , but the mother of a baby had a different one , " said Whitehead .
" As we analyze the data , we 'll be able to figure out whether that was the mother 's originally vocabulary , and she was a weirdo , or if maybe that was just baby talk .
We all know women who change their vocabularies when they have babies . "

PEORIA , Ill. , April 17 ( UPI ) --
It did n't play in Peoria , Ill. , when a karaoke bar called The Elbo Room put up a sign announcing : " We are not a gay bar . "
Peoria Councilwoman Barbara Van Auken , whose district includes the bar , says the sign violated state law and the city has notified owner Greg Quast , the Chicago Tribune reported Friday .

Quast , who could not be reached for comment , has issued a statement apologizing for the sign .
Prior to becoming The Elbo Room , the bar on Main Street was called the Quench Room and was known as a gay bar , longtime residents say .
Nick Stroman , 33 , snapped a photo of the anti-gay sign and sent it to friends via the Internet .
A coalition quickly assembled and held a series of protests last weekend .
" The sign was basically a sign of intolerance , and we 're not going to stand for it anymore , " says Stephanie Worlow , 27 , one of the organizers of the protest .

The San Antonio Spurs and the Milwaukee Bucks have come to terms on a trade that will send Bruce Bowen , Fabricio Oberto and Kurt Thomas to the Bucks for Richard Jefferson .
Though I hate seeing Bruce Bowen leaving the Spurs as when we here in San Antonio think of Bowen we think of San Antonio not because of what he has done on the court but for the community .
Thomas and Oberto really did not establish many minutes and with the addition of Jefferson it surely gave the Spurs no hesitation to send those two out .
Bowen will be missed with his defense but Jefferson brings in his own and more offense to the Spurs too .
Jefferson is a big addition to the Spurs and I hope this is not the only move we make .
Bruce Bowen good luck in Milwaukee , you surely will be missed .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Microsoft Corp. said Thursday that declining PC sales hurt revenue , as the software giant reported quarterly sales that fell for the first time in its 23 - year history as a public company .
The Redmond , Wash .- based company said sales fell 6 % from a year earlier to $ 13.7 billion , missing analysts ' expectations of $ 14.1 billion .
Meanwhile , the company 's net income fell 32 % to $ 2.98 billion , or 33 cents per share , in its third quarter ended March 31 .
Results included charges totaling 6 cents per share for job cuts and investments that took place in the quarter .
Without the charges , Microsoft earned 39 per share , in line with forecasts by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters , which typically exclude one - time items .
Microsoft said weakness in the global PC market negatively impacted its results .
Still , shares of Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) rose 4 % after hours , as the company performed roughly in - line with expectations .
In the previous quarter , results came in well below forecasts , and Microsoft rescinded its prior outlook for 2009 .
" Expectations were much more tempered now , " said Katherine Egbert , analyst with Jefferies & Co . " People now understand that near - term business wo n't be so good . "
On a conference call with analysts , Chris Liddell , Microsoft 's chief financial officer , said the current recession has been " the most difficult economic environment we 've faced in our history . "
He noted that he expects the recovery to be slow and gradual , but again he declined to give a specific outlook for the next three - month period .
Still , Liddell said he was encouraged by the company 's ability to cut costs .
" While I can't be happy in any quarter in which our revenue and earnings per share decrease , I 'm pleased with our relative performance , " he added .
Demand quagmire :
The company has had a difficult time combating slumping demand for its Windows operating system , as the economic slowdown has dragged PC sales down 7 % to 9 % , according to Microsoft 's estimates .
The recession has also prompted many consumers to opt for cheaper , scaled - down " netbooks " that perform only basic tasks such as e-mail and accessing the Internet .
They typically run a lower - cost version of Windows or an open - source operating system such as Linux .
" The trouble for Microsoft is that its cash cow is shifting , " said Carl Howe , analyst with Yankee Group .
" PC sales are troubled , and they 're getting hurt by the move to cheaper notebooks . "
In January , Microsoft announced its first mass job cuts in its 34 - year history in an effort to bolster its bottom line
The company slashed 1,400 position during the quarter with another 3,600 expected to be cut by mid-2010 .
At that time , the company said it was also adding a few thousand positions , mainly in its online advertising division .
" While market conditions remained weak during the quarter , I was pleased with the organization 's ability to offset revenue pressures with the swift implementation of cost - savings initiatives , " said Liddell .
" We expect the weakness to continue through at least the next quarter . "
Sales and profit fell in all of Microsoft 's businesses , except its server business , which managed to squeeze out a 7 % rise in revenue and a 24 % jump in earnings .
The entertainment and devices division , which includes the Xbox 360 , suffered a 2 % revenue decline and an operating loss of $ 31 million from a year earlier .
The company 's business division sales dropped 5 % .
Windows :
The company is banking on a new operating system to break out of its slump .
Microsoft's Vista operating system , which was released in early 2007 , never took off like the company had hoped .
Sales in the division that produces Vista fell 16 % in the previous quarter .
User satisfaction has been underwhelming , and IT departments have largely opted to stick with Vista 's predecessor , Windows XP .
" Microsoft ca n't point to anything in their mix of products that excites people right now , " said Allen Weiner , analyst with tech consultancy firm Gartner Research .
Early reviews of Microsoft 's new Windows 7 system have been largely positive , but the stated release date is n't until late early 2010 .
Analysts think that Microsoft will push up the release date to later this year to help spur PC sales around the holiday season .
The company expects the unveiling of its new operating system will help increase sales even if economic conditions remain challenging .
Online advertising funk : Microsoft has also continued to struggle to compete with rivals Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) and Yahoo ( YHOO , Fortune 500 ) in the online advertising business .
Microsoft 's Online Services division , which includes the online portal MSN and its Internet advertising sales , lost $ 575 million in the quarter , and sales in the division were down 14 % from the same quarter a year earlier .
Microsoft said the loss in its ad sales division was due to the significant decline of average rates in display advertising .
The US Supreme Court has established a broad , new constitutional standard requiring judges to step aside in cases involving a perceived probability of judicial bias .
The 5 - to - 4 decision was announced on Monday in a case involving a justice on the West Virginia Supreme Court .
Justice Brent Benjamin had refused to step aside in a case involving a company that spent $ 3 million to help defeat an incumbent justice , whose seat was filled by Justice Benjamin .
The Supreme Court ruled that Benjamin violated the due process rights of the litigants before the West Virginia high court when he declined to recuse himself in that case .
The majority justices on the US high court viewed the company 's independent campaign expenditure as a significant factor in Benjamin 's electoral success .
They concluded the effort created a perception of a " probability of actual bias " when the company later appeared before Benjamin and the other justices .
" Just as no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause , similar fears of bias can arise when – without the consent of the other parties – a man chooses the judge in his own cause , " Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion .
In a dissent , Chief Justice John Roberts warned that the decision unleashes an ill - defined standard upon America 's judiciary , requiring judges to step aside whenever someone perceives a " probability of bias . "
" This will inevitably lead to an increase in allegations that judges are biased , however groundless those charges may be , " the chief justice said .
" The end result will do far more to erode public confidence in judicial impartiality than an isolated failure to recuse in a particular case . "
The case , Caperton v. Massey Coal Company , was being closely followed because it offered the justices the opportunity to address the issue of when judges must step aside and decline to hear a case because of potential or perceived conflicts of interest .
It arises at a time when many judicial elections in the United States are being swamped with millions of dollars in special - interest campaign money that some analysts say threatens to undercut public confidence in the judiciary .
The case is well known for another reason .
It was the real - life inspiration for John Grisham 's bestselling 2008 legal thriller , " The Appeal . "
Under the federal judicial system and in some states , judges are appointed and serve for life .
But in 39 states , judges must run for office and stand for election to retain their seat .
During such elections , judicial candidates can accept financial contributions from the public , including parties that might later appear before them as lawyers , plaintiffs , or defendants .
In addition , sitting judges who have ruled in controversial cases may find themselves targeted by groups , companies , or individuals seeking their removal from the bench .
All those issues play a role in the Caperton case .
The litigation began amid a heated , long - running dispute between Hugh Caperton , a mining executive , and Don Blankenship , chairman and CEO of the Massey Coal Co .
Mr. Caperton says Mr. Blankenship drove his mining business into bankruptcy through questionable behind - the - scenes dealings .
The dispute went to court , where a jury awarded Caperton $ 50 million for illegal contract interference and fraud .
Massey filed an appeal with West Virginia 's highest court , formally called the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals .
Two years earlier , Blankenship spent $ 3 million to help unseat Warren McGraw , an incumbent justice on the West Virginia high court .
Blankenship paid for a barrage of negative and exaggerated television ads accusing Justice McGraw of voting to release a child molester so he could work in a school .
McGraw lost the election .
A West Virginia lawyer , Brent Benjamin , won the high - court seat and was sworn in as a justice in January 2005 .
Then , in October 2006 , Massey 's appeal reached the West Virginia Supreme Court .
Caperton asked Benjamin to step down from consideration of the case .
He said there was an appearance of bias since the justice had been the beneficiary of Massey 's $ 3 million campaign to unseat McGraw .
Lawyers for Massey filed a recusal motion of their own , seeking removal of a different justice they perceived as potentially hostile to their case .
Benjamin refused to step aside .
Eventually , the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals voted 3 to 2 to invalidate the $ 50 million verdict against Massey .
Benjamin voted in Massey 's favor .
Caperton asked for a rehearing , repeating earlier calls for Benjamin 's recusal .
Two other justices stepped down from the case , but Benjamin remained on the bench .
The state high court again voted 3 to 2 to throw out the $ 50 million verdict .
Benjamin , again , voted in Massey 's favor .
The issue before the Supreme Court was whether Benjamin was required under the Constitution 's due process clause to step aside , or whether he acted properly in rejecting recusal motions and ultimately casting the deciding vote in the case .
Lawyers for Massey said Blankenship 's $ 3 million was an independent expenditure rather than a campaign contribution to Benjamin .
They said that Benjamin voted against Massey in five other cases , including a $ 243 million judgment against the company .
Justice Kennedy said in his opinion that the facts in the West Virginia case were extreme .
He said the new constitutional standard announced by the court would come into play only rarely .
" Most disputes over disqualification will be resolved without resort to the Constitution , " he said .
Chief Justice Roberts disagreed .
His dissent includes 40 questions raised by the majority ruling .
Among them : " How much money is too much money ? " and " Does the judge get to respond to the allegation that he is probably biased , or is his reputation solely in the hands of the parties to the case ? "
Roberts continues : " Today 's opinion requires state and federal judges simultaneously to act as political scientists ( why did candidate X win the election ? ) , economists ( was the financial support disproportionate ? ) , and psychologists ( is there likely to be a debt of gratitude ? ) . "
Kennedy said the majority justices did not question Benjamin's own subjective determination that he had acted properly and with fairness .
But the Supreme Court was now applying an objective test .
" We conclude that there is a serious risk of actual bias – based on objective and reasonable perceptions – when a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds or directing the judge 's election campaign when the case was pending or imminent , " Kennedy wrote .
The inquiry , he said , must focus on the campaign contribution 's size compared with the total spent in the election , and the apparent effect that the money had on the outcome of the election .
" Applying this principle , " Kennedy said , " we conclude that Blankenship 's campaign efforts had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing Justice Benjamin on the case . "
In a separate dissent , Justice Antonin Scalia said the relevant question is whether the court does more good than harm by expanding a constitutional mandate for recusal " in a manner ungoverned by any [ discernible ] rule . "
Sea ice is often used as an indicator for man-made climate change , so find out what it is and why it is important
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
What is sea ice ?
Frozen sea water .
Unlike the mighty ice sheets and glaciers that rest on the bedrock of Greenland and Antarctica , sea ice forms and melts on the surface of the ocean .
The amount of sea ice waxes and wanes with the seasons .
It forms in the winter and melts in the summer .
Where is it found ?
In the deep south and the far north .
Only the freezing conditions of a polar winter are harsh enough to freeze seawater on a large scale .
Sea ice in the Arctic gets most attention because it covers the North Pole and much of the Arctic Ocean for miles around , even in the northern summer .
Antarctic sea ice , along the continent 's coast , tends to completely melt in the southern summer .
Why does it matter ?
Giant swaths of sea ice in the Arctic help control the world 's weather , as white ice reflects some 80 % of sunlight .
Sea ice also forms a natural barrier to navigation and trade in the frozen north , and generations of sailors have perished trying to find a way through .
In recent years , changes in sea ice have become a powerful symbol of man-made climate change , not least because polar bears need the ocean to freeze to forage for food .
How is it measured ?
The amount of ocean surface covered with sea ice has been measured by satellite since 1979 .
These images say little about ice thickness though , and for that information scientists have been forced to rely on patchy measurements taken by local people or Cold War submarines .
In spring 2009 , Arctic explorers led by Pen Hadow attempted to measure ice thickness during a trek across the ice on foot , but the effort was hampered by technical problems .
How is it changing ?
Arctic sea ice seems to melt more each summer .
While sea ice has always melted away in the spring , the speed and extent of the melt has accelerated in recent years .
A series of record lows since 2000 peaked in summer 2007 when summer sea ice extent in the Arctic shrank to the lowest level recorded .
Winter recovery of sea ice has also decreased .
What does that mean ?
Shrinking sea ice is now commonly used to demonstrate the reality of man-made global warming , particularly in the absence of other visible short - term impacts .
Scientists say the sharp acceleration in Arctic ice loss since 2000 could signal that the region has passed a tipping point , with man-made warming driving further ice loss as more summer heat is absorbed by open water .
Other scientists caution that wind and currents can also influence ice loss from year to year , and that the influence of global warming can only be properly judged over a longer time frame .
Dr Vicky Pope , head of climate change advice at the Met Office , has called on scientists and journalists to stop misleading the public with " claim and counter - claim " .
What will happen in future ?
It seems certain that the freezing darkness of the Arctic winter will continue to sustain sea ice , but the big question is when increased melting could cause the warming region to lose all of its ice in summer .
Estimates range from 2070 to 2013 , depending on whether experts believe the recent increased melt rate will continue .
Police Minister Neil Roberts this morning ruled out a temporary suspension of Tasers , telling reporters the weapons had saved lives in the past .
But Terry O'Gorman , vice president of the Queensland Council of Civil Liberties , said the decision was irresponsible .
" The Minister knows full well it will be 12 to 18 months before this matter reaches coronial inquest .
Are we going to risk the chance of another death in that time ? "
Mr O'Gorman said .
Criminal defence lawyer Jim Coburn , who has lobbied with other solicitors for the State Government to justify its decision to introduce Tasers with scientific evidence of their safety , said today 's tragedy was " inevitable " .
" This is the case we have feared since the fast - tracking of the Taser trial by the former Police Minister ( Judy Spence ) last year , " Mr Coburn , of Brisbane firm Ryan and Bosscher , told brisbanetimes.com.au .
" We 've warned about the introduction of Tasers in the first place and the potential for devastating effects .
Now it has happened .
" It is a dereliction of the Minister 's duty not to suspend their use immediately . "
Mr Roberts said separate probes by the Police Ethical Standards Command , the Crime and Misconduct Commission and the coroner 's office would examine the incident and whether the Taser had been used appropriately by police at the scene .
He ruled out a ban on the weapons until that
time .
" I do n't think that 's necessary at all .
In fact the the evidence clearly shows that from the initial trial and indeed the general roll out of the Taser they have been used very appropriately by police , " Mr Roberts told reporters .
" Every deployment of the Taser is investigated fully and reported .
If there are any complaints about the use of a Taser , there is a higher level of investigation that is involved . "
Frontline police were given Tasers by former Police Minister Judy Spence after a 12 - month trial was cut to six months last year .
Mr Roberts today defended the weapon 's use and said far from doing harm , they were in fact " saving people 's lives " .
" The evidence to date is showing the mere presentation of the Taser is actually diffusing situations .
" They are actually being deployed proportionally less than ( during ) the original trial .
" There are many other examples where the Taser has , I believe , actually saved people 's lives .
There have been people who are attempting to self harm and cause harm to others and the use of the Taser , rather than lethal force of a weapon , has diffused that situation immensely . "
Police Commissioner Bob Atkinson today said Tasers were a valid an effective use of force .
" It does not appear to me that we will stop the use of Tasers or the roll - out , " Mr Atkinson said .
Police said the 39 - year - old man , who had allegedly brandished an iron bar and broken glass , was shot three times with a Taser and had collapsed while being handcuffed .
He died before ambulance officers arrived on the scene .
He said a coronial inquiry would likely prove the electric shock device was not to blame .
" Although a Taser was used by police , at this stage I believe that it is unlikely that this will ultimately emerge as the cause of death , due to other contributing factors , " Mr Leavers said .
" I believe that the deceased had caused a number of injuries to his person prior to police arriving and whilst police were trying to apprehend him and it is possible that toxicology reports could also be helpful to the coroner . "
Mr Leavers is flying to Townsville to speak with the officers involved .
He said they were receiving support and counselling .
" It should also be noted that if the police officers did not have a Taser available in this case , they would certainly have had to resort to use of a firearm due to the level of danger that they were exposed to given that the deceased armed himself with a number of weapons .
" Any death in custody is a tragedy and all of our thoughts are with the family of the deceased as well as with the officers involved . "
It is believed the man 's death is the first in Queensland involving a Taser arrest .
A 39 - year - old man died in Alice Springs after being Tasered by police last month , and in 2002 , Gary Pearce , a violent , mentally - ill NSW 56 - year - old , died about two weeks after being shot with a stun gun when he threatened police with a frying pan .
A joint inquest in Brisbane heard all four - James Henry Jacobs , 29 , Thomas Dion Waite , 30 , Mieng Huynh , 40 , and James Michael Gear , 22 - had been in the throes of a psychotic episode and had become violent when they were gunned down either in their homes or in public .

Obama Writes Fourth Grader a Memorable Absence Note
By Michael A. Fletcher
GREEN BAY , Wis. -- John Corpus let his 10 - year - old daughter , Kennedy , skip her last day of fourth grade at Aldo Leopold Community School to attend a packed town hall meeting where she could see the president of the United States up close .
But things turned out to be more exciting than either one of them imagined .
First , President Obama called on Corpus to ask a question about his plans for health care reform .
As he posed his query , he let drop that his daughter was skipping school to see the president .
Does she need a note ?
Obama asked .
Playing along , Corpus said he would take Obama up on the offer .
To his surprise , Obama was serious .
" What 's her name , " Obama asked , reaching in his suit pocket for a pen .
When Corpus answered " John , " Obama repeated : " Her name ? "
" Kennedy , " Corpus replied .
" That 's a cool name , " Obama said , as he started to compose the missive .
" To Kennedy 's teacher , " read the note , written in black ink over the president 's distinctive signature .
" Please excuse Kennedy 's absence .... she 's with me . "

" How Much is Enough ? " : The U.S. Navy and " Finite Deterrence " *
A Moment in Cold War History when the Fundamentals of the U.S. Nuclear Posture Were at Stake
National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 275
Edited by William Burr
Posted - May 1 , 2009
For more information contact : William Burr - 202/994-7000
Photo of Admiral Arleigh A. Burke ( 1901 - 1996 ) , taken 8 July 1955 , the month before he became Chief of Naval Operations .
( Naval Historical Center , Photograph Division , Photo # : 80 -G-668829 ) ( Thanks to David A. Rosenberg for digital image )
Washington , DC , May 1 , 2009 - President Obama 's recent call for a " world without nuclear weapons " immediately raised questions of how do you get there , what does deterrence actually require before you get there , and how many nuclear weapons would that involve at each step .
Exactly these questions of " how much is enough " were raised fifty years ago in secret debate within the U.S. government , when Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke argued that a small force of mainly nuclear missile - launching Polaris submarines was enough for deterrence .
Burke and Navy leaders developed a concept of " finite " or " minimum " deterrence -- highly relevant to today 's debate -- that they believed would make the United States safer because it would dissuade nuclear attacks while removing pressures for a dangerous " hair - trigger " posture .
In early 1960 , when Eisenhower 's budget director Maurice Stans was told that the U.S. Navy 's Polaris missile - launching submarines could " destroy 232 targets , which was sufficient to destroy all of Russia , " he asked defense officials , " If POLARIS could do this job , why did we need other … ICBMs , SAC aircraft , and overseas bases ? "
According to Stans , the answer " he had received ... [ was ] that was someone else 's problem . "
An electronic briefing book of declassified documents obtained through archival research and published for the first time by the National Security Archive shows how the U.S.
Navy , tried to take responsibility for this " problem " by supporting a minimum deterrent force that would threaten a " finite " list of major urban - industrial and command centers in the heart of the Soviet Union .
With their capability to destroy key Soviet targets , Burke believed , the virtually undetectable and invulnerable Polaris submarines could " inflict terrible punishment " and deter Moscow from launching a surprise attack on the United States or its allies .
By contrast , Burke saw land - based missile and bombers as vulnerable to attack , which made the U.S. - Soviet nuclear relationship dangerously unstable .
While he did not propose eliminating all strategic bombers and ICBMs , he believed that a force of about 40 Polaris submarines ( 16 missiles each ) was a reasonable answer to the question " how much is enough ? "
Although the Kennedy administration rejected Burke 's concept , years later former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara revived it by arguing that 400 nuclear weapons were " enough " to deter a Soviet attack .
The Archive 's briefing book includes :
▪ A report by Admiral Roy Johnson arguing that the proper basis of deterrence lay in the " assured delivery of rather few weapons " which was " sufficient to inflict terrible punishment . "
Even " 10 delivered weapons would produce a major disaster with fully a quarter as many casualties as the first hundred . "
( Document 2 ) ▪
A speech by Arleigh Burke where he argued that Polaris submarines would mitigate the vulnerabilities of strategic forces , but would also " provide time to think in periods of tension " making possible gradual retaliation as well as opportunities for " political coercion , if we like , to gain national objectives more advantageous than simple revenge . "
( Document 5 ) ▪
The record of Burke 's conversation with the Secretary of the Navy , where , having lost a major bureaucratic conflict over the direction of nuclear targeting , he declared that Air Force leaders were " smart and ruthless ... it 's the same way as the Communists ; it 's exactly the same techniques . "
( Document 14 )
▪ Burke 's inside " Dope " newsletter to top Navy commanders where he declared that hair - trigger nuclear response capabilities and preemptive nuclear strategies were " dangerous for any nation " because they could initiate a " a war which would not otherwise occur . " ( Document 11 )
This is the first in a series of electronic briefing books that will document moments during the Cold War when top officials considered radical changes in the U.S. nuclear posture , involving significantly smaller strategic forces .
More powerful forces and conflicting policy imperatives defeated these proposals , but they are nonetheless worth revisiting because their proponents raised searching questions about nuclear strategy that were never properly addressed during the Cold War .
" How Much is Enough ? " : The U.S. Navy and " Finite Deterrence "
Ever since 1945 , and especially after when tensions with the former Soviet Union turned into Cold War , United States government officials and outside analysts have considered the question , " How much is enough ? " when thinking about appropriate levels for U.S. nuclear forces .
Were force levels just right , not large enough , or too large and dangerous to deter possible threats or to support other purposes , such as political coercion or preempting an attack ?
During the Cold War and since , other nuclear powers have faced similar questions and have come up with a range of answers .
China and France , for example , focused more on straightforward deterrence and built relatively small nuclear forces .
In contrast , the United States and the Soviet Union , both of which sought preemptive capabilities , produced a total of over 70,000 nuclear warheads as a result of their Cold War arms race .

In recent years , former high level U.S. officials , some of them Cold War hawks , have taken the discussion in a different direction by raising explicitly the prospect of abolishing nuclear weapons altogether on the grounds that their existence anywhere posed too many dangers in an age of non-state actor terrorism .
( Note 1 ) The goal has now become official policy in light of President Obama 's speech at Hradcany Square in Prague on April 5 , 2009 , where he proclaimed " America 's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons . "
A few days later , in a speech before the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace 's annual conference on nuclear nonproliferation , Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg discussed follow - on measures for reducing nuclear arsenals , beginning with a new U.S. - Russian arms reduction agreement .
In this new context , the implementation of a nuclear abolitionist agenda has become deeply policy - relevant .
Thus , practical matters such as first steps , including optimum levels of initial cuts and the sizing of transitional nuclear forces , have become germane .
The problem of " how much is enough " will need to be settled for the near - term and the longer - term .
Moreover , it also seems appropriate to look for a " usable past " and discover moments in recent history when U.S. government officials , from senior commanders to presidents , looked at the possibility of basic changes in the U.S. nuclear posture .
This is the first in a series of electronic briefing books that will document moments during the Cold War when top officials considered radical changes in the U.S. nuclear posture involving significantly smaller strategic forces .
More powerful forces and conflicting policy imperatives defeated these proposals , but they are nonetheless worth revisiting because their proponents raised searching questions about nuclear strategy that were never properly addressed during the Cold War . ( Note 2 )
The Polaris Program and the Origins of Finite Deterrence
The first such occasion was in the late 1950s - early 1960s when the concept of " finite deterrence " ( or " minimum deterrence " ) emerged as an alternative to the Eisenhower administration 's emphasis on " massive retaliation . "
( Note 3 ) With nuclear weapons reaching their maximum destructiveness and ballistic missiles about to become a central element of the U.S. nuclear arsenal , U.S. presidents would approve the formidable levels of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles ( ICBMs ) , and submarine - launched ballistic missiles ( SLBMs ) , and strategic bombers that characterized the remaining decades of the Cold War .
The pressures for high numbers of weapons were substantial , stemming from the Air Force 's standard operating procedure of targeting numerous Soviet military installations ( " counterforce " ) , as well as the exaggerated apprehensions in Washington about a " missile gap " favoring Moscow .
Nevertheless , Chief of Naval Operations ( CNO ) Admiral Arleigh Burke and senior State Department officials rejected Air Force strategy on the grounds that a smaller nuclear force , consisting mainly of Polaris submarine - launched missiles and threatening a " finite " group of Soviet urban - industrial targets , would be enough for the deterrence mission .
For the Navy , a force that could offer devastating retaliation to a Soviet nuclear attack was enough to deter Moscow .
A deterrent force based on submarines , proponents argued , would provide more secure , nearly invulnerable , weapons and put policymakers under far less pressure to launch quickly in a crisis than would bombers and ICBMs .
Critically shaping the Navy perspective was the prospect of the Polaris ballistic missile program , which would deploy intermediate range ballistic missiles ( IRBM ) on nuclear submarines , launching them from below the ocean 's surface .
When Arleigh Burke initiated the innovative Polaris submarine - launched ballistic missile ( SLBM ) program in the mid-1950s , he was interested in a capability that would reduce the U.S. 's dependence on vulnerable fixed - base weapons , such as the Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) bomber force .
The conviction that submarine - based IRBMs would be virtually undetectable informed Navy thinking that Polaris could become the U.S. 's chief nuclear deterrent force , supplemented by carrier aircraft and limited numbers of bombers and ICBMs ( although some Navy strategists proposed a Navy - only deterrent system ) .
In a line of reasoning developed by the Navy 's strategists and others , the Polaris fleet would provide a " finite deterrent " to any threats of nuclear attack or nuclear blackmail by the Soviet Union .
A Naval commander , Paul Backus , coined the term " finite deterrence " in a prize - winning paper he published in early 1959 .
( Note 4 )
What makes the Navy 's approach so interesting is that it was developing ideas for a limited nuclear force posture during a tense period of the Cold War when a " missile gap " was beginning to preoccupy national leaders .
Yet , Navy leaders and like - minded State Department officials were tenacious Cold Warriors who believed that their strategy would enable the United States to prosecute the conflict with Communist states more effectively without some of the dangers posed by alternative postures .
Defense Politics and the Eclipse of Finite Deterrence
If the Navy 's finite deterrence strategy had prevailed , the superpower nuclear arms race might have developed in a different way , with a smaller strategic arsenal on the U.S. side , and perhaps a parallel development on the Soviet side .
Yet , as confident as Navy leaders were in the validity of their strategic concept , they were operating in an uncongenial political environment .
Ideas of " minimum " or " finite deterrence " lacked enough institutional and political support to make them viable , especially in the tense atmosphere of the late 1950s and early 1960s when pressures were moving in the opposite direction .
Burke and his colleagues were developing their ideas in the wake of the " Sputnik " flap and the " missile gap " controversy when many worried that the Soviet Union was going to produce a substantial and threatening ICBM force that could knock out SAC .
President Eisenhower , who worried about excessive force levels , nonetheless supported both Polaris and a large Minuteman ICBM force because of his uncertainty about Soviet capabilities and possible U.S. vulnerability .
Influential Democrats , such as former Secretary of the Air Force Sen. Stuart Symington ( D - Mo ) repeatedly charged that the Eisenhower administration was letting U.S. air power fall behind the Soviets , and when the missile gap controversy emerged , he stepped up the pressure , as did Senator John F. Kennedy , who was positioning himself as a defense hawk for the 1960 presidential campaign .
While Symington and Kennedy strongly supported Polaris , they had no interest in constraining SAC 's role in nuclear strategy .
( Note 5 )
The Navy had a powerful adversary in the Air Force , whose leaders sought a large ICBM force to support their expansive and expensive counterforce strategy and because finite deterrence represented an attack on their strategic concepts .
In speeches , Air Force leaders harshly attacked Navy concepts for rejecting " war winning objectives in nuclear war " ( see Document 16 below ) .
While the Air Force was not strong enough to get control of the Polaris fleet through a failed bid to centralize control over strategic forces , it won other battles with the Navy , notably in a conflict over organizational mechanisms for creating the Single Integrated Operational Plan ( SIOP ) .
While the targets that the Navy emphasized for deterrence , major urban - industrial centers , were part of the SIOP , the overwhelming emphasis of the war plan was counterforce , Soviet nuclear threat targets .
( Note 6 )
Kennedy 's attacks on the Republicans and their presidential candidate , Vice President Richard Nixon , over a missile gap , helped him win the presidency .
In the first days of the new administration , in January 1961 , Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara received what turned out to be an all - day briefing on the recently produced Weapons Systems Evaluation Group ( WSEG ) - 50 report on the strategic force posture .
Completed at the end of the Eisenhower administration , the WSEG - 50 study sharply criticized counterforce strategy , but it also found minimum deterrence wanting for not providing a credible enough threat .
The oral presentation , however , may have given a better spin on the Navy 's strategy and the possibility of basing national deterrence strategy on the Polaris submarine fleet .
While the briefing greatly impressed McNamara , an Air Force Project RAND briefing on counterforce strategy that he heard a few days later had an even more important impact .
McNamara remained enthusiastic about Polaris and its role in a " controlled response " strategy for later stages of a nuclear war , but Project RAND " no cities / counterforce " concepts would strongly influence his thinking .
By contrast , White House science adviser Jerome Wiesner and the President 's Science Advisory Committee ( PSAC ) supported finite deterrence concepts , but their influence was marginal when compared to McNamara's .

When Arleigh Burke retired as CNO in the summer of 1961 , the most committed supporter of finite deterrence was out of government .
That Burke 's ideas had no place in the Kennedy administration became evident in the fall of 1961 when Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara sent a report to President Kennedy explicitly rejecting " finite deterrence " as a plausible strategic posture ( although he later changed his mind ) .
Thus , " overkill " levels of bomber , ICBM , and SLBM forces developed during the 1960s and remained substantially uncut until the Cold War had ended .
With proposals for nuclear abolition having more currency than ever ( Note 8 ) , the documents on the finite deterrence debate presented below are relevant for present discussions , even though they were produced under the very different circumstances of the Cold War .
For a possible transition to a world without nuclear weapons , an alternative force posture is likely to prove necessary because an abolition project will unfold in stages , beginning with significant cuts in force levels by nuclear states .
In this connection , a transitional nuclear force on the scale once proposed by Navy planners becomes highly relevant .
Whether it consists wholly of a scaled - down version of the " triad " of submarines , bombers , and ICBMs , an all submarine force , or new mix , its creation would require complex calculations , military politics , and probably some Congressional logrolling .
But older Navy arguments about the stability and security offered by an SLBM - based deterrent can usefully be taken into account .
In any event , to the extent that a new force mix becomes the subject of arms control negotiations with Russia and other nuclear powers , it could involve verification issues that are far more complex than those addressed in past talks .
( Note 9 )
The limits of " finite deterrence " also have to be considered .
With its emphasis on major industrial cities and political control targets , the Navy strategy conflicted with laws of war , namely the Geneva Conventions which prohibit the targeting of civilian population .
But the same conflict inhered in the SIOP and its successors , which have posited urban - industrial complexes as a target system .
Indeed , while proponents of finite deterrence in the Navy and the State Department acknowledged that their strategy , if implemented , would kill huge numbers of people , they believed that it was less destructive of human life than Air Force counterforce strategy , with its emphasis on high - yield ground - burst weapons .
Later , U.S. targeting policy would become more obfuscactory ( e.g. , targeting " economic recovery " capabilities ) , but the results would have been mass civilian fatalities .
( Note 10 )
Continued ambiguity may provide a template for a new force posture , but a recent report by Robert S. Norris ( Natural Resources Defense Council ) , Hans Kristensen and Ivan Oelrich ( Federation of American Scientists ) suggests a " minimal deterrence " strategy that has potential to minimize civilian casualties while providing a serious threat to adversaries .
Rejecting counterforce as massively destructive and destabilizing , they propose an emphasis on major infrastructural targets ( e.g. , power plants , petroleum refineries , transportation centers ) that are " crucial to a nation 's modern economy . "
Destroying such targets with very low - yield nuclear weapons would pose far less threat to human life than current military planning but would nevertheless " guarantee pain if an adversary unwisely attacks the United States or its allies with nuclear weapons . "
This line of thinking is generally consistent with the emphasis that earlier finite deterrence placed on " essential " targets and deserves further discussion .
( Note 11 )
More could be usefully learned about finite deterrence and its role in national security politics and policymaking during the late 1950s and early 1960s , such as any efforts by Arleigh Burke to bring his views to civilian and military officials outside of the Navy 's ranks .
Moreover , some internal discussions of nuclear strategy in Navy papers remain classified .
While the Navy has kept Burke 's papers closed for many years , perhaps they will some day be available to researchers .
Future declassification releases by government agencies may further illuminate this moment when top policymakers contemplated major changes in the U.S. nuclear posture .

While the Navy was developing the Polaris submarine and missile , a wide - ranging discussion was taking place in the U.S. government about the possibility of installing land - based intermediate - range ballistic missiles ( IRBMs ) in Europe and elsewhere .
Reacting to an earlier Navy memorandum on a possible IRBM deployment in the Middle East , Deputy Chief of Naval Operations Ruthven Libby suggested that was inadvisable because both the Soviets and the Strategic Air Command sought to target and to destroy " every known airfield and all known atomic facilities . "
Such a targeting strategy would produce a disaster : " The damage and casualties to each country accruing from the atomic exchange designed primary to eliminate each other 's atomic capability is all out of proportion to the purely military objective ; and it is generally acknowledged that effective defense against this attack is not possible . "
Believing that the U.S. strategic posture was becoming dangerously unstable , Libby argued that the " best defense is to remove our atomic retaliatory capability from fixed bases either in the United States or elsewhere and put it afloat , " thereby " eliminat[ing ] the military necessity which the Soviets will feel to attack the continental United States " in general war .
Vice CNO Admiral Harry
Felt looked askance at this paper , but Libby suggested that there had been some misunderstanding .
It was not a matter of " casting envious eyes on the SAC side of the fence , " because it was not the Navy that " needs the IRBM ; the IRBM needs the Navy . "
Deploying IRBMs on submarines would enable the Navy to do something better and far more sweeping than superimposing itself on SAC .
Using language that would have caused nightmares among Air Force leaders , Libby suggested that ship - borne IRBMs could actually " supplant [ SAC capability ] in substantial measure . "
If " we had a substantial number of IRBM submarines deployed … around the Eurasian periphery , we would have a retaliatory capability which would be difficult … for the Soviets to neutralize . "
Further , " I think the United States would be better advised to channel funds and manpower in this direction rather than to more B - 52s , more airfields , more tankers , and more overseas bases in somebody else 's front yard . "
The term " finite deterrence " had yet to be coined , but Libby 's emphasis on a retaliatory submarine - based deterrent was heading towards it .

The radical concepts that Admiral Libby spelled out in his brief memoranda were fleshed out more thoroughly in a report prepared by Admiral Roy Johnson 's Long Range Objectives Group ( Op - 93 ) and the Naval Warfare Analysis Group .
( Note 12 ) Rejecting SAC 's strategic concepts ( as well as preventive war ) , Navy analysts argued that the proper basis of deterrence lay in the " assured delivery of rather few weapons " which was " sufficient to inflict terrible punishment . "
Even " 10 delivered weapons would produce a major disaster with fully a quarter as many casualties as the first hundred . "
Moreover , with deterrence based on invulnerable missile - launching submarines there would be " no premium on striking the first blow " and it would be possible to use strategic forces with " constraint and deliberation . "
If deterrence failed , such a capability would decrease the " magnitude of the economic and social disaster of general war … and afford a prospect of salvaging at least some national political objectives . "
The analysts further suggested that the Soviet Union would ultimately develop comparable systems " invulnerable to surprise " which could lead to a " stable stalemate of ‘ mutual deterrence . ' "
This may not be the first use of the term " mutual deterrence , " but it may have been a very early use .
Besides laying out the conceptual basis for a new strategy , the report included recommendations to reorient planning , forces , and budgets .
Thus , SAC should be " constrained " to move it away from its emphasis on the " initiation " of attack , while the submarine - launched fleet ballistic missile ( FBM ) program should accelerate , high - yield warheads should play a smaller role in the nuclear stockpile , and conventional forces should be expanded for greater " freedom of action " in Cold War confrontations .
For their criticisms of the Air Force 's risky force posture , it is worth noting that the authors argue that " Hungary was defaulted primarily for lack of divisions in Europe . "

One way that CNO Arleigh Burke kept in touch with his admirals was by sending out bulletins expressing his thinking and knowledge --- the inside " dope " — on a range of issues , from budgets to administration , but also strategic assessments .
In a set of talking points for use by senior officers when publicly discussing the Polaris system , Burke advised the admirals to avoid " wild claims " because Polaris had yet to be tested as a system .
Moreover , admirals should not argue that the Navy wanted to put all the " nation 's eggs in one basket for deterrence . "
Nevertheless , Burke 's arguments about Polaris 's advantages pointed in that direction by identifying fixed - based systems with provocation , instability , vulnerability , and arms races .

In a report to the admirals on budget developments , Burke provided some of the flavor of inter-service rivalries over nuclear weapons systems .
For the Navy , the key items in the proposed add - on to the fiscal year 1959 budget were acceleration of the Polaris program and augmentation of anti-submarine warfare capabilities .
With the Secretary of Defense giving the services an opportunity to comment on each other 's programs , the Navy found both the Army and the Air Force criticizing Polaris .
The Army pointed to its " unproved " feasibility and joined the Air Force in raising questions about Polaris 's accuracy and its ability to strike " specific targets . "
The Air Force also questioned the system 's abilities to " maintain an alert on station " status and to " transmit and receive communications while submerged . "
For its part , the Air Force was pushing the solid - fuel Minuteman ICBM as a successor to the liquid - fuel Atlas and Titan missiles .
Burke saw an Air Force design to use Minuteman to " kill " Polaris because it was making " drastic claims about the minimum costs and time scale of completion of MINUTEMAN in comparison with POLARIS . "

Source : Library of Congress , Thomas White Papers , box 28 , Navy [ Also available on Digital National Security Archive , U.S. Nuclear History , 1955 - 1968 ]
The Navy 's new thinking disturbed Air Force leaders like Chief of Staff Thomas
White who wanted to make a case against it by finding examples of older Navy language condemning " inhuman and indiscriminate bombing of cities and population . "
White 's assistant ( future JCS chairman ) George S. Brown could not find any examples , but he did find an unclassified Arleigh Burke statement making the basic case for the Navy 's approach .
According to Burke , Polaris would mitigate strategic force vulnerabilities , but it would also " provide time to think in periods of tension " making possible gradual retaliation as well as opportunities for " political coercion , if we like , to gain national objectives more advantageous than simple revenge . "
In addition , " security against surprise … discourages an arms race , " which reliance on " the fortress concept " of buried fixed installations would aggravate .

State Department Policy Planning Staff director Gerard C. Smith had been working closely with Secretary of State John Foster Dulles in trying to develop alternatives to massive retaliation which both believed was becoming less and less credible as the " primary deterrent to all kinds of Communist aggression . "
In this paper , Smith fleshed out proposals for a minimum deterrence force that he believed was consistent with the direction of Dulles ' thinking .
But Smith 's suggestions for an alternative nuclear strategy met formidable resistance at the Pentagon , although some of his ideas would dovetail with the policies of the Democratic administrations during the 1960s .
( Note 13 )
Like Navy planners , Smith rejected the Air Force 's " counter - force " strategy with its emphasis on targeting " very large - yield " nuclear weapons on Soviet strategic installations .
He argued that quick - reacting ICBMs would be elusive targets and that the resulting nuclear explosions and fall - out would kill millions around the world ; moreover , budgetary costs were substantial .
As an alternative to massive retaliation and a vulnerable force of bombers and missiles , Smith placed " much greater emphasis … on the invulnerability of the force . "
He suggested striking a " finite " list of targets - -" control centers and power bases " — using smaller yield and airburst weapons ; damage and fatalities would be large , but not as destructive as a counter - force attack .
The U.S. would be striking major political and population centers , which would be " fatal to the structure of [ the Soviet ] empire . "
It would be interesting to know whether Smith chose the word " finite " on his own or whether he had read ( or heard about ) the Backus paper prior to publication .
Smith did not mention Polaris , but he must have been thinking about submarines and mobile missiles generally when he wrote that " mobility and elusiveness are among the qualities we should emphasize . "
Those qualities , Smith argued , would have great advantages ; not only would they make impractical " a pre-emptive Soviet nuclear attack to disarm us , " they would also reduce the " risk of war by misadventure as we would not have to react instantaneously to an ambiguous threat of major Communist aggression . "
Moreover , a force that directly threatened Soviet " imperial control centers " would be more acceptable to allies than counter - force because of the lessened " danger of severe fall - out effects extending around the world . "
Like strategists in the Navy , Smith also assumed that Washington needed credible alternatives to incredible massive nuclear threats ; therefore , he supported spending on limited war / flexible response conventional capabilities for more likely contingencies in NATO Europe and the Third World .
And like Navy leaders , Smith argued that a new nuclear posture would save money , making it possible to expand conventional forces : " savings resulting from a shift to a smaller nuclear strategic nuclear striking force would offset the increased costs of an effective limited war force . "
While Eisenhower opposed the changes in the military posture that Smith had in mind , the latter 's ideas about conventional forces presaged the " flexible response " approach that emerged during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations .

Source : Washington Navy Yard , Operational Archive , Flag Officers " Dope , " CNO Personal Newsletter and Memorandum # 44 - 49 May - June 1959
With this study , " finite deterrence " entered into the CNO 's vocabulary .
Some of the argument restated points made in earlier documents , such as Burke 's letter to retired admirals [ document 6 ] and Smith 's memorandum , but the report provided a comprehensive treatment of the Navy 's new concepts .
Rejecting preventive war or " surprise attack " on Soviet nuclear bases as a strategy — it would " launch a world holocaust " — Burke argued that the United States must chose a " finite " set of targets which would require fewer megatons than counterforce .
A " finite deterrence " target system would threaten " the most vulnerable and essential features in Soviet life : … the control structure of their government and the Communist Party and the industrial complex which is the foundation of their national power . "
That would " mean killing a lot of people " if war came , but like Smith , Burke argued that counterforce relying on ground - burst strikes of high - yield weapons would " result in killing a much larger number of people . "
While Burke allowed for the importance of " multiple strike systems " , the analysis emphasized the value of invulnerable weapons systems " in the years ahead " and the problems associated with air bases and land - based missiles .

SAC 's commander - in- chief ( CINCSAC )
Thomas Power 's proposal to establish a strategic command that would control the Polaris fleet preoccupied Burke and his colleagues for the following year .
While Power argued that better coordination of strategic forces required centralized control , Burke was not going to give up Navy control of Polaris .
As a background source told the old Washington Star , the Air Force " will have to walk over a prostrate Arleigh Burke to get " Polaris .
In this CNO " Dope " piece , Burke reviewed the briefing he gave to Secretary of Defense Neil McElroy arguing that the " present unified command structure is entirely adequate and needs no basic changes to handle Polaris . "
From Burke 's perspective , a " single command " could delay retaliation against a Soviet attack : " Strike back capability must be dispersed to more than one Unified Commander just as certainly as the individual striking units must be dispersed . "
Burke prevailed to the extent that he kept a naval officer in command of Polaris ; the first Polaris boats would be under the control of the Naval officer who was commander - in - chief of both the Atlantic Command ( CINCLANT ) and Atlantic Fleet ( CINCLANTFLT ) .
But this was a power - sharing arrangement because the Atlantic Command was a unified command which reported directly to the Joint Chiefs and ultimately the Secretary of Defense .

Source : National Archives , Record Group 218 , Records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , file : 3205 ( 17 Aug 59 )
Hoping that ongoing studies of national nuclear targeting policy would preserve the Navy 's autonomy , Burke intervened in the discussions which led to the creation of the Single Integrated Operational Plan later in 1960 ( SIOP ) .
Significant portions of Burke 's memorandum remain excised , but he tactfully raised his concerns about Air Force strategy in his discussion of " how much is enough . "
As long as some of the services were making an " over- estimate of the [ attack ] effort required " the United States would end up with a " needlessly high number of weapons and delivery forces . "
To get the right balance , Burke wanted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to " repossess some of their prerogatives " instead of delegating war planning authority to others , especially the SAC leadership .
So that the United States would " prevail in general war , " Burke supported the idea of a " diversified threat " to the Soviet Union .
Burke asserted that with short warning time and greater missile accuracies , " we can no longer place major reliance upon planes operating from fixed bases " or rely on " fixed missile sites , even though hardened . "
Cautiously putting across the idea of finite deterrence , he argued that what the United States needed for deterrence was a " retaliatory force that stays alive " and Polaris was a " missile system that can , above all others , stay alive . "
Later in the paper , he emphasized the security advantages of " returning to an artillery concept " but without " us[ing ]
United States soil as the artillery base . "
" Technology provides us with the means for using the oceans as the artillery base . "

Although classified secret , Burke 's piece for his admirals on the Polaris system 's potential may have been meant for their use as background for discussing the submarine with members of the public .
Believing that the American public needs to be " accurately and truthfully informed " about how it could be defended but also shown that the Navy was " far - sighted , " Burke suggested that the Navy should not keep Polaris 's " developmental potential " under a bushel .
In a set of arguments designed to highlight the superiority of the SSBN [ ship submersible - ballistic missile - nuclear powered ] over other strategic nuclear systems , Burke declared that as Polaris missiles acquired longer ranges , it would allow the United States to " move its deterrent missile forces many , many miles from land , " to " enlarge the possible launch area … to tens of millions of square miles , " and assure " beyond any question the invulnerability of the SSBN system .

Beginning in 1958 , the Strategic Air Command began testing the feasibility of the airborne alert concept of flying nuclear - armed B - 52s on a continuous basis .
As Burke 's editorial suggested , he was skeptical of this new program ; it could cause excessive wear and tear on B - 52s and funding for bombers would disadvantage Polaris and the ICBM programs .
But , as his short essays on preventive / preeemptive war and ballistic missiles indicated , what really worried Burke was a " hair trigger " strategic posture .
He did not specifically mention the Air Force -- the branch of the service most commonly associated with preemptive , first strike , and rapid reaction strategic capabilities — but Burke believed that such postures were " dangerous for any nation . "
Not only did preemptive strategies " place too great a dependence upon the reliability and effectiveness of [ the ] intelligence system , " they created a need for quick reacting weapons systems that would help a country " get the jump on the other nation " and " devastate [ it [ before it is devastated . "
The danger , as Burke saw it , was " initiating a war which would not otherwise occur . "
With survivable and invulnerable forces , such as Polaris , providing " true deterrence " such risks could be minimized .
" No hair - trigger decision based on real or fancied intelligence is necessary . "
The then on - going discussions of an alleged U.S. - Soviet " missile gap " did not alarm Burke , even if the Soviets " lead us . "
He believed the U.S. 's world - wide deployment of nuclear strike forces — with SAC and carrier - based forces around the world , as well as nuclear forces in Western Europe — would be able to deter " even the maddest Russian . "
As he argued , the Soviet leadership has " striven too hard to industrialize Russia to risk its devastation . "
While the United States could not be complacent because advances in Soviet ICBM accuracy were possible , if it continued to develop " fully mobile " and concealed retaliatory forces , the United States would " provide the enemy with a surprise attack timing and coordination problem of … almost insurmountable proportions . "

This group of excerpts from National Security Council minutes includes a startling comment by Eisenhower 's budget director , Maurice Stans ( later Richard Nixon 's chief fund - raiser as director of Committee to Re- Elect the President ) .
Told that the Polaris missile force could " destroy 232 targets , which was sufficient to destroy all of Russia , " he asked defense officials , " If POLARIS could do this job , why did we need other IRBMs or ICBMs , SAC aircraft , and overseas bases ? "
According to Stans , the answer " he had received … [ was ] that was someone else 's problem . "
In any event , the Navy estimated that a fleet of about 45 submarines would be enough to threaten the list of Sino - Soviet targets , given that some percentage of them would be at sea , with the rest at home base , coming , or going .
By the end of the year , the first Polaris submarine was patrolling North Sea waters in striking range of the Soviet Union .

Burke was pleased to report to his commanders that the Polaris testing program was showing good results which in turn had enabled the Navy to recommend accelerating the construction program and augmenting the size of the prospective fleet .
Also under consideration at the Pentagon was a proposal to deploy Polaris missiles on surface ships .
What really troubled Burke was criticism of the program and he provided the admirals with information to rebut the critics on a number of issues , including missile accuracy and range , warhead power , communications , and submarine vulnerability .

While Burke kept the Polaris out of the hands of a new unified command , he lost the battle over control of strategic targeting policy , a contest which SAC and the Air Force won .
This record of a long conversation between Burke and Secretary of the Navy William B. Franke gives a detailed account of the bureaucratic maneuvering and presidential decisions which gave SAC 's commander - in - chief a second hat as director of the Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff ( JSTPS ) with responsibility for preparing the Single Integrated Operational Plan ( SIOP ) .
Having proposed that the Joint Chiefs of Staff prepare the " master target list , " which would give the Navy a prominent role in shaping nuclear strategy , Burke believed that the plan for a JSTPS would undercut the JCS 's authority .
President Eisenhower thought otherwise , agreeing with Secretary of Defense Thomas Gates that there was not enough coordination of targeting and that the Joint Chiefs and the Joint Staff lacked the capability to prepare a detailed war plan .
Burke told Franke that he would accept the new arrangement and wanted to " make this thing work " , but he was plainly disturbed by the prospect of SAC control over the war plan .
While the JSTPS would include Navy representatives , including the deputy director , Burke did not think it would make much difference , " like putting a little bug in a piece of plastic … The plastic encases the bug . "
Gates told Burke that the target list was " going to be small , " but the CNO thought it was " going to be a big list . "
With SAC control , " the number of atomic weapons will be tremendous and they will be the wrong kind of atomic weapons .
The number of forces will be tremendous . "
As it turned out , SIOP - 62 embodied the levels of " overkill " that worried Burke , with over 3,200 weapons aimed at over a thousand targets .
As far as national strategic planning was concerned , " finite deterrence " was off the table .

Source : Washington Navy Yard , Operational Archive , Flag Officers " Dope , " CNO Personal Newsletter and Memorandum 23 December 1960
In perhaps his last " Dope " newsletter , Burke reviewed the major Army , Navy , and Air Force weapons systems then under consideration , including the Army 's Nike - Zeus anti-ballistic missile program and the Air Force 's B - 52 , B - 70 , Skybolt , Atlas , Titan , and Minuteman programs .
On Nike - Zeus , he cited the Air Force 's criticisms , but nevertheless supported more research and development work , although production should not be undertaken until " effectiveness [ is ] known . "
On the Air Force programs , Burke supported Pentagon recommendations for B - 52 wings , but he was highly critical of the Skybolt air - launched missile ( which was doomed , in any event ) , the B - 70 bomber , and all of the Air Force ICBM programs .
Atlas and Titan he saw , as did others , as vulnerable ; Burke recommended curtailing both missiles .
While the Air Force wanted over 800 Minutemen by Fiscal Year 1964 , Burke saw that as too many because of unproven cost effectiveness and survivability problems ; moreover , " a large number of these missiles will draw more ICBMs into the United States . "
Even if nuclear targeting policy was going in a direction that Burke opposed , he still held his finite deterrent commitment , perhaps believing that Polaris would prove itself and the logic of the case would prevail .
Therefore , he recommended " major reliance on systems of high inherent survivability , proven reliability and accuracy . "
Document 16 : " Open Strategic Invitation to Acts of Soviet Military Aggression "
Speech by General David A. Burchinal at Air War College , " Joint Planning from a Service Viewpoint , " 12 January 1961 , Secret
Source : Air Force FOIA release [ Also available on Digital National Security Archive , U.S. Nuclear History , 1955 - 1968 ]
In a lengthy and informative speech to the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base , Air Force deputy director of plans Lieutenant General David Burchinal gave a presentation on the making of national military strategy and its relationship to military planning and budgeting processes .
The speech is especially instructive on the strategic planning process , including the production of the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan ( JSCP ) , the annual plan for the " employment " of the armed forces for three major contingencies : continued cold war , limited war , or general nuclear war .
Burchinal showed how inter-service struggles over budgets , influence , and doctrine shaped military planning and occasioned significant " splits " between the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
At the doctrinal level , Burchinal emphasized the Air Force 's commitment to a counterforce strategy that threatened Soviet military assets , in particular strategic nuclear forces , which he argued were what Moscow found most " unacceptable " to lose .
Explicitly rejecting the concept of finite deterrence , Burchinal implied that the Navy 's opposition to counterforce was defeatist : it was the denial of a " war- winning objective in general nuclear war " ( p. 26 ) .
From the Air Force perspective , by limiting limited targets to urban - industrial areas , finite deterrence was an " open strategic invitation to acts of Soviet military aggression against our allies or in peripheral areas – against which we can do nothing because of strategic inadequacy . "
Implicitly , Burchinal assumed that the prospect of urban - industrial destruction would not sufficiently deter the Soviets from aggressive political moves toward NATO Europe or third world countries .
For first - strike - minded Air Force leaders , what was especially troubling about Navy strategy was that it was useful only for retaliation and that was " not enough . "
Finite deterrence is " part of a strategy … not a whole strategy . "

Source : Washington Navy Yard , Operational Archives , Strategic Plans Division ( 1961 ) , Box 411 , 3060 Military Preparation for War ( Continental Defense )
In one of the last Navy proposals for a finite deterrence posture , Rear Admiral George Miller , then assigned to the Joint Staff , argued that the new SIOP , with its emphasis on a first - strike contingency , was not adequate for retaliation in the event that " our fixed bases and command control centers had been destroyed . "
The Navy should develop plans for that situation , he argued , but also a " building program … with the objective of providing , in the next 5 - 10 years , a more dependable deterrent retaliatory posture for the United States . "
The current posture of " hair trigger readiness , " reliance on vulnerable fixed - base systems , and " provocative intelligence - gathering , " Miller argued , " could cause such uneasiness among our enemies as to our real intentions " that they may launch a surprise attack .
Therefore , Miller proposed removing " nuclear striking forces from within the United States and [ deploying ] them in mobile bases over the far reaches of the global uninhabited seas . "
Top officials on the CNO 's staff , such as Admirals Thomas Moorer and Ulysses S. Grant Sharp , as well as Deputy CNO James Russell , read Miller 's paper and agreed with much of it .
Yet they saw faulty assumptions ( e.g. , about basing of U.S. ICBMs ) and a lack of realism that would make it necessary to re-work the proposal .
Moreover , both Russell and Sharp also believed that Miller 's proposal would be seen as " parochial " because , in Sharp 's words , it " aimed at providing the Navy with the capability to do the job alone . "
Observing that " the USAF is too entrenched in aerospace to permit such a radical shift in funding , " Moorer suggested a " positive approach " of trying to get along with the other services .
The Navy had to keep in mind that the Army and Air Force " also make a significant contribution " even if their forces did not have " the survival potential of forces afloat . "

Two days before he retired as Chief of Naval Operations , Arleigh Burke , with Secretary of the Navy John Connally , testified before the Senate Arms Service Committee .
In this Air Force record of the testimony , Burke and Connally showed unmistakable self - assurance in their discussion of advantages of Polaris and the disadvantages of competing systems .
In keeping with Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara 's stated preference for forces which could " ride out " a nuclear attack , whose survival did not require a " hair trigger response , " and could be " applied with deliberation " by national authorities , Connally emphasized Polaris 's " freedom from the catastrophic conditions existing on land if an enemy strikes first . "
Burke expounded on the " unique capabilities of the system and … its virtual invulnerability to enemy action . "
When Senator Stuart Symington ( D - Mo ) questioned Polaris 's indetectability , Burke flatly responded that Polaris " could not be detected " ; further , he " could point to no R&D technique having any promise in this area . "
The displeasure of Air Force officers in Burke 's testimony is evident when they cited Burke 's disparagement of silo - based ICBMs and the " presumption that they could not survive in the years to come . "
In his testimony Burke had " referred to ground shock problems and the fact that such parts as heavy silo doors could be jammed by the impact of nuclear weapons . "

Robert McNamara greatly valued the Polaris system , especially because it could serve as a reserve force to threaten Soviet cities in the event of a Soviet first strike .
Therefore , he supported a force of 41 submarines , with 16 missiles each , which coincided with Burke 's original estimate .
( Note 19 ) Moreover , early in the administration , McNamara reacted positively to the WSEG briefing suggesting that a Polaris submarine force would be enough for the U.S. deterrence posture .
Nevertheless , Air Force / RAND
Corporation ideas would have a more powerful influence on his thinking and by the fall of 1961 , using a sort of straw - man argument McNamara rejected " minimum deterrence " ( see pages 4 - 5 ) .
( Note 20 ) While he rejected as impractical the first - strike capability sought by the Air Force , McNamara nevertheless saw finite deterrence wanting because it could not threaten " high - priority " military targets in retaliation to a deliberate Soviet attack ; that was necessary , to " reduce Soviet power and limit the damage that can be done to us by vulnerable Soviet follow - on forces . "
Like Air Force leaders , McNamara believed that finite deterrence could not provide that capability nor was it sufficiently threatening to deter " Soviet aggression against our Allies . "

Rejecting minimum deterrence , McNamara eventually supported a Minuteman force of 1000 ICBMs as a compromise with the Air Force , which had wanted much more .
Nevertheless , several years later , and perhaps remembering the briefing on Polaris , McNamara hinted that a small nuclear force was sufficient for the basic deterrence mission of " assured destruction , " which was a term that he and his advisers developed for sizing strategic force levels .
In a Draft Presidential Memorandum ( DPM ) sent to President Johnson in late 1964 , McNamara defined an assured destruction force as one that could destroy 25 percent of the Soviet Union 's population and more than two - thirds of its industrial capacity .
That was a " level of destruction [ that ] would certainly represent intolerable punishment to any industrialized national and this should serve as an effective deterrent " ( p. 4 ) .
Several pages later , during a discussion of the " destructive potential of various size U.S. attacks on Soviet cities , " McNamara observed that a force of 400 strategic weapons was enough to destroy " nearly 30 percent of the population of the entire nation " and " almost three - fourths of the industrial capacity of the Soviet Union . "
In other words , a force of 400 was sufficient to achieve the " assured destruction " mission .
Doubling the number , to 800 , would only produce marginal benefits .
The experience of the Cuban Missile Crisis , among other considerations , may have encouraged McNamara to make this point .
When President Kennedy and the " ExCom " learned that the Air Force could not guarantee that a U.S. air strike would destroy all Soviet missiles on Cuba , the prospect that even one missile would survive was enough to deter the United States from taking military action against Cuba .
In any event , McNamara drew no explicit policy conclusions from his brief discussion of 400 weapons ; he may not have seen 400 as a plausible force level for deterrence because elsewhere in the DPM he supported a " balanced " nuclear force that included some damage limiting capability .
Nevertheless , over the years his thinking shifted and by the 1980s , if not earlier , he supported a concept of deterrence that echoed earlier Navy thinking .
In 1986 , he wrote that " five hundred or fewer warheads " were sufficient for deterrence .
Perhaps forgetting his earlier rejection of finite deterrence , McNamara wrote that he had learned , from reading David Rosenberg 's work , that " in 1958 and 1959 the Navy had put forward such a plan . "

Homeless ?
Ruth Madoff to Lose Penthouse , Other Homes Meanwhile , government asks for life in prison for Bernie .
June 26 , 2009  -- Ruth Madoff , the wife of convicted Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff , will lose the couple 's $ 7 million Manhattan penthouse , according to a stipulation agreed to by the government and Madoff 's defense attorneys .
The couple 's other homes in Palm Beach and the Hamptons are also set to be sold by U.S. Marshals .
Meanwhile , the government late Friday submitted its sentencing request , asking Judge Denny Chin to sentence Madoff to 150 years in prison – a term that is the equivalent to consecutive maximum sentences on all the counts of his indictment .
Alternatively , the government said in its twenty two page filing , he should serve a prison sentence that both would assure he would " remain in prison for life , and forcefully promote general deterrence . "
" Madoff 's crimes were serious and long - running , complex , and highly orchestrated and devastating to generations of investors around the country and abroad , " states the filing .
Prosecutors estimated that the amount of money that flowed through the principal account used by Madoff to perpetrate the Ponzi scheme was approximately $ 170 billion , but many of his victims are now penniless .
" We now have nothing , " said Kathleen Bignell , whose statement was included in the filing .
" Only living off social security .
I told my father ( 89 ) he could not die because I did n't have enough money to bury him . "
Madoff 's lawyer , Ike Sorkin , suggested this week that a sentence of 12 years " will sufficiently address the goals of deterrence , protecting the public , and promoting respect for the law . "
The length of the sentence could determine whether Madoff is sent to a harsh maximum security federal prison facility .
He has expressed fears of coping with the conditions in a maximum security facility and has met with private consultants who offer expert opinion on how to apply voluntary sentencing guidelines .
Madoff will be sentenced on Monday morning .
Proceeds to Asset Sales to Victims
Today 's forfeiture agreement , which also applies to the Madoffs ' boats and cars , allows all sales to go forward and the proceeds collected to ultimately be distributed to Madoff 's investor victims .
Ruth Madoff had wanted to hold onto the penthouse , where her husband had been placed under a luxurious house arrest , claiming in court documents that it was not connected to her husband 's fraud .
On a recent visit to the prison where her husband is being held , Ruth Madoff was asked by ABC News if she had anything to say to the victims of her husband 's scam or whether she played a role in it .
" I have no response to you , " Ruth Madoff said .

As you probably have heard by now , especially if you follow this blog and watched the Keith Olberman video posted yesterday , many people are placing the blame of Dr. George Tiller ’s death on Bill O’Reilly ‘s shoulders .
At least , blaming him for inciting violence against Dr. Tiller .
Here are a few choice things O’Reilly has said over the years about Dr. Tiller :
“ Tiller the baby killer ”
“ blood on his hands ”
“ I would n’t want to be these people if there is a Judgment Day ”
“ If I could get my hands on Tiller … ”
Over the past four or five years , it has been documented , Bill O’Reilly referenced Dr. Tiller 29 times !
Make that 29 separate episodes of The O’Reilly Factor .
At one point , he even sicked favorite ambush journalist , Jesse Watters , on Dr. Tiller , who was forced to call 911 .
Of course , Bill O’Reilly was quick to blame “ far - left zealots ” and “ Fox News haters . ”
While he claims that everything he said about Dr. Tiller was true , it does little to assuage the fact that it ’s the number of incidents and the language used that are the real issues .
It can also be said that , based on the quotes listed above , O’Reilly included hurtful subjective rhetoric that has no place on a “ news ” channel , or he is an absolute liar .

Iraqi police have arrested a senior member of the U.S. - allied Awakening movement in Salahuddin province , the American military said Sunday , continuing a crackdown that has left many of the Sunni Muslim paramilitary fighters seething with anger .
Mullah Nadim Jibouri , an Awakening leader in the town of Duluiya , 55 miles north of Baghdad , was detained Saturday along with two of his brothers , the military said .
Awakening leaders have been squeezed from all sides in recent months , with Iraqi authorities carrying out a series of arrests against them and Al Qaeda in Iraq continuing to target them with bombs .
Late last month , Jibouri escaped a suicide attack at a mosque in the town where he was also an imam .
The bomber , who detonated an explosives vest , killed five people and wounded 18 , including one of Jibouri ’s now - detained brothers .
In an interview with The Times the day after the explosion , Jibouri blamed the attack on the insurgents he had abandoned when he agreed to join the Awakening , called the Sons of Iraq by the U.S. military .

“ There are people who I used to be fighting with who are seeking to settle scores with me , ” he said .
“ I left them and now I am fighting them , so it ’s obvious that they will target me . ”
Interviewed Sunday at the police station where he is being held , Jibouri said he did not know why he had been detained , but said he did not believe it had anything to do with his activities as an Awakening leader .
“ It ’s a personal matter , ” he said .
Iraqi authorities have said Jibouri is a former senior Al Qaeda in Iraq leader who is being held in connection with “ terrorism ” committed before he joined the Awakening .
But movement leaders complain that , under the terms of the deal they reached when they agreed to team up with the Americans against the insurgency , they are supposed to be immune from prosecution for earlier actions .
“ We made an agreement with the Americans , before the formation of the Awakening , to give immunity to all the fighters who have participated in the resistance , ” said Sheik Khalid Filayah , the Awakening leader in Samarra .
“ Therefore they do n’t have the right to arrest anybody who may have been involved in operations against the Americans before the cease - fire . ”

The Iraqi government , however , has given no such promise of immunity .
The U.S. military has not always been informed by the Iraqis about the arrests of its allies .
In this instance , U.S. military advisors were present when Iraqi police officers served the arrest warrant , but they do not know why Jibouri was arrested , said Maj .
Derrick Cheng , a spokesman for U.S. forces in northern Iraq .
“ Coalition forces had a very minor role in this as the warrants originated from the Iraqis , ” he said .

We could n't make this stuff up even if we got our MFA in Creative Writing at USF , got toked up on acid and then tried .
But San Franciscans rejoice , your favorite mascot is back .
Yup , the Healthy Penis campaign is back in San Francisco and organizers claim it is better than ever .
Not since the Sexual Harassment Panda or Larry the Lobster has a mascot been so confusing .
Only in San Francisco ( believe us they tried to move the campaign to Los Angeles and our neighbors to the south were not too excited ) is a campaign that may be headed by the worst , at least the strangest , mascot in history .
An effort to educate people about syphilis is spearheaded ( sorry ) by an eight foot healthy penis and his friends .
The campaign began in 2002 after the San Francisco Department of Health conducted several focus groups to see how best to raise ( sorry ) awareness about syphilis in the city and how best to persuade gay men to get screened .
The city says the campaign was a huge ( sorry ) success because it led to a significant decrease in syphilis cases .
The Healthy Penis was later introduced in in Los Angeles , Portland , Philadelphia , Seattle , Santa Clara County and in Winnipeg , Canada but in a less provocative way we 're told .
The campaign has expanded ( sorry ) to include an African - American penis named Byron the Penis and a Hispanic penis named Pedro the Penis as well .
The original penis Clark is heading up the campaign and is still the most recognizable penis in the city .
Phil the Sore is also back in the campaign trying to cause all the havoc that syphilis causes .
Maybe the scariest part of it all is that the three penises have Facebook and My Space pages , while Phil has his own regularly updated Twitter page .
Needless to say the Healthy Penis drew national attention , including an appearance on the Daily Show in 2003 , which you can check out below .

“ People who have repeatedly been victims of violence in this region are yet again experiencing terror and upheaval , ” John Holmes , Under Secretary - General for Humanitarian Affairs , said .
Attacks and threats against civilians , in South Kivu province committed by the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda ( FDLR ) , comes in response to a planned new phase of Congolese army operations against the militia , he said .
An estimated 100,000 people in South Kivu have been displaced by fear of armed groups since the beginning of the year , according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) .
“ In the event of intensified fighting between Government forces and armed groups in the weeks ahead , all armed actors in South Kivu must have as a top priority protection of civilians and their livelihoods , ” he stressed , adding that they must also guarantee safe access for humanitarian workers .
The FDLR and other Rwandan militias have also been a key factor in the resurgence of violence in North Kivu province , where another 100,000 civilians have been uprooted by fighting in the past two months , in addition to the many hundreds of thousands previously displaced .
The ethnic Hutu rebels , who recently carried out a wave of retaliatory attacks against civilians after being targeted by a joint Congolese and Rwandan military offensive , have been operating in eastern DRC since the 1994 genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda .
In FDLR - dominated areas of South Kivu , in recent weeks , more than a dozen villages have been pillaged and hundreds of houses set on fire , while in others , FDLR groups are forcing the population to provide them with food , OCHA said .
Rape has also been on the increase in recent weeks – in areas under the control both of the FDLR and of the Congolese army ( FARDC ) .
“ Women and girls are at the mercy of groups with horrendous records of sexual violence , ” OCHA said in a news release .
“ Those committing violations of humanitarian law will have to answer for their crimes , ” Mr. Holmes said , urging the Congolese Government to stop and punish abuses committed by its soldiers , and ensure the protection of civilians during these operations .
Meanwhile , Alan Doss , Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon ’s Special Representative for DRC , has welcomed last week ’s conviction and sentencing of 20 Congolese army officers by a military tribunal .
The tribunal found that the 20 soldiers committed offences ranging from rape and armed robbery to crimes against humanity , according to the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC ( MONUC ) , which is led by Mr. Doss .
Human rights experts from the mission monitored the trials , which took place in the north - eastern town of Walikale , to ensure they met international standards , and provided logistical and financial support , MONUC said .
Scientists are , for the first time , objectively evaluating ways to help species adapt to rapid climate change and other environmental threats via strategies that were considered too radical for serious consideration as recently as five or 10 years ago .
Among these radical strategies currently being considered is so - called " managed relocation . "
Managed relocation , which is also known as " assisted migration , " involves manually moving species into more accommodating habitats where they are not currently found .
A new , ground - breaking tool to help decision - makers determine if , when and how to use managed relocation is described in the May 25 , 2009 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) by a multi- disciplinary working group .
Partially funded by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , the working group is co-led by Jessica Hellmann and Jason McLachlan of the University of Notre Dame , Dov Sax of Brown University , and Mark Schwartz of the University of California at Davis .
David Richardson of Stellenbosch University in South Africa led the writing of the paper .
The researchers ' tool is ground - breaking because managed relocation has been categorically eschewed by some scientists for fear that relocated species would overpopulate their new habitats , cause extinctions of local species , or clog water pipes as invasive zebra muscles have done in the Great Lakes .
Nevertheless , some conservationists and groups have already used managed relocation or are currently considering doing so .
Do Something or Do Nothing ?
So why is managed relocation , a once - taboo and potentially harmful strategy , now being seriously considered ?
" Because , " says Hellmann , " it is becomingly overwhelmingly evident that climate change is a reality ; and it is fast and large .
Consequences will arise within decades , not centuries . "
So action seems much more important now than it did even five or 10 years ago when atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases were lower .
Now , we are committed to greater degrees of climate change . "
What 's more , a " do nothing " response to climate change involves significant risks .
Hellman says , " We have previously been able to say , ' let nature run its course . '
But because humans have already changed the world , there is no letting nature run its course anymore .
Now , action , like inaction , has potential negative consequences . "
So , adds Richardson , " we must develop new tools and new ways to balance the risks of inaction vs. action . "
Managed relocation is not the only controversial adaptation strategy currently being considered by scientists .
Other such strategies include fertilizing the oceans to increase their absorption of greenhouse gases and thereby reduce climate change , conserving huge migratory corridors that may extend thousands of kilometers , and preserving the genetic diversity of threatened species in seed banks .
Speed Kills
Many species have survived previous , slower periods of climate change by evolving or by moving to more hospitable habitats via their own power .
But such survival strategies are now often precluded by : 1 ) the presence of cities and by other unnatural obstacles that prevent organisms from reaching new destinations ; and 2 ) the speed of climate change , which may raise the Earth 's average temperature by as much as 6 degrees Celsius in the next 100 years -- a large , rapid change by nature 's standards .
As temperatures increase , significant percentages of the Earth 's species may become trapped -- like fish out of water -- in habitats that have become too hot , too dry , or too something else for them .
They may therefore go extinct or lose genetically important segments of their populations .
Such losses may disrupt large ecosystems and damage agricultural , cultural and economic systems .
Risky Business
The working group 's consideration of managed relocation has not ended the controversies surrounding this strategy 's use , which sometimes still even pit members of the working group against one another .
Why is managed relocation so controversial ?
Because it begs the question :
Do we really know enough to predict how organisms will behave in new locations and whether they will harm receiving habitats ?
" The results of intentional and accidental introductions of species into new habitats have taught us a great deal about the implications of moving organisms to new habitats , " says Richardson .
Nevertheless , predictions of whether introduced species will ' take ' in new areas and their likely impacts will always involve uncertainty .
But we can make informed predictions with stated bounds of uncertainty . "
To this end , the researchers ' tool is designed to help expose managed relocation 's risks , trade - offs and costs -- considerations that are often absent from decision - making on natural resources .
Specifically , it provides stakeholders with a system for individually scoring a proposed relocation based on multi-disciplinary criteria .
These multi-disciplinary criteria include the probability of the success of a proposed relocation , its potential for harming receiving ecosystems , its costs , its potential for triggering violations of the Endangered Species Act , and the social and cultural importance of impacted species .
Comparisons of stakeholders ' scores should help stakeholders identify the sources of their disagreements so that they may be resolved .
However , the tool does not , by itself produce management recommendations .
" The tool takes advantage of the fact that , although science can't tell us exactly what will happen in the future , it can tell us how likely a favorable result is -- useful information for decision - makers , " says NSF Program Director Nancy Huntly .
Not Just Applicable to Endangered Species
In addition to addressing managed relocations of endangered species , the researchers ' tool may also address :
Managed relocations of species that are not endangered .
For example , the working group 's PNAS paper applies the tool to the debate over whether certain species of North American hardwood trees should be planted beyond their northern range boundaries into coniferous forests .
This application suggests that such relocations may be supported by commercial foresters who value their high potential for producing economic returns as well as their high feasibility and low risk of harming recipient ecosystems .
By contrast , conservationists who value the natural heritage of recipient ecosystems may perceive fewer benefits and greater risks .
Controversial climate - related adaptation strategies besides managed relocation that are currently being considered by scientists .

For nearly seventy years Bentley was owned by Rolls - Royce and offered essentially the same models with different badges and radiator surrounds .
Since 2003 the two marques have been rivals , coming from different factories ( Bentley 's in Crewe and Rolls - Royce 's in Goodwood ) , with two different German owners pulling the strings .
BMW owned Rolls - Royce is looking to increase the range of models offered with a smaller , less formal car .
Codenamed RR4 it is Rolls ’ first direct rival for Bentley ’s Continental series .
Meanwhile Bentley , part of the Volkswagen empire , is replacing the Arnage – a model that dates back to before the companies split .
The new “ grand Bentley ” is , for now , just a teaser photo .
From what the picture shows the front end will be similar to the Arnage , with a sculpted bonnet and raised edges to the front wings .
Bentley also wants the new car to retain the proportions of the outgoing model .
Under the skin things are likely to be quite different with an aluminium spaceframe , similar to that of the Audi A8 .
Also under speculation is the choice of powerplant although the VW stable is not short of suitable engines , including V10 and V12 engines from Audi while the 987 bhp sixteen - cylinder engine from the Bugatti Veyron has also been suggested .
Do n’t rule out the possibility of the 6.75 - litre V8 , which dates back to 1959 , being carried over .
The grand Bentley is due to be unveiled this summer .

More is known about the “ small ” Rolls - Royce .
We ’ve seen the 200EX concept which gives a clear indication of what the new car will look like .
It will be called “ Ghost ” , after the 1906 Rolls - Royce 40 / 50HP model - the first vehicle dubbed the best car in the world .
Mechanical highlights include a 6.0 - litre , turbocharged V12 engine , 8 - speed automatic gearbox and computer - controlled air - suspension .
Rolls - Royce has stated that production will start in September on a second production line at the Goodwood factory .
Even though the cars are n’t aimed at quite the same market - the Ghost will compete with Bentley 's cheaper VW - based Continental models , the Grand Bentley with Rolls - Royces ' big Phantom - comparisons between them seem likely to be inevitable .

This video of so called “ plasma radio ” is popular lately on Russian blogs .
The shown effect is very cool .
Here is a short story to understand it :
Location : Brovary town , Russia .
Transmitter output : 150 kW
Also used : old Soviet antennas , 90 meteres ( 280 ft ) long cable .
That ’s all what you need for UNSAFE experiments to receive radio waves .
In the area of the effect of radio waves very big potential difference emerges .
Because of the modulation of the radio signal the electical spark arc starts vibrating with the human voice and begins to “ speak ” .
The intensity of current in such “ radio ” can reach hundreds of ampers and it easily can molt metals .
Such electricity does n’t have any barriers , it can come through the thick tree .
Do n’t try this at home !

MADRID ( Reuters ) - Spain became the first country in Europe to confirm a case of swine flu on Monday when a man who returned from a trip to Mexico last week was found to have the virus .
The unnamed man returned to Spain on April 22 and was put under observation on April 25 with chest problems , Health Minister Trinidad Jimenez told a news conference .
About 20 other patients are under observation , officials said .
“ They are all stable , none of the cases is grave , not even that of the case confirmed ( as swine flu ) , ” Jimenez said .
“ These are people who have recently been on trips to Mexico , ” she said , adding that Spain had sufficient doses stored of anti-viral medicine .
There is a jagged fissure of insanity which runs through the heart of
the EVE playerbase , a kind of feverish bad crazy that you simply do n't
find in other online games .
Oh , sure , everyone knows a tale or two
about the Starcraft player who stayed awake for 50 hours and href = " http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4137782.stm "
target = " _blank " > died from exhaustion because he
would n't stop gaming , or the legions of relatively mundane overweight
basement - dwelling nerds that populate the other MMOs that have a lack
of perspective that comes from playing in virtual worlds too much .
Some
people like to point to South Korea 's Starcraft tournaments as a sign
of abnormality , but sporting leagues are a ' healthy ' expression of
hobby activity by most standards .
No , if you want utter madness , you
have to look to EVE .

Humans , for all our pretensions , are monkeys , and monkeys are funny
creatures .
One or two of them might seem normal enough , but in
isolation or small groups social animals are n't really their true
selves .
With their overdeveloped adrenal glands , numerous href = " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases "
target = " _blank " > cognitive biases and a supreme
faith in the rightness of that same flawed cognition , when you get them
in groupings over a certain number hilarious things occur .
What
differentiates EVE from the other MMOs - and what creates the level of
frothing madness - is the number of monkeys it manages to pack into one
barrel .
In World of Warcraft , while there may be an obscene 11.5
million people running about as elves and orcs hitting monsters with
swords and spells , those people are broken up into small groups of ten
to twenty thousand per server .
If you do n't like your server , you can
leave to another server , start anew , find a different social milieu .
The game is also infamously newbie friendly , which is partly why it has
gained such mainstream success ; almost anyone can pick it up and play .
The basic group unit in WoW is a guild between 20 and 100 people ; the
odd megaguild nonwithstanding , it 's a grouping intimate enough that
every monkey can get to know every other monkey , and the primary social
activity involves groups of between five and 25 .
Even at this level ,
though , there 's a blurring of perspective in the minds of people ; sick
days are called in from work to raid , personal hygiene is neglected ,
obsession with purple loot and intensely personal dramas around said
loot occur .
By contrast , EVE takes a much smaller player base - perhaps 450,000 -
but jams all these monkeys into one barrel , a barrel from which there
is no escape - no ' other server ' to flee to and begin anew .
The
learning curve in EVE might as well be vertical , despite all the
efforts to make the game more newbie - friendly over the years ; any sort
of mistake usually results in you dying horribly and losing substantial
assets , which are very limited when first playing the game .
Additionally , more than any other MMO , EVE relies heavily on
mathematics and spreadsheets in the player - run logistics and production
aspects of the game .
Given the violence , loss , and ( horror of horrors )
math , it is only a certain sort of of monkey who not only ascends the
nightmarish and Darwinian learning curve , but finds the process
entertaining enough to stick around and play for more than a week .
So
this is EVE , a galaxy filled with socially inept spreadsheet nerds on
the one hand and obsessive , ambitious griefers on the other .
Resources
are limited and must be fought over , and the only way out is to quit
entirely .
Unique in EVE , the number of people on one server puts the players far
beyond the threshold of intimate friendship ; your average social unit ,
the corporation , involves hundreds of people , while alliances made up
of these corporations include thousands of people .
Thus , instead of
micro - level ' guild drama ' over who gets what epic item , EVE suffers
from ' alliance politics ' which in many ways have come to mirror real
world politics ; the threshold of ' enough monkeys in one place ' is
crossed , and you find yourself contending with alliances based on
ethnic and nationalistic identities , many of which carry their cultural
quirks and baggage into the realm of internet spaceships .
EVE has
French alliances , Russian alliances , Polish alliances , German
alliances , you name it .
If the idea of social units comprising of
thousands of people allied by
nationality or shared culture does n't add enough monkey madness for
you , consider that the game has both legal and illegal channels for
real world income to bleed into the game .
You can spend your
hard - earned money on an in - game item called a ' PLEX ' which can be used
to add two months of in - game subscription time to a character , and then
sell these PLEXes on the in - game market for in - game currency ( isk ) .
If
you 're rich in - game and poor in reality , you can play EVE for free by
simply purchasing PLEXes ; if you 're rich in reality and do n't have time
to make spaceship money , you can sell some PLEXes and buy as many
spaceships as you feel like .
Of course , many players go outside of the
established CCP - sanctioned system and buy and sell both currency and
characters on the black market of eBay ; a substantial sum of hard
currency can be earned by a diligent eBayer , and it is an accepted
belief among many EVE players that some people are making a day - to - day
living off selling isk .
One galaxy , limited resources , 450,000 players who are all a little odd
to begin with , nationalistic alliances , and a porous system of currency
trading .
Welcome to the asylum , let 's take a tour !

Our first patient is href = " http://images.tentonhammer.com/eve/lordex1.jpg "
target = " _blank " > SirLordex , an aluminium magnate of
Russian extraction .
His existence was only a rumor among the
English - speaking population of EVE for many months ; he was alleged to
have bankrolled his own alliance , RED.OVERLORD , in a quest to seize the
region of Feythabolis from its previous owner Goonswarm ; it was hinted
that he was spending thousands of dollars to purchase isk in bulk from
eBay , and that with this money he had purchased five Titans , a number
of motherships , and innumerable control towers .
The money was
eventually traced by CCP those Titans and characters vanished in a mass
banning , but evidence of the true extent of SirLordex 's habit of
spending money on EVE only recently came to light - apparently he's
started pumping money into the PLEX system and has singlehandedly
crashed the market , driving the in - game price down steeply .
You too can
watch the madness href = " http://eve-search.com/search/author/lTOPl " target = " _blank " > here ,
keeping in mind that one PLEX is worth $ 34.99 .
How many games do you know of
where someone spends over $ 100,000 on spaceships and brags about it ?
In
SerLordex 's own words :
" Listen , calm down .
Everyone here understands that
ROL did n't sell a
single isk on Ebay .
Originally , I put in about 50 K cash ( buying isk ,
chars and 5 titans + a ton of motherships ) from your ratting me out to
the GM's ( RA 's directors = rats , admit it ) .
All of this got banned
under the pretext of an exploit that we never used ( GM 's could n't prove
that I bought isk for RL cash , but I could n't prove that the isk was
legal , either ) .
After that , I bought a ton of timecards from legitimate
dealers and , at the moment , have sold more than 1 trillion isk's worth
( GM 's have confirmed that they know about this and decided that I 'm not
breaking any rules ) , bought another five titans , two [ more ?
this is
unclear ] are still building , and I 'm also financing new corps that are
coming in .
I 'll have no problems with [ continuing to fund ] any of this .
So let 's not have any dirt thrown around , because if anyone is selling
isk here , it 's you , and since I know all the gray market dealers I'm
going to sell you to CCP at the first opportunity - the next ban is on
you . "
Perhaps he should consider a career in href = " http://images.tentonhammer.com/eve/lordex2.gif "
target = " _blank " > rap .
The bad crazy goes beyond dropping 100
large on internet spaceships ,
though .
About two years ago , Goonswarm was aiding our allies , Red
Alliance ( RA , the aforementioned ' rats ' with whom SirLordex is cross )
in the invasion of the Scalding Pass region against Lotka Volterra and
their coalition .
Lotka Volterra had unveiled one of the first Titans
against us to href = " http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=527
"
target = " _blank " > catastrophic consequences , and at
the time these profoundly silly ships were nearly impossible to kill
through legitimate in - game means ; they were essentially invulnerable ,
with the only Titans destroyed through catching the ship while the
pilot was disconnected from the game .
It was determined that ' The
Enslaver ' and his Avatar - class Titan had to go .
I was approached by one
of the leaders of Red Alliance to help make this happen , but almost
immediately we were down the rabbit hole .
Much to my surprise , the RA
director did n't want in - game information from me ; he wanted us to use
the forensic resources of our intelligence agency to trace down
The
Enslaver 's home address .
At a coordinated time , armed with this
information , a RA member would apparently cut the power to The
Enslaver 's house in the real world , and in EVE a RA capital fleet would
assault the abruptly pilotless Titan .
Yikes .
style= " margin : 10 px ; border - collapse : collapse ; float : left ; width : 200 px ; " border = " 1 " >
href = " http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/27209 " > src= " /image/view/27209/preview "
style= " border : 2 px solid ; width : 200 px ; " />
As one can imagine , I demurred , but the RA director did n't want to take
' no ' for an answer and I did n't fancy telling him that I thought he was
completely insane .
I said that I 'd ' look into it ' , and that 's when
things began to get really crazy - Kugutsumen got involved .
Kugutsumen
is a French national living in Jakarta , Indonesia who was convicted as
a teenager in the early 1990s of phreaking the FBI 's conference call
system and running up $ 250,000 in international calls .
He now runs an
extremely successful computer security business , when he's not setting
up nightclubs in Jakarta or messing about in the EVE universe .
He
copped a ban from CCP years ago for breaking the href = " http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&bid=424 "
target = " _blank " > T20 scandal after penetrating the
Band of Brothers director forums , but it seems the banning completely
removed all restraint on his behavior regarding the game ; he set up his
own forum to cover the hidden news of EVE by publishing snippets from
the forums of other alliances .
One might suggest that he is also a
little off when it comes to the sanity scale , though I personally adore
him .
Why did n't I have to deal with RA trying to cut the power to The
Enslaver 's house to kill his Titan ?
Because Kugutsumen , out of either
idle curiosity or malice aforethought , traced The Enslaver 's ip
addresses back to Iceland , confronted him on Lotka Volterra 's teamspeak
while under an assumed name , recorded the conversation , and href = " https://www.kugutsumen.com/showthread.php?t=363 "
target = " _blank " > then outed him as a GM and CCP employee .
This resulted in the immediate removal of the Enslaver character , as
GMs cannot have their identity known - since this era of gameplay , CCP
has radically revised and tightened the restrictions of where and how
their employees can play , but this was the Bad Old Days .
While the
Titan was eventually given to another pilot - and that pilot was much
more cautious with it than The Enslaver - by that point Lotka Volterra
had already lost the war .
More recently , ' space madness ' came to grip a huge section of EVE
itself , particularly those involved in the invasion and conquest of
Delve .
Because of the href= " http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/65110 " target = " _blank " > time - limited
nature of that war , a tremendous effort had to be put forth
within 28 days , not merely due to the actual conquest of Delve but also
the logistical nightmare that comes from moving an established alliance
of 6000 people from one end of the galaxy to the other .
Sleep was
sacrificed , work was skipped , and as each day passed a greater edge of
delirium inserted itself into the normal operations of the alliance .
One of our logisticians woke his wife up in the middle of the night
shouting that " We 've got to pack up everything and move the babies to
Delve ! "
Another Goonswarm director told his wife that she should only
use half the detergent in the dishwasher , because the " salad bowls are
in reinforced mode . "
And yours truly ( so I am told ) once sat
bolt - upright in bed and warned his spouse : " Do n't touch that !
Do n't
open the refrigerator !
The spy is in the refrigerator ! " before abruptly
passing back out .
CCP often touts this sort of thing with the bland marketing lingo of
' player generated content . '
What that actually means is that you get to
share a galaxy with Russian aluminum magnates , French - Indonesian
nightclub - owning hackers , self - aggranziding ' spymasters , ' and people
who will cut the power lines to your house to destroy your internet
spaceship .
There 's something deliciously addictive about the sweeping ,
endemic insanity , one of the ever - present yet rarely remarked upon
facets of this most unhinged of MMOs .
Yes , you read the headline correctly .
Focus on the Family , the rabid anti-gay Christianist organization that likes to equate homosexuality with things like necrophilia , released the following press release praising President Obama for his engagement with them on the subject of foster care :
The White House Office of Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships hosted adoption leaders from across the country Wednesday to talk about how to better serve the needs of kids in foster care .
Kelly Rosati , adoptive mother of four and senior director of Focus on the Family ’s Sanctity of Human Life department , was among those in attendance .
“ The Obama administration is really listening , ” she said , “ and wanted to know from those on the front lines what could be better done to serve the kids in America ’s foster care system . ”
Unfortunately , the president supports placing some of those kids with homosexual couples .
Rosati said the White House expressed its appreciation for Focus ’ commitment to the issue .
“ One of the things that emerged from the meeting , ” she said , “ was that adoption recruiting events , such as Focus ’ Wait No More , are essential to our ability to find families for those waiting kids . ”
Focus on the Family anticipates ongoing dialogue with the White House on adoption .
The financial crisis that has so significantly undermined economic and investment confidence in many corners of the markets had some very important regulatory underpinnings .
In reflecting on the crisis and its causes , we have to question whether those institutions we 've created to help " stabilize " banking markets and to " protect investors " have actually done what they advertise both heading into the crisis , as well as in dealing with it .
I recently sat down with Ed Kane , Martin Mayer , and Walker Todd -- three people who have great depth and experience in understanding the plumbing , history , and effects of the regulatory infrastructure of our financial markets .
Kane is professor of finance at Boston College , past president of the American Finance Association , and cofounder of the Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee .
Martin Mayer is a prolific financial journalist , a scholar at the Brookings Institution , and the author of more than 30 books on financial market issues .
Todd worked in the Federal Reserve System as an attorney and economist and is now affiliated with the American Institute for Economic Research .
The following conversation has been edited for clarity and length .
Ruth Madoff , the wife of one of the most reviled swindlers in history , has agreed to give up her potential claim to more than $ 80 million worth of assets , keeping just $ 2.5 million in cash in an agreement reached with federal prosecutors .
The settlement with the U.S. attorney 's office in Manhattan was approved late Friday by U.S. District Court Judge Denny Chin , who is scheduled to sentence her husband , Bernard Madoff , on Monday in a final courtroom stand that will seal his legacy as one of the world 's most successful thieves .

Three British Columbia men are calling for an investigation , alleging that they were beaten by RCMP officers and bitten by a police dog during a raid on an apartment in Surrey last year .
Emad Hovaizavi , Mohammed Bosir and Seyedmorteza Ghadiriasli said in a complaint filed against the RCMP that they were " having a conversation over a cup of tea " in Mr. Hovaizavi 's apartment in November 2008 when members of a police Emergency Response Team broke down the door .
After the men were allegedly ordered to get down on the floor , the complaint says a police dog allegedly entered the apartment and dragged Mr. Hovaizavi into the hall where he was beaten by heavily armed police officers who kicked him in the ribs and back .
The other two were also dragged out and beaten , according to the complaint which says the police did not have a warrant to enter the apartment .
The complainants say they have learned that police had warrants to enter apartment units 201 and 206 of the same building .
But the three men were located in unit 205 .
The victims do not have criminal records or any previous dealings with the RCMP , the complaint said .
No one has been charged in connection with the incident .
Craig Costantino , a lawyer retained by the three men , said RCMP Superintendent Wayne Rideout has confirmed that police did not have a warrant to enter unit 205 .
Supt .
Rideout said in a letter to Costantino that an Independent Officer Review has been ordered , and is currently still under investigation .
In a press release sent out Monday afternoon Surrey RCMP say they have apologized to " three individuals who were mistakenly arrested and injured " during the raid .
Cpl .
Peter Thiessen said officers knew they had entered the wrong apartment as soon as the men were taken into custody , and the ERT team leader immediately apologized .
In addition , the force provided a care home nurse and transportation to medical appointments after the injuries .
They also repaired the apartment .
Not for the first time , but more now than ever , I commend to you V For Vendetta , the 2005 film in which a superhero in a Guy Fawkes mask sets about doing to Parliament what his role model tantalisingly failed to achieve under James I .
Slaughtered by most critics , the movie is hardly flawless in its totalitarian state allegorising , lacking the nuance of the Orwell novel that informs it , and its plot full of holes the size of Oliver Letwin 's soggy tennis court .
For all that , I love it to bits , and suspect you might too , because in its crude and overblown way it caught a nebulous suspicion and gave it flesh .
" The truth , " V tells the watching public after hijacking the government - controlled state broadcaster , " is that there is something terribly wrong with this country , is n't there ?...
How did this happen ?
Who 's to blame ?
Well , certainly there are those more responsible than others , and they will be held accountable .
But , again , truth be told , if you 're looking for the guilty , you need only look into a mirror . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Those ultimately responsible for the democratic crisis of which expenses is the tiniest tip of the iceberg , in other words , are us .
By that I mean not just us in the media , who until the Telegraph 's glorious scoop largely abrogated our inquisitive duties .
I mean you and me as private citizens .
We have permitted the nonsense newly exposed in such detail , but known about and ignored for years , through sullen apathy .
And we have allowed much else , and worse , besides .
One of the best things in the film is Stephen Fry , who gives a sparkling cameo as Gordon Dietrich , a TV satirist inspired to an act of suicidal defiance by V's broadcast .
" He 's right , is n't he ? " says Dietrich after watching it .
" There is something very wrong with this country . "
Somehow , the memory makes Fry 's intervention on exes this week painful to contemplate .
In dismissing the furore as the carping envy of petit - bourgeois hypocrites , this clever , charming chap misses completely not only the genuine fury , but also the matter of how that fury must be channelled if a political system atrophied into incompetence , low - level corruption and the highest of farce is to be salvaged and rebuilt .
Only in moments of chaotic flux , when the foetid accommodations and stifling conventions of the age are suspended because the status quo looks scarier than radical change , does a glimpse of a less imperfect country feel like more than utopian dreaming .
Such openings come seldom , vanish swiftly , and must be seized immediately .
This one may well not be .
More than likely we will , until the June elections divert the spotlight , fixate on all the expenses debacle without questioning the underlying culture that generated it , and how that might be ended .
If so – if this golden opportunity is wasted – it will be a historic tragedy for this country .
For the fiddling , as shameful as it's been , is not the disease but one of its more trivial symptoms .
It is to a democratic sickness that remains largely undiagnosed what a bout of violent diarrhoea can be to colonic cancer .
Mask it with over - the - counter medication though you may , more serious symptoms will soon enough emerge .
The longer you ignore those , the more brutal the treatment required , and the lower the chances of recovery .
The illness in question is malignant in the extreme , and the only effective treatment is a written constitution .
Since David Cameron will shortly be Prime Minister , it is to him we must turn on bended knee , begging that he acts while the rage is still hot and the desire for change intense , and makes a binding commitment to that constitution .
He should pledge that , within an hour of kissing the Queen 's hand , he will inaugurate a year - long national debate about how we want that constitution to look , involving the town - hall meetings and an appeal for public proposals with which we can reacquaint ourselves with the notion that our stake in how we are governed extends beyond voting with distaste every four or five years .
A committee of respected parliamentarians ( there are a few ) and distinguished outsiders – scientists , jurists , academics , trade unionists , soldiers , artists , and so on ; even national treasures such as Mr Fry – should be co-opted to filter out the most promising ideas , and hand them to the Commons for a series of free votes .
Those approved should then be given to a group of our finest writers , to be translated into a document as simple , elegant and enduring as the US Constitution revered almost as a deity to this day .
Several of the most compelling requirements race to mind .
Electoral reform is one .
The madness that the votes of little more a third of the actual electorate , and a fifth of the potential electorate , produce almost unlimited political power while disenfranchising the majority must end .
Fixed - term parliaments are a no-brainer .
So is a clause guaranteeing freedom of speech .
The soul - sapping spectacle of MPs trooping pliantly through the lobbies to vote for things in which they do n't believe or actively disbelieve , or even of which they are blissfully ignorant , must stop .
They continually assure us how incredibly hard they work , but being lobby fodder is n't work at all .
It 's a cushy version of house arrest .
The constitutional function of a backbench MP is not to rubber - stamp the leadership 's will , but to act as a check against the power of the executive .
A written constitution could enshrine their duty to vote according to conscience and constituents ' interests , not the blackmail and bribery of the whips .
It should elevate the stature of select committees , those snivelling apologies for overseers of government practice and malpractice .
If we drastically increased allowances for research staff , and offered additional salary , their members ' status would be enhanced to approximately that of a minister of state .
They might then resist the threats and lure of ministerial preferment , and do the fearlessly unpartisan job expected .
There are countless other symptoms that sorely want treating ... the lack of an elected upper chamber ; the absence of quasi- judicial scrutiny of such outrages as the decision to go to war in Iraq and the security failures that prefaced the 7/7 bombings ; the refusal to devolve to local government outside London ; the criminally reckless failure to control and de-politicise the police ; and many more besides .
The overall imperative , however , is to treat the sickness itself by reconnecting the populace with its legislature , by restoring the supremacy of the Commons – our only direct link the central governance of Britain – by packing it with the kind of high - minded , talented and independent representatives whom we'd be delighted to pay £ 100,000 per annum and more .
These expenses - snafflers are not wicked people , but small people .
I say this with no sense of superiority .
I 'm a small person myself .
Most of us are .
But these are big times beset by big issues , and we are sick to our eye teeth of leaving them to the dwarves .
We need that written constitution desperately .
It is in David Cameron 's gift , and his alone , meaningfully to promise one .
He should do so at once .
This window will close by the day , and may not reopen in our lifetimes .

Wow .
My previous post seems to have attracted some attention .
When I woke up on Monday morning , made my coffee and logged into to my email , I found out that my geeky little analysis of Office 2007 SP2’s ODF support had sparked some interest .
I did not intend it to be more than an update for the handful of the “ usual suspects ” who regularly follow ODF issues via various blogs , many of which you see listed to your right .
If I had any foreknowledge or expectation that this post would end up being on SlashDot , GrokLaw , ZDnet , IDG , Reuters , CNet , etc. , I would have done a better job spell checking , and maybe toned down the rhetoric a little ( just a little ) .
But this widespread interest in the topic tells me one thing : ODF is important .
People care about it .
People want it to succeed , and when this success is threatened , whether for deliberate or accidental reasons , they are upset .
Although Office 2007 SP2 also added PDF and XPS support , you do n’t see many stories on that at all .
I ’ve been trying to respond to the many comments by anonymous FUDsters and Fanboys on various web sites where my post is being discussed .
However , it is getting rather laborious swatting all the gnats .
They obviously breed in stagnant waters , and there is an awful lot of that on the web .
Since all links lead back here anyways , it will be much simpler to do a recap here and address some of the more widespread errors .
The talking points from Redmond seem to be consistent , along the lines of :
We did a 100 % perfect and conforming implementation of ODF 1.1 to the letter of the standard .
If it is not interoperable , then it is the fault of the standard or the other applications or some guy we saw sneaking around back on the night of the fire .
In any case , it is not our fault .
We just design , write , test and sell software to users , businesses , governments and educational institutions .
We have no influence over whether our products are interoperable or not .
What effect SP2 has on users or the market — that ’s not our concern .
Come back in 50 years when you have a 100 % perfect standard and maybe we ’ll talk .
In other words , all of those Interoperability Directors and Interoperability Architects at Microsoft seem to have ( hopefully temporarily ) switched into Minimal Conformance Directors and Minimal Conformance Architects , and are gazing at their navels .
I hope they did not suffer a reduction in salary commensurate with the reduction in their claimed responsibilities .
In any case , their argument might be challenged on several grounds .
First up is the question of whether the ODF documents written by Excel 2007 SP2 indeed conform to the ODF 1.1 standard .
This is not a hard question to answer , but please excuse this short technical diversion .
Let ’s see what the ODF 1.1 standard says in section 8.1.3 ( Table Cell ) :
Addresses of cells that contain numbers .
The addresses can be relative or absolute , see section 8.3.1 .
Addresses in formulas start with a “ [ “ and end with a “ ] ” .
See sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.1 for information about how to address a cell or cell range .
And the referenced section 8.3.1 further says :
To reference table cells so called cell addresses are used .
The structure of a cell address is as follows :
The name of the table .
A dot (.)
An alphabetic value representing the column .
The letter A represents column 1 , B represents column 2 , and so on .
AA represents column 27 , AB represents column 28 , and so on .
A numeric value representing the row .
The number 1 represents the first row , the number 2 represents the second row , and so on .
This means that A1 represents the cell in column 1 and row 1 . B1 represents the cell in column 2 and row 1 . A2 represents the cell in column 1 and row 2 .
For example , in a table with the name SampleTable the cell in column 34 and row 16 is referenced by the cell address SampleTable .
AH16 .
In some cases it is not necessary to provide the name of the table .
However , the dot must be present .
When the table name is not required , the address in the previous example is .
AH16
So , going back to my test spreadsheets from all of the various ODF applications , how do these applications encode formulas with cell addresses :
Symphony 1.3 : =[.E12 ] +[. C13 ] -[. D13 ]
Microsoft / CleverAge 3.0 : =[.E12 ] +[. C13 ] -[. D13 ]
KSpread 1.6.3 : =[.E12 ] +[. C13 ] -[. D13 ]
Google Spreadsheets : =[.E12 ] +[. C13 ] -[. D13 ]
OpenOffice 3.01 : =[.E12 ] +[. C13 ] -[. D13 ]
Sun Plugin 3.0 : [.E12 ] +[. C13 ] -[. D13 ]
Excel 2007 SP2 : =E12+C13-D13
I ’ll leave it as an exercise to the reader to determine which one of these seven is wrong and does not conform to the ODF 1.1 standard .
Next is the question of the relationship between interoperability and conformance .
So we are not building skyscrapers in the air , let ’s start with a working definition of interoperability , say that given by ISO / IEC 2382 - 01 , “ Information Technology Vocabulary , Fundamental Terms ” :
The capability to communicate , execute programs , or transfer data among various functional units in a manner that requires the user to have little or no knowledge of the unique characteristics of those units
I think we probably have a better sense of what conformance is .
Something conforms when it meets the requirements defined by a standard .
So let ’s explore explore the relationship between conformance to a standard and interoperability .
First , does interoperability require a standard ?
No .
There have been interoperable systems without formal standards .
For example , there is a degree of interoperability among spreadsheet vendors on the basis of the legacy Excel binary file format ( XLS ) , even though the binary format was never standardized and never defines spreadsheet formulas .
Another example is the SAX XML parsing API .
Widely implemented , but never standardized .
We may call them informal or de facto standards .
Additionally , many standards start out as informal technical agreements and specifications that achieve interoperability among a small group of users , who then move it forward to standardization so that a broader audience can benefit .
But the interoperability came first and the formal standard came second .
See the history of the Atom syndication format for a good example .
Second ,
Is interoperability possible in the presence of non-conformance ?
Yes .
For example , it is well known that the vast majority of web pages ( 93 % by one estimate ) on the web today do not conform to the HTML standard .
But there is a not unsubstantial degree of interoperability on the web today in spite of this lack of conformance .
Generally , interoperability does not require perfection .
It requires good faith and hard work .
If perfection were required , nothing would work in this world , would it ?
Third , if a standard does not define something ( like spreadsheet formulas ) then I am allowed to do whatever I want , right ?
This is true .
But further , even if ODF 1.1 did define spreadsheet formulas you would still be allowed to do whatever you want .
Remember , these are voluntary standards .
We ca n’t force you to do anything , whether we define it or not .
So what then is the precise relationship between conformance and interoperability ?
I ’d state it as :
In general , conformance is neither necessary nor sufficient for to achieve interoperability .
But interoperability is most efficiently achieved by conformance to an open standard where the standard clearly states those requirements which must be met to achieve interoperability .
In other words , the relationship is due to the efficiency of this configuration to those who wish to interoperate .
Conformance is neither necessary nor sufficient to achieve interoperability in general , but interoperability is most efficiently achieved when conformance guarantees interoperability .
When I talk about “ standards - based interoperability ” I ’m talking about the situation when you are in the neighborhood of that optimal point .
The inefficiency of other orientations is seen with HTML and Web browsers .
Because of the historically low level of HTML conformance by authoring tools and users who hand - edit HTML , browsers today are much more complex then they would otherwise need to be .
They need to handle all sorts of mal - formed HTML documents .
This complexity extends to any tool that needs to process HTML .
Sure , we have a pretty good grip on this now , with tools like HTML Tidy and other robust parsers , but this has come at a cost .
Complexity eats up resources , both to coders and testers , but also runtime resources , memory and processing cycles .
More complex code is harder to maintain and secure and tends to have more bugs .
Greater conformance would have lead to a more efficient relationship between conformance and interoperability .
Similarly , the many years of non-conformance in browsers , most notably Internet Explorer , to the CSS2 standard has resulted in an inefficiency there .
From the perspective of web designers , tool authors and competing browser vendors , the lack of conformance to the standards has increased the cost needed to achieve interoperability , a cost transferred from a dominate vendor who chose not to conform to the standards , to other vendors who did conform .
The efficiency of conformance to open standards in particular is the clarity and freedom it provides around access to the standard and the contingent IP rights needed to implement the standard .
So back to ODF 1.1 .
What is the relationship between conformance and interoperability there ?
Clearly , it is not yet at that optimal point ( which few standards ever achieve ) where interoperability is most - efficiently achieved .
We ’re working on it .
ODF 1.2 will be better in that regard than ODF 1.1 , and the next version will improve on that , and so on .
Does this mean that you cannot create interoperable solutions with ODF ?
No , it just means that , like most standards in IT today , you need to do some interoperability testing with other vendor ’s products to make sure your product interoperates , and make conformant adjustments to your product in order to achieve real - world nteroperability .
Most vendors who do n’t have a monopoly would do this naturally and in fact have done this , as my chart indicated .
Complaining about this is like complaining about gravity or friction or entropy .
Sure , it sucks .
Deal with it .
Although it may not pay as much as being a professional mourner , work as a programmer is more regular .
And giving value to customers will always bring more satisfaction than than standing there weeping about how code is hard .
In any case , this comes down to why do you implement a standard .
What are your goals ?
If your goal is be interoperable , then you perform interoperability testing and make those adjustments to your product necessary to make it be both conformant and interoperable .
But if your goal is to simply fulfill a checkbox requirement without actually providing any tangible customer benefit , then you will do as little as needed .
However , if your goal is to destroy a standard , then you will create a non-conformant , non-interoperable implementation , automatically download it to millions of users and sow confusion in the marketplace by flooding it with millions of incompatible documents .
It all depends on your goals .
Voluntary standards do not force , or prevent , one approach or another .
To wrap this up , I stand on the table of interoperability results in the previous post .
SP2 has reduced the level of interoperability among ODF spreadsheets , by failing to produce conforming ODF documents , and failing to take note of the spreadsheet formula conventions that had been adopted by all of the other vendors and which are working their way through OASIS as a standard .
If we note the arguments used by Microsoft in the recent past , they have argued that OOXML must be exactly what it is — flaws and all — in order to be compatible with legacy binary Office documents .
Then they argued that OOXML can not be changed in ISO , because that would create incompatibility with the “ new legacy ” documents in Office 2007 XML format .
But when it comes to ODF , they have disregarded all legacy ODF documents created by all other ODF vendors and take an aloof stance that looks with disdain on interoperability with other vendor ’s documents , or even documents produced by their own ODF Add-in .
The sacrosanctness of legacy compatibility appears to be reserved , for strategic reasons , for some formats but not others .
We ’ll redefine the Gregorian calender in ISO to be interoperable with one format if we need to , but we wo n’t deign , wo n’t stoop , wo n’t dirty ourselves to use the code we already have from the ODF Add-in for Microsoft Office , to make SP2 formulas interoperable with the other vendors ’ products , to benefit our own users who are asking for ODF support in Office .
As I said before , this ai n’t right .
Note to racist Republican : Everything you post on the internet can be spread around the globe in a matter of seconds .
COLUMBIA , SC ( WIS ) - A state Republican activist has admitted to and apologized for calling a gorilla that escaped from the Riverbanks Zoo Friday an " ancestor " of First Lady Michelle Obama .
A screen capture of the comment , made on the Internet site Facebook , was obtained by FITSNews , the website of South Carolina politico Will Folks .
The image shows a post by an aide to state Attorney General Henry McMaster describing Friday morning 's gorilla escape at Columbia 's Riverbanks Zoo .
Longtime SCGOP activist and former state Senate candidate Rusty DePass responded with the comment , " I 'm sure it 's just one of Michelle 's ancestors - probably harmless . "
Read on ...
Yes , this loyal Bushie was referring to the First Lady , Michelle Obama .
Brilliant .
His " I 'm sorry if anyone was offended " non-apology was weak at best , but at some point he should have just STFU , put down the shovel and stopped digging :
DePass took his apology a bit further .
He also said , " The comment was hers .
Not mine , " saying the first lady made statements in the media recently saying we are all descendents [ sic ] of apes .
But an Internet search for those comments turned up no news articles of the like .
Kudos to FITSNews.com for finding this and other racist GOP hackery .
The comment , along with DePass ' Facebook page has been scrubbed .
Good riddance .

President Obama will present a set of proposals on Monday aimed at changing international tax policy , calling for the elimination of benefits for companies and wealthy individuals that harbor their cash in offshore accounts .
The president and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner will announce their plans during a late - morning appearance at the White House .
The proposed overhaul in the tax code , which will be fully unveiled in the administration ’s budget later this week , could help raise $ 210 billion in revenues over the next 10 years .
One of the key proposed changes would restrict companies from deferring the payment of taxes on profits earned overseas .
Administration officials said the plan also would keep firms from taking deductions against their taxes by inflating the amount of foreign taxes they paid .
Mr. Obama raised the idea frequently during his presidential campaign .
In a speech to Congress in February , as he outlined his priorities for the year , he pledged to make the tax code more equitable by “ finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas . ”
The White House said that Mr. Obama would seek to crack down on overseas tax havens in an attempt to “ close the international tax gap . ”
The president is aiming to take away the competitive advantage for companies that invest and create jobs overseas , working to replace their tax advantages with incentives to produce jobs in the U.S .
Several large businesses have opposed the proposal , telling Congressional leaders in March that the provisions would make U.S. companies less competitive .
About 200 companies and trade associations , including Microsoft Corp. , General Electric Co. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , signed a letter stating that the proposed changes to the tax code would put them at a disadvantage with their rivals .
While Democrats have a strong majority in the House and Senate , the administration ’s proposals are still expected to face considerable opposition .
In his presidential campaign last year , Mr. Obama often criticized provisions in the tax code that allowed American firms with overseas operations to defer paying taxes on corporate profits , providing that they placed the money back into their foreign subsidiaries .
In his speech on Monday , the president will call for an end to that practice , as well as seeking to close the loopholes that allow companies and individuals to legally avoid paying billions in taxes through hidden accounts .
The White House said that Mr. Obama also will call for a crackdown on the abuse of tax havens by wealthy individuals .
Officials said the president will propose making it more difficult for financial institutions and wealthy Americans to evade their taxes .
The speech is scheduled for 11:05 a.m. in the Grand Foyer of the White House .

Jurors in the second trial were unaware of the defendants ' links to Baby Peter
The people responsible for the death of Baby Peter have been jailed .
However , as BBC News reports , these prison terms were put at risk by internet hate campaigns .
Vigilante - style websites which are determined to name and shame the mother of Baby Peter and her boyfriend almost wrecked their second trial for the rape and neglect of a two - year - old child .
Their efforts to " out " the identities of the couple - who still cannot be named for legal reasons - could even have led to some of those responsible for Baby Peter 's death receiving far lesser sentences than the ones they did .
It raises further questions on how justice can continue to operate in high - profile cases when judge 's orders can be so easily broken by bloggers .
Reporting restrictions on the media after the Baby Peter trial prevented any information about his mother and boyfriend facing a second trial being made public .
Despite efforts by the mainstream media to challenge the orders , the press was placed in a position that to even mention the second trial could have resulted in a substantial fine or even imprisonment for contempt of court .
Identities of the defendants and the false names they had been given in court had leaked out on websites that specialised in demonising the Baby Peter three
The public could only be told that the couple 's sentencing - and that of their lodger Jason Owen who was also found guilty of causing or allowing Peter 's death but did not feature in the second trial - was being delayed for legal reasons .
Before the second trial even started , defence lawyers for the couple argued forcefully that any jury trying the mother and boyfriend would be prejudiced if they knew who was in the dock in front of them .
They said the defendants were perceived by the public in the same way as the Soham murderer and his girlfriend and that more than half a million people had already signed internet petitions demanding justice for Peter .
These internet campaigns made it impossible to hold a fair trial , they argued .
The judge , Stephen Kramer , disagreed and ordered a trial could go ahead provided the jury was not told the defendants were linked with Peter in any way .
And as a a failsafe measure , it was agreed the defendants should be given false names .
But despite these efforts and within days of the trial starting , the identities of the defendants and the false names they had been given in court had leaked out on websites that specialised in demonising the Baby Peter three .
Harsher sentence Bloggers not only directed readers to where the trial was happening but gave details of what evidence was being heard .
The trial came to an abrupt halt and police were ordered to investigate the source of the information .
It was feared that the trial itself might have been compromised after barely starting .
Finally , it was decided it could continue , but only once the jury were given firm instructions not to do any research on the internet .
The plan worked .
After delivering its verdicts , the jury was told how the two defendants had been convicted or pleaded guilty to causing or allowing Peter 's death .
Not one reacted as if they knew .
As a result , the boyfriend of Peter 's mother received a far greater sentence not only for causing the boy 's death , which carried a 14 - year maximum prison stretch , but also for the rape conviction which carried a potential life sentence .
Peter 's mother was cleared of cruelty to the second child .
If the websites that were so determined to give away the second trial had led to its collapse , they would have been responsible for the earlier release of one of the very people they sought to vilify .

Blueberries may help sharpen your cognitive abilities , according to new research conducted by Tufts University and the National Institute on Aging .
After injecting male rats with kainic acid in order to simulate the oxidative stress that happens with aging , researchers discovered that the rats fed a diet having 2 % blueberry extract performed better navigating through a maze than those rats not fed the compound .
Blueberries on the Brain
Another study carried out by the same scientists discovered that rats that ate blueberries demonstrated increased cell growth in their brain ’s hippocampus region .
Researchers believe the dark blue pigment in blueberries - anthocyanin - is behind these cognitive behavioral changes .
Anthocyanin contains chemicals which researchers suspect may traverse the blood - brain barrier and reside in areas of the brain that control memory and learning .
A Tasty Hint
Help yourself to better mental health by stocking up on blueberries , especially when fresh and on sale .
Sprinkle them over pancakes , yogurt or cereal , or add them to your smoothie .
Oh , and do n’t hesitate to buy frozen blueberries in their off - season .
They are just as nourishing .

この日記を書き始めてからもう6年になろうとしている。書き始めたきっかけは、RFIDタグのプライバシー問題が理解されないことに焦りを感じたからだった。当時の空気では、RFIDタグは5年後くらいに普及し、しだいにRFIDの埋め込まれた日用品で溢れかえるようになり、10年後くらいにプライバシー問題が顕在化すると目されていた。しかし、6年経った現在、私の靴にRFIDタグは埋め込まれていない。
当時の議論で描かれていたRFIDタグの問題は、無線LANやBluetoothにも共通することであり（MACアドレスがユニークIDとなる）、それらの方が先に普及するかもしれないという予感はあったが、現時点でも、無線LAN機器を持ち歩いている人はごく一部の人に限られている。しかし、Bluetoothはどうだろうか。これまでにも何度か、最近のBluetooth事情について書こうとしたことがあったが、他のネタで精一杯で先送りにしていた。
最近 のBluetooth事情
図1は、2008年6月に電車内でBluetooth機器を設定をしようとしたときの様子である。
かなりの数の携帯電話 がBluetooth機器として検出されている。走行中の列車内で5人前後が検出され、駅に到着すると20人前後がドカドカっと検出される（ホームに立っている人の携帯電話が次々に検出される）という感じだった。一昨年あたりから急速にBluetooth対応携帯電話が普及しているようだ。
Bluetoothの機器探査（device inquiry ）では、最初に周辺機器か らMAC アドレスを得て、次に各MACアドレスの機器に名前の問い合わせをするプロトコルになっている。図1にも一部見えているように、Mac OS XのBluetooth機器設定の画面では、名前解決前のMACアドレスがそのまま表示される。
Bluetoothでは 、Bluetooth機能をオンにしていても、探査可能（検出可能）に設定していなければ、このように見つけられてしまうことはないのだが、意外にも、探査可能設定でBluetoothをオンにしたままの人がかなりの割合でいるようだ。これは、RFIDタグよりも先にBluetoothによって、IDのプライバシー問題が顕在化しそうな勢いである。
そこで、実際にいかほどのことが可能なのかを調べるため、Bluetooth機器探査の応答をログに記録するプログラムを作成して、山手線を4周してきた。
機器探査ロ グ
2009年3月1日の日曜日、池袋駅18:12発の外回り列車に乗り、真ん中あたりの車両の中央の座席に腰掛け、観測を開始。4周廻って池袋駅22:18着まで
を観測した。その間に1154個のMACアドレスを検出した。
観測データは以下のように記録した（MACアドレスの下位24ビットは伏せている
）。約21秒ごとの時間スロットに区切って機器探査を繰り返し行い、新たに見つかったMACアドレスを「+」のマークで示している（「#」は私の鞄の中のスマートフォンのアドレス）。
最初の時間スロットは池袋駅停車中であり、2つ目のスロットは駅から動き出した時、3つ目のスロットは、駅を離れて走行中の時である。3つ目から5つ目までのスロットで、7つのMACアドレスを継続して検出していることから、大塚駅までの区間で、私以外に6人の人がBluetooth機器を（検出可能設定のままオンにして）持っていたことを意味している。それに対して、1つ目のスロットや2つ目のスロットで検出されたのに3つ目以降で現れていない（ごく短い時間だけ現れた）MACアドレスが多数あるが、これは、駅のホームを歩いている人のMACアドレスを検出したものと考えられる。

6つ目と7つ目のスロットでは、大塚駅に到着して、「+」マークの新しいMACアドレスが現れている。
ログを眺めながら乗車していると、対向列車とすれ違ったときにも「+」が現れることがあった。また、京浜東北線と並走するときにも「+」が出ることがあった。
Bluetoothの通信距離は10メートルの規格と100メートルの規格があるが、おそらく携帯電話側が10メートルのものであろう。山手線の車両の長さが20メートルなので、ちょうど1両分の範囲で観測したことになる。
ただし、乗車人数に比例して増えるわけではなかった。以下は、ほぼ満員になったピーク時（渋谷駅22:03発、原宿までの区間）の様子である。私以外に13人ほどが継続して検出されている。このとき、駅に停車中でもホームの人をあまり捉えていないことから、着席していると人体で遮られて遠くの機器を検出できなくなるのではないかと思われる。

乗降パター ン
さて、こうして検出した機器を、時刻に沿って同心円上に描いてみた。
短い線分は1回だけ検出されたことを表している。黒と赤があるのは、（同じライン上に描いているけれども）別のMACアドレスであることを示している。（同じライン上に色が変わらずに飛び飛びに描かれているのは、同じMACアドレスのものである。）
短い線分がたくさん重なっているのは、駅のホームを歩く人などを通りすがりに続々と検出したもので、これの多いところのほとんどは駅である。
以下 のJavaアプレットで、4周分を見ることができる。（クリックで開始。）
ログを分析してみると、約1時間間隔で繰り返し点として現れたMACアドレスが何個かあった。山手線は一周が1時間と数分なので、これは、駅に設置されている何らかの情報機器か、もしくは近接した住宅や事務所の情報機器なのかもしれない。以下にそれを示す。

左から2列目は、最初に検出されてから最後に検出されるまでの時間で、
「
|」の右側のコンマで区切られた数値は、時間スロットの番号（約21秒で区切られたスロットなので、1時間が約171スロット）で、検出された時間スロットのリストである。
約30分間隔で現れたものもあった。これは何だろうか。対向列車に乗車して半周した人、あるいは、対向列車の運転士や車掌さんなのだろうか。
001CD6XXXXXX 29:35 | 563,568,646,647 00175CXXXXXX 28:33 | 425,506
一方、不規則な間隔で現れたものもあった。以下の2つ目の事例の、50分後に現れたケースは、同じ人が対向列車か別ルートで駅に移動していたのを捕らえたものだろうか。1つ目の、90分後、8分後、20分後というのは解せない。3つ目以下の20分後に現れるというのも解せないが、これらは、同じ列車に継続して乗車していたものの距離が遠くて飛び飛びにしか検出されなかったケースなのかもしれない。

偶然の乗り合わ せ
この実験を決行する前に、予備テストとして、勤務先から帰宅する電車内で何回かこのプログラムを稼働させていた。具体的には、2月18日の24時04分からと、2月20日の23時16分から、2月24日の23時08分からで、ほぼ同じ車両に乗っていたと思う。
もしかすると同じ人を複数回検出しているかもしれないと思うわけだが、確率的にありそうもないと思ったのだが、実際に集計してみて驚いた。なんと、該当者を捕らえていたのだ。

たった3回計測しただけで、しかも時刻は同じではないのに、同じ車両に乗り合わせた人がいたことが判明してしまった。今まで、東京の電車に乗っていて、同じ人がいるなんて思ったことは一度もなかったのに……。
もうひとつある。出勤時にもテストしていたことがあり、具体的には、2月20日の13時06分からなのだが、18日の24時過ぎに継続して検出されていた人が、20日の昼間に1回だけ検出されている。これはいったい何だろうか。

この実験の適法 性
このような他人 のBluetooth機器を探査する行為に違法性はないのか、検討しておく必要がある。
類似の話として、一昨年、家庭の無 線LANアクセスポイントのMACアドレスを収集して利用する「PlaceEngine」について、電波法59条違反のおそれがあるのではないかと書いたことがある。
PlaceEngineの場合に、違法性があるかもしれないと感じられたのは、PlaceEngineが観測するのは、他人が通信するために発信している電波信号（家庭の無線LANアクセスポイントが、その家庭内の無線LANクライアントと通信するために発信している信号）を、第三者として傍受したもので、それを他人に利用できる形で提供しているからだった。
それに比べて 、Bluetoothの機器探査（device inquiry ）はどうか。まず、これは「傍受」にあたらない。当該機器からの応答信号は、こちらから呼びかけたのに対して返ってくるものであるから、常に1対1の通信であり、機器探査をしている者はその通信の当事者である 。
Bluetooth対応携帯電話を、検出可能設定のままオンにして電車に乗っている人が、はたして他人から探知されることを予定しているかといえば、いないだろう。しかし、それを現行法で抑制できるかというときに、電波法59条は（その趣旨からして）筋が違うように思う。
Bluetoothは低消費電力を利点とした通信規格であり、できるだけ電波を出さないようになっているところ、device inquiry を繰り返し受けて、応答の電波を何度も出すというのは、無用な電力消費を強いられている（僅かであろうが）と言うことができるかもしれない。これが迷惑行為とみなされるようになる可能性はあるかもしれない。
商業的に活用される懸念、CGM的に蓄積される懸念
私は、このような行為が何ら規制されないのは、プライバシー保護の観点からまずいと思っている。だからこそこのような実演を今している。
これだけ多くの携帯電話が 、Bluetooth機器探査に応じる設定のままで持ち歩かれているとなると、マーケティング目的での活用がまず発想されるところだろう。
店内の客がどの棚の前に長く滞在したかを調べるとか、過去に何回訪れたことのある客かを判別するためなどの目的で、商業施設が人々のBluetoothのMACアドレスを記録し、蓄積し、共有するようになるかもしれない。
それはどこまで許されることなのか。これはまさに、2003年にRFIDタグの未来が一大ブームになったときに、さんざん様々なシナリオを示して、問題点を訴えていた話そのものである。
個人情報保護法が守ってくれるかというとそうでもない。こうしたユニークIDは、携帯電話の契約者固有IDと同様で、住所氏名と紐付けない限り「個人情報」に該当しないというのが、日本の個人情報保護法の解釈の通説らしい。
RFIDタグはまだ広く出回っていないが、Bluetooth対応携帯電話の広がりは、今まさに広がりつつあり、止められそうにない。これを商業的に活用するのはアリなのか、ナシなのか。
私としてはナシということになるべきだと思うが、その根拠はどこに求めればよいのだろうか。「無用な電力消費を強いられることが迷惑」という路線でくい止めることができるだろうか。
商業的な活用はそのような倫理でくい止めることができるかもしれないが、個人が勝手に探査してMACアドレスを公開したり、CGM的に多数の人で情報を寄せ集めて共有する行為はくい止められないかもしれない。
2003 年のRFIDの議論で、私は、「自動車ナンバープレートだって、個人が自宅前で撮影して番号読み取りをしたものを、インターネットで共有するような行為が横行するようになるかもしれない。同様にRFIDだって……」ということをどこかに書いた記憶がある。Bluetoothでも同じことが懸念される。
日本は、欧州と違って、Googleのストリートビューの自動車ナンバープレートさえ、自動ぼかし処理なしに開始されている。政府がそれをくい止めないような国である。
英語圏での状況、対策の研究事例
今回、思い出したかのようにBluetoothの件を書いたのは、2月16日に「RFID A GoGo!」というブログの「 MACアドレスによるユニークIDトラッキング」というエントリで次のように書いて頂いたのがきっかけだった。
「 英語で はMACアドレスによるユニークIDトラッキング問題に関する記事はまったく引っかかってこなかった」とのことだが、そんなことはない。Bluetoothに関する同様の指摘は以前から出ていて、たとえば、最近でも以下が話題になっている。
実験事例の報告はいくつも出ているし、研究論文での指摘や対策方法の提案もある。
根本的には、無断でトラッキングされることがないよう、Bluetoothのプロトコルを改善するべきところと思うが、変えようとしても普及の勢いからして当面はこのままだろう。少なくとも、今後出てくる新しい通信方式においては、同じ轍を踏まないようにしてもらいたいものだ。そのためにも、すべての技術者にこの問題への理解を深めて欲しいと願う。
