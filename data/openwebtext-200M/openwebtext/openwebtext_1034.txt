ALEXANDRIA , Va. , July 2 ( UPI ) --
Contractors employed by the Blackwater private military company , now called Xe , were responsible for six unprovoked attacks in Iraq , a lawsuit alleges .
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Alexandria , Va. , added six additional instances in which Blackwater contractors allegedly attacked Iraqi civilians without being provoked , The ( Norfolk ) Virginian - Pilot said Thursday .

The alleged attacks by contractors employed by Blackwater , which was contracted by the State Department to support U.S. personnel in Iraq , resulted in the deaths of three people , including a 9 - year - old boy , the plaintiffs allege .
A racketeering count was also added to the lawsuit against the security company and its founder Erik Prince this week .
The count includes alleged instances in which Prince 's companies took part in illegal activities like homicides , tax evasion , weapons smuggling , kidnapping and child prostitution .
Susan Burke , attorney for the lawsuit 's plaintiffs , said her clients want to prove the military company and its affiliated groups have an alleged history of illicit activity .
" What we 're very , very worried about is this company hurting other people going forward around the globe , " she told the Virginian - Pilot .
" They 're moving into Africa , they 're moving into other places , and we believe they need judicial supervision . "
" I did go online and Google some of the stories and as tough as I am , it does get to you , but there 's no point getting upset , " he said .
Bitfields are very common in low level C programming .
You can use them for efficient storage of a data structure with lots of flags , or to pass a set of flags between functions .
Let us look at the different ways of doing this .
The straightforward way to deal with bitfields is to do the Boolean logic by hand :
Boolean Magic
# define FLAG_USER ( 1 << 0 ) #define FLAG_ZERO ( 1 << 1 ) #define FLAG_FORCE ( 1 << 2 ) /* bits 3-30 reserved */ #define FLAG_COMPAT
( 1 << 31 ) int create_object ( int flags ) { int is_compat = ( flags & FLAG_COMPAT ) ; if ( is_compat ) flags &= ~FLAGS_FORCE ; if ( flags & FLAG_FORCE ) { [...] } [...] } int create_object_zero( int flags ) { create_object ( flags | FLAGS_ZERO ) ; } void caller ( ) { create_object ( FLAG_FORCE | FLAG_COMPAT ) ; }
You can see code like this everywhere , so most C programmers can probably read and understand this quite easily .
But unfortunately , this method is very error - prone .
Mixing up " & " and " && " and omitting the " ~ " when doing " &= " are common oversights , and since the compiler only sees " int " types , this also does n't give you any kind of type - safety .
Bitfields
Let us look at the same code using bitfields instead :
typedef unsigned int boolean_t ; # define FALSE 0 # define TRUE !FALSE typedef union { struct { boolean_t user : 1 ; boolean_t zero : 1 ; boolean_t force : 1 ; int :28 ; /* unused */ boolean_t compat:1 ; /* bit 31 */ } ; int raw ; } flags_t ; int create_object ( flags_t flags ) { boolean_t is_compat = flags.compat ; if ( is_compat ) flags.
force = FALSE ; if ( flags.force ) { [...] } [...] } int create_object_zero( flags_t flags ) { flags.zero = TRUE ; create_object ( flags ) ; } void caller ( ) { create_object ( ( flags_t ) { { . force = TRUE , .compat = TRUE } } ) ; }
Flags can just be used like any variables .
The compiler abstracts the Boolean logic away .
The only downside is that the code with the static initializer requires some advanced syntax .
Endianness
Bitfields in C always start at bit 0 .
While this is the least significant bit ( LSB ) on Little Endian ( bit 0 has a weight of 2^0 ) , most compilers on Big Endian systems inconveniently consider the most significant bit ( MSB ) bit 0 ( bit 0 has a weight of 2^31 , 2^63 etc. depending on the word size ) , so in case your bitfield needs to be binary - compatible across machines with different endianness , you will need to define two versions of the bitfield .
The Raw Bitfield
Did you notice the " int raw " in the union ?
It lets us conveniently ( and type - safely ) export the raw bit value without having to use a cast .
printf ( " raw flags : 0x %xn " , flags.raw ) ;
We can use this to reconstruct the FLAG _ * constants in the original example , in case some code needs it :
# define FLAG_USER ( ( ( flags_t ) { { .user = TRUE } } ) .raw ) # define FLAG_ZERO ( ( ( flags_t ) { { .zero = TRUE } } ) .raw ) # define FLAG_FORCE ( ( ( flags_t ) { { . force = TRUE } } ) .raw ) # define FLAG_COMPAT ( ( ( flags_t ) { { .compat = TRUE } }).raw )
This code constructs a temporary instance of the bitfield , sets one bit , and converts it into a raw integer - all at compile time .
Bitfield Access from Assembly
With the same trick , you can also access your bitfield from assembly , for example if the bitfield is part of the Thread Control Block in your operating system kernel , and the low level context switch code needs to access one of the bits .
The " int raw " can be used to statically convert a flag into the corresponding raw mask :
typedef unsigned int boolean_t ; typedef union { struct { boolean_t bit0:1 ; boolean_t bit1:1 ; int :19 ; boolean_t bit31:1 ; } ; int raw ; } bitfield_t ; int test ( ) { int param = - 1 ; int result ; __asm__ volatile ( " test % 2 , % 1 n " " xor %0 , %0 n " " setcc %0 n " : " =r " ( result ) : " r " ( param ) , " i " ( ( ( bitfield_t ) { { .bit31 = TRUE } } ) .raw ) ) ; return result ; }
The corresponding x86 assembly code looks like this :
. text .align 4,0x90 .globl _test _test : pushl %ebp movl %esp , %ebp movl $ - 1 , %eax ## InlineAsm Start test $ 0x80000000 , %eax xor %eax , %eax setcc %eax ## InlineAsm End popl %ebp ret .subsections_via_symbols
This works fine with LLVM , but unfortunately GCC ( 4.2.1 ) has problems detecting that the raw value is available at compile time , so the " i " has to be replaced with an " r " : GCC will then pre-assign a register with the raw value instead of being able to use an immediate with the " test " instruction .
How to Not Do It
I have seen C++ code doing this :
enum { FLAG_USER , FLAG_ZERO , FLAG_FORCE , FLAG_COMPAT = 31 } int create_object ( bitfield_t flags ) { bool is_compat = flags.is_set( FLAG_COMPAT ) ; if ( is_compat ) flags -= FLAGS_FORCE ; if ( flags.is_set ( FLAG_FORCE ) ) { [...] } [...] } int create_object_zero( int flags ) { create_object ( flags + FLAGS_ZERO ) ; } void caller ( ) { create_object ( ( ( bitfield_t ) FLAG_FORCE ) + FLAG_COMPAT ) ; }
This all looks quite weird .
The constants are bit index values , and they are added and subtracted .
The reason is C++ operator overloading :
class bitmask_t { word_t maskvalue ; public : [...] inline bitmask_t operator -= ( int n ) { maskvalue = maskvalue & ~ ( 1UL << n ) ; return ( bitmask_t ) maskvalue ; } [...] }
This is horrible .
The code that uses this class makes no sense unless you read and understand the implementation of the class .
And you have to be very careful :
While it is possible to " add " a flag to an existing bitfield , you cannot just add two flags - it would do the arithmetic and add the two values .
Mapping the setting and clearing of bits onto the addition and subtraction operators is clearly wrong in the first place :
Flags in a bitfield are equivalent to elements in a set .
Setting a flag is equivalent to the " union " operation , which even in Mathematics has its own symbol instead of overloading the " + " operator .
Question
If you compile code that does something like " ( ( bitfield_t ) { { . bit31 = TRUE } } ) .raw " with GCC in C++ mode , it fails .
Why ?

European patients , taxpayers and national treasuries are being fleeced of billions of euros because of the big pharmaceutical companies ' elaborate campaigns to delay the marketing of cheaper generic drugs , the European commission said .
" There is something rotten in the state [ of the pharmaceutical industry ] , " said Neelie Kroes , the competition commissioner , unveiling the findings of an 18 - month inquiry into the pharmaceuticals sector .
" Makers of original medicines are actively trying to delay the entry of generic medicines on to their markets . "
Kroes announced a formal investigation of the French company Les Laboratoires Servier for allegedly stifling competition for the heart disease drug Perindopril and she is believed to be on the brink of ordering another three investigations , including one into practices at GlaxoSmithKline .
The investigation of the sector , which included raids on several of the biggest firms last year , showed that the major firms had struck at least 200 settlements with generics manufacturers , costing € 200 m ( £ 173 m ) and mainly aimed at restricting the marketing of generic drugs .
A key tactic by big firms was to abuse patenting practices to play for time and wreck the chances of generics firms being able to compete , the commission found .
A common practice was for the major companies to file a large number of patent applications across EU states for a single drug – as many as 1,300 – in what are known as " patent clusters " .
Another common option was for the major firms to sue generics companies and then stall the cases in court for several years .
Kroes called for a new Europe - wide patent and a unified system of litigation to save time and money .
" The lack of progress is very , very damaging , " she said .
" Vicious tactics are used to delay or prevent the entry of more affordable and innovative medicines into the market , " said Monique Goyens , director general of the European Consumers ' Organisation .
" Millions of euros are spent in promotional activities , in legal disputes and settlement agreements instead of in the development of new medicines . "
The commission estimates generic drugs are 40 % cheaper than their branded equivalents within two years of coming on the market , while it calculates that the drugs retail market in the EU is worth € 214bn a year .
But while Kroes attacked the big firms ' tactics , the commission appeared to tone down its criticism of the sector and spread the blame for the fact that drug prices are kept unnecessarily high .
The trade body representing the major pharma companies in Europe , EFPIA said it feared the commission verdict would be worse .
It said : " It demonstrated a welcome shift away from the emotive language of the [ previous interim ] report , with a better balanced , more holistic view of the issues facing the sector .
The report failed to substantiate the initial allegation that patenting strategies dampened innovation or delayed generic entry illegitimately . "
Arthur Higgins , chief executive of Bayer Healthcare , said : " The report failed to substantiate the initial allegation that patenting strategies dampened innovation or delayed generic entry illegitimately .
" Complex and divergent regulatory barriers are the primary cause of market - entry delay . "
As a Comcast customer only because I have no other choice in my area , I ’m used to their shitty customer service .
But when you see the following , it ’s clear they ’re not even trying to improve …
Here ’s a promo for “ Comcast Digital Cable with On Demand and HBO . ”
The headline : The Best and the Smartest .
The picture to go along with that : Shaquille O’Neal and Ben Stein .
No one ’s ever accused Shaq of being the smartest man around … so I presume they mean he ’s the “ Best . ”
Even that ’s arguable since he did n’t win the NBA championship this past year …
But that means Ben Stein represents “ Smartest . ”
Say what now ?
Stein , the evolution - denier , the man behind the pro-Intelligent - Design movie Expelled , the man who once said “ science leads you to killing people “ ….
he ’s the “ smartest ” !?
Which uneducated intern made that marketing decision ?
Maybe I should n’t be surprised Stein is representing Comcast .
When given several options , Stein tends to support the worst one in the bunch .

For citizens of the US , the social security number ( SSN ) is the gateway to all things financial .
It fills its government purpose of helping us pay our taxes and track our ( in many cases , hypothetical ) government benefits , and it has also been widely adopted as a means of verifying identity by a huge range of financial institutions .
As a result , anytime you disclose an SSN you run a real risk of enabling identity theft .
So far , most of the SSN - related ID theft problems have resulted from institutions that were careless with their record keeping , allowing SSNs to be harvested in bulk .
But a pair of Carnegie Mellon researchers has now demonstrated a technique that uses publicly available information to reconstruct SSNs with a startling degree of accuracy .
The irony of their method is that it relies on two practices adopted by the federal government that were intended to reduce the ability of fraudsters to craft a bogus SSN .
The first is that the government now maintains a publicly available database called a Death Master File , which indicates which SSNs were the property of individuals who are now deceased .
This record provided the researchers with the raw material to perform a statistical analysis of how SSN assignments related to two other pieces of personal information : date and state of birth .
The second is that the government has centralized its handling of SSN assignments and provided documentation of the procedures .
The first three digits are based on the state where the SSN was originally assigned , and the next two are what 's termed a group number .
The last four digits are ostensibly assigned at random .
Since the late 1980s , the government has promoted an initiative termed " Enumeration at Birth " that seeks to ensure that SSNs are assigned shortly after birth , which should limit the circumstances under which individuals apply for them later in life ( and hence , make fraudulent applications easier to detect ) .
That last program proved to be the key feature that allowed the new research , as it ensured that SSN assignments were more tightly correlated to date of birth .
The researchers used the Death Master File to split out data from individual states ( which determine the first three digits ) then order them by date .
At that point , they searched for statistical patterns within the resulting data .
Even from data before the 1990s , rough patterns were apparent in the assignment of region and group numbers but , by the mid-90s , it 's obvious that , with a few exceptions , individual region and group numbers are used in a clear sequential order for most SSNs .
The patterns are even easier to pick out in less populous states .
Patterns in the final four digits were harder to detect , but the authors created an algorithm that predicted them with a lower degree of confidence .
The accuracy of these algorithms is positively disturbing .
Using a separate pool of data from the Death Master File , the authors were able to get the first five digits right for seven percent of those with an SSN assigned before 1988 ; after that , the success rate goes up to a staggering 44 percent .
For a smaller state , like Vermont , they could get it right over 90 percent of the time .
Getting the last four digits right was substantially harder .
The authors used a standard of getting the whole SSN right within 10 tries , and could only manage that about 0.1 percent of the time even in the later period .
Still , small states were somewhat easier — for Delaware in 1996 , they had a five percent success rate .
That may still seem moderately secure if it were n't for some realities of the modern online world .
The authors point out that many credit card verification services , recognizing the challenges of data entry from illegible forms , may allow up to two digits of the SSN to be wrong , provided the date and place of birth are accurate .
They often allow several failed verification attempts per IP address before blacklisting it .
Given these numbers , the authors estimate that even a moderate - sized botnet of 10,000 machines could successfully obtain identity verifications for younger residents of West Virginia at a rate of 47 a minute .
All of that requires that the botnet master have access to date and place of birth information , and a number of commercial services will happily provide that data for a price .
But the authors also point out that it may not be necessary to pay ; they cite a publication in progress that indicates it 's easy to harvest a lot of that information from social networking sites like Facebook .

REUTERS / Handout
MADRID ( Reuters ) - Spanish police have arrested a man whom they suspect hired a contract killer to murder his boss in a desperate bid to avoid being laid off , newspaper El Pais reported on Tuesday .
The head of audiovisual services at the Barcelona International Convention Center contracted a Colombian man who shot and killed the director of the convention center on Feb 9 , according to police .
The director had planned to lay off the arrested man as part of a restructuring project , police said .
In fear of losing his job , the head of services , through his sister , contracted a team of six Colombians who planned and carried out the killing , El Pais reported .
Police have also detained the sister and six Colombians .
The shooting marks one of the most extreme actions by Spaniards who fear losing jobs , homes and businesses during a recession in which unemployment is rising faster than in any other developed country .
Other cases include an indebted Spanish builder who kidnapped his bank manager at gunpoint and the head of a construction firm who threatened to set himself on fire unless debts he was owed were paid .
I have finished a first draft of an overview on declarative programming .
The section on functional programming is almost identical to the version published previously but I have added a section on logic programming features : unbound variables , non-determinism , search , and constraints .
The LP section contains a surprisingly concise solution for the n-queens problem and a lazy implementation of breadth - first search with a circular queue .
If you find time to read it , I ’d be interested in whether you could follow easily or — if not — where you got stuck ( especially if you are not very familiar with functional and / or logic programming ) .

At least 66 people have been injured in a mass pile - up involving 259 cars on a motorway in north Germany , police say .
Ten people are said to be fighting for their lives in hospital after the series of crashes on the A2 between Hanover and Peine on Sunday evening .
Police said the pile - up was believed to have been caused by a combination of heavy rain and excessive speed .
Rescue workers were busy throughout the night treating the injured and clearing damaged cars from the motorway .
" I have not seen anything like this before .
I have seen many accidents but never a pile - up this size , " said firefighter Klaus Wulfes .
One of the drivers said his car had been hit from behind and pushed into a ditch , from which his family were able to escape unharmed .
" All I did was turn around to check on my little son , our son .
That was my only thought , " he told the Reuters news agency .

Rice farmers are some of the poorest people in Thailand
The first rains of the year have been falling for a couple of months now in Thailands often dry north - east , and farmers are out most days in the freshly - flooded fields , transplanting young jasmine rice seedlings .
They work quickly , bent over double , expertly spacing the seedlings in the silt .
But it is back - breaking work .
And although jasmine is one of the most highly - prized rice varieties  it is grown almost exclusively in north - eastern Thailand  the farmers in this region are some of the poorest people in the country , most of them mired in debt .
Lack of investment
Their problem , says veteran rice researcher Kwanchai Gomez from Bangkoks Kasaertsart University , is a chronic lack of investment in rice farming .
Very little of the north - east  one of Thailands most populous regions  is irrigated .
 Water is the most important thing that guarantees low risk , " she says .
 And risk is the main problem for farmers .
One year no rain , the next year floods .
So you have to get a loan .
Then your crop fails , and you get into debt .
Other nations are threatening Thailand 's place as the top rice exporter
When world rice prices soared last year , everyone assumed that farmers in Thailand  for many years the worlds top rice exporter  must have done well .
Some did .
But only those in the central plains region , which get irrigation from the Chaophraya River .
They grow up to three crops a year , mostly higher yield varieties than jasmine .
That is where most of Thailands exports come from .
The indebtedness and poverty of farmers was ignored for decades by governments in Bangkok .
Then in the 2001 election , a wealthy telecoms tycoon , Thaksin Shinawatra , drew up a platform of policies aimed directly at farmers , like debt forgiveness and a village loan fund .
It proved a stunningly successful vote - winning strategy , delivering Mr Thaksin three successive election victories , before he was ousted by a coup in September 2006 .
But many of those policies have done less for farmers than Mr Thaksin claimed .
Rice mortgage
One , in particular , is proving a huge headache for the current government , led by his main rival , the Democrat Party .
I realized that our problems with debt and crop prices would never be cured just by waiting for the government to help
Tongsuan Sodapak
It is called the rice mortgage scheme .
The idea is to help farmers ride out price volatility by allowing them to sell their rice to the government at a guaranteed price .
Farmers usually have no way to store or process their rice , so they are all forced to sell at once at harvest time , allowing the millers  who do have these facilities  to bargain down the price and take most of the profit .
But the scheme has become riddled with corruption , and benefits only a minority of farmers .
 Most of them , unfortunately , are rich farmers with irrigation ,  says economist Nipon Poapongsakorn from the Thailand Development Research Institute .
 Poor farmers in the north - east dont have a surplus of rice to sell , so they dont benefit from this policy at all .
It is a pro-rich , pro-business policy  .
The scheme is also very expensive for the government , especially now , because last year  when rice prices were unusually volatile  a weak government , led by Mr Thaksins allies , set the guaranteed price too high .
Those with rice to sell would only sell to the government .
Rice traders , like Asia Golden Rice - one of Thailands most successful - found it difficult to procure supplies at competitive prices for their overseas customers .
 We might even lose our number one ranking as a rice exporter to our competitors ,  says Saranyu Jeamsinkul , deputy managing director for Asia Golden Rice .
 We are at least $ 100 a tonne higher than Vietnam - so it is rather difficult to export at the moment .
Sorting the mess
The government has ordered Deputy Prime Minister Kobsak Sapavasu to sort out the mess .
TAKING THE PULSE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
The BBC is Taking the Pulse of the Global Economy , looking at a range of subjects this summer Consumer behaviour - how have lifestyles changed over the year Food prices - which remain a concern particularly in many developing economies
Highly volatile energy prices - which have been a major issue in the past year
The plight of migrant workers - as the global recession takes hold in many economies Housing markets - which have turned from boom to bust in many countries Rising unemployment levels - as firms cut back because of falling orders
BBC World Food Price Index Taking the Pulse explained
He estimates it has already cost 11 billion baht ( $ 325 m ) just to process and store crops bought under the mortgage scheme .
And because rice prices have fallen this year , when the government sells the stocks he estimates it will lose another 20 billion baht ( $ 590 m ) .
 The numbers are just unbelievable , " says Mr Kobsak .
But his attempts to close down the mortgage scheme , and replace it with a simpler subsidy , have been blocked by his own coalition partners .
There is a strong suspicion , shared by Mr Kobsak , that a lot of politicians are making money out of the scheme  perhaps from bribes from warehouse - keepers storing it , or traders trying to buy at bargain prices .
With any hope of a new agricultural policy stalled over political bickering , one group of farmers near the north - eastern town of Ubon Ratchathani have decided to try to lift their living standards by themselves .
They have joined forces to run their own rice mill , and they are saving on escalating fertiliser costs by recycling cow dung and growing organic jasmine rice .
The escalating price of rice has not made many
Thai farmers any richer " I wondered why so many farmers were abandoning their farms , " said Tongsuan Sodapak , the local teacher whose idea it is .
" Then I realised that our problems with debt and crop prices would never be cured just by waiting for the government to help . "
This group of farmers has been fortunate , because they have been able to make contact with a buyer for their organic rice in Italy .
Most other farmers in the north - east have no way of marketing their jasmine rice , despite its famed fragrance and flavour .
Thailand 's long preoccupation with being the number one exporter should now shift , says Nipon Poapongsakorn - to a strategy of marketing Thai rice for its quality and variety .
One retailer in Bangkok has made a start in promoting Thailand 's 81 rice varieties .
Gourmet Market , a luxury supermarket chain , has bins of different kinds of rice , explaining exactly which region they come from , and their characteristic .
It is a bit like the terroir of wine .
" We have people coming here from places like Hong Kong , " says company vice president Lakana Naviroj .
" They take rice home , because they do n't have the variety and quality we have here . "
One supermarket alone , though , will not give Thailand 's rice the impact it could have on global markets .
That requires a concerted drive coordinated by different government agencies , something that seems unlikely in today 's volatile political climate .
At the school where Tongsun Sodapak teaches , when he's not helping grow to rice , I asked a group of teenage girls - nearly all of them the children of farmers - how many of them would be happy to stay on the farm when they left school .
Only four , out of 34 , raised their hands .

Richard Dawkins
Richard Dawkins is a British evolutionary biologist who has been outspoken in his support of Darwinism , atheism and secular humanism and opposition to religion .
He has written several popular science books , including the iconic The Selfish Gene ( 1976 ) , and holds the Charles Simonyi Chair for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University .
Intelligent life on a planet comes of age when it first works out the reason for its own existence .
If superior creatures from space ever visit earth , the first question they will ask , in order to assess the level of our civilization , is : ' Have they discovered evolution yet ? '
Richard Dawkins , first lines of The Selfish Gene ( 1976 )
' Belief ' interview
This is the transcript of the " Belief " interview broadcast in April 2004 .
Richard Dawkins holds the Charles Simonyi Chair of Public Understanding of Science in Oxford , and as such he takes a high profile role in the exposition and elucidation of scientific ideas in our culture .
He 's eminently well placed to do so , being himself one of science 's most innovative thinkers .
His first book , The Selfish Gene , made a huge impact back in 1976 , with its message of the central role of genes in evolution .
There followed a stream of more books , all with highly poetic titles - The Blind Watchmaker , River Out of Eden , Climbing Mount Improbable , Unweaving The Rainbow , and most recently A Devil 's Chaplain , each offering further development and commentary upon Darwin 's concept of Natural Selection .
There is one book whose title is not poetic - The Extended Phenotype - which Dawkins himself believes marks his biggest claim to scientific innovation .
Not surprisingly , the many honours he 's received include both a fellowship of the Royal Society , and a fellowship of the Royal Society of Literature .
Not many people have both .
Richard Dawkins , you came from a family ... that lived in Malawi , or what is now Malawi .
Your father was in colonial administration , and when you came back to England , he became a farmer .
This suggests a secure , middle class conventional background .
Yeah , that pretty much sums it up I think , yes .
And it felt comfortable ?
Very comfortable .
I was sent off to boarding school , which some people do n't find comfortable .
I was happy with it , and I had an idyllic time in the school holidays .
And was it there that you decided you wanted to be a scientist ?
My decision to be a scientist was a bit of a drift really , more or less by default .
Well you were following in you father 's footsteps ...
I was following , and that partly helped me to help that drift , I suppose .
And I did prefer Biology to any other subject , but it was was n't really until my second year as an undergraduate at Oxford that I feel I really became deeply enthusiastic about science and about Biology .
What about your faith ?
You were part of an orthodox Anglican home .
Did it impinge very much on your life ?
Not much .
I mean my parents were orthodox Anglican in the sense that they were both baptised , as was I , but they were not deeply religious , and they are not deeply religious .
We used to go to Church every Christmas , but I mean apart from that there was n't a lot of it about .
You were n't confirmed ?
I was confirmed .
That was school influence .
I was confirmed at my prep school at the age of 13 .
Because you 've written since about how much you disapprove of children being assigned the religion of their parents .
I do disapprove very strongly of labelling children , especially young children , as something like ' Catholic children ' or ' Protestant children ' or ' Islamic children ' .
That does seem to me to be very wicked because what you 're in effect doing is making the assumption that the beliefs , the cosmology , the beliefs about the world , about life , are automatically going to be inherited in a way that you do n't assume for anything else .
And you certainly do n't assume that a child will inherit his father 's sports team , or love of ornithology , or politics or economics .
Religion is the one ... of course in practice , children very often do .
You very often find that a child will in effect be influenced by a parent to take up bird watching or stamp collecting - that of course is absolutely fine .
But society simply assumes , without even asking , that there is such a thing as a Catholic 4 year old , or a Muslim 4 year old .
And that I do think is wicked .
But confirmed at 13 , read Darwin at 16 ... this was a big leap was it ?
Yes .
I did n't actually read Darwin himself .
I mean I did n't read Darwin himself until rather later .
But I read Darwinism , and understood Darwinism at 16 .
And that was a big leap for me , because by the time I reached the age of 16 , I had lost all religious faith , with the exception of possibly a sort of lingering feeling about the argument from design .
So I 'd already sort of worked out that there are lots of different religions , and they contradict each other , so they can't all be right - and that kind of thing .
But I was left with a sort of feeling ' Oh well there must be SOME sort of designer , some sort of spirit which , which designed the universe and designed life . '
And it was when I understood Darwin that I saw how totally wrong that point of view was , that rather suddenly scales fell from my eyes and I then became rather strongly anti-religious at that point .
And there was n't a sense of loss here ?
I mean you obviously had n't had a personal relationship with God , to whom you spoke in your prayers , because to lose that would 've been considerable .
Well that 's probably right .
At the age of about 13 when I was being confirmed , I did have a fairly active fantasy life about a relationship with God , and I used to pray and I used to have fantasies about creeping down to the chapel in the middle of the night , and having a sort of blinding vision and things .
I do n't know really how seriously I took that .
How seriously do you take it now ?
It was a fantasy which happened in my head and it's not surprising that it should have happened in my head , because I was at that time being filled with all that sort of stuff in confirmation classes .
A nourishing fantasy ?
I do n't think so , no .
I do n't think it was at all a nourishing fantasy .
I do n't think it did me much harm , but I do n't think it did me any good either .
Now you went to Oxford in the early ' 60s .
By the late ' 60s you were in California - and we 're talking of the decade of student tumult - the questioning of everything .
How did this wash over you ?
Well I got pretty much involved in it .
It was at the height of Vietnam war resistance and most of the students and indeed most of the faculty at the University of California at Berkley were against the war in Vietnam and there was a lot of unrest , there was a lot of demonstration and I got pretty heavily involved in all of that .
Now influences on your life then , as a young student , and ideas emerging - Nico Tinbergen ?
And someone called Bill Hamilton ...
Nico Tinbergen was my doctoral supervisor , and he was a benign , avuncular sort of influence ; everybody loved him .
Bill Hamilton was a very considerable theoretical biologist , who influenced me hugely , and the influence can be seen throughout The Selfish Gene .
The books started arriving - ' 76 was The Selfish Gene , Blind Watchmaker ' 86 , River Out of Eden and Unweaving the Rainbow , A Devil 's Chaplain .
These are wonderful titles - and these are not scientific titles .
They suggest that you are a figure with a literary interest , but also a literary sensibility running parallel or perhaps identical with your wish to be clear in the exposition of scientific ideas .
I love words .
I think some of the phrases that I 've produced as titles for books , I wo n't say that they hit me as a sort of ' That 's it ' .
I think they grew on me later .
I do n't actually think The Selfish Gene is a very good title .
I think that 's one of my worst titles .
But what is interesting about The Selfish Gene is ' selfish ' is a judgmental word .
Selfish is what you are brought up not to be .
So we 're saying that we disapprove of the gene .
The gene is behaving in a way that actually we do n't now think is a good thing .
It carries that resonance .
It certainly does .
It carries that resonance .
I 'm not sure it carries a very poetic resonance which I think The Blind Watchmaker does .
And River Out of Eden , which of course is just lifted straight from Genesis , so that 's not surprising that it 's poetic .
And Unweaving the Rainbow is lifted from Keats .
So the writer is evolving along with the scientist .
But The Extended Phenotype is not a poetic title .
No .
And in a way perhaps because you 've said it represents what you see as your greatest original contribution , you did want it to have a scientific sounding title .
Well when you introduced this line of discussion you raised the poetic side of the title , because at the same time you said maybe that went with my desire to be clear .
But you'd be surprised how many people do not actually want to be understood at all but , I regret to say , want to create some sort of an impression .
The Extended Phenotype , as you rightly say , makes no attempt to be poetic , but it does encapsulate very precisely the central message of that book in a way that would be clear to the people that it was mostly aimed at , which was my professional colleagues .
And the books for lay people of course have brought you a huge audience , and people interested in what it is you yourself believe .
Let 's go through the different concepts then that are often applied to religion , but are words often loosely used .
Purpose - the purpose of life - are you satisfied that you understand the purpose of life ?
Well ' purpose ' is a difficult word , and it 's much misunderstood .
As humans with consciousness , we have purposes which we actually visualise in our minds and we see in our mind 's eye something that we wish to achieve .
We 're looking into the future , and attempting to achieve something .
Purpose is used by biologists in a very different way , but the resemblance comes because the products of Darwinian natural selection look so stunningly as though they have been designed for a purpose .
And so something like a wing or a foot or an eye really does carry the most incredibly powerful illusion of purpose .
Since Darwin we 've understood where that illusion comes from , but it 's such a strong illusion that it 's almost impossible to resist using the language of purpose .
But where then does the concept of human purpose come from ?
There must be something within the human psyche that can conceive of a forward - looking ...
Well there clearly is , and it 's clearly a very strong part of our psyche .
And I of course as a Darwinian would see it as yet another thing that has evolved .
So just as we 've evolved sexual desire , just as we 've evolved hunger , we have also evolved a sense of purpose .
And the sense of purpose in our wild ancestors would 've been hugely useful because you can imagine a purpose of setting out on a hunt , a purpose of looking for a water hole .
Those are all very , very useful things , and the human brain was , I do n't doubt , selected by Darwinian selection to develop this sense of purpose .
Was the human brain selected to develop religion ?
I do n't know , but my guess is no .
The way I would answer that question is to say that the human brain was selected to develop something which manifests itself as religion under some circumstances .
If I take an analogy of ... well , one that I 'm particularly fond of is the tendency of moths to fly into candle flames , and it 's tempting to label that suicidal behaviour in moths , and ask what on earth is the Darwinian advantage of suicidal behaviour in moths .
If you put it like that , clearly there is n't any .
But if you say instead ' What is the Darwinian survival value of having the kind of brain which under some circumstances leads moths to fly into candle flames ? ' , then you 're getting somewhere , because then you can say ' Well in the world where moths evolved , there were n't any candle flames .
The only lights you would see if you were a night - flying moth would be things like the moon and the stars , and they are at optical infinity , which means that their rays are coming parallel .
And if you have a rule of thumb in your brain that says ' Steer a steady angle of say 30 degrees to the rays of the moon , ' that 's a very useful thing to do , because that keeps you going in a dead straight line .
That rule of thumb is then misapplied to candles , which are not at optical infinity , where the rays are radiating outwards .
And if you follow the same rule of thumb , of keeping an angle of 30 degrees to the candle 's rays , then you 'll simply spiral into the candle and burn yourself .
So we have rephrased the question .
We 've said it was the wrong question to say ' Why do moths fly into candle flames ? '.
The right question is ' Why do they have the kind of brain which in the wild state made them do something which , in the human - dominated state where there are candles , makes them fly into candle flames ? '.
Now in the case of religion , I think there was something built into the human brain by natural selection which was once useful and which now manifests itself under civilised conditions as religion , but which used not to be religion when it first arose , and when it was useful .
Well given that religion arises in most cultures , do you believe that there are benefits of solidarity , tribal unity , mutual generosity , within religions , that are useful to those communities ?
Yes there very possibly are .
I should qualify that by saying that as a Darwinian , usefulness to communities is not what it 's about .
Darwinism is all about usefulness to individuals , or rather their genes , to be more precise .
So usefulness to communities is an added benefit , and I 'm sure you can list benefits to communities that accrue from religion .
I expect you can probably list disbenefits as well .
But benefits or not , I do n't think that 's why it evolved .
I think that 's a kind of incidental bonus .
One of the things that recurs when you are spoken of , Richard , is the way that you 're regarded by the religious in our society , who see you as a bogeyman - a fundamentalist , a scientific Puritan .
You have this reputation quite widely - do you feel responsible for it ?
I do n't particularly mind being a bogeyman - I do mind being a fundamentalist .
I think a fundamentalist is somebody who believes something unshakeably , and is n't going to change their mind .
Somebody who believes something because it 's written in their holy book .
And even if all the evidence in the world points in the other direction , because it's in the holy book they 're not going to change .
I absolutely repudiate any suggestion that I am that .
I would , like any other scientist , willingly change my mind if the evidence led me to do so .
So I care about what 's true , I care about evidence , I care about evidence as the reason for knowing what is true .
It is true that I come across rather passionate sometimes - and that 's because I am passionate about the truth .
Passion is very different from fundamentalism .
You 're rather good at invective ...
Yes .
I mean if that 's true , I do n't mind it .
I do get very impatient with humbug , with cant , with fakery , with charlatans .
And so sometimes I am perhaps less polite than might be desirable .
But it comes not from fundamentalism but from a passionate belief in the power of evidence .
Let 's talk about the three letter word - God .
What is interesting is how the use of the word varies now , and that while many people have what in shorthand I might call a ' Sunday School ' version of what they believe in God , many people including scientists are using the word ' God ' in a much more abstract way .
What do you feel about those developments ?
Einstein , for example , frequently used the word ' God ' in very clearly what was not a ' Sunday School ' way .
It was somewhere between deism , the belief that some sort of intelligence started the universe going and then stepped back and did nothing else , which actually I do n't think Einstein believed in , and a sort of pantheism , where he was using the word ' God ' as just a name for the laws of nature , the laws of physics , for which he had a deep reverence , as do I .
Stephen Hawking talks about ' the mind of God ' .
Stephen Hawking ends up his famous book by saying ' Then we would know the mind of God ' and that 's precisely like Einstein .
It 's a metaphor , a personification , it 's a poetic way of expressing ' Then we should know everything , then we should understand everything . '
Stephen Hawking was looking forward to a day when physicists finally have unified all their theories and understand everything , and ' Then we should know the mind of God ' was a way of expressing that .
Stephen Hawking and Einstein : neither of them believes or believed in a personal God .
So which is the God you do n't believe in ?
I certainly do n't believe in a God who answers prayers , forgives sins , listens to misfortunes , cares about your sins , cares about your sex life , makes you survive death , performs miracles - that is most certainly a God I do n't believe in .
Einstein's God , which simply means the laws of nature which are so deeply mysterious that they inspire a feeling of reverence - I believe in that , but I would n't call it God .
What about Buddhism , mysticism , contemplation , meditation ?
I know little about Buddhism ; meditation as a kind of mental discipline to manipulate your mind in beneficial directions , I could easily imagine .
In reciting a mantra in a repetitive way - it 's entirely plausible to me that might have some sort of trance - inducing effects which could even be beneficial .
But you do n't do it ?
I have done it , and it did n't do anything for me , but I gave it a go .
But it certainly has nothing whatever to do in my mind with a belief in anything supernatural .
Let 's take another religious word - ' evil ' .
Do you have a concept of evil ?
I mistrust the uses of words like ' evil ' which suggest a kind of personification of them .
I 'm happy to use a word like ' evil ' of a particular individual .
I 'm happy to say that Adolf Hitler was evil , Adolf Hitler did evil things , but too many people once again , leap to the conclusion ' Oh there must be some kind of spirit of evil which entered into Hitler , ' or ' There 's a spirit of evil abroad ' .
That I think is unhelpful , putting it mildly .
What is the vocabulary that you use to express what you believe ?
Well I suppose it 's a scientific vocabulary .
It 's the vocabulary of the real world , but in the rather subtle way that scientists use the idea of the real world .
But where do you draw your values from , if you live in what you might call the mechanistic world of ideas and developing and potential ideas ?
Well , if by ' values ' you mean ' morals ' , that would be one question .
Another question might be ' values ' in terms of things that I think are worth striving for , things that I think are beautiful , those are all values .
Where does ' beauty ' come from ?
Well I think beauty ultimately has to come from the way the brain is set up , so the brain is a devastatingly complicated mechanism .
We 're only just beginning to understand how it works .
And our response to certain things as ' beautiful ' must be explicable ultimately in those terms .
I hesitate to say that , because some people think that that 's in some way to demean it , which of course it is n't - it absolutely is n't .
When I am moved to tears as I can be by the slow movement of a Schubert quartet , it is not in any sense to demean that experience , to say that there is nothing going on other than activity in my neurones .
Nonetheless it is one of the sublimest experiences , the experience of Art , profound Art that moves the human spirit , and again we 're talking again , and I 'm talking now , to the poet in you .
And there is a sense in which people - not you - have suggested that there is a scientific way of looking at the world , which runs parallel to say a religious way of looking at the world , or a poetic way of looking at the world , and in some way they all exist at the same time , but do n't interrelate .
What do you feel about that ?
I do n't really see how they could not interrelate .
I am very suspicious - we keep coming back to this - of uses of words like ' spirit ' , which I 'm happy to use as long as it does n't suggest anything supernatural or ghostly .
To say that something is explicable in terms of the brain , in terms of interactions between neurons , it really is vitally important to understand that that is not to reduce it .
It is actually a far more wonderful explanation than just to say ' Oh it 's the human spirit ' .
And the human spirit explains nothing , you 've said precisely nothing when you say it 's the human spirit .
So are you saying that we undervalue , we have n't yet begun to celebrate , what goes on in our head ?
Exactly .
We have n't begun to celebrate what goes on in our heads and what goes on in the world , in the universe .
These are so much grander , so much more wildly exciting than whatever you can convey by a really rather trite phrase like ' the human spirit ' , that I just find there 's no comparison .
Now you 've said that when in terms of biology and genetics of course you are a Darwinian , but in terms of politics and the world and how we live , you are an anti-Darwinian , because you do not believe in the survival of the fittest .
Well I have said that .
I believe in the survival of the fittest as an explanation for the evolution of life , but there have been people who have advocated the survival of the fittest as a kind of political creed , where they will justify a form of right - wing politics or economics on the grounds that it conforms to the laws of nature .
And that I do object to , as indeed so does any other modern Darwinian .
We do n't want to see Darwinism being used to justify things like fascism , which it has been .
So is Darwinism over now ?
Is it are , are we fighting natural selection ?
Has natural selection come to an end , because we all now use antibiotics and contraceptives and so on ?
Well , only in humans .
Humans are just a very , very small part of the panoply of life , and it is arguable that in a certain sense , humans have emancipated themselves from Darwinian selection .
But it 's not over .
Darwinism is still THE explanation for the existence of all life , including ourselves , even if just at this moment , we 're not indulging in Darwinism or at least indulging it in a rather unusual way .
No , but talk to me then about how man has put a block on Darwinism in his own evolution ?
Do you believe it 's true ?
Not sure .
I mean if it were true , the way it would come to be true is that we do n't die young any more , or it 's rather difficult to .
That means that most people who want to reproduce do .
Whereas in the past , the people who reproduced would be those who made it .
And so natural selection was a winnowing process - some survived , some did n't .
The ones that survived reproduced and passed on the genes that made them survive .
If we live in a welfare state where everybody survives , then there 's not the same sense in which genes that make you survive are the ones that get passed on .
Any old genes can get passed on , if the welfare state keeps you alive .
That would be the point of view that somebody who said that Darwinism had come to an end in humans , somebody who said that - that 's what they would say .
I 'm not sure that I 'm going to say that , but that ...
But what view do you take of it ?
Well , I think there may be more subtle processes of selection going on .
Clearly not everybody does reproduce .
Some people reproduce a lot more than others .
If there is any genetic component to the variants in reproductive success - the word ' success ' is a neutral word , a Darwinian word , it does n't mean that I approve of it - if there is , if you divide those people who have lots of children from those people who have none and then you ask the question ' Is there any statistical tendency for this lot to have a different set of genes statistically from that lot ? '
[ If so ] , then by definition , we 've got natural selection going on .
Of course it may be that that particular selection pressure is so short lived in historical time , that it does n't lead to any interesting evolution - that 's what I believe .
I mean there could be a selection going on for example , in favour of incompetence in using contraceptives .
If there is a genetic component to incompetence in using contraceptives , then for sure there 'll be a slight Darwinian selection pressure in favour of it .
I do n't really believe that , but that gives you the idea of the kind of thing that might be going on .
As the observance of religion in our particular country has declined , we 've seen the rise of perhaps what ( laughing ) you might call more irrational beliefs .
I mean I 'm talking about astrology and crystal gazing and things of that kind .
It seems perhaps from that , to argue the need for religion , that there is never a vacuum in human ideas , that focus around religious notions .
Yes , that 's an interesting point .
My prejudice is that those things are even worse than religion .
As for whether you 're right that they signify a vacuum that needs to be filled , I 'm not sure about that .
I suppose the human mind is complicated , it has all sorts of desires and things that satisfy it .
If there are people who seem to need either religion or astrology and crystal gazing to satisfy them , I would like to have a go at giving them an alternative , and just to see whether perhaps it might work better as a satisfying agent .
And that would be understanding of the real world , and understanding of why you exist , where you come from , what the world is , what it 's all about .
I think that is such a satisfying thing to have in your head , that I find it very hard to believe that anybody would prefer astrology , crystal gazing , or religion .
And so my suspicion is perhaps there is a vacuum that needs to be filled , and it may be that scientific rationalism just has n't got its act together enough to fill that vacuum , and if it did , it would fill it .
Now you have a position in the humanist society , and we 're talking at a time when humanism is coming on the curriculum of schools .
Has humanism got it within its vocabulary and its concepts , its narrative , to persuade people ?
I 'm not sure .
Humanism means different things to different people .
What is proposed for the national curriculum is I think not just humanism but also atheism was mentioned , and people wondered about how you can teach a negative .
I do n't have a problem , and I think that a non-theistic understanding of the universe and of life , that 's not a religion , but it could very well be taught alongside other religions - which I 'm sure will go on being taught - as something deeply satisfying .
As something that children will warm to when they will say to themselves ' Ah yes , I understand why I exist , I understand why the world exists . '
What a wonderful place to be in , where you can actually understand why you exist .
I would like to see that kind of thing on the syllabus of what is now called RE .
While browsing through motherboards at Computex , several manufacturers were quick to tell us some details about the recently released dual - core Phenom II CPUs from AMD .
Two motherboard makers told us at the show that AMD 's new processors are safe when unlocking disabled cores .
In fact , one motherboard maker even told us that when you unlock the disabled cores , they run at slower frequencies than the normal cores .
This is of course all incorrect , and it is indeed not a safe guarantee when you unlock the disabled cores .
The reason for this is that the disabled cores are turned off for a reason : they failed factory tests .
Cores can fail for any number of reasons , including defects in the silicon , problems running at full frequency , or a bug introduced during manufacturing .
Both AMD and Intel disable CPU cores for this very reason .
When you unlock the disabled cores , they will run at full processor frequency , since you can not run each core at different speeds .
While you may see initial gains and benefits from turning a dual - core CPU into a quad - core CPU , you may introduce instability into your system .
Things may corrupt , calculate incorrectly or even crash .
Despite what we were told , we still recommend that if you 're going to unlock disabled cores , do so with caution in mind -- there is always a risk that something will go wrong .
A major release of an operating system typically brings significant changes that require users to learn new skills .
But backers of the open source FreeBSD 8 operating system say that 's not necessarily going to be the case with its next major version .
FreeBSD 8 is currently in its beta release cycle with a final release targeted for August .
The new release will be the first major release since FreeBSD 7 in February 2008 , with the most recent point update being the 7.2 release in May of this year .
While the jump to 8.0 might seem a big step , FreeBSD contributor and Absolute FreeBSD author pointed out that most users have little to worry about .
" FreeBSD has a two - tier development process , " Lucas told InternetNews.com .
" This two - tear method lets our users be very conservative , using only well - tested and widely deployed code , while we can further improve the code and add new features . "
" The newest version of FreeBSD , including the changes that were made just minutes ago , is called FreeBSD - current , " he explained .
" Any new features go into FreeBSD - current for community testing and further development .
Every so often , we cut a major release from FreeBSD - current .
This is a .0 release , such as 8.0 . "
Lucas added that once 8.0 is released , FreeBSD - current will continue receiving new features and further development .
Once those features are tested and debugged , they might be backported to FreeBSD 8 .
As a result , the latest FreeBSD 7.2 release is based on an older version of FreeBSD - current , but includes bugfixes and additional features that have been tested on the development version of FreeBSD .
Another longstanding focus of FreeBSD is on simplifying the technical task of migrating to new releases .
Matt Olander , CTO at enterprise hardware systems vendor iXsystems , told InternetNews.com that his firm will be working to help his customers migrate from older versions of the OS to the new release when it 's out .
But Olander , who also serves on the FreeBSD Project 's marketing and public relations teams , described FreeBSD as " notoriously famous " for its easy migration across versions , with successful migrations to FreeBSD 7.x from far older editions like 4.x .
That makes it easy to recommend to customers , he added .
" We will install whatever platform the customer chooses , although we 're certainly partial to BSDs and FreeBSD in particular , " Olander said .
" Usually my first question , if I 'm brought into discussions for an opportunity and the customer is using another operating system , is ' Have you tried that on FreeBSD ? ' "
What 's new in FreeBSD 8
FreeBSD is one of the earliest open source operating system projects and is a direct descendant of the original , open source BSD work performed at the University of California , Berkeley .
According to Lucas , the FreeBSD Project is driven largely by volunteers with very few actually working as paid developers on the effort .
" While the FreeBSD team has excellent communication skills , many of our people have lives and careers outside of FreeBSD , " Lucas said .
That certainly has n't stunted the new capabilities baked into FreeBSD 8 , however , with the OS -- often thought of as primarily a server - based operating system -- offering big improvements that may benefit desktop users , too .
" FreeBSD 8.0 includes many new features and abilities over the 7.x series , " Kris Moore , founder of the PC - BSD project , told InternetNews.com .
" On the desktop side of things , probably the most important feature will be the new USB stack , which greatly improves support for USB devices , and fixes lots of long - standing bugs .
Improvements to drivers [ and ] speed improvements are also in the works . "
PC - BSD is a desktop derivative of FreeBSD that is currently owned by iXsystems .
" So far , we 've seen some major improvements from the newer FreeBSD base , such as the USB fixes , greatly improved Wi -Fi support , and a significant desktop responsiveness improvement , " Moore said , adding that work on PC - BSD version 8 , which will based on FreeBSD 8 , has just begun .
Despite the improvements in FreeBSD 8 , the project 's supporters reaffirmed that the idea is to keep disruption to a minimum .
" The FreeBSD team works hard to minimize user surprises , " Lucas said , adding that the fact makes his book still relevant , despite having been first published in 2002 .
" Absolute FreeBSD 's usefulness will decrease over time , as with any tech book , but I expect it to be useful for a few years yet . "
David Beckham has opened the door to a possible Premier League return , saying that Manchester United are no longer the only English club he would consider playing for .
Beckham is currently two seasons into a five - year contract with the Major League Soccer side LA Galaxy , but after spending the last off - season on loan with Milan he is likely to return to Europe on a similar deal in January .
" Never say never .
I would definitely consider it , " said Beckham when asked if he would consider playing for another Premier League side .
" When I left my heart was in Manchester – I could n't see myself playing against United .
Now I would n't rule it out . "
Potential clubs include Chelsea , whose manager Carlo Ancelotti was impressed by Beckham 's work ethic at Milan last season , or Tottenham , whose own manager Harry Redknapp has stated on a number of occasions that he would like to sign the midfielder .
Beckham also trained with Arsenal in 2008 , but a return to Milan remains the most likely outcome .
" Obviously Milan expressed that they want me to go back , so I do n't see any reason why that would change , " said Beckham .
" We 'll have to wait and see .
I hope to be going back there . "
Beckham , who has now made peace with his LA Galaxy team - mate Landon Donovan after the striker accused him of not showing enough commitment to playing in the MLS , also insisted that he still plans to see out his contract in Los Angeles .
" I intend to stay until the end of my contract and maybe further , " he said .
" I 've always said that .
I 've always said , even when I went to Milan , that I 'm committed to the Galaxy and to MLS , and that has n't changed . "

Well you ’re going to find out what it ’s like anyway , because some guy named Radix deemed it so .
He has released a version of the game in demo form that lets you walk through a dungeon attacking various enemies from the original game in first person glory .
While there are some kinks , it ’s still only a demo , and it is a pretty cool demo at that .

During the latest US Department of State Town Hall Meeting , secretary Hilary Clinton was asked to let the staff use Firefox .
You can see it in the video below at 26:30 .
Full Transcript of the meeting .
According to Under Secretary Pat Kennedy , the concern cost , not of the software ( which of course is free ) but the cost of deploying , training , and supporting a new piece of software in a world wide operation .
Jim Finkle , the employee who raised the question also mentioned that the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency has already done it .
It ’s not news that Firefox has a long way to go before being more attractive for large IT deployments .
Mozilla has been continuously asked for MSI packages in the past and while it has been targeted for some releases ( Firefox 2 or 3 , if I recall correctly ) , no one has stepped in to take care of this limitation .
Mozilla contributor , Michael Kaply was one of the few people who put some great effort on making Firefox better suited for corporate environments , organizing a Firefox in the enterprise group , and even producing and still maintaining CCK Wizard , a Firefox extension that helps produce another extension with a number of important customizations to ease corporate deployment .
After five major Firefox release , more than a fun fact , this should be a call to finally prioritize the business side of the web .

I received the following press release on June 3 ( forwarded to me by Douglas Rushkoff ) .
I honored the embargo date of July 9 .
Prof Wolpert bets that the following will happen .
Dr Sheldrake bets it will not :
By May 1 , 2029 , given the genome of a fertilized egg of an animal or plant , we will be able to predict in at least one case all the details of the organism that develops from it , including any abnormalities .
The wager will be decided on May 1 , 2029 , and if the outcome is not obvious , the Royal Society , the world 's most venerable scientific organization , will be asked to adjudicate .
The winner will receive a case of fine port , Quinta do Vesuvio , 2005 , which should have reached perfect maturity by 2029 and is being stored in the cellars of The Wine Society .
In the spirit of famous scientific wagers by notable scientists , such as Stephen Hawking and Richard Feynman , two leading biologists , Professor Lewis Wolpert and Dr Rupert Sheldrake , have set up a wager on the predictive value of the genome .
Prof Wolpert and Dr Sheldrake agree that at present , given the genome of an egg , no one can predict the way an embryo will develop .
The wager arose from a debate on the nature of life between Wolpert and Sheldrake at the 2009 Cambridge University Science Festival .
Prof Wolpert believes that all biological phenomena can in principle be explained in terms of DNA , proteins and other molecules , together with their interactions .
He is convinced that it is only a matter of time before all the details of an organism can be predicted on the basis of the genome .
Dr Sheldrake believes that the predictive value of genes is grossly over - rated .
Genes enable organisms make proteins , but they do not contain programs or blueprints .
Instead , he thinks that the development of organisms depends on organizing fields called morphogenetic fields , which are not inherited through the genes .
Famous scientific wagers in the past include Richard Feynman 's bet of $ 1000 that no - one could construct a motor no bigger than 1/64 of an inch on a side .
He lost .
Stephen Hawking bet fellow cosmologist Kip Thorne that Cygnus X - 1 would turn out not to be a black hole ( Hawking lost ) .
And in 1980 biologist Paul Erlich bet economist Julian Simon that the price of five mineral commodities would rise over the next ten years .
In fact they fell .
The wager will be reported in full in The New Scientist on 9 July where there will also be articles stating their cases by both Prof Wolpert and Dr Sheldrake .
Lewis Wolpert 's book How We Live and Why We Die : The Secret Lives of Cells is published by Faber and Faber and the new edition of Rupert Sheldrake 's A New Science of Life is published by Icon Books .
Obama 's Tortured Stance on Torture Editor ’s Note : President Barack Obama is seeking a middle ground on torture – ordering the practice stopped and releasing the secret documents that sought to justify the abuse of prisoners , while signaling that no prosecutions should follow and that the country should look to the future , not the past .
Ironically , Obama ’s forgiveness toward the Bush administration is n’t winning Obama any thanks from Republicans who continue to defend torture and denounce Obama for endangering the nation .
In this guest essay , the Independent Institute ’s Ivan Eland urges Obama to just do the right thing and demand accountability from the guilty : Although Barack Obama should be applauded for stopping torture by the U.S. government and pledging to close the infamous Guantanamo and worldwide CIA secret prisons , he is nevertheless playing politics with the issue to get the best of both worlds .

To poke his predecessor , Obama released graphic memos from the Bush Justice Department that appallingly justified simulated drowning , sleep deprivation for extended periods ( for example , an unbelievable 11 days ) , cramped confinement in a small dark box , stress positions for extended periods , forced nudity , and physical violence against detainees .
At the same time , so as not to excessively rile the Republicans , who he must still work with to pass legislation , Obama said that CIA personnel who followed the twisted Bush legal guidelines authorizing such torture would not be prosecuted .
He also came out against further inquiry into the matter because “ nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . ”
What a relief that we do not follow the same philosophy when murders or other illegal acts occur .
And many of these harsh interrogation techniques are illegal under international conventions signed by the United States , which prohibit “ cruel , inhumane or degrading ” treatment .
Furthermore , waterboarding is clearly illegal under U.S. law , and Japanese interrogators were prosecuted during post - World War II war crimes trials for doing it and other techniques mentioned in the memos .
Leon Panetta , Obama ’s CIA chief , argued that even releasing the memos would divulge intelligence methods .
Yet Obama said that such harsh techniques would never be used again .
So what ’s the problem ?
Obama ’s intelligence chief , Admiral Dennis Blair , argued that CIA officials were desperately trying to prevent another attack in the dark days after 9/11 and should not be prosecuted now that the sun is shining .
The road to hell is paved with good intentions .
Of course , Blair is implicitly assuming that torture is effective in getting good information out of prisoners , which most seasoned FBI and military interrogators say it is n’t .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the planner of the 9/11 attacks , apparently gave the CIA bad information when he was tortured , most likely just to stop the pain .
Even the Justice Department memos describing the harsh techniques admitted that it was difficult to distinguish a prisoner who was holding back information from one who had no information to give .
Also , many in the U.S. military are not fond of torture , because other countries can use it as an excuse to torture U.S. prisoners .
Furthermore , if the United States has a reputation for torturing prisoners , enemy soldiers have an incentive to fight to the death rather than surrender , thus resulting in more deaths among U.S. military personnel .
Besides many experienced interrogators feel that mom ’s advice is best : you get more with sugar than vinegar .
CIA officials who engaged in torture should be prosecuted .
After World War II , the United States did n’t allow lower level Nazis and Japanese to avoid prosecution for war crimes by using the “ just following orders ” defense .
Why should CIA officers be any different ?
They knew these acts were illegal under U.S. law and international conventions when they perpetrated them .
But torture during the Bush administration was worse than that committed during the Spanish - American and Vietnam Wars for one reason : the authorization came from on high .
So the nation needs to know how far up the line the order was given to perpetrate the war crimes .
Baltasar Garzon , the assertive investigating judge in Spain who ordered the arrest of former Chilean strongman Augusto Pinochet , is apparently deciding whether to bring charges against six high Bush administration officials for authorizing torture , including David Addington , former Vice President Dick Cheney ’s chief of staff ; Alberto Gonzalez , Bush ’s Attorney General ; John Yoo , a Justice Department lawyer who wrote the memos justifying torture , and Douglas Feith , Bush ’s undersecretary of defense for policy .
Curiously , Spain could claim jurisdiction for the prosecution because it is a signatory to the United Nations Convention Against Torture , and some former Guantanamo prisoners claiming that they were tortured are Spanish citizens or residents .
But why stop there ?
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld clearly knew about the torture , and it recently came out that President George W. Bush himself was aware of it .
So they condoned illegal acts .
It is true that as we go up the chain of command , it gets politically harder to prosecute former officials .
Even though many Nixon administration officials went to jail for their illegal acts during Watergate , President Richard Nixon was unconstitutionally pardoned before even being charged with a crime .
President Gerald Ford , Nixon ’s successor , claimed that he was doing so to spare the nation the continued trauma of a long presidential trial .
Then as now , great crimes were perpetrated and covered up in the name of “ protecting America . ”
As the rock band AC / DC sings , “ It ai n’t easy livin ’ free . ”
In a republic , the rule of law — the principle that the laws apply to everyone — may well be the most important thing .
If we do n’t want illegal acts at any level of government to be repeated , they must be exposed , thoroughly investigated , and prosecuted — no matter who is implicated and how painful it is for the country .
Yet President Obama , for political reasons , is not only shielding high - level Bush administration officials from investigation and prosecution but even low - level CIA interrogators .
Simply “ moving on ” will not deter future U.S. officials from going back to torture when the political winds permit it .

Harry Browne , the former Libertarian Party candidate for president , used to say : � the government is great at breaking your leg , handing you a crutch , and saying � You see , without me you could n't walk . '�
That maxim is clearly illustrated by the financial industry regulatory reforms proposed this week by the Obama Administration .
In seeking to undo the damage inflicted over the past decade by misguided government policies , the new regulatory regime would ensure that the problems underlying our financial system will only get worse .
As was the case with the deeply flawed Sarbanes - Oxley legislation of 2002 , or the misguided provisions of the Patriot Act of 2001 , such as the torturous anti-money laundering requirements , the move will further burden the financial services industry with unnecessary regulation that will drive up costs , lower quality , and shelter the biggest and least innovative companies .
Ultimately , the structure will put the entire U.S. financial industry at a global competitive disadvantage .
The underlying problem is that the excessive risk taking which brought about the crisis was not market - driven , but a direct consequence of government interference with risk - inhibiting market forces .
Rather than learning from its mistakes and allowing market forces to once again control risks and efficiently allocate resources , the government is merely repeating its mistakes on a grander scale � thereby sowing the seeds for an even greater crisis in the future .
As is typical of government attempts to control economic outcomes , Obama 's plans focuses on the symptoms of the disease and not the cause .
The American financial system imploded for two reasons : cheap money and moral hazard � both of which were supplied by the government .
Under the proposed new regulatory structures , these toxic ingredients will be combined in ever - increasing quantities .
The proposals most notably involve extra regulatory oversight of financial entities that the government deems �too big to fail . �
This implies that it is desirable to have such entities in the first place , and that the government will continue to back those large organizations that fall under its protection .
These �too big to fail� firms will enjoy a competitive advantage over smaller firms in attracting capital , as lenders will perceive zero risk in extending them credit .
This will cause these firms to grow even larger , producing even greater systemic risks and larger losses when the next round of bailouts arrives .
Meanwhile , smaller firms which seek to expand , and which propose no systemic risks , will face greater challenges as higher capital costs render them less competitive .
If the government did not provide these bailouts or guarantees , then the market itself would ensure organizations did not grow beyond their ability to attract capital .
It is only when market discipline is overcome by government guarantees that systemic risks arise .
Obama proposes to entrust the critical job of �systemic risk regulator� to the Federal Reserve , the very organization that has proven most adept at creating systemic risk .
This is like making Keith Richards the head of the DEA .
Given the Federal Reserve 's disastrous monetary policy over the past decade , any attempt to expand the Fed 's role should be vigorously opposed .
Through decades of short - sighted interest rate decisions , the Fed has proven time and again that it is only able to close the barn door after the entire herd has escaped .
If setting interest rates had been left to the free market , none of the excesses we have seen in the credit market would have been remotely possible .
The perverse result will be that our government and the Fed gain more power as a direct result of their own incompetence .
Such was also the case with Freddie and Fannie , which should have been allowed to fail , but were nationalized instead , leaving them in a position to do even more damage .
The new round of regulations ignores them completely .
Along those lines , ratings agencies such as Standard and Poor 's and Moody 's that completely missed the mark were also spared .
Perhaps this special treatment is a way of ensuring that Treasury debt maintains its bogus AAA rating .
Unfortunately , despite their intent , my guess is that the new regulations will most severely impact smaller firms , like my own , that never engaged in reckless behavior .
This will further reward those �too big to fail� firms , whose economies of scale and cozy relationships with regulators leave them better positioned than their smaller rivals to absorb the costs of the added red tape .
With the transition now fully under way , I propose we end the pretense and rename our country : � The United Socialist States of America . �
In fact , given all the czars already in Washington , we might as well go with the Russian theme completely : appoint a Politburo , move into dilapidated housing blocks , and parade our missiles in the streets .
On the bright side , there 's always the borscht .

There ’s a lot at stake with global warming
Our planet ’s climate is anything but simple .
All kinds of factors influence it , from massive events on the Sun to the growth of microscopic creatures in the oceans , and there are subtle interactions between many of these factors .
Yet despite all the complexities , a firm and ever - growing body of evidence points to a clear picture : the world is warming , this warming is due to human activity increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , and if emissions continue unabated the warming will too , with increasingly serious consequences .
Yes , there are still big uncertainties in some predictions , but these swing both ways .
For example , the response of clouds could slow the warming or speed it up .

With so much at stake , it is right that climate science is subjected to the most intense scrutiny .
What does not help is for the real issues to be muddied by discredited arguments or wild theories .
So for those who are not sure what to believe , here is our round - up of the most common climate myths and misconceptions .
There is a guide to assessing the evidence , and the articles we ’ve included contain lots of links to primary research and major reports for those who want to follow through to the original sources .
What is happening now ?
New :
Any cooling disproves global warming
Global warming stopped in 1998
Antarctica is getting cooler , not warmer , disproving global warming
Polar bear numbers are increasing
The lower atmosphere is cooling , not warming
The oceans are cooling
Mars and Pluto are warming too
Does CO2 cause warming ?
Human CO 2 emissions are too tiny to matter
CO 2 is n’t the most important greenhouse gas
Ice cores show CO 2 increases lag behind temperature rises , disproving the link to global warming
Ice cores show CO 2 rising as temperatures fell
The cooling after 1940 shows CO 2 does not cause warming
Why should I worry ?
It ’s too cold where I live – warming will be great
We ca n’t do anything about climate change
Is the sun to blame ?
Global warming is down to the Sun , not humans
It ’s all down to cosmic rays
What happened in the past ?
The ‘ hockey stick ’ graph has been proven wrong
It ’s been far warmer in the past , what ’s the big deal ?
It was warmer during the Medieval period , with vineyards in England
We are simply recovering from the Little Ice Age
What is going to happen ?
Warming will cause an ice age in Europe
Higher CO 2 levels will boost plant growth and food production
Hurricane Katrina was caused by global warming
Can we trust the science ?
Chaotic systems are not predictable
We ca n’t trust computer models of climate
Many leading scientists question climate change
It ’s all a conspiracy
New :
The leaked emails prove it ’s a conspiracy
They predicted global cooling in the 1970s
ソフトウェア工学の祖の一人である、トム・デマルコが、最近IEEE
Software 誌に、過去のソフトウェア・メトリクス賛美を悔い改める記事を書いている。
「ソフトウェア工学」というコンセプト－その時が来た、そして、その時は去った。http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/computingnow/0709/whatsnew/software-r
1982年に、デマルコは有名な「計測できないものは制御できない」という一文から始まる、『品質と生産性を重視したソフトウェア開発プロジェクト技法』という名著を書いている。このドグマは、ソフトウェア工学の考え方に強く根ざしている。むしろ、すべての「工学」という活動は、科学や経験から得た知見を使って自然現象をコントロールし、人間の役に立てることをその定義としており、そこでは測定を元にしたコントロールという概念はその中核にあるものだ。だから、「計測による制御」という概念を疑うことは、「ソフトウェア工学」というものの存在、あるいは、意味を大きく問う問題でもある。
では、計測しないで制御する、という方法があるというのだろうか？
この記事のなかで、例えば 、GoogleEarch や Wikipedia といったソフトウェアが、果たして計測と制御という管理で作られただろうか、と問うている。そして、２つの種類のプロジェクトを例にし、
Project A : 100 万 ドルのコストを使って 110 万ドルの価値を作る 。
Project B : 100 万 ドルのコストを使って 5,000 万ドル以上の価値を作る 。
「 計測と制御 」 は 、Project A の世界では有効だが 、Project B の世界ではほとんど意味をなさない、と指摘している。これは、
ソフトウェア開発という活動には「計測と制御」よりもっと大切なことが多く含まれており、その中では、「工学」の概念は「ポイントを外している」
ということだ 。
デマルコは、冒頭に上げた本を書いた自分を「若かったころ」という言い方をして、メトリクス賛美を実際に悔いているように思われる。
ちょっと衝撃的な記事だが、実際には、「ソフトウェア工学は誤りだった」、というよりも、「ポイントを外しつつある」というのが正しい。ソフトウェア開発にもっとも大切なのは、そこには無かったのだ。現実のソフトウェア開発は、「計測と制御」で語れる部分の「外側」に徐々にフォーカスを移動しつつある。
デマルコの最後の結論の部分を引用する。
Software development is and always will be somewhat experimental .
The actual software construction is n’t necessarily experimental , but its conception
is .
And this is where our focus ought to be .
It ’s where our focus always ought
to have been .
ソフトウェア開発は、いつも、ある種「実験的」である。現実のソフトウェア構築は必ずしも実験ではないが、概念的にはその要素を含む。そして、それこそ我々が焦点をあてるべきところであり、ずっと焦点をあてるべきところであったのだ。
Police have confirmed that a body found at Brunswick Heads in far northern New South Wales on Saturday is that of missing Irish tourist Niall McDonough .
The 30 - year - old man was last seen by his girlfriend on Friday night when he left a Byron Bay youth hostel to go for a walk .
The death is not being treated as suspicious .
Here is the text accompanying the photo at the White House Flickr site :
President Barack Obama bends over so the son of a White House staff member can pat his head during a family visit to the Oval Office May 8 , 2009 .
The youngster wanted to see if the President 's haircut felt like his own .

Think about it .
The youngster wanted to see if the President 's haircut felt like his own .
The humility of our President .
His accessibility to a somewhat ordinary person , a child , who does n't know that one does not ask the President of the United States something like that .
For all of our complaints about policy and actions , the various criticisms we offer - and in many cases we must so criticize - still , it is helpful to have a more complete picture .
Barack Obama is still a caring person .
To me this picture says a lot .
I simply wanted to be sure y'all had a chance to see it .
Peace .
Musicologists have said that Jimmy Page played on 25 - to - 50 % of all popular music recordings made in England in the 1960s .
Even the lower figure in that range seems astonishing but , no matter the actual number , something of young Jimmy Page ’s passion and abilities is revealed in such a statement .
His session guitar work saw him perform on recordings by The Who , The Rolling Stones , Van Morrison & Them and Petula Clark , among many , many others while playing fifteen sessions a week .
He is purported to be responsible , together with Alan Holdsworth , for the wonderful , psychedelic soloing on Donovan ’s “ Hurdy Gurdy Man ” .
We say purported because it is not documented and Donovan has attributed the guitar work to Page and Holdsworth at times and to Alan Parker at others .
Nobody seems to know for sure .
Playing on a TV show at the age of 13 , in 1957 , when asked about his future he expressed a desire to become a biologist and cure cancer .
While touring with a band called The Crusaders , in the early ‘ 60s , Jimmy contracted mononucleosis , following which he abandoned music to enroll in art college .
Thank heavens for us rock fans he returned to music a couple years later .
A living legend and rock guitar god , Page played briefly in The Yardbirds , the eclectic and innovative ‘ 60s British rock group that was also a stepping - stone for Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton .
Led Zepplin
All three of these guitarists are in the top 5 of Rolling Stone magazine ’s “ 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time ” list .
Wanting to create a new and heavy blues - based rock sound , Jimmy Page founded Led Zeppelin and the rest , as they say , is history .
Inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame twice , for his work with both Led Zeppelin and The Yardbirds , Jimmy Page is also an Officer of the Order of the British Empire as well as an honorary citizen of Rio de Janeiro , an honor bestowed upon him for his charity work on behalf of the children of Brasil .
His influence is immeasurable and has been cited by such guitar luminaries as Steve Vai , Zakk Wylde , Eddie Van Halen and Alex Lifeson .
Personal Possessions
Jimmy ’s guitar collection , housed in a small , climate - controlled warehouse , is – according to Jimmy – out of control and includes his first Gibson Les Paul , which he bought from Joe Walsh , as well as guitars previously owned by Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran .
Truly one of the guitar gods , Jimmy continues to inspire guitarists both new and seasoned , and will likely influence musicians , bands and songwriters for generations to come .
Jimmy Page and Robert Plant The Rain Song
He has been barred do to a a character problem - he has n't paid on his 400,000 in student loan debt .
Much of it accumulated in late fees and interest tacked through the years .
The holder of his loans is Sallie Mae .
For those of you who have not been in this situation , if you are unable to pay your loans due to illness , there is no classification for this .
You can get a financial hardship forbearance for a time , but it will run out and your interest will be capitalized .
If you have a long term illness there is no bankruptcy option , that loan will likely remain with you until you die .
There just last year was a new program started that will let workers in public service have their loans forgiven in 10 years , as long as payments are made continually .
The rest of us have that option in 25 or so .
The government also has a new income adjusted payment plan that does n't eat you alive in interest if you transfer your loans to them and can make the payments .
It is the first of it 's kind - ever .
Student loans can be used as an excuse to garnish wages , take money from tax returns , even come out of your retirement .
No forgiveness or bankruptcy option on them .
This is the first plan that I have ever heard of .
I graduated in 1992 myself with 16,000 in debt , under Sallie Mae .
Unable to find more than minimum wage work immediately , and facing illnesses myself , that amount is now almost 40,000 , despite my meager attempts at payment over the years .
Now here is this man who has gotten through law school and they are preventing him from doing the very thing that could allow him to move forward and clear these debts ?
This is outrageous .
Here is what they said :
But a group of five state appellate judges decided this spring that his student loans were too big and his efforts to repay them too meager for him to be a lawyer .
“ Applicant has not made any substantial payments on the loans , ” the judges wrote in a terse decision and an unusual rejection of the committee ’s recommendation .
“ Applicant has not presently established the character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and counselor - at - law . ”

Sarah Palin wades into the debate on cap and trade , or as she prefers to call it , cap and tax , today in the Washington Post 's editorial pages .
Predictably she does n't like it , but it does n't appear as though she understands the issue at hand .
There is no denying that as the world becomes more industrialized , we need to reform our energy policy and become less dependent on foreign energy sources .
But the answer does n't lie in making energy scarcer and more expensive !
Those who understand the issue know we can meet our energy needs and environmental challenges without destroying America 's economy .
Cap and trade is n't about " foreign energy sources . "
It 's about staving off global warming .
At no point does Palin mention CO2 emissions , rising global temperatures or anything that 's at the core of the legislation .
Instead she prefers to talk about the " mountains of oil " we sit on and our " abundant " coal and " the resources that God created right underfoot on American soil . "
No mention of the resources God provides above us , like solar , or God blows on us , like wind .
And , incidentally , where are these mountains of oil ?
The Rockies ?
Good luck pulling it .
She just uses the usual talking points about jobs being lost , and electric bills rising .
It 's a possibility those things will happen , just as it's a possibility that continued CO2 emissions will lead to catastrophic climate change .
The question she needs to answer is which is worse .
Sixty years ago today George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty - Four was published , and this evening , as though to mark the anniversary of Orwell 's last book , the former head of GCHQ , Sir David Pepper , slips from the shadows to tell the BBC's Who 's Watching
You programme that it has become necessary for the government to record all data from phone and internet traffic in the fight against terror .
Pepper , who was , incidentally , born as Orwell struggled over his manuscript in the winter of 1948 – the year the author reversed for his title – makes a case for the total surveillance of society in order to catch the increasingly sophisticated targets .
" There are plenty of people who will do all they can to make themselves difficult to find , " he says .
" The thing you worry about most is the attack that you have n't seen coming . "
The unknown enemy is cast , very much like the ill - defined threat presented to Oceania in Nineteen Eighty - Four , as a pervasive , cunning and unseen foe that requires total watchfulness and , it follows , the sacrifice of the essential right of privacy .
In the programme , Pepper explains the challenges that face his former colleagues at GCHQ with a diagram that shows how information is carried in discreet packets across the internet , a development which he implies must be met by granting the agency total access to all our communications .
You can see GCHQ 's problem , but we should not take the word of a securicrat with a narrow view of how a free society works to be the only voice in this debate .
For like his successor Iain Lobban , Pepper 's solution to the problem of tracking terrorist communications is mass surveillance , which , if allowed , would give the government enormous powers and would very likely become subject to the law of function creep , as all these measure are .
( Last week I reported on how the police national DNA database set up to solve crime was now being used in Camden as a " crime prevention " measure ) .
A Home Office memo leaked during the period when the former home secretary , Jacqui Smith , was swooning over GCHQ 's megalomaniac plans held them to be " impractical , disproportionate , politically unattractive and possibly unlawful " .
The plans have since been modified so that data collection would be outsourced to internet service providers , who are , by the way , none too happy about it , but the key measure of mass surveillance remains and so does the truth of that characterisation by an anonymous official .
A brief moment considering the morals and competence of so many of our leaders must be enough to persuade us that to give such power away would be extreme folly , but that does not stop people like Pepper lobbying for that power in prime time with all his dry , technocratic plausibility .
Those who think of Nineteen Eighty - Four as a prediction are in error .
It is , as the late Ben Pimlott pointed out , an account of the forces that endanger liberty , most of which can be summed up in the single word : lies .
Orwell , writes Pimlott , " offers a political choice between the protections of truth and the slide into expedient falsehood for the benefit of rulers and the exploitation of the ruled .
Thus the novel is above all subversive , a protest against the tricks played by government .
It is a volley against the authoritarian in every personality , a polemic against every orthodoxy , an anarchistic blast against every unquestioning conformist . "
A good thought to remember on the anniversary of Orwell 's greatest and grimmest book , as we watch Pepper arguing for all that Orwell feared and all that we should resist .
Stanford graduate students Drew Hall , left , and Richard Gaster won two awards for their NanoLab diagnostic tool .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
An award - winning invention by Stanford doctoral students Richard Gaster and Drew Hall may change who diagnoses diseases ranging from flu to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus .
The invention , called the NanoLab , is a miniature , portable bioassay that can identify several disease proteins simultaneously without doctors , technicians or special lab equipment .
With this technology , the inventors hope that individuals can literally take health care into their own hands .
“ We built a technology that can be dispensed anywhere , ’’ said Gaster , an M.D. and Ph.D. candidate in bioengineering .
“ It ’s affordable , easy to use , and does n’t require a laboratory to wash anything ; it ’s all self contained . ”
Hall and Gaster entered a preliminary version of the NanoLab , originally coined “ Lab - on - a - Stick , ” in the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance Biomedical Engineering Idea competition as a tool to use in airports to reduce the spread of pandemics .
They took first place , and at a ceremony in New York on June 10 , they received a $ 10,000 prize and a large trophy to display in the Stanford Department of Bioengineering .
Further innovations on the NanoLab won first prize in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ( IEEE ) international Change the World Competition as a diagnostic tool for developing countries that are short on doctors and equipment .
Gaster and Hall received certificates , another $ 10,000 , and planets named after them at a ceremony in Los Angeles on June 25 .
The past , present and future IEEE presidents who chose the finalists were challenged to judge diverse inventions ranging from electronic games that aid disabled children to a human - powered grain crusher .
“ It was like comparing apples and oranges … but we eventually agreed that the NanoLab was No. 1 , ” said IEEE President John Vig .
“ The NanoLab is useful not only in third - world countries , and not only in poor countries , but in every country , even in the United States , ” he said .
Planning the NanoLab
Hall and Gaster found out about the IEEE competition much later than many of their 200 competitors .
They finished the project in 10 or 12 weeks while other teams of up to 20 members had worked for several months .
“ It was a highly accelerated timeline , ” said Hall , a Ph.D. candidate in electrical engineering .
“ We were trying to find the one sexier , killer application that would make this … something that was above and beyond , ” he said .
“ This was something we did on the weekends , spare time , and nights - squeezed in . ”
The effort included planning , hard work and a bit of luck .
“ We planned in two cycles with basically one round worth of errors , ” Gaster explained .
“ The first cycle failed on multiple fronts , ” he said laughing .
“ But we figured out all the problems , and the second cycle miraculously worked . ”
How it works
The NanoLab , which is the size of a small paperback book , consists of an electronic circuit board and a tiny well , just big enough to hold a few drops of blood from a pipette .
The first step is to add a droplet of a sample such as blood , saliva or urine into the well .
The tester then adds magnetic tags to label the viral proteins , making them detectable by nanosensors .
Each tiny magnetic sensor is similar to the read head in a computer hard drive that detects ones and zeros , Gaster said .
The NanoLab uses the same technology to sense biological data .
The final ingredient is a protein solution containing disease antibodies .
The tester hits start and , 10 to 15 minutes later , tiny green , orange and red light bulbs illuminate , indicating which disease proteins were detected - and at what level .
The availability of antibodies , the proteins that our immune system uses to identify and fight viruses , is the only limit to the diagnostic tool .
Novelties of the NanoLab
Part of making the NanoLab “ nano ” was miniaturizing a 250 - pound electromagnet and a desktop computer from a normal - sized lab into tiny wires that fit in the palm of your hand .
Hall built these electrical features and Gaster handled the medical technology .
“ It ’s a really interdisciplinary project that requires knowledge of medicine , chemistry , biology , electrical engineering and materials science , ” Hall said .
“ I think that Rich and I complement each other pretty well .
We each have different specialties and we can communicate between them , ” he said .
In addition to its size and portability , the novelty of the NanoLab is its quantitative multiplex protein detection , which means it can find the level of several different diseases in one run .
Diagnostic tools in developing countries typically work like a positive or negative pregnancy test - they can only look at one protein , Gaster explained .
With the NanoLab , “ we can look at more proteins , and we can look at them at lower concentrations , ” he said .
And running the NanoLab needs no lengthy training .
The students proved this by recruiting the head of their lab , Professor Shan Wang .
“ We gave it to him and said , ‘ Follow these instructions and see if you can detect the protein that we spiked in . ’
It was his first time running an experiment in 15 years and it worked perfectly , ” Gaster said .
Because the tool is portable and does n’t require skilled technicians to run , it has the potential to sell over the counter as a home diagnostic kit .
The students plan to use their prize funds for such commercial developments .

" Interactive marketing will near $ 55 billion and represent 21 % of all marketing spend in 2014 as marketers shift dollars away from traditional media and toward search marketing , display advertising , email marketing , social media , and mobile marketing . "
It adds : " The cannibalization of traditional media will bring about a decline in overall advertising budgets , death to obsolete agencies and a publisher awakening . "
With that in mind , it ’s no surprise studios are trying to monetize the shift , especially when it comes to huge films and programming like " Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince . "
The study ’s findings suggest that the sluggish economy has contributed to this movement , as marketers faced with budget cuts find interactive options to be less expensive and more measureable .
It concludes that advertising budgets will decline , although marketing will not .
the Forrester team points out that marketers are not likely to surrender their budgets ; it suggests , rather , that the extra marketing dollars would be invested in areas such as research , customer service or market - specific technology .
That shift presents a grim outlook for traditional media , as more than half of those surveyed suggested that to pay for interactive marketing , they intend to shift budget from other areas , most notably direct mail , newspapers and magazines .

Recently I treated myself to a solid - state drive ( SSD ) .
That ’s essentially a hard - drive made out of memory chips .
I bought the Intel X25 - E Extreme , which uses faster single - level cell ( SLC ) memory chips instead of slower multi- level cell ( MLC ) memory chips .
I wanted to put the drive through its paces , so I decided to see how fast I could boot Ubuntu and start Firefox .
It turns out that Ubuntu 9.04 , code - named Jaunty Jackalope , is just a few days away , and one of the features listed is “ significantly improved boot performance . ”
Perfect !
I installed Ubuntu 8.10 from a CD and then followed the incredibly easy instructions to upgrade to the beta of 9.04 .
So how fast did Ubuntu 9.04 boot with a solid - state drive ?
Really freaking fast .
Like , “ I ca n’t believe it ’s already done ” fast .
Well , here , watch for yourself :
Total boot time from pressing power to Firefox loaded was about 22.5 seconds , with about 5 seconds of BIOS display on a Thinkpad .
Subtracting out the Thinkpad BIOS display time , that means that Ubuntu 9.04 booted into Firefox in about 17.5 seconds .
I think I ’m going to have a lot of fun with this hard drive .
Oh , and Ubuntu 9.04 looks really interesting too . 🙂
For the folks that are curious , I changed the GRUB boot loader time out from three seconds to zero , enabled automatic login to my account , then I added Firefox to default list of startup services .
Added : I collected a couple boot charts by using bootchart .
As Ryan said in a comment , I ran sudo apt - get install pybootchartgui bootchart , then rebooted , then collected the image in / var / log / bootchart .
If I ’m reading the images correctly , it ’s claiming 8.67 seconds for one boot - up and 8.69 seconds for the other boot - up .
Added : Okay , I reinstalled Ubuntu 9.04 so I could use ext4 and it shaved almost a second off the boot time !
Check out this image which shows a 7.83 second boot time . 🙂
Scientists at Rice University and North Carolina State University have found a method of attaching molecules to semiconducting silicon that may help manufacturers reach beyond the current limits of Moore 's Law as they make microprocessors both smaller and more powerful .
Moore 's Law , suggested by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 , said the number of transistors that can be placed on an integrated circuit doubles about every two years .
But even Moore has said the law cannot be sustained indefinitely .
The challenge is to get past the limits of doping , a process that has been essential to creating the silicon substrate that is at the heart of all modern integrated circuits , said James Tour , Rice 's Chao Professor of Chemistry and professor of mechanical engineering and materials science and of computer science .
Doping introduces impurities into pure crystalline silicon as a way of tuning microscopic circuits to a particular need , and it 's been effective so far even in concentrations as small as one atom of boron , arsenic or phosphorus per 100 million of silicon .
But as manufacturers pack more transistors onto integrated circuits by making the circuits ever smaller , doping gets problematic .
" When silicon gets really small , down to the nanoscale , you get structures that essentially have very little volume , " Tour said .
" You have to put dopant atoms in silicon for it to work as a semiconductor , but now , devices are so small you get inhomogeneities .
You may have a few more dopant atoms in this device than in that one , so the irregularities between them become profound . "
Manufacturers who put billions of devices on a single chip need them all to work the same way , but that becomes more difficult with the size of a state - of - the - art circuit at 45 nanometers wide -- a human hair is about 100,000 nanometers wide -- and smaller ones on the way .
The paper suggests that monolayer molecular grafting -- basically , attaching molecules to the surface of the silicon rather than mixing them in -- essentially serves the same function as doping , but works better at the nanometer scale .
" We call it silicon with afterburners , " Tour said .
" We 're putting an even layer of molecules on the surface .
These are not doping in the same way traditional dopants do , but they 're effectively doing the same thing . "
Tour said years of research into molecular computing with an eye toward replacing silicon has yielded little fruit .
" It 's hard to compete with something that has trillions of dollars and millions of person - years invested into it .
So we decided it would be good to complement silicon , rather than try to supplant it . "
He anticipates wide industry interest in the process , in which carbon molecules could be bonded with silicon either through a chemical bath or evaporation .
" This is a nice entry point for molecules into the silicon industry .
We can go to a manufacturer and say , ' Let us make your fabrication line work for you longer .
Let us complement what you have .'
" This gives the Intels and the Microns and the Samsungs of the world another tool to try , and I guarantee you they 'll be trying this . "
Kristian Thanapalan never stood a chance .
The 22 - year - old , looking forward to beginning his studies at York University in September , was swarmed by as many as 25 men and beaten to death with baseball and cricket bats early Saturday , according to a friend who escaped with only minor injuries .
Police are still looking for suspects and are to hold a news conference today .
" There was no reason to hit us – we never had no problems – so I think it could have been a territorial issue , " said the friend .
" They probably thought we were new guys coming here .
We never had nothing to do with them , they had nothing to do with us . "
Thanapalan and five buddies were playing volleyball at Glamorgan Park near Kennedy Rd. and Hwy .
401 shortly after midnight Saturday , said the friend , who lives nearby and requested his name not be used for fear of reprisal .
They were sharing the park with another group of men playing cricket at a nearby baseball diamond , he said .
" We were about to leave to get some food .
We went to our cars and a bunch of guys came from two angles and pretty much surrounded us .
A couple of us were able to run off , " he said .
Thanapalan was not so lucky .
The men with bats – about six or seven in total – divided into groups , some chasing Thanapalan 's terrified friends , others pounding on Thanapalan himself .
His friend did not see the fatal blow .
" The only reason we came here was for the lights ( illuminating the baseball diamond ) .
We do n't usually come here at all , because we know this is such a bad neighbourhood , " said the friend .
About a dozen mourners gathered at the park yesterday .
Family members looked on in horror , hands covering their mouths , as Thanapalan 's friend led them to the bloodstained patch of pavement on Antrim Cres. where the biotechnology student was swarmed .
They taped Thanapalan 's picture to a tree , above a bouquet of flowers placed at the site by his father .
" He was a great guy , very good natured .
He always had a bright smile for everyone , " said Thanapalan 's cousin Tina , who requested her last name not be used .
" He had a lot of good friends .
He just graduated from Centennial ( College ) . "
Thanapalan 's parents were too distraught to speak .
Det. -Sgt. Savas Kyriacou implored witnesses from within the larger group to come forward yesterday .
" There 's a number of people in the one group who , although they were there , had minimal involvement .
The last thing they want to do is get caught in the same web as those who had more involvement , " he said .
" We 're appealing for those people to do the right thing and come forward . "
An autopsy is being performed today .

The killing was Toronto 's 28th murder of the year , and the second on Antrim Cres .
In February , 30 - year - old Centennial College psychology student Alexis Eracleous was shot in the chest on the ground floor of an apartment building .
Thanapalan 's family is holding a viewing at Ogden Funeral Home on Sheppard Ave. tomorrow and Wednesday , from 5 to 9 p.m .

Although Mars is quite different from Earth in many ways — smaller , colder , drier , and hostile to life — in some respects the two worlds are quite similar .
Volcanoes shaped the surface of both planets , and a distinctive feature of volcanism was recently found on the surface of Mars .
Columnar jointing is a pattern of cracking in rocks that forms slender columns , typically six - sided .
Jointing occurs when lava or magma comes into contact with a cool , flat surface .
After the lava solidifies , it cools and shrinks , causing cracks to form perpendicular to the cool surface .
In lava flows , cooling progresses from the top down ( where the flow is in contact with air or water ) , forming regular columns .
These images show examples of columnar jointing on Mars ( top ) and Earth ( below ) at the exact same scale .
The top image shows layers of solidified lava flows exposed on the rim of a 16 - kilometer - diamter crater in the Marte Vallis region on Mars .
This image from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment HiRISE instrument aboard NASA ’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows the first columnar joints positively identified on a planet other than Earth .
Columns between 30 – 40 meters ( 100 –130 feet ) tall and about 2 meters ( 6.6 feet ) wide comprise the lowest of the visible layers in the Mars image .
( The exposed columns run from lower left to upper right in this image . )
Beneath the columns , talus ( eroded debris ) slopes towards the crater floor .
The crater rim is visible in the lower right corner .
The Sun is lighting the scene from the lower left .
Jointed columns occur around the entire circumference of the crater , indicating that the lava flows cover a huge area : at least 200 square kilometers ( 77 square miles ) .
The widespread lava flows stacked on top of one another appear similar to the terrestrial flood basalts of the Columbia River Basin in Idaho , Oregon , and Washington , where instances of columnar jointing are common .
It is likely that runny lava from a distant source formed layers of basalt in Marte Vallis , and they were uncovered when an asteroid punched through the Martian surface .
Devil ’s Tower ( lower image ) is one of the most famous examples of columnar jointing on Earth .
Although the process — directional cooling and cracking — that formed the columns in Marte Vallis is similar at Devil ’s Tower , the setting and source of molten rock are quite different .
Devil ’s
Tower formed from a bubble of molten rock that rose up into layers of sedimentary rock in eastern Wyoming , but never broke through to the surface .
Over millions of years , the surrounding and overlying rock eroded away , leaving the hard columns standing 386 meters ( 1,267 feet ) above the Belle Fourche River .
The summit of Devil ’s Tower is flat and almost featureless .
Large blocks of rock from collapsed columns bury the base of the tower in steep talus slopes .
Trees cover the debris farther from the tower ’s base .
In this aerial photograph , sunlight comes from the lower right , which creates a long shadow pointing towards the upper left .

It 's not because the president is black , of course .
It 's because those upstanding Americans who cheered as Barack Obama 's predecessor rode roughshod over the constitution in his war on terror have found a new enthusiasm for a strict adherence to the US 's supreme law .
Specifically they 're interested in a clause requiring the president to be born a natural born citizen ( although that does n't mean to say they 're not still worried about Obama also being a secret Muslim ) .
A long brewing conspiracy theory has it that Barack Obama entered this world as a subject of the British crown in East Africa because his father was Kenyan .
A Hawaii birth certificate and birth notices in the Honolulu press went some way to dampen down the feverish speculation when it first emerged during Obama 's election campaign , driven by a handful of rightwingers who helped scupper John Kerry 's bid for president .
But now the issue has returned with a vengeance driven in part by a high profile CNN presenter , rightwing talk radio and a video of a woman haranguing her Republican member of congress prompting her supporters to recite the Pledge of Allegiance .
Now members of congress are sponsoring a bill to require all future presidential candidates to show their birth certificates .
At the heart of the supposed conspiracy is Obama 's failure to produce a paper version of his birth certificate because Hawaii digitalised its original records some years ago and now provides a print out of the electronic record .
That print out shows he was born in Honolulu in 1961 , a fact that was verified again today by the state 's health director , Dr Chiyome Fukino .
He said : " I ... have seen the original vital records maintained on file by the Hawaii State Department of Health verifying Barack Hussein Obama was born in Hawaii and is a natural - born American citizen . "
But that is not good enough for what has become known as the birther movement which would have the world believe that Obama was born in Kenya and smuggled in to the country by his American mother , or some variation on that theme .
In recent days the issue has been fired up again by television and radio .
The CNN news presenter , Lou Dobbs , who is openly hostile to the new administration , drew attention when he told viewers that the question of Obama 's place of birth " has n't been dealt with " .
The influential right wing talk show host , Rush Limbaugh , told listeners last week that the president ‚ " has yet to have to prove that he 's a citizen " .
But the real impact has been a video that has garnered hundreds of thousands of hits on the web .
It shows a Republican congressman , Mike Castle , addressing a town hall meeting on health care in Delaware last month when a woman suddenly stands up waving a bunch of papers .
She says this is her birth certificate and demands to see the president's .
" He is not an American citizen , he is a citizen of Kenya , " she shouts to applause from others in the audience .
Castle insists that Obama was indeed born an American .
The crowd boos .
As the congressman tries to change the subject , the woman suddenly demands everyone recites the Pledge of Allegiance .
The entire hall stands , faces the US flag , place their right hand on their hearts and begins reciting the pledge .
The encounter was a warning to Republican officials how far the conspiracy theory has permeated parts of their party .
The incident reflected an undercurrent of suspicion about Obama among those who see him as somehow un-American because of his politics or race , aside from the theory that he is a secret Muslim because his middle name is Hussein .
Other Republicans have taken note :
Ten members of Congress are sponsoring legislation to force future presidential candidates to find their birth certificates - widely seen as a tacit endorsement of the conspiracy theorists .
One of the sponsors , John Campbell , was asked in a television interview if he believes the president is an American and was mocked for replying : " As far as I know . "
Other members of Congress have been hit with wads of " evidence " and demands for meetings by supporters of the birther movement .
The origins of the birther movement are murky but among those who played a leading role in getting it noticed is Andy Martin , a former Republican congressional candidate and open antisemite who has denounced Jews for secretly controlling the country .
He helped drive the rumours that Obama was a secret Muslim who renounced US citizenship at the age of 10 while living in Indonesia .
Martin filed a lawsuit last year demanding the Hawaii authorities verify his birth certificate .
There is also Jerome Cors who co-authored the Swift Boat book that questioned John Kerry 's war record when he was running for president .
Cors claims
Obama 's birth certificate is a forgery .
He also writes for World Net Daily , a supposed news site that offers for sale bumper stickers demanding to know " where 's the birth certificate ? " and a DVD called A Question Of Eligibility : Is Obama 's Presidency Constitutionally Legitimate ?
Orly Taitz , a Russian born resident of California who describes herself as an attorney and dentist , has come to the forefront as an agitator on her blog and at meetings .
The tone of the questioning has raised unease at major networks .
Dobbs ' own producers have expressed concern over his repeated dwelling on the question of Obama 's origins .
Joe Klein , president of the US wing of CNN , wrote to them to say that " it seems this story is dead — because anyone who still is not convinced does n't really have a legitimate beef " .
But Klein later said he was n't ordering Dobbs to stop talking about it .
The president of MSNBC , Phil Griffin , took a tougher line .
He told the New York Times that the questioning is driven by the fact that America has elected a black president : " It 's racist .
Just call it for what it is . "
What 's the right way to declare version numbers in your modules ?
One obvious approach is :
use vars '$ VERSION ' ; $ VERSION = 1.0.1 ;
If you 're using Perl 5.6.x or newer , you might instead write :
our $ VERSION = 1.0.1 ;
That 's obvious , but wrong ; version specifiers are n't numbers .
To work correctly , you must quote them :
use vars '$ VERSION ' ; $ VERSION = ' 1.0.1 ' ; ... # alternately our $ VERSION = ' 1.0.1 ' ; # or $ PACKAGE ::VERSION = ' 1.0.1 ';
What the Documentation Said
If you look in the ExtUtils : : MakeMaker documentation under the VERSION_FROM section , you 'll see a special case heuristic the Perl 5 toolchain uses to determine the version number of a given module .
To the best of my current understanding , this is only necessary if you have n't already specified the version number in a declarative form -- in a META . yml file generated by ExtUtils : : MakeMaker or Module : : Build , for example .
MakeMaker 's particular magic uses a regular expression to match a single line in the file .
Thus you must abut the vars version :
use vars '$ VERSION ' ; $ VERSION = ' 1.0.1 ' ;
If you 've worked with Perl for a while , you may have encountered v-strings , a feature intended to encapsulate the differences between numbers , strings , and version numbers :
our $ VERSION = v1.0.1 ;
However , the version documentation recommends against their use : their meaning has changed between major versions of Perl 5 , they were only reliable with three - part version numbers .
Careful hackers may notice that the MakeMaker documentation never suggested using three - part version numbers .
( The MakeMaker maintainer called me out on this in a discussion . )
Careful documentation readers may recall the advice in Guidelines for Module Creation in perlmodlib :
To be fully compatible with the Exporter and MakeMaker modules you should store your module 's version number in a non-my package variable called $ VERSION .
This should be a floating point number with at least two digits after the decimal ( i.e. , hundredths , e.g , $ VERSION = " 0.01 " ) .
Do n't use a " 1.3.2 " style version .
See Exporter for details .
The Exporter documentation says :
The Exporter module will convert an attempt to import a number from a module into a call to $ module_name ->require_version ( $ value ) .
This can be used to validate that the version of the module being used is greater than or equal to the required version .
The Exporter module supplies a default require_version method which checks the value of $ VERSION in the exporting module .
Since the default require_version method treats the $ VERSION number as a simple numeric value it will regard version 1.10 as lower than 1.9 .
For this reason it is strongly recommended that you use numbers with at least two decimal places , e.g. , 1.09 .
Easy as pie , right ?
Do n't use version strings .
Quote version numbers .
Do n't think of them as numbers ; they do n't follow the same rules as numbers ( 1.1 is different from 1.10 ) .
Write them all on one line .
Above all , be consistent with everyone else 's mixing and matching of all of the different ways to declare and consume version numbers .
What the Code Did
Do n't fret ; it 's easy to get things wrong .
Given a package Foo :
package Foo ; our $ VERSION = ' 1.0.1 ' ; 1 ;
use Foo ' 1.0.2 ' ; silently succeeds with Perl 5.10 and bleadperl .
use Foo 1.0.2 ; is an error .
So is use Foo v1.0.2 ;
If you change the version in Foo to 1.23.0 , use Foo 1.23 , both Perl 5.10 and bleadperl will fail with the error Foo version 1.23 required -- this is only version 1.23.0 .
Here 's another fun one .
What will this produce ?
{ package Bar ; our $ VERSION = v72.69.76.80 ; } package main ; say $ Bar : : VERSION ; say Bar ->VERSION ;
You get partial credit for guessing that the method call will produce v72.69.76.80 .
You get a week 's supply of analgesic for guessing that the variable stringifies to HELP .
The version module exists to ameliorate some of this pain .
The recommended approach to solving this madness is the one - liner :
use version ; our $ VERSION = version -> declare ( " v1.2.3 " ) ;
... though you can use the slightly shorter version :
use version ; our $ VERSION = qv(" v1.2.3 " ) ;
Note that this only helps on the declaration side .
Of course , if you 've ( wisely ) taken the advice to eschew everything with the stench of v-strings , you can use the slightly - less recommended approach :
use version ; our $ VERSION = version -> parse ( " 1.02 " ) ;
Yes , the quotes are necessary .
Of course , the version documentation suggests that you do n't need to use the module if you use a simple dotted - integer version number with a single decimal place :
our $ VERSION = 1.02 ;
Note that Perl 5 version numbers do not follow this suggestion .
( Note that I explicitly avoided talking about alpha versions and the various heuristics and denotations thereof . )
What Could Be
In a thread on version 0.77 , David Golden suggested an alternate , declarative package version syntax :
package Foo:: Bar 1.00 ;
In an unrelated thread , Nicholas Clark gave a rule of thumb for borrowing syntax from Perl 6 for corresponding features in Perl 5 :
The argument in favour of adding a := operator to give the := syntax is that Perl 6 is using that syntax , so it will become familiar , and that it 's better to converge than diverge .
The Versioning section in the Perl 6 modules synopsis discusses many issues of versioning before offering a declarative syntax :
class Pooch : name < Dog>:auth < cpan:JRANDOM>:ver <1.2.1 >
Thus I wonder if David Golden 's suggestion might provide a nice way out of this mess :
package Foo:: Bar :ver ( 1.00 ) ;
This has the advantage of being declarative , so it 's much easier to parse ( if EUMM and other utilities still need to parse it ) .
It 's much less code ( and fewer expressions to write , understand , and maintain ) than the package global variable version .
Its effects can occur at compilation time .
It can't possibly break existing code because it was impossible to overload the package keyword ( at least without Devel : : Declare magic or a source filter ) .
There are two downsides .
It 's only available to new code running a patched version of Perl 5 .
This is likely only corehackers Perl 5 for the forseeable future .
( Update : This is for two important reasons .
First , it 's experimental code that may not ever work out .
Second , Dave Mitchell asked that p5 p concentrate on releasing Perl 5.10.1 for the near future , and I do n't want to distract from that with what could be a bikeshed discussion . ) .
It also needs to exist in parallel with other version declaration methods until and unless they switch over to the nicer version .
Given the confusion surrounding package version declarations , having one clearly obvious way to do things seems like a big improvement .
( Schwern suggested also patching the documentation for consistency , but even after writing all of this , I 'm still unsure of where to start and what to say . )

Adam Turl explains how Corporate America is outmaneuvering organized labor in the battle over a law that would make it easier for workers to join unions .
THE FIGHT for the Employee Free Choice Act ( EFCA ) appears to be stumbling , with Corporate America increasingly confident that it will defeat the most " controversial " parts of the pro-union legislation .
If passed in its current form , EFCA would make it easier to form unions by giving workers the option of gaining representation when a simple majority of employees signs union cards , a method often called " card check . "
EFCA would also increase fines on employers for violating workers ' right to organize and make it harder for companies to weasel out of initial union contracts by imposing binding arbitration if negotiations stall .
Now , however , a rotten compromise on EFCA -- if not its outright defeat -- is looking more and more likely .
Back in November , it seemed as if there was a perfect storm to win the law .
Barack Obama had won the White House , the Democrats increased their majority in Congress , and there was widespread anger over the financial meltdown and government bailout of the big banks .
Marching for the Employee Free Choice Act in Jacksonville , Florida ( Bernard Pollack )
But just seven months later , efforts to pass EFCA have faltered .
As expected , business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have been ferocious in their opposition to EFCA .
But Democrats have been at best tepid in their support for safeguarding workers ' right to organize .
" They 're acting like they do n't understand how much power they have , and that the conservative movement is disorganized , " said James Thindwa , executive director of Chicago Jobs with Justice .
" EFCA is a test of how committed the Democrats are to labor . "
Some are certainly failing the test .
A few have turned outright against EFCA -- like Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Sen. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas , which , of course , is the home state of the notoriously anti-union Wal - Mart .
Other Democrats seem willing to let EFCA die by a thousand cuts -- Obama among them .
In May , the president argued for compromise on EFCA , saying " I 'm supportive of it , but there are n't enough votes right now . "
Democratic senators are floating ideas for possible amendments that would defang the legislation .
These include :
Featured at Socialism Hear Adam Turl at Socialism 2009 in Chicago , speaking on " An Injury to One Is an Injury to All : The Wobblies " Check out the Socialism 2009 Web site for more details .
See you at Socialism !
Raising the threshold for unionization via card check from 50 - percent - plus - one to 60 - percent - plus - one ;
Dropping arbitration on first contracts ;
Replacing arbitration with non-binding mediation ;
Dropping card check in favor of " mail - in " secret ballots ;
Raising fines on unions , while watering down fines on employers .
When ( and if ) EFCA gets out of Congressional committees , even worse amendments will be proposed by Republicans .
HOW DID this happen ?
Opinion polls show support for legislation that makes it easier to join unions is stronger than ever .
That 's surely the result of the gut - level understanding among millions of people that corporations have been getting away with murder .
But because of the timidity of Democratic politicians and their backers in the union movement , big business has been able to project its case against EFCA .
The result is that an upside - down " bizarro " version of what workers actually face predominates in the mainstream discussion of the legislation .
Take , for example , Corporate America 's main red herring about EFCA -- that it would allow unions to intimidate workers into signing up .
During the 75 years since workers have had a legal right to organize a union , there is almost zero evidence of " union intimidation . "
In fact , a new study by the University of Illinois shows there is evidence of the absence of union intimidation .
The real balance of forces in the workplace is very different from the picture painted by business .
Since 1970s , labor laws that favor unions have gone increasingly unenforced , while backwards anti-labor laws are used with impunity .
As Teamsters Local 743 President Richard Berg put it :
The laws are dramatically slanted towards management .
There 's really no serious punishment for breaking the law .
They 're able to fire union activists and delay elections for long periods of time , with virtually no punishment at all .
There are millions of workers across the United States who want to be in unions , and the laws have been effective in preventing them from being able to do that . "
Chris Townsend , political action director of the United Electrical workers union ( UE ) , agrees .
" We have an often unrecognized , unchecked and unprosecuted corporate crime wave in the workplace , " Townsend says .
" That is the primary reason [ EFCA ] should be passed -- to protect workers from a lopsided war against them waged by their employer almost every day . "
The direct result of all this has been the undermining of union power .
Even before the recession , organized labor represented less than 10 percent of private - sector workers -- down from a post - Second World War high of 35 percent .
An entire way of life for millions of working - class people -- made possible by unions - - was destroyed .
As Berg recalls , " When I was a kid -- my dad was a truck driver - - nearly every truck on the road was union .
And now , when you drive down the road , even in cities like Chicago ... only a fraction of the trucks are union . "
But unions did n't take the opportunity of Obama 's election and the big Democratic win in 2008 to go on the offensive .
As the Los Angeles Times explained :
In 2007 , [ EFCA ] passed the House and gained more than 40 cosponsors in the Senate .
Now , with even more Democrats in the Senate and Obama in the White House , the unions saw the odds in their favor .
Obama 's campaign stump speech last fall included strong support for the legislation .
But once he was elected , labor leaders made a fateful decision .
Originally , they had planned to keep in place their extensive network of field organizers , who had just worked to elect Democratic candidates , and ask them to build pressure on lawmakers to vote for card check .
Instead , they changed course .
The labor groups scaled back , partly to give Obama time to get his bearings amid the deepening economic crisis .
Townsend says EFCA supporters -- including Service Employees International Union President Andrew Stern -- made the mistake of offering compromises at the outset :
We did a bunch of lobby visits last week , and we had many offices tell us they were hearing 100 to 1 against EFCA .
If you do n't have 60 [ votes in the Senate ] , how do you make progress ?
Well , the only way is you start figuring out what Plan B is .
What I think I 'm angry about is that we have everybody from Andy Stern to [ Senators ]
Tom Harkin to Arlen Specter ( of course , Specter called himself a Republican up till last week ) ... negotiating against themselves ...
It 's like a one - sided auction .
THINGS DIDN'T have to play out this way .
Across the country , there are examples of workers and trade unionists doing the sorts of things that could tip the balance in labor 's favor if such tactics were pursued nationwide .
For example , the United Food and Commercial Workers union seized the moment to launch an organizing campaign at Wal - Mart .
The union deployed 60 organizers to 100 stores across 15 different states .
Business Management Daily reported :
The organizers will be circulating union authorization cards bearing President Obama 's picture and a quote from a 2007 speech , in which he said , " I do n't mind standing up for workers and letting Wal - Mart know they need to pay a decent wage and let folks organize . "
The cards also symbolize the union 's push for passage of the Employee Free Choice Act ( EFCA ) , which would allow workers to choose union representation by completing an authorization card rather than by secret ballot .
One can imagine the impact if more unions had undertaken similar initiatives , connecting actual organizing with the struggle for EFCA .
There have been other positive examples .
In Fontana , Calif. , 200 workers picketed for EFCA in front of a Wal - Mart warehouse .
Another 300 people protested in Lynn , Mass .
In Peoria , Ill. , hundreds of unionists and workers protested former George W. Bush advisor Karl Rove , who was speaking at an anti-EFCA event .
In the brouhaha that preceded Rove 's visit , the city 's Chamber of Commerce was pressured into withdrawing its endorsement of the event , and even issued a statement that it had no formal position on EFCA .
Unfortunately , mobilizations like these have been too few to have the same sort of impact nationally .
Of course , EFCA is not the end of the story .
Even if EFCA is watered down or defeated , there are more fights to come .
As the UE's Townsend put it , " EFCA is not a magic wand or a cure - all .
As fast as we pass this thing or something like it , we are going to have to go back again and face a whole front of other issues [ that ] will need to be fixed . "
Chief among these issues is organizing -- with or without EFCA - - a generation of workers now living on the economy 's edge .
Somewhere in a parallel universe where Atari is still king , this is what their flash drives look like .
In our world USB flash drives are small and come in all sorts of shapes that are smaller than an Atari cartridge .
Except this one .
The Atari USB flash drive comes with a USB cable to plug into your computer since the thing is too big to just hang off the USB port .
It does evoke some nostalgia from those of us old enough to remember the Atari 2600 .
You could probably fit all of the Atari classics on this one drive .
WASHINGTON ( JTA ) — Lawyers for the two former AIPAC staffers charged four years ago with dealing in government secrets credited the Obama administration for dropping the case .
“ We are extremely grateful that this new Administration , in coordination with the U.S. Attorney ’s Office in Virginia , has taken seriously their obligation to evaluate cases on the merits and not to allow an unjust prosecution to continue solely due to momentum , ” said the joint statement by lawyers for Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman issued Friday , hours after the government filed for a dismissal of the charges against the two former senior staffers for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
“ This Administration truly shows that theirs is a Department of Justice , where the justice of any case can be re-evaluated and the government can admit that a case should not be pursued . ”
Sources close to the defense said the investigation , which first came to light in 2004 when FBI agents raided AIPAC offices , appeared to be of a piece with the Bush administration policy of expanding its secrecy powers that President Obama has said he will reverse .
Rosen and Weissman were the first civilians to be prosecuted under 1917 statute that criminalizes the receipt and retention of classified information .
JTA has learned that the defense lawyers two months ago launched an intensified effort to get Obama appointees at the Justice Department to review the case .
Abbe Lowell , Rosen ’s lead lawyer , said now was a time for AIPAC and the organized Jewish community to consider its treatment of the two .
“ Now , we mostly look for ways for Keith and Steve to get their life back , ” Lowell said .
“ What happened to them at AIPAC , how the community treated them , how they get on with their lives . ”
The others lawyers signing the statement included : Erica Paulson for Rosen ; and John Nassikas , Baruch Weiss , Kate Briscoe and Kavitha Babu for Weissman .

While the project is licensed under LGPL , there is no copyright indemnity for source code available from Fluendo or other sources primarily because the GStreamer project does not collect copyright assignments from each and every one of its contributors .

Study : Using big words needlessly makes you seem stupider
Everyone knows how college students will try to make themselves sound smarter by reaching for the thesaurus and using big , ponderous words they barely understand .
But now a new study shows that readers can see through this .
Daniel Oppenheimer , a psychologist at Princeton , took a handful of writing samples and used a thesaurus to replace the simple words with needlessly flowery ones .
As the Bad Language blog notes :
He created a “ highly complex ” version of each original text by replacing each noun , verb and adjective in it with the longest synomym .
This is the kind of writing by thesaurus that many business people and techies employ when they want to sound knowledgeable and important or because they think writing like they speak will make them sound lightweight .
Then Oppenheimer gave all the writing samples — the original , simple ones and the modified , flowery ones — to 71 students to evaluate .
The result ?
As the grandiosity and complexity of the language increased , the judges ’ estimation of the intelligence of the authors decreased .
Oppenheimer wrote up his results in a paper with the gorgeously ironic title “ Consequences of Erudite Vernacular Utilized Irrespective of Necessity : Problems with Using Long Words Needlessly . ”
His findings make perfect sense when you think about the nature of language .
Every sentence and paragraph of writing is an organic whole ; a writer ’s style is , too .
Taking a sentence and swapping in synonyms plucked from a thesaurus is bound to warp the meaning and clarity of a sentence , because synonyms are not mathematical equals :
They all have slightly different shadings .
Describe someone as “ angry ” and it means one thing ; describe them as “ choleric ” or “ furious ” or “ splenetic ” — all synonyms offered up by Thesaurus.com — and you ’re saying something slightly different .
When an essay is filled with these sort of swapped - in synonyms , it winds up having Frankensteinian seams :
You can feel its cognitive artificiality , its constipated straining to convey a higher meaning .
No wonder the judges thought these essays seemed dumber .

Anyone who is able to make this turd smell like a rose wins a prize :
For $ 25,000 to $ 250,000 , The Washington Post is offering lobbyists and association executives off - the - record , nonconfrontational access to “ those powerful few ” — Obama administration officials , members of Congress , and the paper ’s own reporters and editors .
The astonishing offer is detailed in a flier circulated Wednesday to a health care lobbyist , who provided it to a reporter because the lobbyist said he feels it ’s a conflict for the paper to charge for access to , as the flier says , its “ health care reporting and editorial staff . ”
The offer — which essentially turns a news organization into a facilitator for private lobbyist - official encounters — is a new sign of the lengths to which news organizations will go to find revenue at a time when most newspapers are struggling for survival .
The Hollywood Reporter said Thursday that after a four - studio bidding war , Universal has won the rights to produce a film based on Atari 's 1979 videogame Asteroids .
The script will be written by Matthew Lopez ( Race to Witch Mountain ) and the film produced by Lorenzo di Bonaventura ( G.I. Joe : The Rise of Cobra ) .
At great personal risk , the staff of Game |Life infiltrated Universal Studios ( we accidentally broke into the theme park , first , which was embarrassing ) to smuggle out bits of the first draft of the screenplay .
We think you 'll agree that this has some serious blockbuster potential .

See today it is easy to be a racist .
All you have to do is hide behind a cause and use it as a red herring for how you really feel .
If you have not seen the sad , sad woman at a republican congressman 's townhall meeting in Delaware , take a peek here .
It is pathetic , lame and an excuse for these individuals to vent their real racist feelings .
See , I do n't give a DAMN about folks running around here saying Barack Obama is not the legitimate president because he is not a citizen .
His birth certificate was shown time and time again , in print , for you to download , in all the major newspapers and online , but still the urban legend continues .
In fact , this tactic was used during the campaign and went no where , but the height , anger and raw emotion of the far , far , far right winged base of the Republican Party is something we need to be aware of .
Why ?
Because they can not let it go .
When was the last time anyone questioned the last 43 presidents birth certificates , or if they were given " is he really an American test ? "
None of this was questioned because the last 43 were white men .
But now with Obama this is brought up and with fervor now .
The reason this is bothersome is because after hearing Pat Buchanan 's diatribe on Rachel Maddow 's show , not only showed who he really is but makes many question why television have these people on ?
What Pat Buchanan said was racist through and through , yet , the responsibility of NBC / MSNBC has been moot .
Now we have the likes of Liz Cheney and Lou Dobbs stroking the hatred flame .
This is dangerous .
Change was a word many of us wanted in the campaign , but along with policies was the reality that an African - American man was the change .
And along with all of this is the real hatred of racism and bigotry that many have towards this man and his family at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
The birthers crowd wo n't win .
They will continue to be laughed at , looked upon as a freak show .
This will continue to be a noose around the Republicans neck , as they attempt to expand their stale , pale and male party .
In the end , it is a negative for the Republican Party .
But as I close , as an African - American and a woman , it is very sad to have to witness , hear and read all the hate towards a man who won the presidency fair and square .
OK , my rant for today .

This Week With Barack Obama
Representative Tom Coburn , a second - term Republican from Muskogee , Okla. , criticized NBC last week for broadcasting '' Schindler 's List ' ' and exposing children to what he called its '' violence ' ' and its '' vile language , full - frontal nudity and irresponsible sexual activity . ''
Mr. Coburn , 48 , a physician , is co-chairman of the Congressional Family Caucus , and his comments set off alarms .
'' This is n't ' Melrose Place , ' Mr. Coburn , this is the Holocaust , '' said the American Jewish Congress .
'' He complained about nudity -- these people 's clothes were stolen , '' said Representative Mark Foley , a fellow Republican from Florida .
'' Violence ?
These people were murdered . ''
The mental health records of the gunman in the Virginia Tech massacre , which could not be found during the investigation into the 2007 shooting , have been discovered in the home of the former director of the university ’s counseling clinic , Gov. Tim Kaine said Wednesday .
The records were found by lawyers preparing for a civil lawsuit filed this year by families of two of the 32 people that Seung - Hui Cho killed before turning the gun on himself on April 16 , 2007 .
The center ’s former director , Robert C. Miller , left his position at the Cook Counseling Center more than a year before the massacre .
The discovery raises new questions about the rigor of the state ’s investigation into the shootings .
Mr. Kaine said a criminal investigation was under way to determine how Mr. Miller was able to take the records and why the documents were not found earlier .
Mr. Miller declined to comment .
Mr. Kaine said the files would be made public within days , either with the permission of the administrator of Mr. Cho ’s estate or through a state subpoena .
When he opened Wednesday 's hearing on the hazards of inadvertent file sharing via peer - to - peer software , Representative Edolphus Towns ( D - NY ) said he was done with letting the industry solve the problem .
By the end of the hearing Towns had lowered the boom , announcing that he plans to introduce a bill to bar LimeWire - style software from government and government contractor computers and their networks .
" At its best , with the proper safeguards in place , peer - to - peer software has great potential , " Towns told the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , which he chairs .
" At its worst , it is n't peer - to - peer ; it 's predator - to - prey . "
The representative also said he wants the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether " inadequate standards " on P2P software constitute an unfair trade practice .
" The FCC needs to look into this too , " he added , although it 's unclear what statutory authority , if any , the Federal Communications Commission has over this problem .
One thing is for sure , though .
The " see no -evil , hear - no - evil approach " is done , Towns declared .
" As far as I am concerned , the days of self - regulation should be over for the file - sharing industry . "
Prime targets
To the hearing came experts with horror stories .
Inadvertent file sharing takes place when P2P users allow the program to share not only music or video files on a specific folder , but much of what is contained in the rest of their computer , including .pdfs of legal and personal documents , .gifs of medical records , and .csvs of financial data .
A lot of the discussion focused on the accidental exposure of sensitive military information .
The latest shocker came out of the testimony of Robert Boback of the Tibersa security company , who showed the House committees slides of a document the company says it found titled , " U.S. Nuclear Facilities .
List of Site Location Facilities and Activities . "
" This is from the United States , " Boback told the representatives .
' This is from the President ....
Every nuclear agency .
Every facility .
The problem is we found this in France .
Four locations in France .
Not in the United States .
Other countries know how to access this information , and they are accessing this information . "
But it appears that what the hearing saw ( it 's streamed here ) was in fact a list of civilian nuclear fuel sites that was first accidentally posted online by a government website .
Boback 's testimony was confusing to the Washington Post , which has published an errata on its earlier story on the event .
Nonetheless , there 's no shortage of evidence that loose file sharing is releasing tons of Personally Identifiable Information ( PII ) on the US military .
" Military families are prime targets for identity theft as the thieves are aware that the soldiers are probably not checking their statements or credit reports very closely due to the serious nature of the work that they are performing , " Boback warned .
" We have seen the confidential information ( SSNs , blood types , addresses , next of kin , etc. ) of more than 200,000 of our troops . "
Other cited data leaks have included the Social Security numbers of all master sergeants in the Army , about 24,000 medical records from a Texas hospital , and the surveillance photos of a Mafia hit man .
It also seems that the office of one Fortune 100 company officer accidentally released an executive 's Microsoft Outlook .
PST file , Boback disclosed , donating thousands of e-mails , contact addresses , sales spreadsheets , phone numbers , and passcodes to the file sharing universe .
The culprit du jour at this hearing was LimeWire itself .
Digital property expert Thomas D. Sydnor of the Progress and Freedom Foundation laid into the company with gusto .
" Distributors of file - sharing programs like LimeWire LLC have repeatedly responded to even the most serious and well - documented concerns about inadvertent sharing with half - measures , misrepresentations , whitewash , and other conduct that , considered in its entirety , could strongly suggest bad faith , " Sydnor charged , " an intent to cause and perpetuate inadvertent sharing . "
Dangerous living
Sydnor told the company that over the weekend he performed a test on a computer with 16,798 files in a folder named My Documents .
" After confirming that no version of LimeWire was installed upon this test computer , I then did something very dangerous : I downloaded the latest version of LimeWire 5 , " he explained , and opted for the software 's default settings .
The program very quickly put all 16,798 files up for sharing , Sydnor said .
" Were this my actual family computer , my family would be sharing all of our work - related and personal documents , all of our scanned tax - related and identifying documents , many home movies , all of our family photos , and over 3,800 copyrighted audio files , " he warned .
LimeWire Group Chair Mark Gorton dropped by for the roast , he being the main course .
He strongly disputed Sydnor 's charges .
" LimeWire 5 does not share user - originated files by default , " Gorton insisted .
" In fact , by default , LimeWire 5 shares no files of any sort for the new LimeWire user .
Also contrary to what Mr. Sydnor states , LimeWire 5 does not share ' sensitive file types ' by default .
In fact , by default LimeWire does not permit sharing of Microsoft Word documents , Corel documents , many proprietary tax document extensions , Excel spreadsheets , power point presentations and .pdf file [s ] . "
But it 's clear that after seven years of probes and government hand wringing over this issue , key players in Congress have run out of patience with assurances that the industry can plug up all these widely noted security leaks on its own .
" The file - sharing software industry has shown it is unwilling or unable to ensure user safety , " Towns declared .
" It 's time to put a referee on the field . "
He also wants the government to launch a national consumer education campaign " about the dangers involved with file - sharing software . "
What was it about former State Department official Richard Haass that bugged former Vice President Dick Cheney ?
Haass , out with a new book , War of Necessity , War of Choice , says he was shocked to read in Angler , a book about Cheney , that the former veep ordered his phone calls tapped .
An aide to both former President Bushes , Haass thinks the reason might have been that he was n't hawkish enough while working with another moderate , former Secretary of State Colin Powell .
" To me it was just indicative of how ideological the administration had become , " Haass says .
For example , he pushed for a dialogue with Iran , rejected by the Bush - Cheney team .
" The idea that something like that would be seen as somehow beyond the pale — that in many ways encapsulated my fundamental difference with this administration . "
When asked directly what irked Cheney enough to spy on him , he shrugs : " Ask the former vice president . "

I took this column for three reasons : to bring up anything I could n't fit into the video or put a nice appropriate ball - sucking joke around , to address specific responses to previous videos , and to clarify things that need more explanation .
With that in mind , Red Faction : Guerrilla is bad because it 's not a stealth game .
And if anything deserves clarification , it 's that .
My well - documented love of stealth games may undermine this argument , but the fact is , Red Faction : Guerrilla is not guerrilla .
Guerrilla warfare is to wage war upon a much larger , better - equipped force .
And yes , technically that 's what the game is about , but guerrilla tactics rarely involve parking a pickup truck full of rebels in the enemy 's kitchen and gunning down everyone who complains .
That 's just regular warfare .
Or , if we must give it a name , ' stupid ' warfare .
Stealth is what guerrilla tactics are all about .
It 's about sneaking unseen behind enemy lines and taking out key objectives .
It 's about slapping the school bully in the back of the head and running away before he can see who did it .
I 'm pissed off about RF : G not being a stealth game for the same reason I 'd be pissed off at a stealth game called ' Sergeant Cockthrust 's Adrenaline Fistfights . '
And RF : G does n't even give us the option of being stealthy .
You have no silent weapons and everyone in the current hemisphere knows about it the moment you break wind .
And often the enemy will be onto you before you even do that .
There 's a recurring mission where you have to destroy a truck convoy .
On the surface , a nice and guerrilla -y thing to do .
So , flashing back momentarily to Farcry 2 , I laid some remote explosives on the road and hid behind a rock .
And then , while I was waiting , an enemy tank actually came off the road and started shooting at me .
I 've noticed they do that if you stand still for too long - apparently loitering on Mars carries the death sentence .
And even after dodging gunfire long enough for the now extremely alerted trucks to show up , the explosives barely dented them .
I realized then what the game wanted me to do : the same thing it always wanted me to do , ram the objective with the biggest vehicle I could find and pour rockets into it until everything stopped moving .
It 's a shame , because the destruct - o- physics could have made for some awesome stealth gameplay .
Picture this .
You 've silently laser - scalpeled your way through the outer wall of a major enemy building and stolen an enemy uniform .
For a few tense hours , you sneak and bluff your way to key supports and tape satchel charges onto them .
Finally , you 're away , nodding nonchalantly to the gate guards as you go .
You move to a nearby hilltop .
You watch the personnel filing in and out of the entrances , playing out the same workaday routine they 've maintained for years .
None of them have any reason to believe today will be any different .
You 're holding the detonator .
You draw the moment out .
You look dreamily at the clouds .
In the distance , a bird sings .
Everything is peaceful .
Then you push it .
Screams .
Tile and brickwork collapse into rising dust clouds .
Your hijacked enemy radio goes berserk .
Enemy squads scour the area , but you 're already back in civvies and en route to the secret hideout , stopping at the 7 - 11 to buy more cigars .

Do n’t you just love modern day technology .
So many ways to connect and meet women but also so many ways to screw up in a matter of seconds .
To help combat these issues , I have put together a quick list of do ’s and don’ts for online dating .
These rules can also be tweaked to applied to other areas like emailing and texting .
Print these rules out and put them by computer and read them every time before you engage in online dating !!!
*********
Online Dating Guide : 14 Dos and Don’ts of that First Crucial Email
Written by : Jennae
Online dating often feels like its own world .
Real winks are replaced with virtual ones , and chemistry is guessed at through pictures and profiles .
But the biggest difference between online dating and meeting someone in the real world is how much words count , specifically , written words .
A lot of men fail when it comes to online dating because they do n’t give good email 😉
Yes , it ’s that important .
In a virtual dating word , your written words are you .
It ’s not only important what you write , but how you write it .
DON ’T wink .
Yeah , yeah , it ’s a nice little tool that helps you figure out if someone is interested in you or not , but what it really says to a woman is “ I ’m too shy to actually talk to you . ”
And while shy can seem endearing , most women doing online dating have a ton of men contacting them , especially if they are someone worth contacting .
You winking at her is n’t going to stand out as much as a well written introductory email .
DO keep it light .
Funny is sexy !
While writing a joke is harder than telling one , any bit of humor you can put in your email is a good way to show off your personality .
And women like men who make them laugh .
DON ’T use IM / text speak .
I will tell you right now that I delete anyone who contacts me with “ How R U doing 2day ?
” If you ca n’t take the time to actually spell out your words , you ’re just not worth mine .
Women want men who can hold actual conversations , and writing like you only have 140 characters is n’t the way to convince them of that .
DO keep it short .
Too long of an email tends to give a bit of the creepy vibe , and no woman wants to read a novel about why you decided to write to her : “ we have this in common , and this in common , and I think you ’d really like my mom ! ”
But while short is good , too short can also be an issue if there is nothing for her to respond to .
Aim for around three lines , minimum , but no longer than a couple of short paragraphs .
DON ’T forget to spell check and edit your email .
If the online dating program you have use does n’t have a built in spell check program , write the email in Word or the equivalent and copy and paste it into the body of the email .
Appearance counts , and just like you would n’t try to pick up a woman in a bar wearing sweats and a dirty t- shirt , you should n’t try to pick up a woman online half - assed either .
DO read her profile and make a comment about something you read .
This comment should n’t be “ I ca n’t live without sex either , so why do n’t we get together and save each other ’s lives ? ”
It should be more like “ I really like hiking too .
What are your favorite spots ? ”
DON ’T give out your contact information right away .
Any guy who sends his phone number or even AIM or other messenger services contact information to me in a first email I automatically label as a “ player ” , someone not interested in any sort of long term relationship .
It ’s sort of like walking up to a woman and handing her your card first and then trying to have a conversation with her after .
It might work in a business setting , but not in a romantic encounter .
DO ask at least one question , preferably about something you read in her profile .
This proves you actually read her profile and did n’t just check out her picture , and that , again , you ’re capable of having a conversation .
However , first rule dates apply to first emails as well , and this question should n’t delve into heavy topics like past relationships or the reason why she ’s doing online dating .
But by asking a question you give her something to respond to should she decide to write back to you .
DON ’T start talking about sex right away or compliment her in a sexual manner .
Women like compliments , but “ you ’re very pretty ” is different than “ I can totally see myself having sex with you . ”
Also stay away from complimenting particular body parts that are not eyes or smiles .
DO sign off with your actual name .
The screen names are entertaining and all , but signing off as “ drlovegod137 ” is n’t going to personalize you to the woman you ’re contacting as much as “ Jim . ”
Remember , you want to get her thinking of you as a person and not just a profile .
DON ’T come on too strong or immediately suggest getting together for coffee or a drink .
Women like to be wooed , and that ’s a two - email minimum of you asking questions about herself and answering questions about yourself , slowly establishing that preliminary trust that will make her feel comfortable meeting with you .
However …
DO communicate clearly .
Ambiguity is not your friend in email , where it ’s hard enough to read someone ’s tone as it is .
If you ’re making a movie reference or a joke , make sure she can tell that ’s what it is and not a really bad pick up line , especially if the joke is in reference to something in her profile .
You might think you ’re being clever , but she might not remember that she talked about the Simpsons , so why are you talking about the windmill in a mini golf course ?
DON’T wait longer than a few weeks of email exchanges to ask a woman to meet you .
The point of online dating to is get offline and actually meet to see if the chemistry is there before getting too invested .
I ’m perfectly fine with a man suggesting a meet up after about two or three email exchanges , depending on how much we actually talk about it those emails .
DO follow up .
Now , assuming you ’ve done your job and paid attention to her profile , writing a well formed email with proper spelling and grammar , at least one attempt at humor and one question , it ’s up to her to decide if , and when , she writes you back .
If she does , the follow up email should follow the same advice as the first with the exception that it ’s allowed to be a little longer — a little longer .
This is not your opportunity to write a thesis paper on why Kobe is the best basketball player ever or how the iPhone has changed your life .
This is where you answer any questions she asked , and then ask her a few more of your own .
A good rule of thumb on email length is to respond about the same length she ’s written to you — mirroring behavior works , even with emails .
Remember , your email is supposed to show the woman in question that you ’re good at communicating .
Think about how many fights between men and women are about a lack of communication — you do n’t want that to be you .
Giving good email is the best way to get to that first date , but after that first date remember that nothing speaks as loud …as your own voice .
Picking up the phone is always a good idea .

Phil Spector is “ likely to spend the rest of his natural life behind bars , ” said Guy Adams in The Independent .
The legendary record producer was found guilty on Monday of the 2003 shooting death of struggling actress Lana Clarkson at his Los Angeles mansion .
( watch Phil Spector ’s reaction to the jury ’s verdict ) Spector ’s “ abusive behavior toward women ” and “ fatal fascination with firearms ” finally caught up with him .
A “ parade of women ” described how Spector could turn " from charm to menace , " said Dan Glaister in the Guardian .
And , contrary to defense claims , Lana Clarkson “ had given no indication that she was suicidal . ”
But the most damning evidence may have been what Spector allegedly said to his chauffer on the night of Clarkson ’s death : “ I think I killed someone . ”
This is the end of a sad and tragic tale , said Mick Brown in the Telegraph .
“ In his heyday in the early ’60s , Spector produced some of the most exuberant and uplifting recordings ever heard in pop music . ”
But the “ teenage genius ” who briefly became “ the most successful producer in rock ' n ' roll ” was ultimately “ overtaken by hubris and his own demons . ”
In a letter to the Sunday Times , the architects , who include five winners of the Pritzker prize including Zaha Hadid , Norman Foster and Frank Gehry , criticise the Prince of Wales for trying to interfere with the democratic process by using his royal connections to stop modernist plans for the site .
It is also signed by Ricky Burdett , David Adjaye , Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron and Renzo Piano .
The letter states : ‘ It is essential in a modern democracy that private comments and behind - the - scenes lobbying by the prince should not be used to skew the course of an open and democratic planning process that is under way . ’

The architects were moved to write the letter following reports that Prince Charles had written privately to Qatari Diyar – the development arm of the Qatar government and owners of the site .
In the letter he is understood to recommend alternative plans by the classicist architect Quinlan Terry .
According to the Sunday Times , Prince Charles has already been successful in persuading the developer to consider having more traditional brick and stone buildings for the development , as opposed to the emphasis on glass and steel proposed by Rogers Stirk Harbour +
Partners planned .
Contra all the spin we 've been hearing from BaucuCon and the GOP about health care , soak in these numbers from the NYT poll yesterday :
To summarize :
Americans trust Obama over congressional GOPers on health care by a 55 % - 26 % margin .
72 % think Congress is moving either too slowly or at the right pace .
59 % think Obama is moving either too slowly or at the right pace .
76 % think health care costs pose a serious threat to the nation 's economy .
66 % support a Medicare - style public option for all Americans .
If that 's what the Republicans call winning the health care debate , they are even more screwed than has been reported .
More importantly , if BaucuCon does n't understand these numbers , then they gotta ' get out more and stop hanging out with the wingnuts .
After more than 20 years farming onions , Steve Gill still breaks out in tears at his processing facility .
Only now he ’s crying all the way to the bank .
He recently began using juice from his pungent crop to create energy to run his refrigerators and lighting .
That ’s slicing $ 700,000 annually off the electric bill at his 14 - acre plant in Oxnard .
He ’s also saving $ 400,000 a year on disposal costs .
And he has secured more than $ 3 million in government and power company incentives to do it .
Gill figures the $ 9.5 - million system will pay for itself in less than six years while eliminating up to 30,000 tons of carbon dioxide - equivalent emissions a year .

“ It ’s a great sustainability story , but it was first a business decision to solve a waste problem , ” said Gill , 59 , who co-owns the company with his brother David .
“ But in doing so , we solved a lot of environmental problems too . ”
Gills
Onions is one of a small but growing cadre of U.S. companies generating their own electricity on site with waste from their production processes .
In addition to plant material , firms are using a variety of feedstocks , including animal manure , vegetable oil , whey -- even beer .
The massive upfront costs limit the appeal of these so - called closed - loop systems .
But volatile energy prices and the rising cost of waste disposal are compelling more firms to take a look .
Farmers and processors in California ’s $ 37 - billion agricultural industry in particular are looking for ways to save money and reduce their environmental footprint , said Sonia Salas , science and technology manager for the Western Growers Assn .
Advertisement
“ Many growers want technology that helps them handle waste , ” she said .
“ This is a concept that other operations can definitely use . ”
The system at Gills Onions , which will be unveiled to the public today , converts methane from fermented onion juice into energy burned in two on - site fuel cells .
The company has farms throughout California that send onions year - round to the Oxnard plant , where they are skinned , diced , sliced or packaged whole in a numbingly frigid facility by 400 employees .
The vegetables are then shipped all over the country to wholesalers and retailers such as Ralphs .
Machines slice off about 40 % of each onion .
That leaves 150 tons of waste a day .
For years , the Gills spread these leavings as fertilizer over their fields or sold them as cattle feed .
But the refuse was expensive to handle , and it posed a hazard to the atmosphere and groundwater .
Advertisement
So the brothers decided to turn it into energy instead .
Machines extract about 30,000 gallons of onion juice that is then sent to a 145,000 - gallon holding tank kept at a toasty 95 degrees .
Inside , bacteria purchased from an Anheuser - Busch beer brewery produce methane gas by feasting on the carbohydrates in the fermenting juice .
“ It ’s like a big stomach , ” said project manager Bill Deaton .
The gas is purified , dehumidified and compressed , then burned in the fuel cells at temperatures that exceed 1,000 degrees .
The 600 - kilowatt system produces enough power to operate the plant ’s refrigeration units and lighting .
Advertisement
The Gills are also looking into installing a battery at the plant that can store excess electricity from the fuel cells .
Reserve energy could be used during peak hours in the summer , when electricity is more expensive .
“ I did n’t want to depend on anyone taking my waste for me , ” Gill said .
“ It was my problem , and I had to solve it .
It ’s a relief to find a solution . ”
Producing biofuel for a single company ’s closed - loop system is one thing , but integrating the energy into the public grid is still a prohibitively expensive and difficult endeavor .
Fuel from organic matter , such as crushed palm nuts or fermented wheat , is rarely pure enough to blend with commercial energy sources , said Ross McCracken , editor of Platts Energy Economist .
Advertisement
As a result , companies would have to sink funds into cleaning the biogas and then invest in a pipeline or other delivery system to hook the fuel into the national pool .
And even large companies would struggle to produce enough fuel to make a significant contribution .
The drawbacks make many experts skeptical of the large - scale potential of any biogas .
“ There ’s no silver bullet , ” McCracken said .
“ The technology is n’t quite there .
Advertisement
Meanwhile , Gills Onions is keeping its eco-friendly aspirations close to home .
Gill hopes to turn the plant into a zero - waste facility by revamping packaging and by recycling employees ’ lunch leftovers .
The company even cleans its own wastewater and funnels it into a cooling tower .
“ We consider this a long - term investment for the company , ” Gill said .

Charles Ying has created a collection of components and code examples that illustrate the power of CSS visual effects on the iPhone .
Officially named CSS - VFX , the project has yielded it ’s first very cool little web app called Zflow .
Zflow uses Javascript and CSS transforms and animations to emulate the Apple ’s native coverflow .
It starts by loading each image from the an array , scales them to fit in a square region , and applying 3D CSS transforms to scale it in place .
To add the reflections , Zflow creates a Canvas element that contains a gradient alpha mask for each image ( using a “ reflect ” function to do this ) and positions the canvas element in place .
A TouchController object fields touch events from Mobile Safari and calculates the appropriate offset .
When you click on an image , Zflow zooms + rotates the focused image forward by setting a “ CSS Transitioned ” 3D transform on the focused image .
Clicking again transitions the image back .
When sliding through the image set , Zflow achieves inertia by setting the “ transition timing function ” of the “ tray ” to an “ ease - out ” function , which slows things down .
On the touch end event , the projected velocity is calculated and sets the tray ’s target position to that location .
CSS Transitions handles the decay in velocity as the transition timing function executes — slowing the tray down gradually .
It really is a beautiful piece of work .

This prototype rifle could provide soldiers a new advantage against hidden enemies ( Image : US Army )
A RIFLE capable of firing explosive bullets that can detonate within a metre of a target could let soldiers fire on snipers hiding in trenches , behind walls or inside buildings .
The US army has developed the XM25 rifle to give its troops an alternative to calling in artillery fire or air strikes when an enemy has taken cover and ca n’t be targeted by direct fire .
“ This is the first leap - ahead technology for troops that we ’ve been able to develop and deploy , ” says Douglas Tamilio , …

BBC News , Mumbai
Troops battled for three days to regain control of Mumbai As an Indian court decides whether to accept the only alleged surviving Mumbai bomber 's guilty plea , the bodies of nine dead gunmen remain unclaimed .
They are still lying unwanted in a local government hospital .
All nine of the alleged accomplices of Mohammad Ajmal Amir Qasab were killed by the security forces during the attacks in November .
Officials in charge of the bodies say that they have yet to hear from the authorities what to do with them .
Setback " We are awaiting instructions from the state as well as the central government , " said Bhushan Gangrani , a senior government official in Maharashtra state - of which Mumbai ( Bombay ) is the capital .
TEN NAMED GUNMEN Nasir , alias Abu Umar ( Nariman House ) Abu Ali ( Taj Palace ) Soheb ( Taj Palace ) Fahad Ullah ( Oberoi ) Mohammed Ajmal Amir Qasab ( survived ) Bada Abdul Rehaman ( above left , Taj Palace ) Abdul Rehaman Chota ( above right , Oberoi ) Ismal Khan ( CST station ) Babar Imaran ( Nariman House ) Nazir , alias Abu Omer ( Taj Palace )
The question of what should be done with the dead militants arose soon after the dust settled following November 's attacks , in which more than 170 people died , including the nine gunmen .
It is now beginning to haunt the central government , because Pakistan flatly refused to take them despite India 's argument that they should go back to the country from which they originated .
The bigger setback for the government came from Indian Muslims when they said they would not allow the bodies of the militants to be buried in their cemeteries .
It has now been been eight months since the bodies were first taken to the mortuary of a local government hospital .
And still there are no signs of any takers .
Muslim community leaders insist that the militants cannot be called Muslims because they have brought disrepute to Islam by killing innocent civilians .
Ibrahim Tai , the president of the Muslim Council Trust which looks after the social and religious affairs of Indian Muslims , told the BBC that his community 's stand in November was not to allow the bodies to be buried in Muslim burial grounds and that stand has not changed .
" These dead militants were involved in a bloodbath , " he said , " they killed innocent people .
There 's no place for them in our cemeteries . "
Instead Mr Tai urged Pakistan to take the bodies and " bury them in their homeland " .
This appears to be one of the rarest occasions when Indian Muslims have openly defied " Islamic terrorism " .
While the bodies have been embalmed there are also worries about their long - term condition .
Officials warn that they will start to decompose in a few months .
A suggestion from some quarters , to donate them to medical colleges , has been rejected by the government .

The imaging system on board NASA 's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) recently had its first of many opportunities to photograph the Apollo landing sites .
The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera ( LROC ) imaged five of the six Apollo sites with the narrow angle cameras ( NACs ) between July 11 and 15 , within days of the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission .
The early images obtained by LROC , operated by Arizona State University Professor Mark Robinson , show the lunar module descent stages left behind by the departing astronauts .
Their locations are made evident by their long shadows , which result from a low sun angle at the time of collection .
" In a three - day period we were able to image five of the six Apollo sites – the LROC team anxiously awaited each image , " says LROC Principal Investigator Mark Robinson , professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration in ASU 's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences .
" Of course we were very interested to get our first peek at the lunar module descent stages just for the thrill – and to see how well the cameras had come into focus . "
For additional information about the LROC instrument and to view the first Apollo landing site images , visit : http://lroc.sese.asu.edu.
The orbiter 's current elliptical orbit resulted in image resolutions from the NACs that were slightly different for each site but were all about four feet per pixel .
Since the deck of the descent stage is about 14 feet in diameter , the Apollo relics themselves fill about four pixels .
However , because the Sun was low to the horizon when the images were acquired , even subtle variations in topography create long shadows .
Standing just over ten feet above the surface , each Apollo descent stage creates a distinct shadow that fills roughly 20 pixels .
The Apollo 14 lunar module ( LM Antares ) and the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package are visible in this image ( note the astronaut tracks between the two artifacts ) .
At the current altitude and lighting the descent stage is clearly visible with its angular shadow ( right ) and shadow cast by leg ( near arrow tip ) .
The LROC NAC image data has not been calibrated , the faint vertical stripes are a natural part of the image and will be removed later after the full suite of calibration data is collected during the commissioning phase .

" For the five landing site images photographed by LROC , the biggest variables are spacecraft altitude ( ground scale ) and time of day , which translates into signal strength , " explains Robinson .
" In the current collection of images the best discrimination of features is in the Apollo 14 scene even though the highest resolution picture covers the Apollo 16 site . "
Compared to the other landing site images , the image of the Apollo 14 site revealed additional details .
The Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package ( ALSEP ) , a set of scientific instruments placed by the astronauts at the landing site , is discernable , as are the faint trails between the descent stage and ALSEP left by the astronauts ' footprints .
Though it had been expected that LRO would be able to resolve the remnants of the Apollo missions , these first images came prior to the spacecraft reaching its final mapping orbit .
As the orbit of LRO is lowered , LROC will receive many more opportunities to image the landing sites in the weeks to come .
The resolution of future LROC images of these sites will improve by two to three times .
The timing of these images being captured is notable as it occurred only days before the 40 - year anniversary of NASA 's Apollo 11 mission that first put humans on the moon .
Though these pictures provide a reminder of one of humankind 's greatest technological achievements , LRO 's primary focus is paving the way for future exploration .
By returning detailed lunar data the LRO mission will help NASA identify safe and compelling landing sites for future explorers , locate potential resources , describe the moon 's radiation environment and demonstrate new technologies .

WASHINGTON - Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee are preparing to hold
hearings to investigate the role of vice president Dick Cheney in
allegedly ordering the C.I.A. to conceal a secret assassination program
from Congress .
As I reported yesterday ,
there are two crucial issues at play : the nature of the U.S .
assassination program and the role of former vice president Dick Cheney
in concealing aspects of it from Congressional oversight .
On the
broader issue of U.S. government assassination , it is very unlikely
that will become a central focus given that there has long been a
bipartisan assassination program that continues under President Obama .
Indeed , most legislators frame their opposition to this program through
the lens of the concealment issue , not the assassinations .
Early
moves , however , by the Obama administration indicate that it is backing
Cheney and the C.I.A .
In May , when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was under
fire over allegations she had been briefed on U.S. torture tactics , she
publicly accused the C.I.A. of misleading her .
In what many viewed as a
response to Pelosi , C.I.A. Director Leon Panetta wrote C.I.A. staff a memo ,
saying , " Let me be clear :
It is not our policy or practice to mislead
Congress .
That is against our laws and our values ...
My advice - indeed ,
my direction - to you is straightforward : ignore the noise and stay
focused on your mission .
We have too much work to do to be distracted
from our job of protecting this country .
We are an Agency of high
integrity , professionalism , and dedication . "
After Panetta
briefed the Intelligence Committees on June 24 and , according to
Democratic lawmakers , revealed that Cheney had concealed the covert
assassination program from Congress , six Democrats from the House
Intelligence Committee wrote Panetta asking him to retract his
statement that the C.I.A. does not " mislead Congress . "
Last week , a CIA
spokesperson said Panetta " stands by his May 15 statement . "
Some
lawmakers , including Senate Intelligence Committee chair Dianne
Feinstein and Senator Dick Durbin , have suggested the concealment was
illegal .
" The executive branch of government cannot create programs
like these programs and keep Congress in the dark .
There is a
requirement for disclosure , " Durbin said .
" It is inappropriate for the vice president or the president to be
ordering that a program be kept secret and not disclosed at the highest
levels of congressional leadership . "
As Democrats try to build
momentum for the hearings , a senior Obama official has now come forward
to defend the legality of Cheney and the C.I.A.s ' alleged concealment .
President Obama 's Director of National Intelligence , Dennis Blair , says
the C.I.A. did not violate the law .
In an interview with The Washington Post ,
Blair said that he believes the C.I.A. should have informed Congress ,
but was not required to .
" It was a judgment call , " said Blair .
" We
believe in erring on the side of working with the Hill as a partner . "
From the Post :
Blair said that Panetta told him in advance of the decision
to terminate the program and that he supported the action as well as
the decision to inform Congress .
Panetta " felt it was urgent and
appropriate to brief the Hill , " Blair said .
" You can make a judgment
call on whether a briefing was necessary .
We were on the side of ‘ Let's
do it . '
We 're trying to reset our relations with Congress . "

Blair
also asserted that killing the program did not diminish U.S. options
for battling al - Qaeda , including the possible use of insertion teams
that could kill or capture terrorist leaders .
" This particular
program did n't make the cut , " he said .
" But it is absolutely not true
that we are doing less against al - Qaeda .
Our primary criterion is
effectiveness , and we will continue to do things that we think are
effective to make terrorist lives miserable , and hopefully , short . "
A C.I.A. spokesperson , George Little , told the paper the program was
" never fully operational and never took a single terrorist off the
battlefield . "
Little added that Panetta has been " aggressively using
the vast tools and tactics at our disposal - those that actually work -
to take terrorists off the streets . "
At the end of the day , as I
have pointed out previously , among the crucial issues for Congress to
investigate are : what is Dick Cheney 's role in concealing information
to which Congress has a right ?
What covert assassination programs were
activated by Cheney ( and / or Bush ) and whom exactly were they targeting ?
Is it true , as has been suggested by the current C.I.A. and National
Intelligence directors , that this specific program was never activated ?
Part of this investigation should also include a deep probe into the assertions made by Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist Seymour Hersh that Cheney was running an " executive assassination ring . "
The current portrayal of what exactly this program entailed is , at
best , very fishy on several levels .
To me , this very much seems like
some major league misdirection .
There is no doubt that Cheney was
running some nefarious programs and any orders from Cheney to the
C.I.A. to conceal information on programs to which Congress has a right
should be fully investigated .
BUT , when compared with other information
about Bush / Cheney illegal operations , the description of this one seems
really small potatoes for the Intel Committees outside of the need for
Pelosi to be vindicated .
I guarantee you that there are much worse
things that members of the Intelligence Committees are aware of than a
program that never was activated , which Cheney told the C.I.A. not to
mention to Congress .
It bears repeating : this secret program , as it is
currently being described , is very , very similar to the longstanding
U.S. assassination program that the Intel Committees have known about
for years predating 9/11 and Bush / Cheney 's time in power .
Former C.I.A. operator Robert Baer , has an interesting take on all of this at Time .
I am not endorsing Baer 's view , but think it is worth reading :
How much of Twitter ’s trending topics are polluted by spam ?
How many Twitter verified accounts are there ?
Have you ever thought of reaching Twitter utopia : a spam - free Twitter where information and knowledge sharing are the main purposes for using Twitter ?
Is Twitter doing enough to protect us from spam ?
Would you like to find all the top 5 solutions to cutting down on Twitter spam in one place ?
Thoughtpick is here to save the day !
While reading the post about Twitter closing down thousands of spam accounts , I found that it would be interesting and very beneficial if I researched the web to present you with the top 5 methods and applications which could help Twitter users cut down on incoming spam and better enjoy their overall Twitter experience .
Manual Selection :
This method might be fun at the beginning yet could become a bit overwhelming especially to those following thousands of tweeps .
Basically , this method entails that you monitor the activity , profile , links and tweets of those you are following and manually unfollow and block those who seem to be spammers rather than true tweeps .
Things you should be well aware of when manually following and unfollowing tweeps :
Be ware of suspicious - looking shortened URLS ; these could be links to viruses , pornography , trojans or spam .
For example , if you see the same URL with 10 different descriptions !
; these could be links to viruses , pornography , trojans or spam .
For example , if you see the same URL with 10 different descriptions !
Be careful of trending topics ; spammers use those with a combination of hashtags so they would show up more often on Twitter search ,
; spammers use those with a combination of hashtags so they would show up more often on Twitter search , Be ware of fake followers ; followers who will not RT you or provide you with valuable information , instead , they use their Twitter account to send our promotions to sell their services .
; followers who will not RT you or provide you with valuable information , instead , they use their Twitter account to send our promotions to sell their services .
Know who you follow before you follow them and unfollow and block anyone who seems to be a spammer immediately .
Tweepi.com : A new application , still in beta , for Twitter users which allows you to cleanup spam users using numbers that are able to reveal bots through various ratios such as number of tweets vs. number of RTs and the number of links per tweets .
So if you ’re following a few thousand people on Twitter and you noticed that many of them do not engage in conversations , never retweet anybody , or simply just ramble about nonsense stuff all day long ( no links to useful content whatsoever ! ) ,
Tweepi is your answer !
Twerpscan.com : TwerpScan will check the number of followers of all your contacts , the number of people they are following , and then compute the ratio between those .
You can easily sort the list of your contacts ; display them in variable batches of 20 to 100 people ; and you can follow , unfollow and / or block each contact right there on the spot — without going insane .
Clean
Tweets : A browser - based filter plugin that removes spam from Twitter Search .
Clean Tweets is an extension for Firefox that goes through your Twitter searches , either from Twitter.com or Search .
Twitter.com , and erases a majority of the spam - based ones by essentially using only two filtering rules :
1 ) Delete all tweets from accounts that are less than 24 hours old 2 ) Delete all tweets that mention three or more Twitter trending topics .
TidyTweet : A real - time tool especially tailored for blog / website owners and which allows companies to syndicate Twitter content on their website or blog free from inappropriate language , users , and content .
TidyTweet , which is currently in private beta , is designed around creating and managing feeds with additional customization options .
Finally , I ’ll leave you with the following questions :
Do you think a time will come where Twitter would be absolutely spam - free ?
And do you know of any other spam - cutting applications that we might have missed ?
Your feedback is always appreciated .
Enjoy your Twitter experience as spam - free as possible :)
SHOTGUN
made from iron bedposts ; charge
made of pieces of lead from
curtain tape and match - heads ,
to be ignited by AA batteries and
a broken light bulb .
On May 21 , 1984 two inmates of
a prison in Celle , Germany , took
a jailer as a hostage , showed off
their fire power by letting go at
a pane of bullet - proof glass , and
escaped by car .
Now that 's pretty quiet .
Intel , today , announced its Core i5 and Core i3 branding with very little detail .
The post that inspired all of this is here , which I found from Cyril 's summary on Tech Report ( btw , Cyril 's posts pretty much always rock ) .
The important take away points are as follows :
1 ) The new brand is Intel Core .
There will be three derivatives : Core i7 , Core i5 and Core i3 .
2 ) The Core 2 Duo and Core 2 Quad branding will eventually disappear .
3 ) Pentium , Celeron and Atom will remain .
4 ) Centrino will also go away and Intel 's WiFi and WiMAX products will inherit the name starting in 2010 .
But what separates a Core i7 from a Core i5 and Core i3 ?
I may have some insight .
Let 's start with desktop processors :
Desktop Processor Cores Threads Turbo Intel Core i7 4 8 Yes Intel Core i5 2 or 4 4 Yes Intel Core i3 2 or 4 4 No
Only the Core i7 is allowed to run in a LGA - 1366 socket , however there will be LGA - 1156 i7 , i5 and i3CPUs .
The number of memory channels and the presence of a QPI link does not determine branding .
In other words , Lynnfield will be both a Core i7 and a Core i5 depending on the SKU .
The LGA - 1156 Core i7s will be the 8xx series , while the LGA - 1366 i7s will be the 9xx series .
The i5s will be the 6xx series and the i3s will be the 5xx series .
Four cores and HT enabled with turbo mode yields you a Core i7 on the desktop .
If you only have support for up to 4 threads then you 've got a Core i5 ; take away turbo and you have a Core i3 .
In mobile , things are a little different :
Mobile Processor Cores Threads Turbo Intel Core i7 2 or 4 4 or 8 Yes Intel Core i5 2 or 4 4 Yes Intel Core i3 2 or 4 4 No
The mobile i7 can be 2 or 4 cores and support 4 or 8 threads , which makes sense since there will be more dual - core than quad - core mobile processors .
The rest of the lineup follows the desktop rules ; i5 and i3 are capped at 4 threads and i3 does n't have Turbo .
I 've got one more thing to report .
Remember how I was n't totally sure about the turbo modes for the top end Lynnfield processor in our preview ?
I think I 've got it :
Desktop Processor Clock Speed Max Turbo ( # of Cores Active ) 4C 3C 2C 1C Intel Core i7 870 2.93GHz 3.20 GHz 3.20 GHz 3.46GHz 3.60GHz
From what I 've heard , this is going to be a Core i7 870 and the turbo modes are similar to what I estimated .
With two cores active this thing will turbo up to 3.46GHz ( 4 speed bins ) .
That 's going to be a huge boon to performance in games and other apps that have difficulty using more than 2 threads .
Combine that with Windows 7's superior thread handling and I believe we have a winner on our hands .
On the face of it , one remarkably clever man might have woken on Wednesday and expected , at the very least , a decent slew of plaudits .
Professor Karim Nayernia , from the University of Newcastle , announced a world first : the creation , from stem cells , of a human sperm .
Strictly speaking , it 's not a proper sperm ; not yet up to doing the business , as it were .
Nevertheless , it 's a cute enough tadpole , with the capacity to do a fetching wriggle and the distant future potential to alleviate infertility in men , to increase understanding of the production of sperm and to become a tool to test new drugs .
So : three cheers all round ?
Not a chance .
" Men doomed ! " yelped the red -tops .
" Profoundly shocking " , " a terrifying new era " and " macabre scenario " followed suit .
Even the quality end of the news market pointed to " the threat to the future role of men " , while by teatime the generally erudite Carolyn Quinn found herself chairing a Radio 4 debate between Toby Young and Fay Weldon entitled : " Are men redundant ? "
For crissake .
What irks is not just that they are chewing on the wrong end of the stick - though they surely are : if the result is that more men will have children to whom they pass their own DNA , rather than that of a sperm donor , are n't such men going to feel less , rather than more redundant ?
But the truly depressing aspect of the brickbats is how thoroughly predictable it all was ; how typically people reacted to this medical , technical and scientific advance .
It 's hard to believe , sometimes , that we once stayed up , agog and proud , to follow , say , the reports of a moon landing .
We did n't understand that , either - but progress was as progress did and what we all knew was that we wanted in .
Today , the greatest achievements of the beautiful minds are met with suspicion , cynicism and hostility .
Never mind that information technology has transformed our lives , 99 % for the better .
Let 's concentrate , instead , on the 1 % : the seduction of our children ; the imminent collapse of our universe , courtesy of a belated millennium bug ; the bad - guy Google , snooping on our homes .
So synonymous has science become with harm that world opinion - well , western opinion - would rather see another million die in Ethiopia than contemplate the genetic modifying of a crop that could survive the arid soil .
Better to throw another rock concert ; that 'll sort it .
But of all the targets enjoyed by the doom brigade , none receives the vindictiveness hurled at reproductive technology .
The contraceptive pill , arguably the most powerful aid to the emancipation of women , was predicted to slay an entire generation by embolism .
In 1978 , when Louise Brown was conceived as the world 's first IVF baby , the birth of a freak was widely anticipated .
Hormone replacement therapy ?
Gives ya cancer , baby .
Epidural anaesthesia ?
One slip and you 're paralysed .
And in the absence of specific threat , feel free to be vague : scans of the unborn ?
" Ca n't be good for the baby " will do nicely .
As it turned out , with due acknowledgement of the ( very ) few who succumbed to the pill , hundreds of millions seized control of their fertility with no ill effect .
By Louise Brown 's 21st birthday , 300,000 other healthy children had followed her lead .
We might not like the idea of a 66 - year - old using IVF to conceive , but it 's hardly a goldrush , nor likely to be - and one dubious conception in , now , three million should keep nobody awake at night .
HRT does not suit everyone , but has reinvigorated the lives of countless women .
Epidurals have relieved more suffering than is imaginable ; ultra - sound scans have saved heartbreak , be it by cure , by choice or by termination .
There , of course , is the root of the exceptional vitriol shown towards reproductive technology , be it one sliver of a copper IUD contraceptive or Professor Nayernia 's nascent sperm : opponents do not wish to allow choice ( let alone termination , heaven forbid ! ) because these opponents have an agenda of their own .
All those who lined up last week to tell newspapers and television inquisitors that the newfangled sperm is " unsafe " ( really ? how ? ) these days call themselves " ethicists " but are in fact our old friends from the religious right .
Interviewers would show greater diligence if they ended every " ethical " debate with the simple question : now remind me , which is your church ?
But they do n't and they wo n't , almost as if to expose fundamentalism has become impolite - and , to be fair , it might not make as much difference as it should , given that the religious zealots are not propagandising in the vacuum one might wish upon them .
The generalised mistrust of all things progressive or futuristic has created an equally generalised , and almost equally zealous acceptance of slippery slopes , thin ends of wedges and a head - shaking , tooth - sucking belief that any step towards the unknown is inevitably a step towards the bad .
Almost every scientific advance , no matter its potential , has first to run the dumb - arsed gauntlet of " it 's not natural " - and you 've only your own breath to waste by pointing out that no , nor is aspirin .
The pity of it is that we already have in place a very adequate control over science : it comes up with the goods and we - collectively and individually - decide whether to buy them .
Scientists have , for instance , developed merciful means of assisted suicide ; society has collectively , and repeatedly , told them to stuff it .
By the same token , once the professor has perfected his sperm , no individuals will ever be forced to avail themselves of his genius .
It would , therefore , be a huge loss if he were to be sidetracked by sci - fi stories of how , for example , women could have babies with sperm created from long - dead men .
First : what are the chances ?
And second : even if , while millions of infertile men found joy in paternity , a strange , solitary woman did dig up a few grams of some old Nazi and have his baby - really , in the great scheme of things , so what ?

Laura Cote / Northwestern U SCHOOL PRIDE
This logo was made by masking a portion of a graphite oxide film ( brown ) and exposing the remainder to light from a camera flash , which reduces the material to graphene ( black ) .
No time to make graphene via conventional routes ?
Then make it " in a flash . "
Northwestern University scientists have just demonstrated that graphite oxide can be converted instantly to graphene via photothermal deoxygenation by exposing the material to a pulse of light from an ordinary camera flash ( J. Am. Chem .
Soc. , DOI : 10.1021/ja902348k ) .
Because of its low cost and wide availability , graphite oxide is a promising precursor for making graphene - based materials , which are being studied for use in polymer composites and electronics .
The oxide is typically treated at high temperature or with potent reducing agents such as hydrazine to yield graphene .
Now , Laura J. Cote , Rodolfo Cruz - Silva , and Jiaxing Huang of Northwestern have shown in a video that the flash method is an instantaneous , chemical - free way to transform graphite oxide , an electrical insulator , into graphene , a conductor , at room temperature .
The team has also shown that by applying masking and photolithography methods , the flash technique can be used to fabricate complex patterns , a key step in developing electronic components .

Pumpkin for cats - pumpkin for dogs - Pumpkin for diarrhea or constipation
It should be noted that both diarrhea and constipation can both be very serious and require immediate veterinary care depending on the cause .
Whatever the cause , diarrhea or constipation lasting more than 24 - 36 hours requires vet care .
If your dog or cat is having the occasional case of constipation or diarrhea , one of the things that might help is canned pumpkin .
Yes canned pumpkin in its pureed form ( NOT pumpkin pie filling ) is a fantastic stool softener which makes it a good natural remedy for constipation .
It often helps with upset stomach or indigestion for both cats and dogs .
It is very rich in fiber and adding just one or two teaspoonfuls to your pet 's food often gets the system moving in no time .
Dogs will occasionally want to eat it directly and that 's fine too .
Sometimes though , finicky cats and dogs wo n't touch it no matter what you do .
On the opposite end of things is diarrhea .
Since the dietary fiber in canned pumpkin absorbs water , it can be a great help to a cat or dog that has diarrhea .
Some pet owners report that it firms up their pet 's loose stools or diarrhea within a few hours .
Again one to two teaspoonfuls is all that is needed .
It should be noted that both diarrhea and constipation can both be very serious and require immediate veterinary care depending on the cause .
Whatever the cause , diarrhea or constipation lasting more than 24 - 36 hours requires vet care .

People Choose Eco-friendly Cars Over Dream Cars
Added by viorel on Jul 08 , 2009 | Visited by 6147 | Voted by 41 persons
It seams that luxury cars are going out of fashion with more people deciding to buy an environmentally - friendly vehicle and save money on the car of their dreams .
According to a market research company Synovate that carried out a study of more than 13,500 people , 6 out of 10 respondents " would choose to buy a green car over a dream car , even if money was no object . "
The company completed its research in 18 markets , asking people questing regarding eco-friendly vehicles , car ownership , what they intend to acquire in the upcoming year , as well as their thoughts about vehicles , traffic , public transport etc .
It turned out that 37 percent of respondents were more likely to acquire an eco-friendly vehicle , 22 percent said that their dream car is a green car .
By summing the numbers it is clear that 59 percent were more likely to be closer to green technology .
" Green or hybrid cars are more fuel efficient and , together with pollution concerns , this economical issue would be a big part of why Koreans put green over dream " mentioned Byeong Hwan Je the Motoresearch Head of Synovate Korea .
According to Shinya Goto , Head of Synovate Japan 's Motoresearch team , for environmental and market reasons public transport , walking and bike riding represent the most popular source of transportation .
At the same time , in case of Japan , there is another key factor at work , which is involved in the car - making industry .
The country 's younger generation is stepping away from personal transport .
Young people up to 30 years old were less likely to buy a car .
This particular segment of people is pretty much aware of the environmental issues .
They are more likely to save money on cars and spend more on gadgets and clothes , while using public transport .
The Chief Executive of Synovate Motoresearch , Scott Miller , believes that more people around the world will consider switching to green cars .
He predicts that households who have two cars will reduce their number to one and it would be better if that only car is environmentally friendly .
The firm carried out its research across the following markets : Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , Egypt , France , Germany , Greece , India , Japan , Korea , Malaysia , South Africa , Thailand , Turkey , the United Arab Emirates , Britain and the United States .
Note that the company considered the most populated countries such as India and China and the most polluting country - the United States .
If we analyze current health problems , fossil depletion and peak oil we might as well realize that public transportation is one of the steps that should be made to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases .
The current study also asked respondents whether they would choose to ride a bicycle or walk more often instead of using a car .
It is worth mentioning that all respondents lived in urban areas .
Among 13,500 people 9 percent said that they would .
The highest percentage of people that would choose a bicycle over car was registered in Korea 20 percent , Germany 17 percent , China 16 percent and Japan 15 percent .
With an increasing demand for bicycles and continuously rising issues about the environment it is possible that more people around the world would become aware about the importance of reducing carbon emissions and what it is important to do in order to save out planet .
Dioxin exposure during pregnancy impairs the development of mammary glands during pregnancy and may cause women to not produce enough milk for their newborns , a new study finds .
Breast milk is an amazing food for babies , and breastfeeding has many benefits for both mother and child , including reducing the risk of heart attacks for mothers , reducing asthma risks for babies , and reducing anxiety in children .
But up to 6 million women either can’t breastfeed , or do n’t produce enough milk for their child , and dioxin in our food chain may be to blame .
The study , from the University of Rochester Medical Center , found that dioxin causes mammary cells to stop their cycle of proliferation as early as six days into pregnancy , and the effects of exposure can last through mid-pregnancy .
“ We showed definitively that a known and abundant pollutant has an adverse effect on the way mammary glands develop during pregnancy . ” – B. Paige Lawrence , Ph.D. , associate professor of Environment Medicine and of Microbiology and Immunology at URMC
Human exposure to dioxins is usually through diet , as the chemical enters the food chain through emissions settling on farmland , and through livestock and fish .
Though normal exposure is in typically low daily doses , the toxin settles in the fatty tissues and is slow to be eliminated .
Researchers found that in tissue samples from mice , a 50 % decrease in new epithelial cells was seen after dioxin exposure , and because mammary gland cells have a high rate of growth during early to mid-pregnancy , this is an important finding .
The team also reported that dioxin alters the induction of the milk - producing genes and reduced the number of lobules and ductal branches in mammary tissue .
“ The best thing people who are concerned about this can do is think about what you eat and where your food comes from .
We ’re not suggesting that we all become vegans — but we hope this study raises awareness about how our food sources can increase the burden of pollutants in the body .
Unfortunately , we have very little control over this , except perhaps through the legislative process . ” – Lawrence
The report was published online in Toxicological Sciences .
The group is also investigating a possible link between breast cancer and dioxin exposure .

Jason Furman owes an apology to Michael Boskin , the Stanford economist who wrote a year ago on these pages that Barack Obama would raise American income tax rates nearly to 60 % .
Mr. Furman , then in the Obama campaign and now at the White House , claimed this was wrong and that Democrats would merely raise taxes back to their Clinton - era level .
House Democrats are now proving that Mr. Boskin had it right , and before it's over even he may have underestimated how high taxes will go .

When life gives you cherries , make this Cherry Jam Recipe .
Yellow cherries are perfect for jam making because they keep firmer .
Top your French toasts , pancakes or crepes with cherry jam .
It will become a staple at breakfast .
Although sour cherry jam is more popular in Turkey , I think yellow cherries are way better to make a cherry jam recipe .
They keep their shape much better even after they are cooked .
Do you love cherries as much as I do ?
I really do n’t know how to describe my feelings when I see a tree full of cherries .
Whenever I see such a tree , I realize how beautiful life is .
This may sound nonsense , but I do n’t have the same feeling for other fruit trees .
It makes me so happy to see those little red things between green leaves on a tree .
I suppose that this makes the tree happy as well .
It looks like a bride in reds .
Have I told before that red is the color of brides and newly married women in our culture ?
I think I love seeing cherry trees much more than eating cherries .
I would witness how cherry trees blossomed and then fruited as a child when we visited my grandma .
There were immense cherry yards in the village where she was living in and I remember watching these yards with a great admiration .
It is such a village that nobody has to get permission to get into someone ’s yard and to taste some cherries .
So we would enter one , taste some and then enter another to taste a different species of cherry .
Grandma also had a cherry tree in her backyard where we ( my cousins and I ) enjoyed a lot .
We would climb on the tree , which was my favorite method to taste fruits , and would chat there eating cherries .
The funniest thing I remember is that we , as girls , would make ear rings from cherries by hanging them on our ears .
We would love to feel swingings of cherries on our ears when we shake our heads .
Would you do the same thing when you were children ?
Besides their wonderful taste and beauty , it is known that cherries also have healing effects .
It is known that they are more effective as painkillers than an aspirin .
So if you have bad headache , please try eating cherries before taking any other painkillers .
No need to mention that they are great antioxidants .
Heavy smokers should eat cherries to get rid of the nicotine in their body .
It also strengthens our immune system and our body against many cancer types .
Grandma would also say that cherry stalk has many herbal effects , too .
She would make tea boiling cherry stalks in water for about 10 minutes .
She would say that this helped kidneys work well and cured joint calcification .
I learnt one more thing from her that cherry stones keep heat for a long time , so she never wasted these stones .
She would fill a heatproof bag with dried cherry stones and heat it in oven .
She put this heated bag under my feet whenever I had stomachache .
I ’m always in favor of trying herbal healing before any medicine just like grandma as I believe that nature has all remedies if used right .
Cherries are mostly in various tones of red , but we have a unique species of cherries in Turkey , yellow cherries .
They are so rare in our country that it is grown in few regions .
I do n’t know if it ’s grown in other countries .
It has a very limited season here , so if you see it at the market , you should n’t miss that chance .
Yellow cherries are sweeter in taste , that may be the reason why people prefer mostly these to make jam .
They make jam either from yellow cherries or sour cherries .
At the open market last week I had that chance and I bought 2 kilos of yellow cherries to make some jam .
Unfortunately I did n’t think how I would pit them .
In the evening , when I prepared the necessary cups in the kitchen and grabbed one cherry , I realized it would n’t be so easy to pit them .
I wanted them remain as they were , but how ?
Believe it or not , I spent great effort on scooping their stones .
After some time , getting tired , I gave up and just cut them in half and easily removed the stones .
I called mom in the morning and told my cherry adventure .
She laughed at me and asked why I did n’t buy a cherry pitter .
A cherry pitter ?
What was that , I ’ve never heard such a thing !
Gosh why did n’t I talk to mom a day before ?
Then she told me if I did n’t have that tool , I could use a paper clip as a hook to remove cherry stones .
She claims it works perfect .
It was too late for me !
Oh wait !
I ’m planning to making jam from sour cherry as well when its season comes , I can try either of these methods then .
If you know any other ways to pit cherries , I ’d be glad to hear .

The question of whether Osama bin Laden has ever visited the United States , a subject on which I have expended an unhealthy amount of energy in the course of various journalistic and biographical research , has now seemingly been settled .
Osama was here for two weeks in 1979 , it seems , and he visited Indiana and Los Angeles , among other places .
He had a favorable encounter with an American medical doctor ; he also reportedly met in Los Angeles with his spiritual mentor of the time , the Palestinian radical Abdullah Azzam .
All this is according to a forthcoming book by Osama ’s first wife , Najwa Bin Laden , and his son Omar Bin Laden , to be published in the autumn by St. Martin ’s Press .
First , some context for the book ’s disclosures :
In the autumn of 2005 , while conducting research in Saudi Arabia for the book that became “ The Bin Ladens : An Arabian Family in the American Century , ” I met a Saudi journalist named Khaled Batarfi , who had been a neighbor and friend of Osama Bin Laden in their teenage years .
During one of our interviews , Batarfi offered an account of Osama ’s early travels — to London , to Africa on Safari , and to the United States — that was suggestive of a young man who had more direct experience of the West than was generally understood .
Batarfi ’s account of Osama ’s American trip was particularly striking .
In December of that year , I wrote a story for this magazine about the private high school Osama had attended in Jedda , and how he was first introduced to the tenets of radical Islamic politics .
In that story , I also reported Batarfi ’s on - the - record but unconfirmed account of Osama ’s visit to America ; Batarfi believed the travel had occurred not long before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , in 1979 .
U.S. customs and immigration records from the relevant period had been routinely destroyed — and so the question of whether Osama had personal experience of America , and what that experience might have been , remained elusive .
( Bin Laden has never referred to any trip to this country in his writings or statements . )
While I found Batarfi to be credible , a single - source account , based on hearsay , could hardly be regarded as satisfactory .
Over the next several years , I came across several other fragments suggesting that Batarfi was essentially correct — these bits of evidence included a published account by one of Osama ’s workplace supervisors in Saudi Arabia reporting that Osama had once traveled to the United States , and more recently , an interview with Yassin Kadi in the Times in which Kadi recalled meeting Osama during the nineteen seventies in Chicago .
After the original 2005 interviews with Batarfi , I reported that
only one aspect of the journey made a particularly strong impression on bin Laden :
On the way home , Osama and his wife were sitting in an airport lounge , waiting for their connecting flight .
In keeping with their strict religious observance , his wife was dressed in a black abaya , a draping gown , as well as the full head covering often referred to as hijab .
Other passengers in the airport “ were staring at them , ” Batarfi said , “ and taking pictures . ”
When bin Laden returned to Jedda , he told people that the experience was like “ being in a show . ”
By Batarfi ’s account , bin Laden was not particularly bitter about all the stares and the photographs ; rather , “ he was joking about it . ”
Batarfi had it right , it now seems .
Here is Najwa ’s forthcoming account of their journey , according to a bound galley of “ Growing Up Bin Laden ” provided by St. Martin ’s Press .
One evening he [ Osama ] arrived home with a surprise announcement : ’ Najwa , We are going to travel to the United States .
Our boys are going with us . ’
I was shocked , to tell you the truth … Pregnant , and busy with two babies , I remember few details of our travel , other than we passed through London before flying to a place I had never heard of , a state in America called Indiana .
Osama told me that he was meeting with a man by the name of Abdullah Azzam .
Since my husband ’s business was not my business , I did not ask questions .
I was worried about Abdul Rahman because he had become quite ill on the trip and was even suffering with a high fever .
Osama arranged for us to see a doctor in Indianapolis .
I relaxed after that kindly physician assured us that Abdul Rahman would soon be fine .
… I am sometimes questioned about my personal opinion of the country and its people .
This is surprisingly difficult to answer .
We were there for only two weeks , and for one of those weeks , Osama was away in Los Angeles to meet with some men in that city .
The boys and I were left behind in Indiana with a girlfriend whom I would rather not name …
My girlfriend was gracious and guided me on short trips …
We even went into a big shopping mall in Indianapolis …
I came to believe that Americans were gentle and nice , people easy to deal with .
As far as the country itself goes , my husband and I did not hate America , yet we did not love it .
There was one incident that reminded me that some Americans are unaware of other cultures .
When the time came for us to leave America , Osama and I , along with our two boys , waited for our departure at the airport in Indiana .
I was sitting quietly in my chair , relaxing , grateful that our boys were quiet … .
I saw an American man gawking at me .
I knew without asking that his unwelcome attention had been snagged by my black Saudi costume …
I took a side glance at Osama and saw that he was intently studying the curious man .
I knew that my husband would never allow the man to approach me …
When my husband and I discussed the incident , we were both more amused than offended .
That man gave us a good laugh , as it was clear he had no knowledge of veiled women …
We returned to Saudi Arabia none the worse for our experiences .
Not a particularly consequential experience , perhaps , but surely one that has a life in Osama ’s memory and imagination — and another indication , among many available in his life , that he should be understood not only as a self - isolating radical imbued with millenarian religious narratives , but also as a modern and globalized figure whose experiences and outlook belong very much to our age .
In comments today , Israel ’s Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon once again rejected the US demand to freeze all settlement activity in the West Bank , saying that Israel willl never halt “ natural growth ” in the settlements , and “ will not suffocate the life of 300,000 Israelis who live in settlements in all legality . ”
Ayalon added that he did n’t believe the Palestinian Authority was willing to make a single concession , and that he believed it was unfair for the US to make so many demands on Israel given that situation .
Despite repeated demands from the Obama Administration , the right - wing Israeli government has repeatedly rejected the call and insisted that the US will eventually change its mind .
The move has proved relatively popular , and Prime Minister Netanyahu ’s approval rating has remained strong .
The Obama Administration has said the halt to settlement growth is necessary for its goal of a Palestinian state .
Netanyahu has supported , with some conditions , the notion of a Palestinian state , but has absolutely ruled out halting the growth of settlements .
— A North Carolina State University student who created a " monster " out of construction barrels on the side of a road near campus was sentenced Tuesday to 50 hours of community service .
District Judge Vince Rozier deferred judgment against Joseph Carnevale until Oct. 30 .
If Carnevale complies with the sentence , the charges against him will be dismissed .
Raleigh police charged the 21 - year - old history major and part - time construction worker last month with misdemeanor larceny and destruction of property after he took the orange - and - white traffic barrels from a construction site near N.C. State .
The 10 - foot " barrel monster , " which Carnevale said was supposed to be sticking out its thumb for a ride along Hillsborough Street , grabbed attention on social networking Web sites , with thousands of supporters calling on the Wake County District Attorney 's Office to dismiss the charges .
Hamlin Associates , the construction company that owns the barrels Carnevale used , has become a fan of his work and has asked him to create a replica of the figure that led to his arrest on June 10 .
" It 's been positive publicity for us , " Hamlin President Steve Hussey told The Associated Press in June .
" If we 'd known he'd do that good of work , we 'd have given him the barrels . "
Authorities pursued the case , despite the construction company 's desire not to press charges .
Because the case has been deferred , Wake County Assistant District Attorney Steven Saad declined to comment Tuesday .
" The law is what we enforce , " Raleigh police spokeswoman Laura Hourigan said .
" We go out every day and do our job , and the job is enforcement , and that 's why we did what we did . "
Carnevale said Tuesday that he understood why he was charged , and that he believes his sentence was fair .
He hopes to do his community service for Habitat for Humanity .
" As far as ( whether I ) should have been ( charged ) , there was a theft that occurred .
I guess on paper , yeah , I should have been , " he said .
" I was surprised in a city the size of Raleigh that they would go to the trouble . "
Carnevale said he plans to continue his public art and that , despite his arrest , " it was all worth it . "
His advice to other artists : " Do n't get caught . "

Carbon footprint calculator
We all know that certain choices use energy and cause pollution , but how do those things stack up against each other ?
For example , do you prevent more pollution by ditching your car or by going vegetarian ?
And how does the energy you save in your home compare to the energy you save by not taking a certain airline flight ?
I wanted to know , and I found the other online calculators did n't answer that question well , so I spent a solid week researching the data and creating the calculator below .
So give the calculator a whirl and see how you stack up !
By household ...
By person ...

X Electricity matters because most electricity in the U.S. is generated by burning coal .
Coal - burning causes tremendous pollution , and is a powerful contributor to climate change .
As a result , the coal industry has been touting what they call " Clean Coal " , which is little more than a marketing ploy .
There is no such thing as clean coal .
You 'll also note from the calculator that your house has a bigger effect on the climate than your car !
That 's why I put home energy first in the calculator .
Electricity used in different parts of the country creates different amounts of pollution , because some places get a larger share of their electricity from coal .
But this calculator keeps things simple by using U.S. averages for pollution caused by electricity .
You 'll get the most accurate answer by entering in the number of kWh you use ( which you can find on your electric bill ) rather than cost per month , since the cost of electricity in the U.S. varies widely from one area to another ( 7 ¢ to 30 ¢ per kWh as I write this ) .
If you enter $ / mo . then I first subtract $ 10 to estimate the fixed cost that the utility charges you each month for the privilege of being their customer , and then figure the rest was for energy at 11¢ / kWh , the national average .
The average U.S. household uses 920 kWh per year of electricity .
I assume that single - person households use half that .
( There are 2.67 people per household , but I do n't divide by 2.67 because I want to account for the fact that multi-person households are more efficient .
If I divide average household use by 2.67 then I 'll understate the individual 's use .
For example , both a 3 - person household and a 1 - person household will each have one refrigerator , so the fridge in the 1 - person house uses more energy per person . )
On a separate page I have complete sources , references , and calculations .
X You can enter your gas usage either as the amount you pay per month , or the number of therms you use per month ( which you can get from your bill ) .
If you enter the cost , then I first subtract $ 10 as an estimate of the fixed cost your gas company charges you no matter what , then figure that the rest was charged at $ 1.50 / therm .
If you enter the cost , then I first subtract $ 10 as an estimate of the fixed cost your gas company charges you no matter what , then figure that the rest was charged at $ 1.50 / therm .
If you know your fixed monthly charge is higher or lower than $ 10 , you can account for that to get a better estimate from the calculator .
For example , let 's say you enter in $ 14 .
The calculator subtracts $ 10 and figures you bought $ 4 worth of gas .
But say the gas company charges you only $ 8 / mo . to be a customer .
In that case you really used $ 6 worth of gas ( $ 14 - 8 ) .
So to get the calculator to figure you bought $ 6 worth of gas , enter in $ 16 , and it will subtract $ 10 , leaving $ 6 .
Only 64 million of the nation 's 107 million households use natural gas .
Of those using gas , they use 688 therms per year on average , or 57.3 therms per month .
To come up with the default figure for single - person households , I assume they use half of what a typical household uses .
( There are 2.67 people per household , but I do n't divide by 2.67 because I want to account for the fact that multi-person households are more efficient .
If I divide average household use by 2.67 then I 'll understate the individual 's use .
For example , both a 3 - person household and a 1 - person household will each have one hot water heater , but the water heater likely wo n't use 3 x as much energy in the 3 - person household , so the heater in the 1 - person household uses a little more energy per person . )
To figure the tons of carbon from the average household and the average person for the right - hand column , I divide the total amount of carbon generated by natural gas by the total number of households ( 107 million ) and the total number of people in the U.S. ( 300 million ) , respectively .
On a separate page I have complete sources , references , and calculations .
X You can enter your heating oil usage either as the amount you pay per month , or the number of gallons you use per month ( which you can get from your bill ) .
If you enter the cost , then I first subtract $ 10 as an estimate of the fixed cost your oil company charges you no matter what , then figure that the rest was charged at $ 4.00 / gallon .
If you know your fixed monthly charge is higher or lower than $ 10 , you can account for that to get a better estimate from the calculator .
For example , let 's say you enter in $ 14 .
The calculator subtracts $ 10 and figures you bought $ 4 worth of oil .
But say the oil company charges you only $ 8 / mo . to be a customer .
In that case you really used $ 6 worth of oil ( $ 14 - 8 ) .
So to get the calculator to figure you bought $ 6 worth of oil , enter in $ 16 , and it will subtract $ 10 , leaving $ 6 .
Only 8.1 million of the nation 's 107 million households use fuel oil .
Of those using oil , they use 889 gallons per year on average , or 74 gallons per month .
To come up with the default figure for single - person households , I assume they use half of what a typical household uses .
( There are 2.67 people per household , but I do n't divide by 2.67 because I want to account for the fact that multi-person households are more efficient .
If I divide average household use by 2.67 then I 'll understate the individual 's use .
For example , both a 3 - person household and a 1 - person household have a furnace , but the furnace likely wo n't use 3 x as much energy in the 3 - person household , so the heater in the 1 - person household uses a little more energy per person . )
To figure the tons of carbon from the average household and the average person for the right - hand column , I divide the total amount of carbon generated by fuel oil by the total number of households ( 107 million ) and the total number of people in the U.S. ( 300 million ) , respectively .
On a separate page I have complete sources , references , and calculations .
X As you can see from the calculator , the average home pollutes more than the average car .
The EPA reports the average fuel economy of the U.S. fleet as 22.2 mpg , but actual fuel economy is only 20.36 , as listed in the sources section .
Therefore , for whatever MPG you enter , the calculator assumes your car gets only 91.7 % of that .
There are 107 million households in the U.S. but only 99 million have a car .
Of those with a car , they use 1,141 gallons of gas per year on average , or 95 gallons per month .
To come up with the default figure per person , I divided the total miles traveled ( 2.3 trillion ) by average MPG ( 20.36 ) and divided again by the number of drivers in the U.S. ( 196 million ) , for 591 gallons per person .
I also use this in the right - hand column to come up with the amount of carbon generated by an individual 's driving .
On a separate page I have complete sources , references , and calculations .
X Most people are surprised to learn that the typical diet ( what people normally eat ) uses twice as much energy to produce than a typical vegan diet -- and therefore twice as much energy - related pollution .
The reason is that livestock are food factories in reverse :
We put about 14 times more food into a steer than we get out of it .
So we 're running 14 x as many tractors , using 14 x as much labor , flying 14 x as many crop -spraying planes , etc .
( The reasons a typical diet uses only twice as much as a meatless diet instead of 14 x are that other meats are n't quite as inefficient as beef , and that meat - eaters also eat plant foods . )
Here 's how energy - intensive beef is :
It takes 145 times more energy to produce beef than potatoes .
Grass - fed beef is not the answer for a whole host of reasons , the most important being that there is not nearly enough grazing land in the U.S. to raise as much beef as Americans currently eat .
Food choices are so important that the typical American could save more much carbon by going vegetarian than by giving up flying .
Vegans do even better , saving twice as much carbon .
( source )
That 's why I list Food higher in the calculator than flying .
It 's also one of the easier lifestyle factors to change .
It 's easy to choose a bean burrito instead of a hamburger .
It 's not as easy to get from New York to California without flying .
One buzzword these days is buying locally - produced food , so that it takes less energy to transport .
While it can't hurt to buy local , it 's a small drop in the bucket compared to the effect as going vegetarian or vegan .
Transportation of food to the store accounts for only 4 % of the greenhouse emissionsn involved in producing the food .
A scientist who analyzed food energy in a research paper concludes , " Buying local is not as important as what you eat . "
In other words , it 's much , much better to buy a pound of carrots shipped from far away than a pound of locally - produced beef .
( New Scientist reviews the research paper , Actual research paper , source for the quote )
For the calculator , I assume that kids eat 60 % as many calories as adults ( and therefore create 60 % as much carbon ) .
On a separate page I have complete sources , references , and calculations .
X The calculator asks for hours of flight rather than miles because most people have a better idea of how many hours they 've flown than how many miles .
The calculator averages the number of miles you took per trip , since shorter flights use more energy per mile than longer ones .
It 's no surprise that planes use huge amounts of energy -- and thus produce huge amounts of climate - changing gases .
The airlines are on the defensive about this and in their in - flight magazines you will see big full - page glossy ads touting their energy efficiency initiatives .
What they 're not telling you is that such changes make only a 2 % difference at best .
Most carbon calculators fail to include radiative forcing ( RF ) and thus underestimate the impact of flying by a factor of 1.9 .
RF basically means that the damage caused by planes is greater than normal because the pollution happens up in the sky .
This calculator is one of the few to account for RF .
RF is explained in more detail in pp. 26 - 27 a Dec. 2006 PDF report from Tufts University , which states : " To estimate the impact of an airplane trip a multiplier should be used on the CO2 emissions from jet fuel to account for full radiative forcing ....
Although more research is needed to fully understand the chemical processes in the stratosphere , the research used by the IPCC is robust .
We therefore recommend using a calculator that includes a multiplier for the increased radiative forcing in its carbon calculations . "
Alternatives to flying include : Taking a train or bus
Taking a cargo ship .
( I 've done that very thing , traveling across the Atlantic Ocean by boat . )
Vacationing closer to home
Taking fewer trips , but staying for longer periods of time
Teleconferencing instead of face - to - face business meetings
Would people consider not flying to save the environment ?
Sure they would .
A BBC poll found that over half would do so .
In fact , most Americans already do n't fly .
In a given year , only 43 % of Americans take a plane .
That number will surely decrease as airlines respond to increased fuel costs by cutting flights left and right ( making travel less convenient ) and raising airfares substantially .
If you can't give up flying , let me give you an out : the typical American could save as much carbon by going vegetarian than by giving up flying .
Vegans do even better , saving twice as much carbon as flying .
( source )
Many people come to this page looking for an answer to the question , " Which is worse : driving or flying ? "
The answer is flying .
Planes effectively get only 22.6 passenger miles per gallon when considering their special contributions to climate change .
That 's less than just about any car .
The default shown for flying by household is equivalent to the total number of passenger - miles flown ( 848 billion miles ) divided by 107 million households , multiplied by the percentage of trips that are personal ( non-business ) , which comes out to 5548 miles , which I 'm figuring as a 2 round - trips of 1,387 miles each way , which is closest to 13 hours of flying time total .
On a separate page I have complete sources , references , and calculations .
Tons of carbon dioxide emissions per capita
( I got this from the Hinkle Charitable Foundation which credits the Energy Information Administration ,
" International Energy Outlook 2003 " , but I 'm unable to find that report , or a newer version , on EIA 's website .
Wikipedia has a Carbon dioxide emissions per capita by country article . )
Which actions make the biggest impact
Action ( one person ) Carbon Saved
in one year Stop driving 6.0 tons Slash home energy use 5.2 tons Go vegan 2.2 tons Stop flying 0.9 tons
Note that most people can save twice as much carbon by going vegan than by not flying .
This assumes 5.5 hours of flying time per year .
The " reduce home energy use " line assumes using 150 kWh / mo .
on average , and no oil or gas .
( see sources )
Passenger MPG Transportation Mode 125.0 Bus 81.6 Typical U.S. car , 4 people 61.2 Typical U.S. car , 3 people 43.0 Airplane , w/o considering extra climate change effect 40.8 Typical U.S. car , 2 people 22.6 Airplane , after considering extra climate change effect 20.4 Typical U.S. car , 1 person
Flying is worse than driving
Planes get a respectable 43 passenger miles per gallon ( pMPG ) , but they cause 1.9 times as much climate change per gallon of fuel burned , by virtue of their being up in the sky .
So when we consider climate change , the plane 's efficiency is more like 22.6 pMPG .
That 's worse than most cars .
And if there are two people traveling in the car instead of flying , then the pMPG of the car is doubled , while the plane is stuck at 22.6 pMPG , because we 're already figured the plane 's pMPG on a per-seat basis .
The only time that flying is better than driving for a given trip is if there 's only one person in the car , and / or we 're assuming a very low - mileage car .
The most efficient way to travel in the U.S. is by bus .
Inter -city buses get a whopping 125 pMPG .
By contrtast , Amtrak trains get only 45 pMPG ( though that could be due to U.S. trains often running very empty ) .

Hummer - driving vegans use less energy than meat - eating Prius drivers ?
Michael Pollan made that claim , but it 's not true .
The calculator can help do the comparison .
A 10 mpg Hummer driven the U.S. average of 1000 miles / mo. generates 13.4 tons of CO2 per year , vs. 2.7 tons for a 50 mpg Prius , for a penalty of 10.7 tons for driving the Hummer .
By contrast , going vegan saves only 2.2 tons /yr .
So it is n't even close , it 's far worse to drive a Hummer than to eat meat .
But this kind of comparison misses the point :
Meat production really is energy - intensive and causes a tremendous amount of unnecessary pollution , it 's just that Hummers are even worse .
Anyone who 's serious about reducing their carbon- , energy - , or pollution - footprint is going to cut back or eliminate meat , especially as it's the low - hanging fruit .
Cutting back or going veg is the easiest way for most people to make the biggest dent in their footprint .

LONDON GRAND PRIX
Venue : Crystal Palace , London Dates : 24 - 25 July
Coverage : Our man was there on Saturday sending updates on twitter and flickr Triple Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt blew away the field to win the 100m in style at the London Grand Prix .
Despite racing into a strong headwind , the Jamaican eased ahead of the field after 50 m and strode clear before high - stepping over the line in 9.91 seconds .
His team - mate Yohan Blake was a distant second in 10.11 , while Britain 's Simeon Williamson finished in fourth with Jamaica 's Asafa Powell back in sixth .
" I 'm not invincible , " Bolt told BBC Sport after the race .
606 : DEBATE
Pure magic from the fastest man on the planet
MissyRed " Other people will have a good day when I do n't , but until then I 'll keep winning .
" Overall the main aim for me was the first 50 m and I did well , I got it right , so I 'm happy .
" I knew it was going to be a headwind so I was n't worried about the time .
I got a good start , the transition was good so I 'm happy with myself .
" I 'm still at 85 % ( fitness ) and after this it's all training , I 've got two or three weeks of good training to put in so I guess I will be 100 % by Berlin . "
With next month 's World Championships in Berlin fast approaching it was a display that would have been noted by Bolt 's rivals , including American Tyson Gay who runs in the 200 m at Crystal Palace on Saturday .
Former world record holder Powell , who was unbeaten on his previous three visits to Crystal Palace and insisted before the race that Bolt could be beaten , ran a sluggish race and was never in contention .
Tyrone Edgar 's hopes of being selected for Britain 's squad for the World Championships were hit when he was disqualified from his heat for a false start .

NBC ’s Kelly O’Donnell mentioned on The Chris Matthews Show that Democrats may look to go a different route on the torture investigation issue .
Some Congressional Democrats are considering the possibility of charging Bush administration officials who lied to Congress with perjury .
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :

O’Donnell said , “ A different approach to the concern about accountability with those interrogation memos .
Senior Democrats have told me that they might look at the possibility of were there false statements made to Congress , was there any perjury , when some of the people involved in policy and legal parts of all of that appeared before Congress a few years ago .
Now things have been declassified , compare them and see , is there anything there .
A different way to go at accountability of the so - called torture memos . ”
Let ’s be honest here , Democrats are looking for a way to investigate the Bush administration without turning this into something that Republicans can run on in next year ’s midterm elections .
If Congress can find documents which prove that members of the Bush administration knowingly lied to Congress , then they should go for it .
The Republican Party will have a more difficult time making their witch hunt argument if Democrats limit their investigation to the members of the Bush administration who lied to Congress .
President Obama has made it clear that he wants no part of this , so Congressional Democrats are flying solo on this one .
My hunch is that the point is n’t to throw people in jail .
The purpose of this investigation would be to gather information in order to figure out what happened .
The upside of using perjury is that the investigating committee can use their subpoena power to compel witnesses to testify .
It is almost a certainty that will be some sort of Congressional investigation .
The only remain question is how it will be carried out .
SHANGHAI ( Reuters ) - A popular Chinese online video showing a woman going hysterical after her male companion refuses to buy her a car is stirring debate about Shanghai ’s females , who are renowned for their demanding ways .
In the video , apparently shot on a mobile phone or handheld camera and carried on the widely read www.youku.com ( here ) , the woman is seen screaming at the man in a Shanghai car showroom .
It ’s already attracted over 1.7 million hits since it was posted some four months ago and is still drawing heated comments .
“ The car does n’t suit you , ” the man tells the woman , to which she answers screaming : “ It does suit me ! ”
“ It ’s like this each time we go shopping .
I ’m not buying this car for you ! ” he counters .
The woman is then seen jumping into and driving the burgundy sedan up and down the showroom , ignoring her frantically gesturing companion and the salesman .
Finally the man gives in , waving his credit card and shouting : “ Stop ! Stop !
I ’ll buy it !
I ’ll buy it ! ”
So far , the video has attracted over 1,000 comments , some supporting , others criticizing the woman ’s behavior .
But not everyone is buying the video , entitled “ What Shanghainese women are like , ” with some bloggers questioning its veracity and the stereotypical image it portrays of women from mainland China ’s richest and most cosmopolitan city .
“ I did n’t even hear one word of Shanghainese ! ” wrote one poster , asking why the whole exchange was in Mandarin rather than the local Shanghai dialect .
“ Listening to the accent you know they are not Shanghainese .
You people who say Shanghainese are bad -- how many do you actually know ? ” wrote another .
Others wondered whether the whole thing was a stunt by the car brand .
“ It ’s all been whipped up , ” one person wrote .
“ What great publicity . ”
Still , not everyone thought the woman was at fault .
“ I admire this lady .
In the end she won -- that ’s the moral of this tale ! ”
Or at least , that 's what the advertisers think .
It turns out a lot of these amazing , cutting edge products are really bullshit .
Not just bullshit , but bullshit you could make on your own , for next to no cost .
Such as ...
Every day you are bombarded with commercials for things you have to buy to avoid ending up bitter and alone in a pile of your own , reeking filth .
You trust these products , because they are state of the art and one of a kind , and because you are an idiot .
7 Audio Cables

How They 're Marketed :
The world of audiophiles is a strange and frightening one .
For them , the actual song is bullshit .
What really matters is the sound quality .
Do you want to listen to t.a.t.u all scratchy and low fidelity , whatever that means ?
Fuck no , you want to hear it with such clarity and richness the pseudo - lesbian antics are practically tickling your eardrums right alongside every awful note .
And you can't do that with your shitty Walkman .
You need high tech audio equipment .
Shit like Pear audio cables .
They fucking rule , because they cost thousands of dollars .
Pear stays in business based on the " holy shit " principle .
As in " holy shit , those speaker cables cost thousands of dollars " or " holy shit , I breathe through my mouth , and these cables cost thousands of dollars , therefore they must be the best and I should buy them . "

Pear 's
Anjou cables apply " rigorous consideration of applicable scientific and engineering principles followed by real world testing . "
That means they 're so highly advanced that when you use them to connect your 8 - track player to your speakers , if it happens under a full moon , Aqua may actually appear and sing " Barbie Girl " live for you .
No shit .
It 's happened before .
Twice .
It 's not like they 're doing anything else .
What it Really Is :
Like any audio cables , the Anjou cables -- and other insanely expensive cables like them -- are kinda sorta just cables .
Pretty much a few pennies worth of copper and plastic .
Not only do the expensive cables not make thousands of dollars worth of difference , they do n't make any difference .
To prove it , skeptic James Randi offered $ 1 million to anyone who could hear the difference between cheap cables and the high - end ones in a big , public " you are full of shit " throwdown .

Seriously , just take the blind hearing test , cheap cables vs. Pear , and if you can pick out the difference , you 're a millionaire .
As it stands , Randi still has his million dollars and you can get some decent cables at Wal - Mart for a few bucks .

Clayton Weatherston has been found guilty of the murder of Sophie Elliott .
The jury returned its verdict about 11.20 am at the High Court in Christchurch .
The verdict was greeted with sighs of relief and joy from the public gallery .
RELIEVED : Gil and Lesley Elliott outside the High Court in Christchurch this morning after Clayton Weatherston was found guilty of the murder of their daughter .
" You 're guilty , " an Elliott supporter said from the public gallery .
Lesley Elliott , Sophie 's mother , broke down immediately when the verdict was delivered .
She embraced with her husband Gil Elliott and then , surprisingly , with defence counsel Judith Ablett - Kerr QC .
DEAN KOZANIC / The Press CLAYTON WEATHERSTON : Stabbed Sophie Elliott over 200 times .
Weatherston betrayed little emotion in the dock , twitching his face somewhat when the verdict came down .
Weatherston will be sentenced on September 15 .
Outside the Christchurch courthouse today Gil Elliott said the provocation defence should no longer be an option .
LIFE CUT SHORT : Sophie Elliott had planned to move to Wellington to start a new job before she was stabbed to death by her ex-boyfriend Clayton Weatherston .
" I think there are people who will back us on that , " he said .
In comments to The Press before the verdict was delivered the family said the five week trial had been " painful " .
" It has not been easy to sit daily in court and listen , not only to graphic forensic evidence , but also to distortions and embellishments of the truth about Sophie and her life , " the family said in a statement .
Elliott 's brother Chris said there was " nothing about the legal process designed to make it any easier on victims . "
" We have had no choice but to sit and watch it unfold and hope for the best , whilst he is allowed to talk and pass notes to his legal team any time he wants , " Elliott said .
" Our lives will never be the same , but we are fortunate to have the unwavering support of family and friends .
They have been our strength . "
Weatherston had pleaded guilty to Elliott 's manslaughter but not guilty of murder .
He admitted stabbing her 216 times in an attack in the bedroom of her Dunedin home on January 9 last year .
Weatherston said he was provoked by the emotional pain of a tumultuous six month relationship with Elliott and because she had attacked him with a pair of scissors .
Weatherston , 33 , was a research fellow at Otago University .
He lectured a paper that Elliott , 22 , took in 2007 .
TRAUMATIC FOR ALL
A source said the trial had been " very traumatic for a lot of people " at the university 's economics department .
" Most people knew both the victim and Clayton , " the source said .
" It has n't been pleasant .
You can notice the change in people that have n't been the same since .
" There has been a lot of people in shock . "
Old school mates of Weatherston said he had to " serve his time . "
Dean Moeahu , who went to Dunedin 's Green Island School and Kaikorai Valley High School with Weatherston , told The Press there was no support for him .
" He definitely has to serve his time , " Moeahu said .
" From my point of view , I think it was sad for the fact of the parents having to go through the whole trial when it 's pretty clear cut . "
Another former school mate , who did not want to be named , said there was a lot of sympathy for Weatherston 's family .
" You speak to anyone in Green Island , everyone feels very sorry for the whole family , they 're devastated and I do n't blame them , " the man said .
' PERVERSE OPPORTUNITY '
Women 's Refuge chief executive Heather Henare joined Mr Elliott in calling for the provocation defence to be reviewed .
" Because of the way the defence was run , this trial became a perverse opportunity for a killer to continue to persecute his victim and her family after her death .
" The provocation defence is based on absolutely archaic notions about violence .
Once upon a time , society accepted that an affront to male privilege or dignity was a reasonable excuse to fly into a homicidal rage .
" This trial turned justice inside out .
The killer became the victim and Sophie Elliott was portrayed to us all as he chose to describe her .
Unfortunately for Clayton Weatherston the jury did n't buy it and nor did the hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders who watched him giggling on their televisions . "
Ms Henare said she had been " horrified to hear " Miss Elliott 's mother described as an unreliable witness and expressed sympathy for what her family had endured .
" I believe there will be a strong and justifiably angry reaction to the way this trial proceeded .
New Zealanders hearing so many of the details and seeing Weatherston taking the stand will have been absolutely dumbfounded that this remorseless killer has had a platform for his justifications and excuses - televised and thoroughly reported by the media . "
Counselling agency Relationship Services said the case was a reminder that extreme partner violence could occur in all sectors of society and was not restricted to couples who lived together .
" This is a well educated , articulate man who has resorted to violence on a number of occasions in response to relationship pressures , " national practice manager Cary Hayward said .
The agency said people who knew someone at risk from a partner should encourage that person to seek help .
Warning signs in a relationship include possessiveness , jealousy , stalking and controlling behaviour .
" People need to be aware these are not part of a normal , healthy relationship and should take action . "

Krugman vs. Ferguson : Letting the Data Speak
When giants like Paul Krugman and Niall Ferguson start to argue , they both sound compelling .
Ferguson says that interest rates are rising because of the deficit , and Krugman retorts that Ferguson has forgotten his first - year economics .
Fortunately , the data can speak , and it ’s time to give them a voice .
This is why I turn to my frequent collaborator , Eric Zitzewitz , who has an incredibly handy knack for getting financial data to speak clearly .
Eric ’s verdict ?
You ’ll have to keep reading .
Quantifying the Nightmare Scenarios II : Why Have Long - Term Interest Rates Risen ?
By Eric Zitzewitz
A Guest Post
There ’s no debating that long - term interest rates on government debt have risen .
But there ’s a pretty fierce debate about what it means .
Harvard historian Niall Ferguson interprets this as indicating that the bond market is worried about the U.S. deficit and the prospect of inflation .
Princeton economist Paul Krugman thinks it indicates that worries about deflation have eased .
It ’s a high - stakes debate : Professor Ferguson is arguing that the stimulus package has counterproductively stimulated inflation fears , while Professor Krugman thinks the stimulus has worked as intended by reducing the likelihood of deflation .
In fact , Krugman has argued for another dose of fiscal stimulus .
So who is right ?
Standard measures of expected inflation — such as the difference between 20 - year nominal and inflation - protected Treasury yields — have risen sharply , from an almost implausibly low 0.9 percent in December to 1.5 percent throughout February and March to 2.25 percent last week .
But an increase in expected inflation can come from an increased probability of high inflation ( bad news ; Ferguson ’s story ) or a decreased probability of deflation ( good news ; Krugman ’s story ) .
Resolving their debate requires measuring the likelihood of different inflation scenarios .
Let ’s do it .
The graph below plots the probability of different outcomes for the yield on 25 - year Treasuries on two different dates — late February and the end of last week .
I calculated these probabilities using the technique I discussed in my last post , which extracts the probabilities implied by option prices on those dates .
( Wonkish detail : I used the January 2011 options on the iShares Barclays 20 +
Year Treasury Bond exchange - traded fund ( TLT ) and converted bond prices to yields using the portfolio average data reported by iShares . )
The blue line shows that there was a lot of uncertainty about future Treasury yields in February , including a very large chance of very low interest rates , as in Krugman ’s deflation scenario .
But the green line shows that this deflation risk appears to have receded .
In fact , the recent increase in Treasury yields is almost entirely due to a reduction in the probability of the deflationary ( low nominal interest rates ) scenario .
Score this round for Krugman .
While Ferguson wrongly diagnosed the cause of the rise in interest rates , he is right that the markets are spooked about the risk of an inflationary breakout .
There ’s about a 7 percent chance that 25 - year interest rates will exceed 10 percent , although surprisingly , this risk was slightly higher back in February .
This is a fairly extreme scenario : long - term interest rates have not been above 10 percent since inflation was tamed in the mid-1980’s .
So there ’s a chance that Professor Ferguson may be right about the broader issue : now that deflationary worries seem to have eased , it might be time to start turning the fiscal policy battleship around .
Finally , let me suggest that Professors Ferguson and Krugman settle their dispute like gentlemen .
No , I do n’t mean pistols at dawn , or the modern equivalent .
Instead I suggest that Professor Ferguson purchase from Professor Krugman a January 2011 put on TLT ( the iShares ETF ) at a strike price of 55 ( which would profit if future yields were over 8 percent ) at the current market price .
If the two good profs would put their money where their mouths are , the whole debate may well become clearer , more civil , and more credible than the usual cheap talk , which may be our largest remaining national surplus .
SHIP OF FOOLS
by Ted Kaczynski
Published by OFF !
Magazine , a zine produced by students at SUNY Binghamton and edited by Tim La Pietra .
Once upon a time , the captain and the mates of a ship grew so vain of their seamanship , so full of hubris and so impressed with themselves , that they went mad .
They turned the ship north and sailed until they met with icebergs and dangerous floes , and they kept sailing north into more and more perilous waters , solely in order to give themselves opportunities to perform ever - more - brilliant feats of seamanship .
As the ship reached higher and higher latitudes , the passengers and crew became increasingly uncomfortable .
They began quarreling among themselves and complaining of the conditions under which they lived .
" Shiver me timbers , " said an able seaman , " if this aint the worst voyage Ive ever been on .
The deck is slick with ice ; when Im on lookout the wind cuts through me jacket like a knife ; every time I reef the foresail I blamed - near freeze me fingers ; and all I get for it is a miserable five shillings a month ! "
" You think you have it bad ! " said a lady passenger .
" I cant sleep at night for the cold .
Ladies on this ship dont get as many blankets as the men .
It is nt fair ! "
A Mexican sailor chimed in : " ¡Chingado !
Im only getting half the wages of the Anglo seamen .
We need plenty of food to keep us warm in this climate , and I m not getting my share ; the Anglos get more .
And the worst of it is that the mates always give me orders in English instead of Spanish . "
" I have more reason to complain than anybody , " said an American Indian sailor .
" If the palefaces hadnt robbed me of my ancestral lands , I wouldnt even be on this ship , here among the icebergs and arctic winds .
I would just be paddling a canoe on a nice , placid lake .
I deserve compensation .
At the very least , the captain should let me run a crap game so that I can make some money . "
The bosun spoke up : " Yesterday the first mate called me a fruit just because I suck cocks .
I have a right to suck cocks without being called names for it ! "
It s not only humans who are mistreated on this ship , " interjected an animal - lover among the passengers , her voice quivering with indignation .
" Why , last week I saw the second mate kick the ships dog twice ! "
One of the passengers was a college professor .
Wringing his hands he exclaimed ,
" All this is just awful !
It s immoral !
It s racism , sexism , speciesism , homophobia , and exploitation of the working class !
It s discrimination !
We must have social justice : Equal wages for the Mexican sailor , higher wages for all sailors , compensation for the Indian , equal blankets for the ladies , a guaranteed right to suck cocks , and no more kicking the dog ! "
" Yes , yes ! " shouted the passengers .
" Aye - aye ! " shouted the crew .
" It s discrimination !
We have to demand our rights ! "
The cabin boy cleared his throat .
" Ahem .
You all have good reasons to complain .
But it seems to me that what we really have to do is get this ship turned around and headed back south , because if we keep going north were sure to be wrecked sooner or later , and then your wages , your blankets , and your right to suck cocks wont do you any good , because well all drown . "
But no one paid any attention to him , because he was only the cabin boy .
The captain and the mates , from their station on the poop deck , had been watching and listening .
Now they smiled and winked at one another , and at a gesture from the captain the third mate came down from the poop deck , sauntered over to where the passengers and crew were gathered , and shouldered his way in amongst them .
He put a very serious expression on his face and spoke thusly :
" We officers have to admit that some really inexcusable things have been happening on this ship .
We hadnt realized how bad the situation was until we heard your complaints .
We are men of good will and want to do right by you .
But  well  the captain is rather conservative and set in his ways , and may have to be prodded a bit before hell make any substantial changes .
My personal opinion is that if you protest vigorously  but always peacefully and without violating any of the ships rules  you would shake the captain out of his inertia and force him to address the problems of which you so justly complain . "
Having said this , the third mate headed back toward the poop deck .
As he went , the passengers and crew called after him , " Moderate ! Reformer !
Goody - liberal !
Captains stooge ! "
But they nevertheless did as he said .
They gathered in a body before the poop deck , shouted insults at the officers , and demanded their rights : " I want higher wages and better working conditions , " cried the able seaman .
" Equal blankets for women , " cried the lady passenger .
" I want to receive my orders in Spanish , " cried the Mexican sailor .
" I want the right to run a crap game , " cried the Indian sailor .
" I dont want to be called a fruit , " cried the bosun .
" No more kicking the dog , " cried the animal lover .
" Revolution now , " cried the professor .
The captain and the mates huddled together and conferred for several minutes , winking , nodding and smiling at one another all the while .
Then the captain stepped to the front of the poop deck and , with a great show of benevolence , announced that the able seamans wages would be raised to six shillings a month ; the Mexican sailors wages would be raised to two - thirds the wages of an Anglo seaman , and the order to reef the foresail would be given in Spanish ; lady passengers would receive one more blanket ; the Indian sailor would be allowed to run a crap game on Saturday nights ; the bosun wouldnt be called a fruit as long as he kept his cocksucking strictly private ; and the dog wouldnt be kicked unless he did something really naughty , such as stealing food from the galley .
The passengers and crew celebrated these concessions as a great victory , but the next morning , they were again feeling dissatisfied .
" Six shillings a month is a pittance , and I still freeze me fingers when I reef the foresail , " grumbled the able seaman .
" Im still not getting the same wages as the Anglos , or enough food for this climate , " said the Mexican sailor .
" We women still dont have enough blankets to keep us warm , " said the lady passenger .
The other crewmen and passengers voiced similar complaints , and the professor egged them on .
When they were done , the cabin boy spoke up  louder this time so that the others could not easily ignore him :
" It s really terrible that the dog gets kicked for stealing a bit of bread from the galley , and that women dont have equal blankets , and that the able seaman gets his fingers frozen ; and I dont see why the bosun shouldnt suck cocks if he wants to .
But look how thick the icebergs are now , and how the wind blows harder and harder !
Weve got to turn this ship back toward the south , because if we keep going north well be wrecked and drowned . "
" Oh yes , " said the bosun , " It s just so awful that we keep heading north .
But why should I have to keep cocksucking in the closet ?
Why should I be called a fruit ?
Aint I as good as everyone else ? "
" Sailing north is terrible , " said the lady passenger .
" But do nt you see ?
That s exactly why women need more blankets to keep them warm .
I demand equal blankets for women now ! "
" It s quite true , " said the professor , " that sailing to the north imposes great hardships on all of us .
But changing course toward the south would be unrealistic .
You cant turn back the clock .
We must find a mature way of dealing with the situation . "
" Look , " said the cabin boy , " If we let those four madmen up on the poop deck have their way , well all be drowned .
If we ever get the ship out of danger , then we can worry about working conditions , blankets for women , and the right to suck cocks .
But first weve got to get this vessel turned around .
If a few of us get together , make a plan , and show some courage , we can save ourselves .
It wouldnt take many of us  six or eight would do .
We could charge the poop , chuck those lunatics overboard , and turn the ship to the south . "
The professor elevated his nose and said sternly , " I dont believe in violence .
It s immoral . "
" It s unethical ever to use violence , " said the bosun .
" Im terrified of violence , " said the lady passenger .
The captain and the mates had been watching and listening all the while .
At a signal from the captain , the third mate stepped down to the main deck .
He went about among the passengers and crew , telling them that there were still many problems on the ship .
" We have made much progress , " he said , " But much remains to be done .
Working conditions for the able seaman are still hard , the Mexican still is nt getting the same wages as the Anglos , the women still dont have quite as many blankets as the men , the Indians Saturday - night crap game is a paltry compensation for his lost lands , it s unfair to the bosun that he has to keep his cocksucking in the closet , and the dog still gets kicked at times .
" I think the captain needs to be prodded again .
It would help if you all would put on another protest  as long as it remains nonviolent . "
As the third mate walked back toward the stern , the passengers and the crew shouted insults after him , but they nevertheless did what he said and gathered in front of the poop deck for another protest .
They ranted and raved and brandished their fists , and they even threw a rotten egg at the captain ( which he skillfully dodged ) .
After hearing their complaints , the captain and the mates huddled for a conference , during which they winked and grinned broadly at one another .
Then the captain stepped to the front of the poop deck and announced that the able seaman would be given gloves to keep his fingers warm , the Mexican sailor would receive wages equal to three - fourths the wages of an Anglo seaman , the women would receive yet another blanket , the Indian sailor could run a crap game on Saturday and Sunday nights , the bosun would be allowed to suck cocks publicly after dark , and no one could kick the dog without special permission from the captain .
The passengers and crew were ecstatic over this great revolutionary victory , but by the next morning they were again feeling dissatisfied and began grumbling about the same old hardships .
The cabin boy this time was getting angry .
" You damn fools ! " he shouted .
" Dont you see what the captain and the mates are doing ?
They re keeping you occupied with your trivial grievances about blankets and wages and the dog being kicked so that you wont think about what is really wrong with this ship -- that its getting farther and farther to the north and were all going to be drowned .
If just a few of you would come to your senses , get together , and charge the poop deck , we could turn this ship around and save ourselves .
But all you do is whine about petty little issues like working conditions and crap games and the right to suck cocks . "
The passengers and the crew were incensed .
" Petty ! ! " cried the Mexican , " Do you think its reasonable that I get only three - fourths the wages of an Anglo sailor ?
Is that petty ?
" How can you call my grievance trivial ?
shouted the bosun .
" Dont you know how humiliating it is to be called a fruit ? "
" Kicking the dog is not a petty little issue ! " screamed the animal - lover .
" It s heartless , cruel , and brutal ! "
" Alright then , " answered the cabin boy .
" These issues are not petty and trivial .
Kicking the dog is cruel and brutal and it is humiliating to be called a fruit .
But in comparison to our real problem  in comparison to the fact that the ship is still heading north  your grievances are petty and trivial , because if we dont get this ship turned around soon , we re all going to drown .
" Fascist ! " said the professor .
" Counterrevolutionary ! " said the lady passenger .
And all of the passengers and crew chimed in one after another , calling the cabin boy a fascist and a counterrevolutionary .
They pushed him away and went back to grumbling about wages , and about blankets for women , and about the right to suck cocks , and about how the dog was treated .
The ship kept sailing north , and after a while it was crushed between two icebergs and everyone drowned .
The economy may have faltered , but the Internet continues growing by leaps and bounds as people keep moving online in droves -- and at faster speeds .
Content delivery network vendor Akamai ( NASDAQ : AKAM ) today released its Q1 2009 State of the Internet report , showing that on both a year - over - year and quarterly basis , the Internet is growing despite the current global recession .
The total number of IP addresses seen by Akamai 's network of global servers grew by 28 percent compared to last year .
In the U.S. alone , Akamai saw growth of 20 percent .
The speeds at which users are connecting to the Internet are also improving : Globally , connections grew faster by 29 percent on a year - over - year basis .
At present , average global connection speed to the Internet totals 1.7 Mbps , Akamai said .
In the U.S. , the average connection speed is now 4.2 Mbps , a 15 percent increase over the figure Akamai reported for the first quarter of 2008 .
" I do n't think we 've seen a significant impact from the recession on either the growth of Internet connectivity , which is trending upwards , or growth in broadband penetration , " David Belson , Akamai 's director of market intelligence , told InternetNews.com .
"
Even in spite of the recession , we 're seeing a lot of new fiber being put in and new broadband packages being brought to market .
I think it 's the kind of thing where people really are looking at connectivity as a utility like a water or electric bill . "
Broadband penetration also continues growing .
Akamai said that globally , 20 percent of all connections are broadband -- 5 Mbps or faster .
Japan also seized the top spot as the nation with the largest percentage of connections at 5 Mbps or faster , with broadband accounting for 57 percent of all of its Internet connections .
South Korea , which held the title of the world 's fastest for all of 2008 , slipped to second place with broadband accounting for 52 percent of all of its connections .
The U.S. continues to rank far behind , coming in twelfth in the world with 26 percent of connections at 5 Mbps or faster .
That 's a steep drop from its position last year , when , during the first quarter of 2008 , the U.S. came in seventh .
Meanwhile , the state of Delaware retained its crown as the fastest state in the nation with average connection speeds of 7.2 Mbps .
With broadband on the rise globally and in the U.S. , narrowband connection are correspondingly on the decline .
On a global basis , Akamai reported a 39 percent decline on a year - over - year basis in the number of narrowband connections , which it defines as dialup Internet connections at speeds of 256 Kbps or below .
Not all those lost narrowband connections end up as high - speed broadband connections , either :
Some users trade up to faster connections that still rank below Akamai 's cut - off .
The company does not include statistics on connection speeds between 256 Kbps to 2 Mbps , Belson said .
" We have the data , but when we put the report together , we figured it 's not interesting , " Belson said .
" The narrowband connections are interesting as it shows the people who are in the slow lane .
The 2
Mbps plus connections are the people that are able to consume the higher - quality video that is now being put online .
We looked at the mid-tier ( 256 Kbps to 2 Mbps ) and did n't see it as having an interesting impact . "
IPv6
Currently , Akamai tracks unique IP v4 address only and not the next - generation IP v6 address space .
Belson noted that Akamai currently has engineering efforts underway regarding IP v6 , but did not elaborate .
LRO 's First Moon Images
NASA 's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has transmitted its first images since reaching the moon on June 23 .
The spacecraft 's two cameras , collectively known as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera , or LROC , were activated June 30 .
The cameras are working well and have returned images of a region in the lunar highlands south of Mare Nubium ( Sea of Clouds ) .
As the moon rotates beneath LRO , LROC gradually will build up photographic maps of the lunar surface .
" Our first images were taken along the moon 's terminator -- the dividing line between day and night -- making us initially unsure of how they would turn out , " said LROC Principal Investigator Mark Robinson of Arizona State University in Tempe .
" Because of the deep shadowing , subtle topography is exaggerated , suggesting a craggy and inhospitable surface .
In reality , the area is similar to the region where the Apollo 16 astronauts safely explored in 1972 .
While these are magnificent in their own right , the main message is that LROC is nearly ready to begin its mission .
" These images show cratered regions near the moon 's Mare Nubium region , as photographed by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter 's LROC instrument .
Impact craters feature prominently in both images .
Older craters have softened edges , while younger craters appear crisp .
Each image shows a region 1,400 meters ( 0.87 miles ) wide , and features as small as 3 meters ( 9.8 feet ) wide can be discerned .
The bottoms of both images face lunar north .
The image below shows the location of these two images in relation to each other .

WASHINGTON 
At his inauguration in January , President Obama warned that times would get tougher before they got better .
He has been proved correct .
With unemployment already at 9.5 percent and likely to exceed 10 percent , much higher than White House officials predicted back in February , Mr. Obama has been facing attacks that his $ 787 billion stimulus program was either too timid or wrong - headed or both .
Now , just five months after Congress agreed on the plan , with only a fraction of the money actually out the door , Washington is debating the need for a second round of stimulus amid economic and political crosscurrents .
In Ohio , where unemployment is above 10 percent and where Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will visit on Thursday , Mr. Obama ’s popularity has dropped sharply .
In a poll by Quinnipiac University earlier this week , 48 percent of respondents said they disapproved of Mr. Obama ’s handling of the economy , while 46 percent approved , down 11 percentage points since May .
“ People are soured on the system , and that ’s understandable , ” said Senator Sherrod Brown , Democrat of Ohio .
“ People want to see more money for water and sewers .
They want to see more manufacturing growth .
They want to see what we ’re going to do beyond that . ”
The barrage of utterly inane celebrity tributes ( ” inspirational ” , “ a true hero ” , “ a genius ” , “ a gentle soul ” “ a treasure ” ) was to be expected .
The howling fans across the world , broken and gibbering nonsense for the rolling TV news crews ( ” he ... he died for all of us ” etc ) , the inevitable autopsy results in a few weeks , with their Swiss laboratory inventory of prescription tranquilisers , all this too is standard operating procedure .
What has stunned me and truly floored me in the past week or so has been the complete sidelining by the entire media of Jackson ’s later life .
Across the board , from every news channel to all the quality papers , there has been wholesale collusion in the notion that “ he was a great artist and , yes , there was some , umm , troubling stuff later on , but let ’s forget all that right now and just celebrate the music ” .
Hang on a minute .
I ’m not the kind of person to start Paedogeddon - style witch - hunts gratuitously , but ...
I thought I ’d find some real analysis of the “ troubling stuff ” somewhere .
But here ’s what we ’re getting : “ Another beautiful boy is gone , wiped out in an instant . ”
This was Germaine Greer in The Guardian .
She made no mention at all of the multiple accusations of child abuse levelled at Jackson ( although she was unintentionally hilarious when she wrote of his art no longer being fuelled by his ability to “ run with the kids on the block ” .
Uh , Germaine , love , they ’d be more likely to be running away from him ) .
Rather , she went on to wax lyrical about Dionysus and Orpheus and how we should “ salute this miraculous boy who will triumph over death ... becoming immortal through his art ” .
Well , the ancient Greeks were certainly a culture that would have sympathised with some aspects of Jackson ’s life .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Then there was the editorial in The Independent last Saturday which ( almost reluctantly ) allowed that there were “ most damaging of all , the accusations of child abuse ” , before going on to say that “ what will remain in people ’s minds long after memories of his sad fall have vanished ” – and this “ sad fall ” is priceless , suggesting something tragic and completely beyond Jackson ’s control – “ is how thrilling he was as a performer in his effervescent pomp ” .
There are at least several young men alive today who I am sure have very different memories of what it was to be caught in Michael Jackson ’s force field at the height of his “ effervescent pomp ” .
I have a feeling we might be hearing from some of them in the coming weeks .

He was acquitted , we are reminded .
Well , like many people in our post - OJ , post - Tyson world , I am not inclined to treat the acquittal of a celebrity with a billion - dollar legal team behind him by a Californian court as a gold - plated get - out - of - jail - free card .
But on the rolling news channels and in the print media in the days following the death perhaps a certain level of inanity was to be expected .
So it was with an almost purring sense of relief that I tuned into Newsnight Review last week : good old BBC2 .
Kirsty Wark , Paul Morley , Miranda Sawyer fer Chrissakes .
Now here would be an island of sanity , where the disgrace ( let me repeat , not the “ troubling stuff ” ) would be mercilessly exposed and dissected .
Over the next half - hour my jaw gradually dangled floorwards as we were treated to banal , celebratory fluff that made The Sun ’s tribute look like the work of Woodward and Bernstein on a particularly feverish night .
Paul Morley said things like : “ That ’s his genius – reinvention ....
He was an amazing science fiction creation . ”
Kirsty Wark called him “ unique ” .
Miranda Sawyer nodded a lot .
Then there was the playwright and singer Kwame Kwei Armah , who trotted out the old chestnut about how we must “ separate the art from the artist ” before going on to talk about how there was “ Michael the artist and then there was Michael the celebrity with ... with all the , the attendant problems that came with it ” .
He went on to say , unchallenged , how there were different Michaels and that he wanted to remember “ the Michael who made Thriller and Off the Wall ” .
There were also , presumably , different Hitlers .
Some people might like to remember the Hitler who reunited Germany and brought back full employment .
Not the later Hitlers , with their “ attendant problems ” .
The problem is that people keep on bringing up all the bloody stuff that these other later , more troublesome , Hitlers did .
You can probably make a claim for several different Peter Sutcliffes , one of whom was a model employee who was very nice to his mother .
The problem is ....
Another Newsnight guest called Jacqueline Springer picked up on the “ different Michaels ” point and ran out of the park with it .
She talked about the concept of a “ cookie - cutter Michael ” : you simply “ take the bits you want and remember them ” .
Aww diddums .
Lovely .
I ’ll take the songwriter and the dancer and just leave the paedophile thanks very much !
Finally , Kirsty Wark spoke up .
Here we go , I thought .
“ So you would n’t choose to remember the Michael who – say – dangled his baby off a window ledge . ”
Wow .
Nailed him there , Kirsty .
Much has been made of this ( of course idiotic ) bit of horseplay , but , truth , you see fathers taking greater risks with their kids in London everyday as they whizz along with their children perched precariously on bicycles .
Less of them , I imagine , fill kids full of booze , get them to watch online pornography and then offer to show them how to masturbate .
I ’d have thought the latter scenario more worthy of examination .
To go back to the Nazi analogy : our Kirsty , having the chance to bring up the concentration camps , cuts in with a reference to one of the other pesky Hitlers dishonouring the Nazi / Soviet pact .

And this was Newsnight .
I wanted to weep .
At this point let me state my own position baldly : I believe that , at least in his later life , Michael Jackson was an active , predatory paedophile .
( In terms of focusing on this I seem to be in the minority : Google “ Jackson death ” and you ’ll get something like 65 million hits .
Google “ Jackson paedophile ” and you ’ll get around 150,000 . )
I am very familiar with the argument of separating the art from the artist – Philip Larkin was a compulsive masturbator with racist views who loved pornography .
The poems were magisterial .
Wagner was a boiling anti-Semite .
The music is timeless .
Now , having racist views , masturbating to pornography , I can guarantee that everyone reading this paper has had some contact with practitioners of these dark arts .
I would not venture that everyone is on handshake terms with people who get little boys drunk and then try to abuse them – I ’m afraid I ca n’t embrace the good tunes and overlook the “ troubling stuff ” and the “ attendant problems ” just yet .
Anyone with me ?
Anyone else fancy a refresher course on the kind of man Michael Jackson really was ?
Good .
Let ’s go back a few years ....
“ The accuser , now 15 , remarked that ‘ Sometimes Michael would also give wine ’ to the New Jersey siblings ... which Jackson called ‘ Jesus Juice ’ . ”
As a novelist you know a linguistic bullseye when you see it and “ Jesus Juice ” is just too good .
It is exactly what a quasi- religious paedophile would call wine he has transferred to a Coke can and is trying to get a child to drink .
When I heard that detail during the trial it literally stopped me in my tracks .
Jordy Chandler , Jackson ’s first accuser , gave detectives a detailed description of Jackson ’s genital area , including distinctive “ splotches ” on his buttocks and one on his penis .
The boy ’s information was so accurate he was able to locate where the splotch moved to when Jackson ’s penis became erect and the fact that he was circumcised .
Jackson was brought in and his genitals duly photographed .
Soon after this shoot ( surely one of the stranger photo sessions endured by the singer ) was matched up to Chandler ’s description , Jackson suddenly agreed to settle Chandler ’s civil claim out of court for somewhere north of $ 20 m ( £ 12.2 m ) .
At this juncture , some details recounted in the affidavit of Gavin Arvizo , Jackson ’s second accuser , are also worth remembering : “ Jackson told him [ Arvizo ] that boys have to masturbate or they go crazy , and related a story about a boy who had sex with a dog .
Jackson , he said , then told him he wanted to show him how to masturbate . ”
Again the writer in me responds strongly to the tawdry reality of the dialogue here .
If you were going to make this stuff up this is exactly the tone you ’d be shooting for : the childlike vocabulary and anecdote marshalled as supporting fact .
It is just how you ’d attempt to convince a child to do something .
Ultimately one is faced with two options .
Either Jackson really was an innocent , a childlike man-boy who simply enjoyed hanging out with young boys , up to and including having them sleep in his bed ( ” There ’s nothing more loving you can do , ” he told Martin Bashir in the infamous 2003 documentary , while Arviso cuddled him adoringly ) , and that some of these children decided – in collusion with their money - grabbing parents – to take Jackson to the cleaners .
Or Jackson was an active , predatory child molester .
Personally I believe the allegations are very real .
Child sex experts will tell you the same thing over and over again : kids do n’t make this stuff up .
For a 13 - year - old , the thought of being forced to talk – in public , in detail – about sex acts is so abhorrent there is n’t a cheque big enough that you could dangle .
And what real concept of money does a 13 - year - old have anyway ?
Anyway , the eventual molestation trial was a freak show , with Arvizo ’s mother ending up on trial rather than Jackson , a terrible example of jurisprudence in which the prosecution just about proved that Jackson molested seemingly every little boy in Los Angeles except the one in the witness box .
Let us go down the Albert Goldman road for a moment .
( And the parallels between Graceland and Neverland are expected and wholly unsurprising : it is what happens when incredible fame , fortune and near - limitless power are bestowed on young men with no real education and no intellectual interests .
The pleasures of the inhabitants of the two mansions are near - identical : lying in bed , attended by lackeys , while you indulge your sensory pleasures : food , small boys , whatever . )
Let us picture what was , by all accounts – that of the staff , of the parents and siblings of various young accusers – this grown man ’s idea of a good time .
We descend into the chilled , darkened bowels of Neverland , passing the Mickey Mouse posters , the discreet alarm systems ( rigged to give advance warning of anyone approaching his chambers ) , we punch in the keypad security code required for access to the inner sanctum and we find the King of Pop : he lies on an enormous bed , numbed by opiates , smudged with wine or bourbon ( ” Jim Bean ” one of the boys called it , a malapropism that might be charming in other circumstances ) and surrounded by half - naked pre-pubescent boys .
A laptop is showing pornography , opened bottles of Pinot Noir and SKYY vodka are strewn around .
Jackson is watching Disney ’s Fantasia over and over again , drifting off up to the ceiling as a wave of the Dilaudid or Demerol hits him .
He cuddles the nearest boy .
His newest , most special friend .
The medical bag in the corner glistens darkly , filled with brown tubs of prescription candy and pre-loaded hypodermics .
Man , sweet dreams for the King of Pop .
“ Michael , ” an ex-adviser claims to have said to him once , “ you ’re going to wind up in a lot of trouble .
Why do n’t you stop all this stuff with the young boys ? ”
“ I do n’t want to , ” Jackson replied .
His answer has the acrid whiff of the dismissiveness of the potentate , the emperor .
It reeks of “ I like not this news .
Bring me some other news . ”
Finally , thankfully , for Jackson there will be no more news of any kind .
The author is a writer and former A&R ( artist and repertoire ) man whose novel ‘ Kill Your Friends ’ tells the murky story of a young record industry executive during the Britpop era .
No Duh . Farmers Will Benefit From Climate Bill : Says Vilsac
July 23rd , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
You ’ve seen the headlines :
Cows Operate Power Company as Side Business
Onion Farmer takes $ 2.5 Million to Bank For Electricity Production
More Carbon Sequestration Needed : Farmers Paid to Not Plant
Every day there ’s more news of the alternative energy that farms can make .
From cow poop .
From crop residues .
From onion skins .
From chicken feathers .
From wind royalties .
From solar power .
But you read cleantechnica .
Of course farmers will benefit from the climate bill .
HR2434 is designed to make it cheaper to switch to low carbon energy than to keep using fossil fuels that destroy our future .
Farmers ; however , are stuck with Fox News and Rush and the Heritage Foundation and CATO .
They are told
Your energy cost will soar under socialist Al Gore climate bill !
So they worry .
What Fox News and Rush wo n’t let them know is that …
Energy wo n’t be more expensive .
Oil and coal will be more expensive , yes .
But oil and coal are not the only way to make energy .
There are other ways to make energy .
Low carbon ways .
Farms have the raw materials for creating low carbon energy .
Wide open space for wind turbines .
Huge sun -filled fields of solar power .
Cow sheds full of methane gas .
Shucked corn stalks ready for biodiesel .
Farms are the new oilfields .
And now , with the climate bill , we have the financial incentives we need to start tapping into that new power .
Finally we have an administration able to do something about climate change .
All we need to do is just change how we get energy .
We can do that .
Farms are also key to mitigating climate change .
Carbon offsets will become increasingly valuable .
The EPA ’s analysis projects annual net returns beginning at over $ 1 billion a year and increasing every year .
By 2050 carbon offsets will net farms $ 20 billion annually .
“ USDA analysis in a new report strongly suggests that revenue from agricultural offsets ( afforestation , soil carbon , methane reduction , nitrous oxide reductions ) rise faster than costs to agriculture from cap and trade legislation .
It appears that in the medium to long term , net revenue from offsets will likely overtake net costs from HR 2454 , perhaps substantially .
A number of administration heavyweights — Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , EPA administrator Lisa Jackson , and science advisor John Holdren — told the Senate agricultural committee to relax .
Farmers will make out a lot better with climate legislation than without it , enjoying “ significant net benefits . ”
Secretary Vilsack brandished a new report from the Agriculture Department .
The upshot ?
Thanks to all the last - minute goodies included in the House climate bill , farmers stand to rake in a fortune from so - called carbon offsets . ”
( WSJ writers have to call carbon offsets “ so - called ” carbon offsets . )
Bottom line ?
That extra income will more than compensate higher energy prices , he said .
I think the writer means higher oil prices ; but in the Wall Street Journal they are not allowed to suggest that energy and oil are not synonyms .
Their readers might have heart attacks .

UPDATE : Mark Karlin at BuzzFlash came up with the perfect caption for this video :
[ O ] n " America 's News HQ , " guest pundit Ralph Peters suggested something to the effect that the Taliban should " save us the headache " and execute captured 23 year - old American soldier Bowe Bergdahl , because " it looks like " Bergdahl deserted his unit .
While prefacing his comments by stressing that a military decision should not be made until all of the facts surrounding Bergdahl 's capture are determined , Peters then ignored his own advice and encouraged the Taliban to kill this young man .
Fox News ' Julie Banderas was visibly shocked at the words coming out of Peters ' mouth , but did not challenge any of his statements before awkwardly ending the segment .

So , now , did n't John Sidney McCain " collaborate with the enemy " too ?
That would be the same J Sid who was the revered Rushpublic presidential candidate only months ago ?
Oh , silly me .
That was Sarah Palin .
J Sid was just along for the ride :
Oh my stars .
Allowing a commentator to talk about our military that way without so much as a peep ?
A guest wishing harm on one of our soldiers ?
That 's pretty appalling !
Really Faux Noise , you can do better than this .
Oh wait .
No you can 't . - More of Peters bullshit here here and here
Small electronics makers are struggling with -- and fighting against -- new state laws mandating they pay for electronic recycling programs for consumers .
Five companies , including ViewSonic Corp. , CTX Technology Inc. and ToteVision Inc. , are threatening litigation against Washington state 's new electronic waste law , which requires manufacturers to fund recycling and collection services for old TVs , personal computers and monitors

Even before he ran for re-election to the Senate , Norm Coleman saw more than his share of ignominious elections .
First he lost the Minnesota governorship to a former pro wrestler who called himself the Body .
Then he just barely managed to wrest a Senate seat from an opponent , Paul Wellstone , who had recently perished in a plane crash .
So can you really blame Coleman for having spent the last eight months furiously trying not to have to concede defeat to Al Franken — a man who once acted alongside a gorilla on the set of “ Trading Places ” ?
And yet all this protesting came at a real cost to the voters , because while Coleman was appealing his case to every Minnesota court that would hear it , his old colleagues back in Washington were actually grappling with some pretty consequential work — doling out a few trillion dollars in stimulus money and bailout funds .
And through it all , the great state of Minnesota exercised only half the voice afforded the other 49 states .
As they say in high - school locker rooms , Coleman refused to lose — even when it seemed clear that he had lost just the same .
Recounts and postelection wrangling are nothing new in America , of course .
Reconstruction ended in the South because of a prolonged presidential standoff in 1876 ; Republicans ultimately got to keep the presidency , in the person of Rutherford Hayes , while Democrats extracted a promise to withdraw federal troops from the old Confederacy .
Lyndon Johnson won his 1948 Senate primary only after the state Democratic committee voted to certify the ballots of dozens of loyal , albeit dead , voters .
Such epic elections are often clouded by revelations of fraud , and yet the mundane truth is that American democracy is a little like your bathroom scale .
If you want to know if you lost a pound or two , step on the scale and you ’ll probably find out ; if , on the other hand , you ’re looking to find out whether you ’ve lost an ounce , then the reading will vary every time you plant your feet .
Similarly , no democratic system , with its vulnerability to human error and mischief , can be calibrated to function precisely within a certain margin of error .
No matter how many new machines and monitors you deploy in the pursuit of perfection , some elections are always going to end in what is essentially a tie .

What is new are the lengths to which losing candidates will now routinely go — and the money the parties will spend — to avoid their certain fates .
It used to be that when a candidate lost by a few suspect votes , the first question that arose was whether he would seek a rematch .
Richard Nixon , who felt certain he ’d been mugged in several states in 1960 , exited quickly to begin plotting his return to office .
Now , it seems , the first question anyone asks — at least since the 2000 presidential quagmire — is for how long you intend to fight the results in court .
The governor ’s race in Washington State in 2004 was disputed for eight months .
More recently , the recount in a special election for Congress in New York dragged on for more than three weeks amid legal arguments over what did and did not constitute a valid ballot .
We ’ve already written a lot about the money that Microsoft is spending on advertising to promote its new search engine – Bing – from Web ads to the Bing - a - thon that aired on Hulu earlier this week .
Tonight , the company is giving fans of The Daily Show that watch it when it airs ( as opposed to recording it on DVR ) a bit of a treat .
Microsoft has purchased a full two and a half minute block of commercials , sponsored by Bing , and will use the time to “ fast forward ” the ads with a TiVo - like experience .
While this should be an interesting ad to see visually , it also means two more minutes of content from Jon Stewart .
Microsoft plans to use the same concept on ad buys across a number of shows over the next week , including CMT ’s Top 20 Countdown , George Lopez , Charm School with Ricki Lacke , and World / Road Rules Challenges : The Duel 2 .
We ’ll post video of what exactly this concept looks like as soon as we get it .
How ’s all of this advertising performing for Bing ?
Compete is out with some numbers today that show “ searcher penetration ” ( the percent of people doing queries ) for Microsoft was up 2.3 percent over the last week .
However , the actual number of queries those searchers were doing on Bing actually dropped .
In other words , while Bing ’s ad campaign is attracting curiosity , it might be translating to a net gain of zero so far .

( CNN ) -- Argentina 's Angel Cabrera won a dramatic three - way playoff on Sunday to capture his first Masters , rallying to defeat Kenny Perry and Chad Campbell .
Angel Cabrera celebrates on the 18th hole on Sunday after forcing a Masters playoff that he would go on to win .
In winning , Cabrera became the first South American to claim one of golf 's most - prized crowns .
Cabrera , Perry and Campbell all finished 72 holes on 12 - under par 276 to force the eighth sudden - death playoff in Masters history
The 48 - year - old Perry was leading heading into the 18th hole , but bogeyed to fall even with Cabrera and Campbell .
He would have become the oldest major champion in golf history .
It was the first Masters playoff since Tiger Woods beat Chris DiMarco in 2005 and the first three - man playoff since 1987 , when Larry Mize chipped in to beat Greg Norman after Seve Ballesteros was eliminated on the first hole .
Woods finished in a four - way tie in sixth place at eight - under par after carding a four - under par 68 in the final round .
Do n't Miss Woods and Mickelson light up final day
Two - time Masters champion Phil Mickelson , paired with Woods on the final day , mounted a tremendous last day charge , going to the turn in just 30 shots -- tying the record at Augusta -- before coming unstuck with a double bogey on the 12th .
He eventually carded a five - under 67 to finish in fifth place , three shots adrift of the playoff .
Cabrera overcame a rough start in overtime , after pushing his tee shot into the woods on the right on the first playoff hole .
He salvaged par on that hole and claimed the title one hole later .
" This is the Masters , " Cabrera said , the green jacket snug on his large frame .
" It 's a course that you can do a lot of birdies , a lot of bogeys .
A lot of magical things happen .
It 's simply the Masters . "
It was his second major title after winning the 2007 U.S. Open at Oakmont , holding off Woods on the last day , experience that proved invaluable in the final showdown with Perry and Campbell .
Since Walter Cronkite 's passing , new focus has been put on the decline of legitimate news sources in America .
The big three networks have fallen the way of the corporate cable news / propaganda networks and people are turning to alternate sources like The Daily Show to get a little truth with their news .
That 's why it came as no surprise that Jon Stewart was voted Most Trusted Newscaster In America in a recent Time poll .
Here 's the breakdown of the results :
Jon Stewart - 44 %
Brian Williams - 29 %
Charles Gibson - 19 %
Katie Couric - 7 %
Not to take away from Stewart 's accomplishments , but it does speak volumes about the way the American people view the major networks and their " news " departments -- and that they would take the word of a comedian more seriously than high profile , highly paid network news anchors .
Stewart has long taken on the corporate media , beginning with his notorious smackdown of the feckless Tucker Carlson on CNN 's Crossfire in 2004 , which lead to the eventual demise of the show .
Since then , he has been relentless in his pursuit of the truth , and C&L has been posting videos from The Daily Show for years , along with many other blogs , big and small .
Alan Greenspan continues his White - collar $ 100,000 speaking fee comedy tour in which he tells the audience that he had nothing to do with the housing bubble .
Those expecting to see a mea culpa concert from the former Fed Chairman are going to be waiting for a very long time .
According to the majestic maestro , a low interest rate environment has nothing to do with encouraging people to borrow .
This line of thinking from the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve is precisely the reason we created an ecology that was conducive to planting and growing excessive debt .
You would think that we have learned a lesson about excessive liquidity but the current Federal Reserve has gone even below the 1 %
Fed funds rate and is now hugging the zero bound range forcing the Fed to do the modern dance of quantitative easing .
What is quantitative easing ?
When the central bank reaches the zero bound like in our current economy causing monetary easing an impotent pursuit , the central bank then begins to purchase items such as treasuries and corporate bonds from banks and other financial institutions with money it has created ex nihilo .
That is , out of thin air .
Quantitative easing is n’t “ printing money ” but the central bank does create additional credit by merely increasing their balance sheet .
It is the electronic version of printing dough for banks .
Now to blame the entire housing bubble on Greenspan is not entirely correct .
However , what he did do was create an environment , with the blessing of the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury to create the biggest debt bubble in history .
Let us take a look at how year over year debt matched up with the drops in the Fed funds rate :
There is nothing more telling than the above chart .
The year over year change in household debt moves in near perfect synchronization with each subsequent cut in the interest rate .
Each cut increased debt exponentially .
The market in 2004 was telling us to cool our jets with debt :
In 2004 household debt hit a year over year peak .
It simply could not go anymore .
The market was screaming “ hike up the rate Greenie !
I have green shoot smoke coming out of my nostrils ! ”
At this point , anyone and everyone with a pulse had access to enough funds to buy any home of their choosing .
We hit the comical apex of the debt bubble .
The 30 year housing bubble reached a hilarious climax where no job , no income , and horrible credit meant that you were a perfect candidate for an adjustable rate mortgage with a 1.25 % teaser rate ( thanks Greenspan ! ) .
And of course Greenspan warned us about those toxic mortgages in 2004 that even in 2009 , still linger on the balance sheets of banks like a crazy ex-girlfriend .
Or did he ?
“( February 2004 – USAToday )
Overall , the household sector seems to be in good shape , ” Greenspan said .
Americans have been buying homes and refinancing mortgages at a record pace in the past several years , lured by low interest rates .
Most mortgages are fixed rate , so consumers can prepay when rates go down but do not face higher costs if rates rise .
Under adjustable - rate mortgages ( ARMs ) , which made up about 28 % of mortgages in January , borrowers usually have lower initial rates but face the risk of higher payments if rates in the broader economy rise .
While borrowers can refinance fixed - rate mortgages , Greenspan said homeowners were paying as much as 0.5 to 1.2 percentage points for that right and the protection against a potential rate rise , which could increase annual after - tax payments by several thousand dollars .
He said a Fed study suggested many homeowners could have saved tens of thousands of dollars in the last decade if they had ARMs .
Those savings would not have been realized , however , had interest rates shot up . ”
“ American consumers might benefit if lenders provided greater mortgage product alternatives to the traditional fixed - rate mortgage , ” Greenspan said . ”
That Greenspan .
Did n’t I tell you he was on a White - collar comedy tour ?
In that first chart that I included above , I also put in the historical trend of 30 year fixed mortgages .
You know , the traditional tried and tested kind once used in mortgage burning parties ?
As you can see , rates did decrease but nothing to the absurdity of the adjustable rate mortgage market .
We now know how painfully stupid that move was .
In fact , Greenspan also commented how great mortgage equity withdrawals had become to the vitality of our economy .
This guy is n’t the main reason for the current economic mess but he was the captain of the varsity debt bubble cheerleading club .
During this debt induced decade we have also redefined a few terms in our language :
Debt has now become credit
Usage :
We are currently suffering a credit crisis .
Junk bonds are now known as high yield bonds
Usage :
These high yield bonds sure screwed up my 401k !
Casino has now become the derivatives market
Usage : I was going to gamble at the MGM but decided to buy some AIG derivatives !
Toxic mortgages are now known as legacy assets
Usage : I hate toxic mortgages but man , I ca n’t get enough of these legacy assets !
Creating money out of nothing is now quantitative easing
Usage : I despise creating money out of nothing but I sure love them quantitative easing !
Now this is important because it has softened the negativity of what these words really signify .
What we are suffering through is the bursting of a debt bubble .
We have a market full of junk securities .
The market is full of toxic mortgages .
Yet you would n’t know that from the headline numbers .
In fact we have 24,700,000 unemployed or underemployed Americans yet in the headline number , we only hear about the 13 million unemployed .
Apparently working 10 hours a week at Wal - Mart for minimum wage is considered fully employed .
This would be a prime candidate for Greenspan ’s wonderful adjustable rate mortgage product of yesteryear .
Income stagnant or dropping ?
Go into debt !
Greenspan is the epic debt creator and is so good at filling a room with nonsense that he can fool people into paying him $ 100,000 for yapping about his legendary monetary failures .
Like the Wizard of Oz , except in his tool box he has monetary easing and interest rates and his road is paved with quantitative easing .
Time to finance those ruby red slippers .

An MRI scan shows how the nasal retinal optic nerve has connected to the left hemisphere of the brain ( image is inverted ) .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Scientists have discovered how a 10 - year - old girl born with half a brain is able to see normally through one eye .
The youngster , from Germany , has both fields of vision in one eye and is the only known case of its kind in the world .
University of Glasgow researchers used Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) to reveal how the girl ’s brain had rewired itself in order to process information from the right and left visual fields in spite of her not having a whole brain .
The right hemisphere in the girl ’s brain failed to develop in the womb .
Normally , the left and right fields of vision are processed and mapped by opposite sides of the brain , but scans on the German girl showed that retinal nerve fibres that should go to the right hemisphere of the brain diverted to the left .
Further , the researchers found that within the visual cortex of the left hemisphere , which creates an internal map of the right field of vision , ‘ islands ’ had been formed within it to specifically deal with , and map out , the left visual field in the absence of the right hemisphere .
Dr Lars Muckli of the Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging in the Department of Psychology , who led the study , said : “ This study has revealed the surprising flexibility of the brain when it comes to self - organising mechanisms for forming visual maps .
“ The brain has amazing plasticity but we were quite astonished to see just how well the single hemisphere of the brain in this girl has adapted to compensate for the missing half .
" Despite lacking one hemisphere , the girl has normal psychological function and is perfectly capable of living a normal and fulfilling life .
She is witty , charming and intelligent . "
An MRI scan clearly showing only one hemisphere of the brain .
The girl ’s underdeveloped brain was discovered when , aged three , she underwent an MRI scan after suffering seizures of brief involuntary twitching on her left side .
Apart from the seizures , which were successfully treated and slight weakness on her left side ( hemiparesis ) , the girl had a normal developmental and medical history , attending regular school and taking part in activities such as roller - skating .
In other cases , where patients have half of the brain removed ( hemispherectomy ) , to treat severe epilepsy for example , one field of vision is lost in both eyes - i.e. they see only objects on the left or right side of their vision .
In the case of the German girl , her left and right field vision is almost perfect in one eye .
Visual information is gathered by the retina at the back of the eye and images are inverted when they pass through the lens of the pupil so that images in your left field of vision are received on the right side of the retina , and images from the right are received on the left .
The part of the retina closest to your nose is called the nasal retina , while the other half is called the temporal retina , as it is next to the temples of the head , and both halves have separate nerve fibres which transmit the information received .
Normally , the nerve fibres from the nasal retina cross over in a part of the brain called the optic chiasma and are processed by the hemisphere on the opposite side .
The nerve fibres from the temporal retina remain in the same hemisphere , so this means that the left and right visual fields at processed by opposite sides of the brain .
However , in this case , the nasal retinal nerve had connected to the left brain hemisphere .
The scientists believe the right hemisphere of the girl ’s brain stopped developing early in the womb and that when the developing optic nerves reached the optic chiasma , the chemical cues that would normally guide the left eye nasal retinal nerve to the right hemisphere were no longer present and so the nerve was drawn to the left .
This implies that there are no molecular repressors to prevent nasal retinal nerve fibres from entering the same hemisphere .
Dr Muckli added : “ If we could understand the powerful algorithms the brain uses to rewire itself and extract those algorithms together with the general algorithms that the brain uses to process information , they could be applied to computers and could result in a huge advance in artificial intelligence . ”
The study , which was begun by Dr Muckli at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Germany and involved colleagues at the Institute of Medical Psychology at Goethe - University , Frankfurt - am - Main , is published in the ‘ Proceedings of the National Academy of Science USA ’ .

It 's time for Gov. Pawlenty to certify Al Franken 's victory so he can take his rightful seat in Congress .
We are waiting for the Minnesota Supreme court to rule which is supposed to come in June .
It 's highly doubtful that they will overturn the election results so Americans United For Change produced this ad to let him know that we 're watching .
And the state of Minnesota is watching too .
All the polls show that they want this carnival over and Franken to become their new Senator .
According to the Star Tribune Minnesota Poll , nearly two - thirds of the 1,042 adults surveyed believe Norm Coleman should concede the race .
A separate poll by the Alliance for a Better Minnesota shows about two - thirds of the 600 people polled believe the recount process was " fair , impartial , accurate , and carried out according to Minnesota law . "
The findings come after Coleman filed an appeal with the Supreme Court , following a 3 - judge panel 's ruling that Franken won the Senate race by 312 votes .
In his appeal , Coleman cites that there are over 4,000 rejected absentee ballots that should have been counted .
Political Analyst Ralph Doty , who himself voted for the Independent candidate , said at this point in the game , Minnesotans are being " deprived . "
Von Thill of Cloquet said he agrees .
" There 's more important things to get resolved right now , with the economy , and everything else . "
Gov. Pawlenty can't succumb to pressure from the Limbaugh National Committee and keep obstructing him .
If Norm Loserman wants to go to the Roberts Court , that should n't stop Gov. Pawlenty from signing off .
Call 800-657-3717 and tell him to certify Al Franken .
Ideas On Cyclical Investing : What to Do When Markets Are Up , What To Do When They ’re Down
As I write this , the S&P is up practically 40 % from its November 2008 lows and much of the stock market pain endured in the 2008 collapse has been alleviated , if not eliminated .
So what have we learned from this bull and bear market cycle ?
The two key pieces of investment knowledge I ’ve learned are also tried and true adages repeated in many a book on money management and beginner ’s finance .
(1) Asset allocation .
If I had more of my money in bond funds and bond ETFs , my overall portfolio would not have seen as much of a decline and I would n’t have been so concerned about my portfolio ’s future or the merits of even trying to invest at all .
(2) Keep enough cash on hand for the times when the stocks you watch go “ on sale . ”
These stocks will present good enough nominal value so that you can snap them up before they jump back .
This tenet assumes that you ’ve done your basic research and due diligence first .
Whether or not we ’re currently in a bear market rally or the beginnings of a real recovery , the markets are up in nominal terms .
I want to share with you some thoughts on what I think you should try to take advantage of when this happens for any extended period .
I also want to suggest what it might be good to do when markets are significantly down .
It ’s going to sound dangerously close to “ timing the market , ” but timing the market is not exactly what I mean here .
I ’m not talking about trading market cycles .
I ’m assuming you ’re basically a buy - and - hold investor like me , since most readers of personal finance blogs — if they invest in the stock market at all — also seem to be .
This is n’t about “ timing ” in the sense of trying to isolate an exact turnaround moment or the lowest / highest prices .
This is a much broader view of very large valleys and peaks that for most people would be impossible to miss .
Cyclical investing takes a view of the larger undercurrent of what is happening in the economy and not the daily ups and downs .
There ’s not a literate soul in America , I ’d guess , who does n’t know the economy went through a major upheaval over the last 7 months .
And besides , even if you ’re not a trader either , you still want to buy low , sell high , right ?
Even if all you invest in are mutual funds or index funds , these comments should apply to you too .
Your Portfolio Looking Good ?
What To Take Advantage Of When Markets Are Up
OK , let ’s get practical .
Forget about why .
Stocks are up .
Unless you ’re a strict dollar - cost - averager ( and you might still also have a dollar - cost - averaging plan going on in your portfolio ) , now is not the time to be adding to your stock portfolio ( unless an individual stock on your watchlist is for some reason not performing along with the market ) .
Consider these financial moves instead :
Revisit your foreign currency needs .
Do you frequently need to buy euros , pounds or Yen ?
Wild swings in the markets produce shifts in currency balances .
In a risk - taking climate , some currencies naturally fare better than at other times .

, now is a good time while prices are back up Thinking about buying gold ?
Up markets are better to do it in , since they often go hand - in - hand with consumer confidence and risk - taking .
Do n’t wait to buy gold until fear sets in and even your neighbour is talking about it .
You might have some very long waits .

Start developing some side income and / or increasing your main income – whether it ’s a small business or other project – so that it ’s there for some more income security in tougher times .
When The Economy and the Markets Are A Mess
If dividends have been suspended or cut , jobs are disappearing and home prices have fallen , you ’re in a downtrend .
The downtrend might also only apply to a certain sector or region .
But in general , doing many of the opposite things done in an uptrend make smart choices here .

, but in harsh downturns it ’s even more important .
Think about selling all that “ stuff ” you do n’t really need anymore as a way to make more cash .
The above schema is basically a “ store your nuts for the winter ” financial model .
But it ’s built on logic in addition to mere fear or insecurity about the future .
For those die - hard “ this looks too much like market timing ” critics , I would only suggest that you can probably modify this model so that , say , half your portfolio is done through dollar - cost - averaging ( eg. , same amount invested every month ) and the other half based on overall market trends if you can sleep with the extra layer of “ active ” investing it implies ( even though , like I said , this is not a trader ’s model – this is just about when to buy your stocks ) .
Stock market cycles present an opportunity for wealth building , if you keep your head around you .
What do you think , do you already put something like this into practice ?
Can you think of any good revisions / suggestions to add to it ?
I ’d love to hear your feedback .
I was born in 1969 when the population of Australia was just 12 million .
By the end of this year , our population will top 22 million .
To folks in other countries , that might n’t seem like much ; but it ’s a number that was n’t predicted to occur until the middle of the century .
Based on the current growth rate , it could more than double again by 2050 , exceeding 44 million .
An Australia with 44 million people ?
I ’m glad I likely wo n’t be around to see that as the place already feels crowded :)
We have a large country , but much of it is arid and while beautiful in its own way , is n’t really suited for a western lifestyle .
Actually , I do n’t know any countries that really are .
So does this milestone and rather unsettling revised prediction mean Aussies breed like rabbits ( another unwelcome import here ) ?
Not really , much of our growth is through immigration .
I have no problems with migrants as such – it would be rather hypocritical if I did as I come from migrant and refugee stock ; as do most of us .
Prior to European settlement , the country was in good hands with a comparatively small population of indigenous peoples .
While that was never going to remain the case ; we really need to consider how many people this country , meaning the Australian environment , can support – and the peoples of other countries need to consider their own population situation too .
The very frightening thing about our population growth is it ’s all about profit and “ prosperity ” .
We are actively encouraging it and we are growing our population based on the myth of infinite growth being possible .
To consider anything else is just too frightening for some and to accept that we ’ve probably hit the ceiling already is just unthinkable to others .
We ’re told we need more people in order to support those who retire and those who are unable to support themselves .
This is at best incorrect and at worst a blatant lie .
This growth is about making more money for the mega- corps and in turn , their shareholders .
This is about maintaining our “ standard of living ” which really means our wretched excesses that we ’ve convinced ourselves are fine .
The problem is , nature will fight back – we cannot continue to pull resources out of our environment the way we are , use them in the way we do and then dumping the toxic waste without it coming back to bite us .
We ’re starting to see that happen now through climate change .
Our “ standard of living ” * will * change – whether we do it the easy way by making necessary changes fast enough or the hard way when nature has finally had enough of us remains to be seen .
While changing light bulbs to CFLs and implementing gas saving strategies are noble and and necessary actions , one of the best ways we can take the pressure off the environment and something many of can do is quite simple ; in Australia ’s case , to stem the immigration tide and in many countries , for people to stop having so many kids – aiming for * at least * a zero population growth .
People often talk about their right to have children .
Nature does n’t recognize or care about those rights and deals with overpopulation in ways we find quite cruel .
It ’s not a topic for endless debate – it just has to be done .

Palin -Schmidt flame war
Todd Purdum's Vanity Fair story on Sarah Palin has really broken a dam .
CBS 's Scott Conroy and Shushannah Walshe , the McCain - Palin embeds who inked a book deal about the 2008 campaign , have the latest must - read report on conflicts between Palin and campaign manager Steve Schmidt .
The issue under dispute : Todd Palin 's membership in the quasi - secessionist Alaska Independence Party .
Conroy and Walsh :
On the morning of Oct. 15 , Palin was aboard her campaign jet and en route to New Hampshire when she happened to catch a disparaging CNN segment that touted the Salon.com story , complete with a provocative graphic at the bottom of the screen reading , " THE PALINS AND THE FRINGE . "
While shaking hands after a rally later that afternoon , someone on the rope line shouted a remark at Palin about the AIP .
The comment set her off .
She worried that the campaign was not sufficiently mitigating the issue of her alleged connection to the party , which despite a platform that harkens more to the Civil War than the 21st century , continued to play a serious role in Alaska politics .
Palin blasted out an e-mail with the subject line " Todd " to Schmidt , campaign manager Rick Davis and senior adviser Nicolle Wallace , copying her husband on the message ( all of the e-mails are reprinted below as written ) .
" Pls get in front of that ridiculous issue that 's cropped up all day today — two reporters , a protester 's sign , and many shout - outs all claiming Todd 's involvement in an anti-American political party , " Palin wrote .
" It 's bull , and I do n't want to have to keep reacting to it ...
Pls have statement given on this so it 's put to bed . "
After the jump : the rest of the exchange ...
Schmidt hit " reply to all " less than five minutes after Palin 's e-mail was sent .
" Ignore it , " he wrote .
" He was a member of the aip ?
My understanding is yes .
That is part of their platform .
Do not engage the protestors .
If a reporter asks say it is ridiculous .
Todd loves america . "
This clear cut response from the campaign 's top dog carried an air of finality , but it did not satisfy Palin .
She responded with another e-mail , adding five more names to the " cc " box , all of whom traveled on her campaign plane .
They included her senior political adviser Tucker Eskew , senior aide Jason Recher , the lone traveling aide from her Alaska office Kris Perry , press secretary Tracey Schmitt and personal assistant Bexie Nobles .
... " That 's not part of their platform and he was only a ' member ' bc independent alaskans too often check that ' Alaska Independent ' box on voter registrations thinking it just means non partisan , " Palin wrote .
" He caught his error when changing our address and checked the right box .
I still want it fixed . " ...
Clearly irritated by what he saw as Palin 's attempt to mislead her own campaign and apparently determined to demonstrate that the ultimate authority rested with him , Schmidt put the matter to rest once and for all with a longer response to everyone in the e-mail chain .
" Secession , " he wrote .
" It is their entire reason for existence .
A cursory examination of the website shows that the party exists for the purpose of seceding from the union .
That is the stated goal on the front page of the web site .
Our records indicate that todd was a member for seven years .
If this is incorrect then we need to understand the discrepancy .
The statement you are suggesting be released would be innaccurate .
The innaccuracy would bring greater media attention to this matter and be a distraction .
According to your staff there have been no media inquiries into this and you received no questions about it during your interviews .
If you are asked about it you should smile and say many alaskans who love their country join the party because it speeks to a tradition of political independence .
Todd loves his country
We will not put out a statement and inflame this and create a situation where john has to adress this . "
So when you watch his special , know two things :
1 ) That he tells these routines differently already , and 2 ) he 's already trying to move on to the next bit .
" Things evolve .
Your comedy evolves .
Bits evolve .
It makes it very hard to listen to .
With stand - up , it 's a constant need for perfection .
A desire to try to get things right . "
" There 's nothing you can do .
A lot of comics when they put out stuff too quick , you can listen to those jokes and see those jokes just have n't matured yet ... It takes a long time ... to get to the best version of it . "
How do you reconcile that ?
" You do n't .
You keep dong it .
You just keep writing it .
Doing new stuff .
You just have to accept the fact that it 's not really done . "
I know you talked about this on your blog already .
But it 's something all comedians have to deal with when they record a special , CD or DVD .
How do you let go of a joke , and worse yet , how do you let that joke get recorded on tape when you 've later refined it or made it better ?
" It sucks , man .
Because I just recorded it a couple of months ago , and there are jokes I see and hear , and think , I already have so many taglines that make the joke so much better . "
" I always find it interesting when people will argue without doing zero research , " Rogan told me over the phone earlier this week .
That 's a lot of people , though !
" We 're definitely dealing with people who are n't thinking .
They 're just spouting predetermined decisions or proclamations thieir team has made .
It seems people adopt this conglomeration of opinions that other people have found for them .
As a a staunch conservative , I think this way .
As a lifelong Democrat ... I BLANK .
But there 's people for you .
Silly monkeys . "
Joe Rogan has a new one - hour stand - up comedy special that debuts Saturday , June 20 , on SPIKE - TV .
Let 's talk about it .
Better yet , let 's talk to Rogan .
Actually , here 's a great place to start .
This is a clip from the special , " Talking Monkeys in Space , " in which Rogan talks about how some people are just so set in their beliefs that they came from Jesus that they cannot handle the idea of monkeys and evolution .
Tell me I 'm not crazy , meanwhile , to think the voice he uses for the Jesus - believer sounds oddly familiar :
Was Spike a natural fit for you because of your appearances on there analyzing mixed martial arts fighting , or did you have to talk them into getting into the stand - up comedy special game ?
" No , they were into it right away .
I think they 'd like to do a bunch of these things .
It 's right in with their demographic , anyhow , male - oriented programming .
I think there 's a lot of comics out there who would fit that bill .
And because Spike is owned by the same people ( Viacom ) , it 'll also air on Comedy Central . "
Do you find you use your martial - arts background and training in your approach to stand - up ?
" I think there 's something in martial arts , that there is some sort of connection .
If something is not funny , it 's just not funny .
If they do n't laugh , they do n't laugh .
There 's no way to pretend that it 's not what it is .
And in fighting , you either can defend yourself , prosper and thrive in competition , or you can't .
If a guy kicks your ass , he kicked your ass .
There 's no way to spin that .
Comedy is art , and art is subjective .
When I was first young and getting into comedy , it was very frustrating to me .
For one thing , I was young , I was 21 and I was n't very good .
I had thought of going back to competing , and fighting .
Because fighting is such an absolute thing .
Nobody has to like you .
You do n't have to seek anyone 's approval .
Whereas with comedy , it was much more of a gray area .
Especially with getting booked , you have to get booking agents to like you and take a chance on you and book you places .
You have to have guys who are willing to have you open for you .
Then it 's whether people like your material . "
I think maybe I mis-phrased my question .
You have a way onstage of telling people that what they thought was wrong , and I wonder if in metaphorically wrestling with people 's notions of how life is , that there 's more to that comparison of wrestling in the ring and wrestling with someone 's head and philosophy ?
" You can't really worry about that .
Getting them to come around to your way of thinking .
I try to think of the audience as a group of my friends .
I just try to be as honest and as precise about what I say as possible .
I just try to get to the heart of the matter . "
And yet , in your bit about Mount Everest , you kind of shake people 's foundations of mountain climbing and risk - taking .
The old adage about why anyone would be climbing Everest was , because it 's there .
You take a different tack .
" For me , it 's an opportunity to face death when there 's no benefit in it whatsoever .
There 's tribes that take different substances that provide near - death experiences ... rites of passages ... there 's different types of drugs .
There 's a category that they refer to .
They 're called ordeal poisons .
They 're a poison that does n't quite kill you .
It just makes you wish you were dead .
And when it 's over you have this newfourd appreciation for life . "
" What does n't kill you make you stronger , that old adage . "
Would that even apply to your saga dealing with other comedians and the industry over the past few years ?
" I think with that whole situation , it was more of , it gave me a little bit of clarity of who I was working with . "
You mean , like , say , Gersh ?
" The Gersh ( Agency ) and The Comedy Store .
The fact that they were willing to tell me to apologize to a plaigarist , or I was n't going to work with them anymore ... the funny thing is that Carlos dumped them like a year later .
Louis CK left them , too , which was an awesome sign of support . "
He got a call from Louis CK when everything with Mencia and their respective agency went down .
" Nick Swardson dumped them , too .
It was nice .
It was really just Hollywood .
Seeing that from the agents ... you guys are like right out of a Kevin Bacon movie from the ' 80s . "
" The reason why it 's good business is you can make money from it .
You can make money from white slavery and prostitution .
Is that good business ?
You are selling artists .
Now what it takes to become an artist ... when you have someone who 's basically a vampire sucking . "
And yet a network such as Comedy Central probably was in a tough position because they had built Mencia up so much and had so much riding on him with the series , DVDs and other merchandise , so they could n't really come out and say , hey , we know he 's a joke thief , or anything to that effect .
We get on a riff .
No , make that Rogan gets going .
And he eventually comes to this conclusion about Mencia 's act .
" He appealed to all forms of retards .
That 's really who he is , and they ( his fans ) like that act .
But they 're really dumb . "
The biggest acts usually have to go dumb to get mainstream appeal , though , do n't you agree ?
While the smart acts only find a cult audience ?
" If you do n't think there are 10 milion people that you could talk into anything .
They can't think straight . "
And two million of them are probably following Ashton Kutcher on Twitter right now .
" He 's fascinating on Twitter !
I like when guys try to be really profund in 140 characters .
This is n't going to work .
If you have something that deep and personal to say : Dude , write a blog .
You 're geting a chance to see the inner workings of peoples minds that we 've never gotten to see before , " he says of celebrities .
" It 's not them sitting down with Jay Leno talking about how much they love their wife .
There 's no social cues .
No band bringing them out .
It 's just them sitting at a computer .
You can see both how smart and how dumb they are .
John Mayer , that guy takes a lot of shit .
But if you read his blogs , he is a really thoughtful guy . "
Another non-comedy tangent follows , and we agree that Mayer 's sensitive songs and everything about him is packaged to have sex with the hottest women on the planet , and how that 's not a bad thing .
What about your Twitter approach ?
" Mostly I just try to be silly .
Like making fun of Al Gore .
Or sometimes I find an interesting article that I put up .
When I have ( he goes to check ) 28,409 current people who are now on my Twitter thing .
That 's like an audience that , I can entertain them .
Give them some funny things , things to think about .
It 's an interesting little outlet .
I think restricting the amount of characters , for a stand - up it 's good because of the economy of words , trying to get a point across as quickly as possible .
It 's not even a text message .
So it has to be quick . "
Do you think Twitter 's a good thing for aspiring comedians ?
" There 's guys that I follow .
One guy who pretends to be an abusive cop .
I sent him a direct message that said hey , your shit 's really funny .
I asked him if he ever thought about doing stand - up comedy .
He said he thought of doing open mic nights but this was his way to fuck around .
He was shocked by how many people thought he was being serious . "
It 's so much different than we were younger , as you also mention in your new special , talking about how people did n't used to have cell phones -- somehow tied into a bit about getting caught masturbating , by the way .
But it 's also such a different atmosphere for young people who want to be noticed as aspiring comics .
" Look at these guys ... Bo Burnham .
He has gotten really popular just from YouTube .
In a normal world , when I was doing stand - up 20 years ago , that kid would just be doing clubs and doing his own thing .
It 's pretty amazing .
Then , of course , Dane Cook .
Dane Cook became famous because of MySpace ... it 's kind of fascinating .
A lot of people do n't know how to approach it ( technology ) .
I 've figured out a lot of what to do just over the past few years .
I 've had my own site since 1998 , but I used it to fuck around ... I did n't use it as a marketing tool until I saw Dane Cook 's success with it .
You can cut out all the bullshit .
A lot of the things you have do as a comic ; the morning radio shows ... wouldnt it be great if you could just have enough people on your mailing list and say hey , I 'm in St. Louis next week and just have them show up ! "
Your buddy Doug Stanhope has achieved that , in a way , himself .
" Doug , he 's doing great .
Just because of word - of - mouth .
He 's developed this Hunter S. Thompson comedy gonzo thing going on ... drinking Jager bombs and having like - minded people come out to see him .
I went out to see him in Hollywood at a 500 - seat rock club and it was packed wall to wall .
He sold that out two nights in a row .
He 's getting the door at most of these places .
He was getting horrible offers from comedy clubs ... they like to strongarm comics ... they 'll try to squeeze you , get you to perform for as little as possible .
They feel they can get a certain amount of people no matter who is performing .
I still get good offers from clubs because of my TV presence and my relationships with them .
It 's a business .
I understand their point of view .
I understand where they 're coming from .
What 's important to me is makign sure I have a direct connection to the people who like my stuff .
So I blog .
I post to my message board almost every day , and I Twitter almost every day .
If you do that , you maintian a connection with people .
This is definitely the best era for stand - up comics " in that regard .
" Back in the day , what are you going to do ?
Answer mail ?
And lick envelopes and get stamps ?
Fuck that shit .
That would take you all day .
Emails take enough time to respond to personally . "
" I 've pretty much given up on MySpace .
Literally nine out of 10 emails I get on MySpace are spam now .
That place is like Chernobyl now .
It 's a wasteland . "
You also talk about being a dad .
Have you wondered if now you 're going to be one of those comics who tells dad jokes ?
" I definitely do n't want to be that guy who does kid humor who only parents can relate to ... nothing will turn off single audiences more than yapping about our wife and kids . "
We get onto another tangent about comics who have come and gone , and some who have changed completely , and it reminded Rogan of a time he and Dennis Miller were on an NBC press tour together ( Rogan for " Fear Factor " and Miller for his short - lived talk show ) , post - 9/11 , and found themselves standing next to each other at the urinals .
Rogan wanted to know what happened to make Miller change his tone so radically .
" I just really wanted to tell him and thought , I should play nice .
I 'm holding my dick .
He 's holding his dick .
Just casually talking .
It 's very strange when you see a guy turn a big big corner like that ... he always used to come off as this really educated bright young guy who didnt buy the bullshit .
And then he 's bought the biggest worst bullshit ever .
All of a sudden he thinks this dope who has gone along with the worst administration that this country has ever seen by a long shot ... and he 's just hopping along with it ? "
Even though Rogan took on Mencia and harbors ill will toward other infamous joke thieves , he questioned the basis for some other comedy feuds .
Such as David Cross taking on Larry the Cable Guy ?
" Is n't there a war going on and you 're upset that this guy is telling jokes ?
I think Larry the Cable Guy is funny .
Yeah , it 's not the most brilliant shit in the world .
But you do n't like it , you do n't have to laugh about it . "
" That 's like Led Zeppelin coming out and saying Sheryl Crow sucks .
Comics get angry about shit like that sometimes .
I 've talked to comics about alternative comedy and they get fucking angry .
THESE fucking faggots they cant make people laugh , so ... RELAX .
They like to do it their way .
You do n't have to see it .
But .
A lot of comics are very needy .
They feel like anybody else 's success somehow or another takes away from them .
It takes a spot that they could have had .
It could be a fat Chinese guy who 's doing a show about being a sushi chef , and a black skinny guy could be angry about him .
For some reason , a lot of comics will lash out .
It 's very unhealthy .
" But I remember when I was a young comic and see someone kill onstage .
I would n't get inspired .
I 'd be jealous .
Especially guys my own age .
Goddamn , looking at him he 's killing .
Goddamn ,
Why did n't I think of that joke .
Now i do that .
But it took a while to realize , that , ' God I wish I had thought that joke up , that does n't help anything .
But being inspired always helps . "
In this day and age of blogs , aggregation sites , personal recommendation sites , link publishing , twitter and more , its not unusual to get a news alert email , or to wake up and google a person , place or thing and find hundreds of references originated in just the past 24 hours .
Does it matter ?
Could something be published hundreds , if not thousands of times on the net and be read by no one ?
Fewer than 100 people ?
Fewer than 100 people that you care about ?
The answer is yes .
When should you care if something is published on the net about you , your company , or someone you care about ?
The answer is not often , and only when it comes from a “ professional outtie ”
Whats an “ Outtie ” ?
An Outtie is someone who publishes on the web .
There are two kinds of “ Outties ” .
Those that attempt to publish in a limited number of locations to a maximum number of readers or listeners , with a reasonable expectation of building a following .
They are the professional Outties .
The 2nd type are the amateur outties .
Those that attempt to publish in as many places as possible hoping they are “ discovered ” .
They publish in the comments section of a newspaper .
They produce videos and response videos .
They comment on blogs .
They may write a blog .
They post comments on facebook and myspace .
They may tweet and often reply to other people ’s tweets .
They may call talk radio stations .
They may send anonymous or even signed emails to people they do n’t know .
They forward emails .
They post comments on aggregation sites like Digg or Hacker News .
Some use their writings to brand themselves .
Others had behind anonymity and publish in volume to try to amplify a message .
Many engage in “ sockpuppetry ” and publish anonymously under any number of “ handles ” on blogs , forums , editorial boards , twitter and email .
Whereever there is a platform , the “ Amateur Outties ” wills will search it out and write and speak on it .
Even worse , some will automate the entire thing and escalate the volume to enormous levels .
The “ Innies ” on the otherhand are passive consumers of web writings .
They are traditional media consumers , where the media , regardless of platform is coming one way to them .
They only very rarely respond in public to the information they consume .
They read , watch and listen to the Professional Outties .
They ignore the amateur outties .
Why does this matter ?
Because the Amateur Outties may be creating most of the volume for blogs , tweets , recommendation and news sites on the internet .
What got me thinking about this was after talking to some people in the businessworld that were getting upset about things that were being written about them .
They were sending me links to blogs .
They sent me a link to something posted on some newspaper sites .
They were sending me cut and pastes of tweets .
They were sending me links to comments .
They were upset because in their mind they were under attack and an issue they were addressing had become “ a huge media debacle ” .
I tried to explain to them that the “ amateur outties ” really had no impact on 99.99 pct of the population .
That because its on the net , even if a newspaper puts it on their site , does n’t mean more than 100 people had seen it or cared about what they read .
I had to repeat to them over and over , that even if something is tweeted and retweeted .
If its published on 200 blogs .
If its on some newspaper sites , it probably has no impact .
How could that be ?
The first step was to click through from tweets to the home pages of the tweeters and show them that most had under 20 followers and then show them that it looked like some of the followers linked back to accounts that looked like they were set up by the same person .
In otherwords they were following and retweeting themselves to make it look like they were important .
The same held true with blogs .
I would use some different webstats sites to show they werent in the top several hundred thousand websites and to notice that there were zero comments on the blog and no original sites linked to the blog .
Then there were the newspaper sites .
I couldnt show them the specific amount of traffic for a given article , but I could show the lack of a single comment .
That for any articles for which there was probably more than a couple hundred readers , there would be at least a single comment .
If the “ amateur outties ” didnt know or care about your issue , then the innies / the rest of the world , didnt either .
It soon became clear to them that vast majority of what is written on the web goes unread and even that which is read , is quickly forgotten .
That even when something is heavily commented on , it is usually just an onslaught by the “ amateur outties ” .
Fragmentation applies to 100 pct of media .
We have gotten to the point where it is so easy to publish to the web , that most of it is ignored .
When it is not ignored and it garners attention , the attention is usually from those people , the amateur outties , whose only goal is to create volume on the web in hopes of being noticed .
Thats not to say there are no sites that people consume and pay attention to .
There obviously are .
Thats where the “ professional outties ” come in .
They are branded .
They have an identity that usually extends beyond the net .
They are able to make a living publishing , even if its not much of one .
They are the sites that people consume and may possibly remember .
The moral of the story is that on the internet , volume is not engagement .
Traffic is not reach .
When you see things written about a person , place or thing you care about , whether its positive or negative , take a very deep breath before thinking that the story means anything to anyone but you .
Recursing over the Pareto Principle ...
June 07 , 2009
Vilfredo Pareto :
do n't got time to shave .
I keep hearing rather a bit too much about this Pareto Principle .
Apparently , with just 20 % effort , correctly applied , I can achieve 80 % of the desired effect .
Marvellous stuff !
I was about to go ahead and do this when it occurred to me :
" Why waste all that time , doing a whole 20 % ?
" If I only did 20 % of that 20 % , then surely I could achieve 80 % of the 80 % ? "
Then with a little more head scratching , and the help of an excel spreadsheet , I determined that with just 0.8 % of the effort I could achieve 51.2 % of the result -- which is a PASS in anyone 's books .
So from now on , you will excuse me while I spend 99.2 % of my time :
Lounging around , drunk , in a pool bar and Determining exactly which 0.8 % of the effort to apply myself to .
Unless , of course , it takes 80 % of the effort to work out exactly which 20 % will achieve the desired effect .
And it takes ...

Dwayne De Rosario has performed as advertised since coming over to Toronto FC in a high - profile off - season trade .
The Scarborough native is tied for the team lead in goals with five , has added three assists and is a big reason TFC sits tied for first place in the Eastern Conference of Major League Soccer .
The 31 - year - old was recognized for his accomplishments yesterday by being named to the MLS All - Star First XI , which is set to play Everton FC of the English Premier League on July 29 in Salt Lake City .
But the all - star selection , De Rosario 's fourth straight , will take a back seat to his club duties as he 's expected to confirm today that he will skip the game for a TFC match against the Puerto Rico Islanders .
That game , scheduled the same night at BMO Field , is the first of a two - game competition against Puerto Rico , which will determine who continues to play in the CONCACAF Champions League .
TFC comes in as Canadian champions after edging out the Vancouver Whitecaps on goal differential .
They clinched the title in the three - team competition last month in Montreal with a 6 - 1 victory in which De Rosario scored the first hat trick in team history .

Google is putting millions of users at risk of fraud from hackers and needs to enable encryption by default on its most popular web apps , including Gmail and Google Docs , a gaggle of security researchers told the search giant Tuesday in an open letter .
At issue are the current default settings for Google 's popular web applications .
The settings use the secure " HTTPS " protocol only for logging in , and fall back to unencrypted browsing thereafter .
If a user does n't know how to force Google to use HTTPS full time , he 's vulnerable to a host of nasty hack attacks when using an open or badly secured network , particularly a public Wi -Fi spot .
Most of the web 's cloud computing applications leave users just as vulnerable to having their e-mail and social networking accounts hijacked , the letter admits , but the collection of security professionals is leaning on Google to take a leadership role .
" Few users know the risks they face when logging into Google ’s Web applications from an unsecured network , and Google ’s existing efforts are little help , " the letter reads .
" As a market leader in providing cloud services , Google has an opportunity to engage in genuine privacy
and security leadership , and to set a standard for the industry . "
The 37 signatories to the letter ( .pdf ) include the country 's top encryption and security experts , ranging from Ron Rivest – the inventor of some of the most popular encryption tools – to Rsnake , one of the net 's most agile good - guy hackers .
The posse seems to have been called together by Christopher Soghoian , a computer researcher , programmer and privacy provocateur .
The letter notes that Google locks down other applications , such as Google Voice , Health , AdSense and AdWords , by running all their traffic – not just the login – via the https protocol .
That 's how banks run their sites , since that encrypts the communication between a user 's browser and company 's servers , making it virtually impossible for a hacker to get at the data in transit .
That 's important , given how often people use open and untrusted wireless connections that can easily be snooped on .
Currently , Google 's web apps do require users to log - in via https , but after that , most users check their email , read their documents and look at their calendars " in the clear . "
That means any ne'er - do - well with the brains to install WireShark or Linux can sit in a cafe , using their packet sniffer to check , read , and look along with them .
Even worse , a clever attacker can " side - jack " the user 's cookie and actually log - in to those services at the same time the user is in them .
From there they can edit and delete your documents , scour your email for sensitive data and even send out mail under your name .
Google responded Tuesday morning , saying that it is already ahead of the pack by even offering HTTPS , and that the company is looking into whether it would make sense to turn it on as the default for all Gmail users .
" Free , always - on HTTPS is pretty unusual in the e-mail business , particularly for a free e-mail service , " Google engineer Alma Whitten wrote Tuesday morning on Google 's security blog .
" It 's something we 'd like to see all major webmail services provide .
"
The company is planning a trial where small samples of different types of Gmail users will be shifted to a default HTTPS to see how fast things load , how happy users are and what networks or computer setsups fair badly , according to Whitten .
" Unless there are negative effects on the user experience or it's otherwise impractical , we intend to turn on HTTPS by default more broadly , hopefully for all Gmail users , " Whitten wrote , noting that the extra cost associated with the computing power needed for encyrption was not holding the company back .
For right now , the security problems can largely be solved currently by into Google 's options and changing the " Browser Connection " setting from ' Do n't always use HTTPS ' to ' Always use HTTPS . '
Firefox users can also use the Customize Google extension to fix the problem for many Google applications , and others can force Google to use HTTPS for a particular session by going directly to a Google HTTPS address , rather than being redirected there .
( Note , the last solution does n't stop so - called sidejacking attacks unless users also change the Google account SSL option ) .
So why has n't Google switched on HTTPS for all accounts ?
Well , according to Google 's own post , the default to HTTP was made for speed and user experience reasons .
HTTPS sessions involve a lot more computation on both sides of the transaction , and that also means more load on Google 's servers – which easily translates into larger expenses for the company .
And that 's good enough security for users of a secure wireless or a wired network , unless there 's an intruder in the network or someone is spying on all of an ISPs ' internet traffic .
The letter 's signatories say Google engineers can solve any technical problems with always using https .
" Google ’s engineers have created a low - latency , enjoyable experience for users of Health , Voice , AdWords and AdSense – we are confident that these same skilled engineers can make any necessary tweaks to make Gmail , Docs , and Calendar work equally well in order to enable encryption by default .
Shorter version of the letter :
What do we want ?
H T T P S !
When do we want it ?
Now .

A bottle of Tylenol , which contains the ingredient acetaminophen , appears with its box wrapper , in Walpole , Mass. , Tuesday , June 30 , 2009 .
In a series of votes Tuesday , a Food and Drug Administration panel endorsed lowering the maximum dose of over - the - counter acetaminophen _ the key ingredient in Tylenol , Excedrin and other medications .
( AP Photo / Steven Senne )
( AP ) -- Government experts called for sweeping safety restrictions Tuesday on the most widely used painkiller , including reducing the maximum dose of Tylenol and eliminating prescription drugs such as Vicodin and Percocet .
The Food and Drug Administration assembled 37 experts to recommend ways to reduce deadly overdoses with acetaminophen , which is the leading cause of liver failure in the U.S. and sends 56,000 people to the emergency room annually .
About 200 die each year .
" We 're here because there are inadvertent overdoses with this drug that are fatal and this is the one opportunity we have to do something that will have a big impact , " said Dr. Judith Kramer of Duke University Medical Center .
But over - the - counter cold medicines - such as Nyquil and Theraflu - that combine other drugs with acetaminophen can stay on the market , the panel said , rejecting a proposal to take them off store shelves .
The FDA is not required to follow the advice of its panels , though it usually does .
The agency gave no indication when it would act on the recommendations .
In a series of votes Tuesday , the panel recommended 21 - 16 to lower the current maximum daily dose of over - the - counter acetaminophen from 4 grams , or eight pills of a medication such as Extra Strength Tylenol .
They did not specify how much it should be lowered .
The panel also endorsed limiting the maximum single dose of the drug to 650 milligrams .
That would be down from the 1,000 - milligram dose , or two tablets of Extra Strength Tylenol .
A majority of panelists also said the 1,000 - milligram dose should only be available by prescription .
The industry group that represents Johnson & Johnson , Wyeth and other companies defended the current dosing that appears on over - the - counter products .
" I think it 's a very useful dose and one that is needed for treating chronic pain , such as people with chronic osteoarthritis , " said Linda Suydam , president of the Consumer Healthcare Products Association .
The experts narrowly ruled that prescription drugs that combine acetaminophen with other painkilling ingredients should be eliminated .
They cited FDA data indicating that 60 percent of acetaminophen - related deaths are related to prescription products .
But some on the panel opposed a sweeping withdraw of products that are widely used to control severe , chronic pain .
Prescription acetaminophen combination drugs were prescribed 200 million times last year , according to the FDA .
" To make this shift without very clear understanding of the implications on the management of pain would be a huge mistake , " said Dr. Robert Kerns of Yale University .
If the drugs stay on the market , they should carry a black box warning , the most serious safety label available , the panel decided .
" If we do n't eliminate the combination products we should at least lower the levels of acetaminophen contained in those medicines , " said Sandra Kewder , FDA 's deputy director for new drugs , summarizing the panel 's vote .
Percocet and similar treatments combine acetaminophen with more powerful pain relieving narcotics , such as oxycodone .
If the combination products are eliminated , the acetaminophen and the other ingredients could be prescribed separately .
In effect , patients would take two pills instead of one , and be more aware of the acetaminophen they are consuming .
Vicodin is marketed by Abbott Laboratories , while Percocet is marketed by Endo Pharmaceuticals .
Both painkillers also are available in cheaper generic versions .
" The panel recommending banning Vicodin and Percocet seems a little draconian , " said Les Funtleyder , an analyst for Miller Tabak & Co .
Drug companies avoided the most damaging potential outcome with the defeat of proposal to pull NyQuil and other over - the - counter cold and cough medicines that combine acetaminophen with other drugs .
These drugs can be dangerous when taken with Tylenol or other drugs containing acetaminophen , according to the FDA , but cause only 10 percent of acetaminophen - related deaths .
" I do n't think we should be advocating a solution to a problem that really is not there , " said Dr. Osemwota Omoigui , of the Los Angeles pain clinic .
A recall of combination cold medicines would have cost manufacturers hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue .
Total sales of all acetaminophen drugs reached $ 2.6 billion last year , with 80 percent of the market comprised of over - the - counter products , according to IMS Health , a health care analysis firm .
" The acetaminophen people dodged a bullet , " said Erik Gordon , a University of Michigan business professor who studies the biomedical industry .
Even with the lower daily dosage recommendation , consumers will likely keep taking as many pills as they think they need to ease their pain , Gordon said .
Analyst Steve Brozak of WBB
Securities said the panel votes were a " shot across the bow " of the pharmaceutical industry .
" This basically puts more government oversight into something that heretofore has been less than present , " Brozak said .

Warner Bros. just debuted the trailer for the upcoming re-imagining of A Nightmare on Elm Street , including a full look at Jackie Earle Haley in the Freddy Krueger makeup .
The trailer starts with Freddy ( still alive ) being chased down a dark street by the mob that winds up killing him .
He ’s shouting that he ’s innocent , but the mob corners him and burns him alive .
As the flames come around him , he tears off his jacket , revealing the iconic sweater .
We hear the “ One , two , Freddy ’s coming for you ” song being sung by children and flashes of kids all around a graveyard .
One little girl has the claws slashed across her dress .
There ’s a girl in her room , reaching for something on a shelf and suddenly ’s Freddy ’s head is there , staring at her from behind .
A number of kids are shown , obviously under the effect of Freddy ’s dream powers .
One seems to be having a seizure on a rooftop and another is trying to burn herself with a car cigarette lighter .
There ’s a basement , filled with pipes and Freddy moving through the darkness , getting closer and closer to the camera between flashes of victims before the logo comes up .
A Nightmare on Elm Street is set to hit theaters April 30 , 2010 .

Hill lawmakers struggling to reconcile clashing views on overhauling the nation ’s healthcare system , President Obama on Wednesday appealed to the public not to let Congress put off action on his top legislative priority .
“ In order to make it happen , I ’m going to need ordinary Americans to stand up and say now ’s the time , ” Obama said at a town hall meeting at Northern Virginia Community College in the Washington suburb of Annandale , Va .
“ If Congress thinks that the American people do n’t want to see change , frankly the lobbyists and the special interests will end up winning the day . ”
The president issued a pointed critique of the institution where he once served , warning that lawmakers often are tempted to shunt aside politically sensitive issues .
“ For those who say , ‘ Well , you know what , this is something that is very complicated , so we should n’t rush into it , ’ that ’s what happens in Congress all the time , ” Obama said .
“ They have hearings , they write white papers , and then suddenly the lobbyists and the special interests start going at it .
And next thing you know , another 10 years has gone by , and we still have n’t done anything . ”

The administration has been working largely behind the scenes with congressional Democrats to develop legislation aimed at expanding coverage to all Americans , controlling costs and improving quality .
But recently , the president has stepped up efforts to keep healthcare at the top of the domestic policy agenda as the party ’s legislative proposals have run into stiffening opposition from Republicans -- and unease from some moderate Democrats over the cost of an overhaul that is expected to top $ 1 trillion over the next decade .
Wednesday ’s forum was Obama ’s third grass - roots event devoted to healthcare in the last three weeks .
And debate over healthcare legislation is expected to move to center stage after lawmakers return to Washington from their July 4 recess .
But leading Republicans , including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , have begun to call for slower action .
“ We could target the things that are askew in the system and fix them without this kind of massive overhaul , ” McConnell said on Fox News Sunday .
At the same time , while some polls show deep public support for overhauling healthcare , there is growing discomfort with government spending -- a development some experts fear could prompt lawmakers to try to delay action .

In a recent NBC - Wall Street Journal survey , more Americans said the deficit and government spending , rather than healthcare , should be the federal government ’s top priority .
“ That could send a message to Congress that it is not necessary to move this year , ” said Robert Blendon of the Harvard University School of Public Health .
“ What the president has to do is keep healthcare on the agenda so there is no way that when it gets ugly , Congress can say , ‘ We can go home and not pass anything . ’ ”
Obama has said he hopes to sign a healthcare bill in the fall .
On Wednesday , he implored his audience -- which submitted questions online as well as in person -- not to let that timeline slip .
Obama ’s staff screened online questions .

As he has done in recent weeks , the president highlighted the trials of Americans trying to get medical care while employers drop insurance and insurers deny coverage .
Obama also delivered a warning to the majority of Americans who have insurance and report they are happy with their medical care .
“ What ’s happened if you ’ve got health insurance ? ” he said .
“ Your employer ’s . . . increased deductibles .
They ’ve increased premiums .
Your out - of - pocket costs have gone up by about 62 % . . . .
Families have seen their healthcare costs double over the last nine years .
So you just project out nine years from now :
Your wages or incomes are n’t going up that fast , which means that a bigger , bigger bite is being taken out of your paycheck even if you ’ve got health insurance . ”

Do I Have To Talk You Into It
Animals that seem identical may belong to completely different species .
This is the conclusion of researchers at the University of Gothenburg , Sweden , who have used DNA analyses to discover that one of our most common segmented worms is actually two types of worm .
The result is one of many suggesting that the variety of species on Earth could be considerably larger than we thought .
" We could be talking about a large number of species that have existed undiscovered because they resemble other known species , " says Professor Christer Erséus .
The segmented worms that were studied by Christer Erséus , doctoral student Daniel Gustavsson and their American colleague , are identical in appearance .
From the very first time that they were described , they have been treated as the same species , and they are also found together in freshwater environments in North America , Sweden and the rest of Europe .
But when the researchers examined the worms using advanced methods for DNA analysis , they discovered that they were in fact two different species .
Both species of worm differ in one of the examined genes by 17 percent , which is twice as much as the equivalent difference between humans and chimpanzees .
The research results , which are being published in the journal Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution , could have major consequences .
For example , the worms are frequently used for laboratory testing around the world , to examine the effects of environmental toxins .
" Different species have different characteristics .
If it emerged that these two species differ in terms of their tolerance towards certain toxins , then it could be difficult to make comparisons between different studies , " says Christer Erséus .
And as this advanced DNA technology is tested increasingly within various animal groups , it could , according to Christer Erséus , mean that our perception of the earth 's biodiversity may need to be revised .
" There could be ten times as many species in total , compared with what we previously thought , " he says .
The new species of worm has not yet been given a name , since researchers have not yet decided which of the two will keep the old name , Lumbriculus variegatus .

A ' giant black mystery blob ' in the Chukchi Sea off the coast of Alaska has been identified as marine algae .
Initially speculated to be an oil spill , the mass was discovered by a group of hunters earlier this month near Wainwright .
The blob is reported to be stringy and hairy , and is tangled with jellyfish , among other debris .
The " thick , dark gunk " stretches for as much as 15 miles , and is moving at a slow drift .
Upon being first sighted , the U.S. Coast Guard flew out to investigate the mass , and local officials collected samples for testing .
Coast Guard Petty Officer Terry Hasenauer reported that " We responded as if it were an oil product .
It was described to us as an oil - like substance , thick and lingering below the surface of the water .
Those characteristics can indicate heavy , degraded oil , maybe crude oil , or possibly an intermediate fuel oil . "
Test results subsequently revealed that the blob is some sort of unusually extensive algae bloom .
" It 's definitely , by the smell and the makeup of it [...] some sort of naturally occurring organic or otherwise marine organism " , Hasenauer said .
The substance has remained entirely offshore .
However , there is still great uncertainty among local residents and officials alike : " We 've observed large blooms in the past off Barrow although none of them at all like this " , said Barry Sherr , an oceanography professor .
" The fact that the locals say they 've never seen anything like it suggests that it might represent some exotic species which has drifted into the region , perhaps as a result of global change .
For the moment that 's just a guess . "

In a few months when best - selling author Dan Brown 's new book The Lost Symbol hits Borders , chances are some customers will be stepping into the chain 's British stores to buy the e-book and a reader instead of the hardcover book .
Last week , Borders U.K. introduced a £ 189 ( $ 276 ) e-book reader called Elonex .
The Elonex will come pre-loaded with about 1,000 books and will support both the open - source ePub and proprietary Adobe formats .
It will be " completely compatible " with the 45,000 odd e-books sold through the Borders website , says the company .
" Digital bookselling is still in its infancy but we believe it is here to stay , " says Peter Newbould , commercial director at Borders .
" By launching the e-book reader , we hope to bring new customers into the market . "
Borders is not the only big chain store to embrace the e-book reader trend .
Its biggest competitor Barnes & Noble is reportedly working on introducing an e-book reader of its own .
And online , Amazon.com – which once called itself " Earth 's biggest bookstore " – has scored a hit with the most popular e-book reader to date , the Kindle , enabling it to generate an estimated $ 310 million in revenue .
" The big book stores are seeing Amazon take more and more market share of digital book sales , " says Sarah Rotman - Epps , an analyst with Forrester Research .
" E - books are a small part of the market but it is one of the growth areas and retailers do n't want to stand back and let Amazon get ahead . "
Since Amazon introduced the Kindle in 2007 , e-reader and e-books sales have exploded .
In May , E Ink , which almost exclusively supplies the black - and - white displays that power most e-readers said more than a million readers use its technology .
Though still a small percentage of overall book sales , e-books have been one of the fastest growing segments in the market .
Book sales fell to $ 24.3 billion in 2008 from $ 25 billion the year before , e-book sales nearly doubled to $ 117 million in 2008 from $ 67 million , a year ago .
Borders U.K. has n't created its Elonex e-reader .
Instead it is selling a device manufactured by Taiwanese company Netronix and re-branded by Elonex , a U.K. - based computer and IT services firm .
Borders will also offer a discount coupon booklet on e-books for the Elonex e-reader customers .
Earliers , Borders U.K. offered an e-book reader called iLiad for £ 399 ( $ 555 ) .
It 's a clever strategy to get a foothold in a growing market , says Forrester 's Epps .
" Borders is smart to take advantage of an existing product that they can piggyback on to get a device into the market , " she says .
" Developing your own device is very time consuming and expensive . "
The moves by Borders and in the future by Barnes & Nobles is also attempt to stave off a fate that music retail stores have faced as records went digital , says Epps .
Still the transition is unlikely to be easy .
" It 's not a pretty picture right now for brick - and - mortar retailers , " says Epps .
" E - books sales are growing but they can't nearly bring in the same kind of revenue as physical books do , " she says .
Meanwhile , e-book readers promoted by big stores could also widen the gap between chain stores and independent book sellers who may not be able to offer an integrated e-book reading experience .
Survival is an issue for indie stores , agrees Stephanie Anderson , manager of a Brooklyn - based book store called Word .
But she says stores like hers hold a few trump cards .
" A lot of what independent book stores are about is a place for people to go , meet authors and talk about what they are reading , " she says .
"
For indies , the books are the most important thing but the community comes a close second . "
And then there are some books such as children 's books and cook books , says Anderson , where the paper counterparts are likely to outsell their digital namesakes .
" You can drop those into the bathtub or spill some sauce on it without it going bust , " she says .
An e-reader may not be for everyone but Borders is hoping inexpensive e-book readers widely available in retail stores could tempt some skeptics such as Russ Marshalek , a freelance publicist .
Marshalek does n't own a e-reader and says he is a strong supporter of indie stores .
" I very consciously shop independent book stores , " he says , " and will drive out of my way to get to one . "
Yet Marshalek would be open to buying an e-reader that 's priced right , even if it comes from a Borders or a Barnes & Noble .
Throw in a members discount for e-books bought from their store and Marshalek concedes he could be hooked .
" It could impact my impulse buy , " he says , " especially if they have in - store promotions and offers . "

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel rejects charges by Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and U.N. agencies that its January invasion of the Gaza Strip inflicted civilian death and destruction on an unjustifiable scale .

Now , some of the Israeli soldiers who took part say they were urged by commanders to shoot first and worry later about sorting out civilians from combatants .
Accordingly , they say , the force went into Gaza with guns blazing .
In print and video testimony published on Wednesday by the activist group Breaking the Silence , the 30 soldiers say the Israeli army ’s imperative was to minimize its own casualties to ensure Israeli public support for the operation .
“ Better hit an innocent than hesitate to target an enemy , ” is a typical description by one unidentified soldier of his understanding of instructions repeated at pre-invasion briefings and during the 22 - day operation , from December 27 to January 18 .
“ If you ’re not sure , kill .
Fire power was insane .
We went in and the booms were just mad , ” says another .
“ The minute we got to our starting line , we simply began to fire at suspect places .
“ In urban warfare , anyone is your enemy .
No innocents . ”
Israel ’s Operation Cast Lead had the declared aim of forcing Islamist Hamas fighters to stop firing rockets at towns in southern Israel .
A Palestinian rights group says 1,417 people were killed , 926 of them civilians .
The Israeli army put the death toll at 1,166 and estimated 295 dead were civilians .
Israel said 10 of its soldiers and three civilians were killed .
Whole streets in parts of the Gaza Strip were razed to minimize the risk of Israeli casualties from small - arms attacks and booby - trap bombs .
The United Nations says Gaza six months later is just beginning to clear 600,000 tons of rubble .
The Israeli military rejected criticism in the 112 - page Breaking the Silence report as “ based on hearsay . ”
But it pledged in a statement to investigate any formal complaints of misconduct , saying its troops had respected international law during “ complex and difficult fighting . ”
“ MORAL ARMY ”
Responding to the report , Defense Minister Ehud Barak said in a statement : “ The IDF is one of the most moral armies in the world and behaves in accordance with the highest ethical code . ”
He said any organization with information critical of Israeli military actions “ should bring it to me , as Israel ’s defense minister , and to the government that directed the IDF to restore peace and quiet to communities in the south . ”
Soldiers in Israel ’s largely conscript army have standing orders not to talk to the media .
The report includes testimonies of 30 “ who served in all sectors of the operation . ”
“ The majority ... are still serving in their regular military units and turned to us in deep distress at the moral deterioration of the IDF ( Israel Defense Force ) , ” it says .
Their narratives “ are enough to bring into question the credibility of the official IDF versions . ”
Except for a sergeant named Amir , the soldiers are anonymous and their faces digitally blurred .
Transcribed statements can be viewed at www.breakingthesilence.org.il.
The group said it had funding from Israeli human rights groups and the governments of Britain , the Netherlands and Spain , and from the European Union .
Soldiers describe a “ Neighbor Procedure ” in which civilians were forced to enter suspect buildings ahead of troops .
They cite cases of civilians advancing in front of a soldier resting his rifle on their shoulder .
The report repeats charges -- denied by Israel --- that white phosphorus was fired indiscriminately into Gaza streets .
It cites “ massive destruction was unrelated to any direct threat to Israeli forces ” and “ permissive ” rules of engagement .
“ We did not get instructions to shoot at anything that moved , ” says one soldier .
“ But we were generally instructed : if you feel threatened , shoot .
They kept repeating to us that this is war and in war opening fire is not restricted . ”
To strip away cover for Hamas fighters , aerial bombardment , artillery , demolition charges and armored bulldozers razed whole areas including gardens , and olive and orange groves .
“ We did n’t see a single house that was intact ... that was not hit .
The entire infrastructure , tracks , fields , roads , was in total ruin .
The D - 9 ( bulldozer ) had gone over everything , ” the report quoted a soldier as saying .
“ There was a clear feeling , and this was repeated whenever others spoke to us , that no humanitarian consideration played any role in the army at present .
The goal was to carry out an operation with the least possible casualties for the army . ”
Amnesty International has labeled Israel ’s actions as “ wanton ” destruction and said it was “ outrageously accusing the Israeli military of war crimes . ”
VERNON -- Police say it was an " attack . "
At this point , New Jersey wildlife officials say , it was an " incident . "
Either way , Henry Rouwendal , who was nursing a head injury , dislocated shoulder and other injuries at his Vernon home last night , says his run-in with a hungry black bear was " a pretty wild ordeal . "
" I 'm still hurting pretty badly .
My face is all messed up .
It looks like I 've been in a boxing match , " said the 52 - year - old electrical engineer .
" I 'm just lucky to be talking to you now . "
Rouwendal said he was in his driveway at about 10:30 last Friday night , loading the back of his sport utility vehicle for a business trip to New Hampshire .
Along with his bags was an Italian hoagie , loaded with salami and other meats , lettuce , onions and tomatoes .
Suddenly , Rouwendal said , something hit him from behind .
" It blind - sided me .
I was on the ground and I was thinking , ' What the hell just hit me ? ' " said Rouwendal , who also suffered a large cut on his left temple and several deep bruises on his knee , elbow and buttocks .
Rouwendal said was knocked , face - first to the ground .
When he rolled over , the bear was standing over him and then grabbed the sandwich .
" I kicked him three times in the snout and one time in the throat .
I think the one in the throat got him , " Rouwendal said , adding the bear started to run toward the rear of his home on Panorama Drive in the Lake Panorama section of Vernon .
Rouwendal said he lay on the ground for about an hour before he made it back inside his house .
He woke up his wife , Kathleen , a nurse , who tended to his wounds .
Vernon police believe the bear was a 300 - to 400 - pound female with two cubs that had been spotted several times in the area .
" It could have been a lot worse .
The bear could have done more than just knock him down , " police Lt. Daniel Zill said .
Rouwendal waited until Saturday to call police , who said the " attack " was first of its kind in more than 25 years in the Sussex County township , which normally has a large number of bear sightings and reports of bruins killing livestock , busting into homes and acting aggressively .
The DEP , which has set a trap for the errant bruin on Rouwendal 's property , said authorities have yet to classify the incident as an attack .
" At this point , it just does n't seem we will label this as an attack on a person .
...
He has no bruises , claw marks or scratches or even a ripped shirt that indicates it was a purposeful attack by the bear , " said Lawrence Herrighty , deputy director of the DEP 's Division of Fish and Wildlife .
Herrighty said it appears the bear went for the sandwich and not Rouwendal .
According to the state Department of Environmental Protection , bear " incidents " are growing in the northwest corner of the state .
Between Jan. 1 and May 20 of this year , the DEP received 693 calls about bears .
During the same period last year , it received 591 .
The reports show 71 of the calls this year involved livestock deaths , home break - ins and aggressive behavior compared to 62 last year .
State authorities and local police also have killed seven aggressive bears this year , the same number as last year , according to the DEP .
Classifying bear conflicts with humans has become controversial in New Jersey .
Two hunts were held , in 2003 and 2005 , to control state 's growing bear population , but opposition from animal rights activists prompted Gov. Jon Corzine to end the hunts when he took office in 2006 .
Now , bears are killed only by farmers with special permits and by police or wildlife authorities when they engage in dangerous behavior , such as home break - ins , attacking humans and killing livestock .
After Friday 's incident , the state set a culvert trap - a large metal cylinder with a heavy gated door that drops when a bear walks inside - on Rouwendal 's property .
Rouwendal said the bruin was nearly captured Tuesday night , but it escaped the trap and fled into the woods .
Despite his injuries , Rouwendal said he 's trying to remain upbeat about the attack .
" Maybe I 'll fill that trap with some sub sandwiches , " he said jokingly , adding that he 'll have the deli hold the lettuce , onions and tomatoes , which the bear left behind .
A while back , we mentioned a new mathematics journal with an unusual twist on peer review .
Rejecta Mathematica was founded with the mission of publishing articles that had actually been rejected by journal editors and peer reviewers , based on the reasoning that even mistakes can contain valuable information .
The risk , of course , is that the journal would be nothing more than an outlet for cranks and the bile of scorned authors .
The first issue is now out , and there 's no shortage of bile , but there 's also some fairly solid research and glimpses of how the online world has changed publishing .
Rejecta Mathematica , which is online only and open access , has some simple rules for publication .
Papers had to be submitted for peer review at one or more other journals , and they had to have been rejected , either by the journal 's editors or the paper 's reviewers .
The papers authors could then send a letter that describes the reason for rejection , along with the paper itself , to Rejecta , which would publish both as a single document .
There is an obvious tension at work in academic publishing .
A number of significant papers have been rejected through some combination of political maneuvering , editorial misapprehension of whether the research was sufficiently compelling , and basic misunderstanding of the work on the part of reviewers .
At the same time , researchers can always be counted on to overestimate the significance of their own work .
There is also no shortage of crackpots with a PhD , pursuing ideas that can be unnecessary or fundamentally erroneous , all while railing against the powers that be in their field .
The question is which of these would dominate the virtual pages of Rejecta .
Although I 'm not in any position to evaluate advanced mathematics , the answer appears to be " neither . "
There 's plenty of bile that hints at crackpottery ; for example , one author invites everyone to " Read the Narrow - Minded and Ignorant Referee 's Report and my response . "
In paraphrasing the response from a reviewer , another admits that he is " Quoting from memory , since I had rejected his rejection letter . "
This latter author seems to have some serious issues with his field , writing , " Where did I go wrong ?
Perhaps I should not have called professional mathematicians , in the first paragraph , ' meaning - imposers ' who generate ' inconsistencies and confusions . ' "
In fact , the term " Meaning - Imposers " appears in his title .
There 's another author who is apparently attempting to derive masses for particles using quantum mechanics without having a functional theory of quantum gravity .
I can't speak to the validity of the approach , but the author cheerfully admits that a string theorist has called the group using this approach " F- ing Crackpots " in a blog comment .
But there are also a couple of papers that appear to occupy a middle ground .
In one case , an author is apparently convinced that his work is novel , while the two journals he sent it to were not .
The math appears to be reasonable , however , as the authors noted that " one reviewer suggested a simplification of our proof , which we gladly used in our revision , which was also rejected . "
In another case , a group of researchers developed an algorithm that could perform halftoning ( an image transformation used for print ) via the well - understood mathematical approach of deconvolution .
It was rejected in part because the reviewers did n't find the image results very compelling .
There 's at least one article , however , that appears to be real , quality material .
It was submitted to a journal that took 8 months to reject it based simply on the fact that it ran too long .
In the meantime , the author had written a follow up , which has since been published and received a number of citations .
The first manuscript , languishing on the arXiv preprint server , has also started receiving citations , and has now accumulated more than a work the author actually published in the Journal of the American Mathematical Society .
So , it appears to be a quality piece of work that 's finally found a home in Rejecta .
Probably the least important lesson of Rejecta 's first issue is that there are mathematicians at war with their field , and using outrageous language in campaigning for their pet ideas .
I certainly knew they existed in the sciences , so the surprise would have been if math did n't have its share .
Nor is it a shock that the process of peer - reviewed publishing has its issues .
To paraphrase Churchill , editorial discretion and aggressive reviewers can make it the worst system , except for all the others .
Instead , the real lesson is that the Internet era has allowed researchers to recover from some of the problems with peer review .
The approach to quantum mass derivations may indeed be " F- ing crackpot , " but its adherents are getting the word out ( even if it is only via blog ) .
Meanwhile , the arXiv has managed to keep a valuable bit of research from disappearing down the memory hold .
Rejecta may be doing a service by putting these things in one place , but the work itself has clearly already found an audience .
The journal itself , in fact , represents a logical outcome of the low cost of hosting and the growth of open access research .
I find it kind of comical that Craig Crawford says that the upshot of the Sotomayor hearings is that Obama is now free to go “ hard left ” in his next Supreme Court appointment .
But the rest of his post is actually right on target .
“ Racially - tinged inferences , snide liberal bashing and the shameless pandering to anti-intellectual sentiment that once won the day for Republicans are now falling flat , ” he writes .
Indeed , the attacks have “ showcased just how narrow and out of touch their political base has become . ”
This is actually a very acute takeaway from this entire drama .
Consider that probably as much as 50 % of the Republican attack on Sotomayor has been about this ‘ wise Latina ’ comment , in essence an overwhelmingly white and ( in terms of elected officials ) overwhelmingly male party accusing a Hispanic woman of brining racism into the public square .
This is one of those cases where a discussion of the actual situation is apparently verboten .
I doubt anyone thinks that Sotomayor believes or ever believed that Hispanic women are inherently superior at legal reasoning than white men .
I take it that a comment like this is a bit of hyperbole in response to decades and longer in which the mentalities and reasoning power of marginalized groups like Hispanic women were taken to be too limited and parochial to achieve the kind of disinterest and breadth required to administer the rule of law .
That , and perhaps a sense that not only are they good enough but have particular experiences to bring to the job that these traditional worthies do not .
We all know this is what this means , right ?
It sounds like a lot of other people do too .
Almost 150 women living in the Maldives face a public flogging for indulging in extra-marital sex after being convicted by the Muslim country 's conservative courts .
Around 50 men also face the punishment .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Earlier this month , an 18 - year - old woman fainted after she was flogged 100 times having been found guilty of having sex with two different men .
The woman , who was pregnant at the time of sentencing , had her punishment deferred until after the birth of her child and the court said the teenager 's pregnancy was proof of her guilt .
In contrast , the accused men were acquitted , with one of them escaping punishment simply because he denied the charge .
The head of the country 's Criminal Court , Judge Abdulla Mohamed , told the island 's Minivan News that flogging was a deterrent and not designed to cause injury and said the person carrying out the punishment was prohibited from raising his arm higher than his shoulder .
" The public should know this lady or man have done these things and they will stay away from these things , " he said .
As to why fewer men were prosecuted , he said : " A man , after making this problem , will go away and maybe the woman will have relations with more than one man and wo n't know who was responsible .
Or the man denies it . "
But Amnesty International 's Maldives specialist , Abbas Faiz , called flogging " a cruel , inhuman and degrading punishment which is banned by international human rights law .
The practice is humiliating and leads to psychological as well as physical scars for those subjected to it for years .
[ It is ] a form of torture . "
The most recent official statistics available to the group date from 2006 and show that a total of 184 people were sentenced to flogging for extra-marital sex under a penal code that includes elements of Sharia law .
Of those 146 were women , with the majority of the punishments still to be carried out .
In the Maldives , an island nation made up of more than 1200 atolls , the issue of flogging has become a political battleground following the whipping of the teenager earlier this month outside a government building in the capital , Male .
Reports said that the women required hospital treatment after she was flogged in front of a jeering crowd of men .
Since then there have been a number of demonstrations in favour of flogging and several articles published defending its use .
Since the case was publicised there have been a number of demonstrations in support of flogging , some calling for the deportation of a British journalist , Maryam Omidi , who published reports of the incident in the local Minivan News .
" It 's hard to tell whether this is indicative of a wider feeling , because people are afraid to speak out , " Omidi said .
" But I had people calling me up to offer their support . "
In its first free polls held last year , the Maldives elected as its president Mohammed Nasheed , a former prisoner of conscience .
But campaigners say the liberally - inclined Mr Nasheed feels prevented from speaking because of his dependence on Islamist coalition allies and because of opponents who are using a debate over Sharia law as political lever .
The Islamist Adhaalath Party , which is a member of the coalition government , has denied organising these demonstrations .
Yet , some voices have spoken out .
" We do n't cut off the hands of all those who steal and we do n't implement the death sentence so why do we continue with these very inhumane practices , especially when the statistics show that the victims are women , " said MP Eva Abdulla .
Reports suggest that in recent years , many mosques in the Maldives have fallen under the influence of foreign , conservative imams .
The previous president , Maumoon Abdul Gayoom , who had been Asia 's longest - serving ruler and who positioned himself as the country 's " defender of Islam " , had sought to use the religion to bolster his dwindling .
The government in turn said that more conservative forms of the religion had been able to spread as restrictions on freedom of expression were lifted .

For Mr Nasheed , a former political activist who served six terms in jail , the controversy is a severe test .
While his inclinations may be of a moderniser , he remains dependent on the support of the conservative Adhaalath Party .
Indeed , the party is said to have a grip on the ministry of Islamic Affairs which Mr Nasheed created last year , apparently a political reward for its support .
Last night , presidential spokesman Mohamed Zuhair told The Independent the government was committed to fulfilling its obligations to international treaties that prohibit torture .
He added : " The president is holding meetings with all concerned parties to try and deal with this . "
Editor 's Note :
This is the second in a series of six features on the science of food , running daily from March 30 through April 6 , 2009 .
UTRECHT , the Netherlands — Just down the hall from a frozen vat of pig semen on the über - modern campus of Utrecht University here , Bernard Roelen pulls out a clear , rectangular flask from his precision incubator .
The molecular biologist is careful not to leave the door open too long , as slight fluctuations in air temperature , humidity or carbon dioxide are enough to upset the precious piece of pork growing inside .
If he succeeds in turning these embryonic stem cells into a slice of sausage , Roelen could make carnivory socially respectable even to the most ardent vegetarian .
" There is a point that the Earth is not big enough to have all the animals and the fields to feed all the animals , " he says , " You have to think ahead . "
According to ecologist David Pimentel of Cornell University 's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences , some 12,000 gallons ( 45,500 liters ) of water are needed to produce every pound ( 0.45 kilogram ) of beef , compared with just 60 gallons ( 225 liters ) for a pound of potatoes .
Beef requires 27 times more energy to produce than plant protein .
The methane burps of 56 billion farm animals ( as enumerated by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ) are a significant contributor to climate change , and their nutrient - rich manure pollutes waterways .
Raised under sterile conditions , lab - grown meat could reduce food - borne illnesses such as Escherichia coli and salmonella .
And , for some animal rights activists , meat may no longer be " murder . "
Slide Show : Growing Meat inside a Test Tube
In a prescient essay from 1932 , Winston Churchill wrote , " Fifty years hence , we shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium . "
Although Roelen has a lot of work ahead of him to fulfill Churchill 's prediction , the dream got a boost last April with the first In Vitro Meat Symposium in Norway and with the announcement by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) of a $ 1 - million prize for a commercially viable in vitro chicken product .
When I ask Roelen if he 's competing for the PETA prize , he chuckles , " We do n't work on chicken . "
In any case , with its four - year deadline , the PETA prize is nothing more than a publicity ploy , some skeptics insist .
After all , in the past three decades , scientists have only succeeded in deriving embryonic stem cell lines from two animal species : the mouse in 1981 and the human in 1998 .
" Saying you have meat grown in a lab would already be a big step , ” Roelen points out .
" Saying you have meat grown from a lab and it's mouse tissue — that 's asking too much . "
Presumably , the same goes for human tissue .
The Dutch In Vitro Meat project is the brainchild of businessman Willem van Eelen , now in his 80s , who nearly starved to death in a Japanese prison camp during World War II and came to believe that in vitromeat could solve world hunger .
He later took classes in biology and consulted with researchers and companies over 25 years , culminating in a series of patents on in vitro meat production , which he filed in the late 1990s .
In 2005 the Dutch government granted three universities and a Dutch meat processor owned by Smithfield Foods two million euros over four years to develop Eelen 's idea .
But the flask in Roelen 's hands today is just filled with a thin layer of fluid , the color of red Kool - Aid but slightly more viscous .
Floating within this growth medium , but not quite visible to the naked eye , is the protomeat .
" I get all these phone calls and e-mails from people saying , ' Can I taste something ? ' "
Roelen recounts .
" You can scrape the cells on the surface , and then you may have this snotty substance , but that would not be so good . "
I decline his offer of a taste , and he places the gooey mass under a microscope and adjusts the focus knob .
Suddenly , I see that the entire wall is speckled with the elusive embryonic stem cells that have the potential to transform into any part of the pig 's body — bones , blood , brains or , for Roelen 's work , muscle .
The process begins , ironically , with a nearby slaughterhouse , from which Roelen has retrieved pig ovaries .
The eggs mature in vitro and are then fertilized with pig semen , transforming them into embryos .
Placed in a nutrient bath , the embryonic cells divide and grow , changing along the way .
Some are just motionless blobs , but others pulse to an eerie rhythm , having spontaneously transformed into heart muscle despite Roelen 's desire to keep them in their undifferentiated state .
" You can see the cells have started to align , but they have not fused yet , " Roelen says .
" You want that process to be as efficient as possible . "
In the future , meat - growers may forgo the dish and culture stem cells on an edible , three - dimensional scaffold , and , with the right chemical signal , they would transform into sumptuous fibers of skeletal muscle protein .
Roelen 's colleagues at the Eindhoven University of Technology are even working on ways to " exercise " tissue through electrical stimulation to give them a more natural texture .
Unfortunately , Roelen 's cultures only survive a few months before they sputter , failing to reproduce because of genetic problems — their chromosomes become deformed or cells end up with too many copies .
His group also works with adult stem cells extracted from skeletal muscle — a direct approach for in vitro meat .
Tor Erling Lea , a biologist at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences in Aas who is also pursuing test - tube meat , acknowledges that Roelen is the leader in the field , but he 's not impressed with either the embryonic or adult approach so far .
" I think what they have achieved is what we could expect to achieve , " he says .
At last year 's In Vitro Meat Symposium , Lea presented his preliminary work on stem cells derived from the umbilical cords of pigs .
They are easier to work with , and he calculates that it 's possible to culture up to 10,000 pounds ( 4,500 kilograms ) at a time , but so far he has only produced fat and cartilage .
Even if Roelen 's team succeeds in culturing enough muscle cells for a bacon substitute , the team still faces with the problem of what to feed their disembodied animal .
The red Kool - Aid–colored medium has just about everything a growing muscle needs ; the only problem is that it 's derived from cow blood .
Vegetarians certainly are n't going to stomach bovine serum albumin .
Alternatives exist , but they are far too costly for food production .
Molecular microbiologist Klaas Hellingwerf of the University of Amsterdam believes that a suitable substitute lies in a medium based on yeast or algae .
He has done preliminary experiments to get genetically modified algae to produce a growth factor that will encourage Roelen 's stem cells to multiply .
Before I leave , I can't help but ask Roelen if he would consider eating his lab - grown meat .
" Why not ? " he responds , noting that people have no problem scarfing down imitation cheese and other processed foods .
He has a point , assuming he can get his meat past the snot phase .
NASA has reported that the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) has sent back its first images of Apollo lunar landing sites .
They say they will be releasing the images at 12 noon EDT ( 5 pm London Time ) , today , Friday 17th July .
Here is a link to the press release .
Update :
The photos have been released at http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/apollosites.html –
Not the clearest , but once the satellite gets to it ’s final orbit , we should expect images of the resolution I wrote about below .
The actual photos will probably be released at http://wms.lroc.asu.edu/lroc_browse.
Now , for the bad news …
Although the orbiter has a high resolution camera , reportedly able to do one pixel per sqare foot ( 0.3 m resolution ) , this is at perigee ( the closest point of orbit ) and at nadir ( directly overhead ) .
So far , the best images released are half of that ( one quarter of the resolution ) at one pixel per 0.56 m .
I decided to work out what to expect to see .
The lunar lander module has a maximum diameter of 9.07 m .
At 56 cm per pixel , this makes the lander 16 pixels in diameter … or like this :
Now , let ’s overlay it on the moon , with a shadow :
Image sources are :
http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/mwade/project/apollo.htm
http://wms.lroc.asu.edu/lroc_browse/view/iom20090703
I hope you were n’t expecting more than this …
At some of the Apollo sites , there will be tracks from the lunar rover .
The rover is 72 inches wide , which is 1.82 metres , or 2.8 pixels , but the actual wheel tracks will likely be under half a pixel wide so possibly detectable by their shadows .
The foot prints will come in at around 0.5 x 0.25 pixels , hardly detectable .
We should be able to see the actual rovers at 3×4 pixels , and the PLSS ( Life support back packs ) , provided they are lying flat at around 1 × 2 pixels , but bright white .
Although these images will be of great interest to us Apollo fans , the people who believe it was hoaxed wo n’t change their minds .
In his on - going quest to relentlessly shame Birther - sympathizing , race - baiting conservative talking heads , Jon Stewart introduced a hilarious new Daily Show competition segment last night called , " So You Think You Can Douche . "
Competing for the crown were three Gawker favorites — Sean Hannity , Lou Dobbs and , of course , Glenn Beck .
As you can probably imagine , this was indeed a contest for the ages , but alas , only one Douche King was left standing in the end .
Long live the Douche King .

My new book will be coming out in the spring !
It is about lesbians and dead moms and weird not - quite - dead creatures .
It is based on One Bloody Thing After Another .
Emily and I sometimes joke that A Softer World is mostly about lesbians , dead moms and zombies , and so at first that was how I referred to the book .
But it 's not really about zombies .
They 're just weird bloody violent creatures .
Also , youthful vandalism and vomiting ghosts and young love !
Spring ' 10 !
Also ,
My book Overqualified just had its third printing !
You guys are great .
Where would I be without such a lovely group of people crazy enough to enjoy my off - kilter nonsense ?
Off - kilter nonsense ?
Who talks like that ?
I 'm so sorry .
I 'm just sort of giddy because I sold my new book and I love you .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama opened the door on Tuesday to possible prosecutions of U.S. officials who laid the legal groundwork for harsh interrogation of terrorism suspects during the Bush administration .
Obama also said he would not necessarily oppose an effort to pursue a “ further accounting ” or investigation into the Bush - era interrogation program that included waterboarding , sleep deprivation , forced nudity , shoving people into walls and other methods .
That marked a shift for the Obama administration , which has emphasized it does not want to dwell on the past with lengthy probes into policies put in place by President George W. Bush after the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
But pressure in the U.S. Congress is growing for a full - blown investigation of the CIA interrogation program .
Controversy has erupted across the political spectrum over last week ’s release by the Obama administration of classified memos detailing the program to question al Qaeda suspects .
Human rights groups say tactics such as waterboarding -- a form of simulated drowning -- constituted torture and violated U.S. and international laws .
Conservative critics contend Obama has endangered the country by releasing CIA secrets .
The New York Times reported that Dennis Blair , Obama ’s national intelligence director , told colleagues in a private memo last week that the harsh interrogation techniques yielded “ high - value information ” that “ provided a deeper understanding ” of the al Qaeda organization .
The newspaper reported that Blair sent his memo on the same day the Obama administration publicly released the Bush - era memos .
It said Blair ’s assessment that the interrogation methods produced important information was deleted from a condensed version of his memo released to the news media .
REPORT SAYS TACTICS SPREAD TO IRAQ
A congressional report released late on Tuesday traced how a Bush - era policy on interrogation at the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , helped set the stage for detainee abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and in Afghanistan .
The report may add impetus to calls for a wider probe .
The report , released by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin , laid blame for the abuses on former Vice President Dick Cheney , former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and other top Bush administration officials .
“ The report represents a condemnation of both the Bush administration ’s interrogation policies and of senior administration officials who attempted to shift the blame for abuse -- such as that seen at Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo Bay and Afghanistan -- to low - ranking soldiers , ” Levin said .
“ It was senior civilian leaders who set the tone . ”

Earlier , in an Oval Office question - and - answer session with reporters , Obama reiterated his vow not to prosecute CIA interrogators who relied in good faith on legal opinions from the Bush administration condoning the harsh methods .
However , Obama did not rule out charges against those who wrote the opinions justifying the methods used on captured terrorism suspects .
“ With respect to those who formulated those legal decisions , I would say that is going to be more of a decision for the attorney general within the parameters of various laws , and I do n’t want to prejudge that , ” Obama said after meeting Jordan ’s King Abdullah .
“ I think that there are a host of very complicated issues involved there , ” Obama said .
The comment seemed at odds with the position offered on Sunday by Obama ’s chief of staff Rahm Emanuel , who told ABC that the president did not believe the authors of the legal opinions should be prosecuted .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs brushed aside questions about the contradiction .
“ Instead of referring to what anybody might have said ... it ’s important to refer to what the president said , ” he said .
While human rights advocates have urged prosecutions for those involved in the interrogation program , Obama has received scathing criticism from some conservatives over the release of the memos detailing the harsh methods .
Among the most outspoken critics has been Cheney , who contends the questioning yielded valuable information about terrorist activities and has accused Obama of endangering the country by releasing the CIA memos .
But Sen. Dianne Feinstein , the Democratic head of the Senate Intelligence Committee , welcomed Obama ’s comments about a possible inquiry as a “ step forward . ”
Feinstein has urged Obama to withhold judgment on possible prosecutions pending a closed - door review by her committee of the interrogation program .
Obama said he would not necessarily oppose a U.S. panel to investigate the interrogation program .
But he said he would prefer to see such an inquiry take place outside of the “ typical hearing process ” of Congress , where the issue could become politicized .
The female partners of wealthy Chinese men report more frequent according to a study by researchers at Newcastle University , in England .
Why ?
According to study authors , Thomas V. Pollet and Daniel Nettle , wealthy men are more desirable and thus " cause women to experience more orgasms . "
A fat wallet drives women wild with desire .
Public outrage
Popular reactions to these claims in England , Australia , and the U.S. have varied from , " Do n't bother , we knew it already , " to angry denials that money is the real source of all the excitement .
After all , partners of wealthy men are often wealthy women .
Wealthy women are happier and healthier , so why would n't they experience greater sexual pleasure ?
They are more educated , so they can read up on sexual technique .
Yet , , health , and are not likely to be responsible for income differentials in female orgasm because the authors statistically removed these factors in their paper that is soon to appear in Evolution and Human Behavior .
They could not remove other possible sources of confusion , though .
It could be that the sort of women who marry , or live with , wealthy men are just intrinsically more orgasmic .
Perhaps they have higher levels , or are more physically attractive .
They might feel better about their appearance .
Their childhoods may have been less and their relationships with parents more affectionate .
Perhaps they work less and are less physically exhausted when they go to bed .
Or maybe they just see the world through rose - colored spectacles and are more likely to say they reach orgasm " always " as opposed to " often , " " sometimes , " " rarely , " or " never , " whether this is true or not .
A cold shower of skepticism
Correlation is not the same as cause and , strictly speaking , one cannot legitimately conclude that wealthy male partners generate female orgasms without tidying up all of the many loose ends .
There are plenty of reasons for skepticism .
To begin with , many women would reject the argument that their orgasms are simply " given " to them by men .
Another study of self - reported orgasm frequency also found that it was unrelated to the man 's financial prospects .
This raises the possibility that results produced in a survey of Chinese women do not hold up in other societies .
Moreover , when women say they have experienced orgasm , we do not have to believe them .
That is not because they are willing to lie , like Elaine in Seinfeld , but because women tend to define orgasm in terms of an emotional high rather than just involuntary muscular contractions and accompanying physical sensations .
This fact was uncovered by sexology pioneers Masters and Johnson , who found that women experiencing physiological orgasm according to reliable scientific measures often denied the orgasm in verbal reports .
( Similar unreliability emerged when women denied being aroused by pornographic videos despite blood flow measurements indicating that they definitely were ) .
Female reports of orgasm are so intrinsically subjective that they are tough to use as scientific data without some sort of corroborating evidence , whether from electrophysiological monitoring devices or from partners .
Size matters
The size of the man 's wallet is a notorious aphrodisiac , according to evolutionary psychologists who point to the amorous successes of well - off dudes from King Solomon to Magic Johnson .
Yet , there is little in the way of a clear connection between a man 's income and his romantic allure .
Indeed , poor men typically begin having earlier and may devote more time and to seducing women .
Their increased effort can mean that they have more sexual partners .
It is not just the size of the wallet that matters but the size of the effect in Pollet and Nettle 's study .
How important is a man 's income ?
It accounts for just under a fiftieth of the differences in self - reported orgasm frequency according to their statistical analysis .
In other words , 98 % of the differences in self - reported orgasm frequency are not explained by the man 's income .
That is a very small fraction of a very squishy measure .
Marrying a wealthy man is not exactly a high road to orgasmic bliss .
Perhaps the angry reactions are justified after all .

Whenever he ’s asked about the scandals of America ’s war on terror -- the torture , the wrongful detentions , the legal corners cut -- President Obama has responded with some version of this statement : “ We have to focus on getting things right in the future as opposed to looking at what we got wrong in the past . ”
But that approach ca n’t work .
The unanswered questions are too many , the lawsuits too numerous , the fundamental questions of accountability too nagging .
We need a public reckoning -- and , much as they might like to avoid the distraction , Obama and his people must know it .
The latest controversy was the disclosure last week that the CIA had launched a program to track down and kill Al Qaeda leaders without informing Congress .
The CIA withheld the information , according to Director Leon Panetta , on orders from then - Vice President Dick Cheney .
Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee were outraged :
The controversy served to bolster Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s contention that the CIA had chronically lied to Congress .
Advertisement
The dust - up over what Congress was n’t told came just as Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. announced that he will take a new look at old cases in which CIA personnel were accused of abusing detainees , to see if any of them merit prosecution .
Obama has said that CIA officers who used “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” will not be punished if they followed regulations in force at the time .
But he has also said that those who employed torture beyond the rules should answer to the law .
And such cases do exist .
The CIA ’s inspector general reportedly sent as many as a dozen “ crimes reports ” on detainee abuse to the Bush administration Justice Department .
Several of the cases concerned detainees who died in custody .
Bush Justice Department lawyers examined every case , officials said , but decided to prosecute only one , a contract interrogator from North Carolina named David Passaro who beat an Afghan detainee to death with a flashlight in 2003 .
Passaro was convicted of assault and sentenced to eight years in prison .

When Holder reviewed the inspector general ’s 2004 report on the detainee program , he was taken aback by the cases that were n’t prosecuted .
And he was n’t the first .
When the tough report was delivered five years ago , it caused then - CIA Director George Tenet to suspend the program until new rules could be devised .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , who also read the report , said it was “ chilling . ”
Holder told Newsweek that he is leaning toward launching a criminal investigation into the old cases , and his words sent a shock wave through the CIA ’s clandestine service , which had hoped it was out of the woods .
( A former official who spoke to me asked for his identity to be concealed because he expects to be questioned if the cases are reopened . )
Panetta , defending his CIA troops , authorized an unusual on - the - record statement telling the attorney general to back off .
“ This has all been reviewed and dealt with before , ” CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said in a statement .
“ The Department of Justice knows -- and has known for years -- the details of past interrogation practices .
... Justice decided when to prosecute and when not to prosecute .
In some cases , when the department chose not to prosecute , CIA took administrative steps of its own . ”
At the end of last week , Holder had made no decision .
White House officials said publicly that they were leaving the issue to the attorney general -- but in private , some of them winced at the prospect of prosecuting CIA officers and the political firestorms that could ensue .
Advertisement
Obama may prefer to soar above painful questions about what his predecessor ’s CIA did , but he is unlikely to have that luxury , even if Holder backs off .
A series of looming disclosures are likely to keep the debate over accountability alive .
The inspector general ’s 2004 report is due to be released ( with secrets blacked out ) by Aug. 31 in response to a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union .
The Justice Department ’s own ethics office is about to release a report judging the department lawyers who drew up the so - called torture memos that offered legal justification for detainee abuse .
A federal prosecutor is investigating the CIA ’s decision in 2005 to destroy 92 videotapes of detainee interrogations , including the repeated waterboarding of Al Qaeda figure Abu Zubaydah .
And Feinstein ’s Senate Intelligence Committee staff is grinding away at a comprehensive report on interrogations that may not be complete before the end of the year .
“ All of these strands are converging to create what could be an ugly summer , ” noted Jeffrey H. Smith , a former CIA general counsel who has informally advised Obama aides on intelligence issues .
“ The CIA feels once again that they are the ham in the sandwich . ”
There are two ways to resolve these nagging problems .
One is the long and bumpy process of responding passively , letting Congress and the courts do what they will .
That ’s the path Obama has taken until now .
Far better , though , for the president to grasp the nettle , deal with problems quickly and put safeguards in place to prevent their recurrence .
Only then can he focus fully on “ getting things right in the future . ”

YOU’D have thought by the media lovefest that the pope had died a tragic death after a lifetime of caring for lepers .
But , no , it was the death of Michael Jackson , a drug - addled , creepy - beyond - words , accused pedophile who literally bought his children with the help of two brood mares and , apparently , his dermatologist — a group of amoral savages who had no problem giving their kids to a man who looked like the Phantom of the Opera and who behaved like a depraved worm .
You can call it “ adoption , ” but I call it child - trafficking .
JACKO ’S WILL IS SLAP AT MOM
READ THE WILL DOCUMENTS ( pdf )
Ongoing Michael Jackson Coverage
OK , I said it — and it ’s about time somebody had the nerve to say what millions of people must feel and believe about the once - talented black man who turned himself into a white woman before turning himself into a monster .
But you ’d never know any of that if you ’d listened for the past week to the endless prattle from the sickening , fawning media and all those Hollywood music phonies who were crying crocodile tears over someone they ’d mostly avoided like , well , a pedophile .
Even the president of the United States felt compelled to issue a statement .
Are you kidding me ?
I say all this not just as some casual bystander to the Michael Jackson freak show — though I was a Jacko freak back in 1993 , when I was as in awe of him as the rest of the world .
But then one day , a friend came to see me at my office at another newspaper and everything changed .
“ My cousin ’s boy ’s been hijacked by Michael Jackson , ” he said .
He pulled out two photos of the boy , Jordie Chandler , with Jackson .
They were dressed alike — in fedoras , little black suits , each wearing one freaking glove .
They were on a roller - coaster — in Europe .
Jordie ’s mother had remarried , and his stepfather had introduced her to Jackson .
Within weeks , the sleepovers among Jackson and her gorgeous 13 - year - old son and 5 - year - old daughter began .
The boy broke down and told his father that he ’d been molested at Jackson ’s playground , Neverland Ranch , and in Europe .
The dad , a dentist - to - the - stars and screenwriter , contacted authorities , and shortly thereafter was jumped and beaten bloody in a garage .
His home was broken into , and thugs menaced patients in his waiting room .
The authorities told him it might be best if he and his son disappeared for a while .
They settled for more than $ 20 million .
The father took the boy underground , and he had plastic surgery and disguised himself for safety .
Dental practice destroyed , screenwriting career over , family in tatters .
Jackson walked free — or as free as a tortured soul can be — to repeat over and over again his hideous tricks with children at Neverland , a place straight out of “ Hansel and Gretel . ”
It is in this very spot where his family wanted to put on their grotesque public display of his sadly emaciated , needle - marked body , reportedly to be dressed “ like a prince , ” as though he has become one of the garish statues upon which he loved to drop millions in Las Vegas hotel tchotchke shops .
Another circus of the macabre to add to the horror that became Michael Jackson ’s life .
This is the kind of madness that ’s followed Jackson ’s death — everyone is acting as though the world has lost one of its greatest men .
The King of Pop was a great entertainer — innovative beyond anyone the world had ever seen — but he turned into a disgustingly depraved man who hung an infant off a balcony and forced his kids to walk around with masks , veils , towels and even nets over their faces .
Great men do n’t pretend to be childlike to disguise their depravities .
Shameful .
The king is dead , and I for one am not crying .

* Obama says it is his job to get economy moving
* Says critics “ carp and gripe ”
* Jobless rate likely to “ tick up ” for several months ( Updates with speech , changes dateline from WASHINGTON )
WARREN , Michigan , July 14 ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama defended his handling of the U.S. economy on Tuesday in a visit to hard - hit Michigan and said the emergence from bankruptcy of GM and Chrysler is proof his plans are working .
But Obama also carried a dose of reality to Michigan , saying thousands of jobs lost to the auto industry ’s downturn are not coming back and it is time to prepare for new industries .
He touted a $ 12 billion initiative to encourage more Americans to seek education for new jobs .
Obama , a Democrat who often says he inherited a recession from Republican predecessor George W. Bush , fired back at Republican critics who say his $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan has failed to stem the rising jobless rate .
Obama said it is his responsibility to “ get this economy back on its feet . ”
“ That ’s my job .
And it ’s a job that I gladly accept .
I love these folks who helped get us into this mess and then suddenly say , ‘ Well this is Obama ’s economy . ’ ”
“ That ’s fine , ” Obama said .
“ Give it to me .
My job is to solve problems , not to stand on the sidelines and carp and gripe , ” he said .
Talking to reporters before leaving for Michigan , Obama said the United States is trying to rebound from the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression , and that the jobless rate probably will get worse before it gets better .
“ My expectation is , is that we will probably continue to see unemployment tick up for several months , ” he said .
Critics have complained loudly about the government ’s bailout of GM and Chrysler , but the situation in Michigan would be far worse if the government had not acted , he said .
“ It was the right thing to do , ” he said in Warren .
SOME AUTO JOBS WON’T COME BACK
The continued lag in the economy is starting to make a dent in Obama ’s strong job approval ratings .
A new CBS News poll said Obama ’s approval rating was 57 percent , still robust but down six points from last month .
The poll said his approval rating on handling the economy is now 48 percent , while 44 percent disapprove .
Last month , Americans had approved of his handling of this issue by a margin of 22 points , CBS said .
As he visited a state hit hard by job losses as Detroit ’s Big Three automakers have reeled from the U.S. recession , Obama promoted a $ 12 billion initiative to boost community colleges and increase the graduation rate .
“ The hard truth is that some of the jobs that have been lost in the auto industry and elsewhere wo n’t be coming back , ” Obama said .
“ They are the casualties of a changing economy ... And that only underscores the importance of generating new businesses and new industries to replace the ones that we ’ve lost , and of preparing our workers to fill the jobs they create , ” he said .
Speaking outdoors in his shirt - sleeves , Obama made his case in Macomb County , an area that gave rise 30 years ago to “ Reagan Democrats ” who crossed party lines to elect Republican Ronald Reagan .
Obama ’s 10 - year program to boost community colleges includes a new goal of graduating an additional 5 million students from these schools over the next decade , double the current number of expected graduates .
Education is the often - forgotten third pillar of Obama ’s economic plan and has received far less attention than the other two -- healthcare reform and renewable energy .
Mozart left more than 600 pieces of music before his death at 35
Two piano pieces have been identified as the work of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , experts in the Austrian city of Salzburg say .
The compositions have long been in the possession of the International Mozarteum Foundation in the city , the organisation said .
Few details are being released until an official presentation in a week 's time .
In January , a piece by Mozart which had lain undiscovered in a French library for years , had its first performance .
Prolific
A spokeswoman for the Mozarteum Foundation said full details of the most recently identified works would only be made public on 2 August .
She said the music would be performed on Mozart 's original fortepiano .
Mozart left more than 600 known pieces of music before his death in 1791 at the age of 35 .
He had begun composing at the age of five and his works include operas , chamber music , choral pieces and piano concertos .
The two - minute - long piece performed in public in January for the first time was played by violinist Daniel Cuiller before a small audience in Nantes , western France .
The sheet music had been found by staff at the city 's library , and authenticated as the work of Mozart in September 2008 .
1 . This is very interesting video about an " idiot " who forget to pull his handbrake when filling the gas and later he thought that " My car was stolen ? " .
Watch it !
2 . I think it 's funny that he heard the car hit the ditch , realized it was his car , then went back to﻿ filling his little gas tank !
Then he looks up at the other people , probably saying , " I do n't know who 's car that is , I 'm not that stupid ! "
Hahaha .
In March , a rumor started about there being a 64 - bit version of Office 2010 and in April , we got official confirmation from Microsoft that this would indeed be happening .
Ever since then , the number one question from readers commenting on Office 2010 posts was whether or not both 32 - bit and 64 - bit flavors would be available on one DVD .
With Vista , this was not possible due to size constraints .
However , with Office 2010 , readers speculated , it might be possible to pull off .
So far , Microsoft has refused to give me details on whether or not they would be doing this , but with the Office 2010 32 - bit and 64 - bit leak ( build 14.0.4006.1010 ) over the weekend , speculation is turning into a believable rumor .
While trying to install the 64 - bit version on my Vista box , I got an error ( pictured above ) , that would suggest Microsoft is indeed trying to put both on the same disc .
I 've quoted the important text :
If you want to install 64 - bit Office 2010 , you must uninstall all 32 - bit Office products first , and then run setup.exe in the x64 folder .
If you want to install 32 - bit Office 2010 , close this setup .
Then navigate to the x86 folder at the root of your CD / DVD and run setup.exe .
Presumably , this would mean that , just like with Vista , the same product key can be used to install the 32 - bit or the 64 - bit version of the same software .
Of course , it is possible that this error is only there for the development phase of the product , but something tells me that Microsoft would rather have one DVD if it was possible .
I will continue pestering Microsoft for an official answer to the question and will keep you posted accordingly .
DESPITE falling exports , China 's economic growth has remained relatively strong this year thanks to a surge in investment sparked by the government 's stimulus measures .
Official data show that fixed - asset investment leapt by an astonishing 39 % in the year to May , or by a record 49 % in real terms .
Sowing more today should yield a bigger harvest tomorrow , but how wisely is this capital being used ?
Official figures almost certainly overstate the size of the spending boom : local bureaucrats may well be exaggerating investment in order to impress their masters in Beijing .
More important , the government 's figures misleadingly include land purchases and mergers and acquisitions .
But even if measured on a national - accounts basis , like GDP , investment is probably growing at a still - impressive real annual rate of around 20 % .
This year China 's domestic investment in dollar terms is likely to exceed that in America ( see chart ) .
There is widespread concern that this investment boom is adding to China 's excess capacity .
Investment amounted to 44 % of GDP last year ( compared with 18 % in America ) , which many economists reckon was already too much .
Worse still , as well as forcing state firms to invest , the government is directing state - owned banks to lend more , despite falling corporate profits .
Many of those loans could turn sour .
Like Japan in the 1980s , it is argued , an artificially low cost of capital causes chronic overinvestment and falling returns .
If so , it will end in tears .
To assess that risk you need to ask two questions .
How much excess capacity was there already ?
And where is the new investment going ?
There is certainly excess capacity in a few sectors ( steel and some export industries , such as textiles ) .
But the best measure of spare capacity for the economy as a whole — the difference between actual and potential GDP , or “ output gap ” — is probably only about 2 % of GDP , compared with an average of almost 7 % in the rich world .
The large role played by state - owned banks is bound to have resulted in some misallocation of capital , but a recent study by Helen Qiao and Yu Song at Goldman Sachs argues that concerns about overinvestment are exaggerated .
A successful developing economy should have a high ratio of investment to GDP .
And a rising rate does not mean that the efficiency of capital is falling ; capital - output ratios are supposed to increase as economies develop .
America 's capital stock is much larger relative to its GDP than China 's , with 20 times more capital per person than in China .
A better measure of capital efficiency is profitability .
Profits have indeed slumped over the past year , but taking the past decade to adjust for the impact of the economic cycle , profit margins have not narrowed as one might expect if there were massive spare capacity .
The argument that the average cost of capital is ludicrously low is also no longer true .
China 's real interest rate is now 7 % , which is among the highest in the world .
Where is the new investment going ?
There has been little new spending in industries with overcapacity , such as steel and computers .
But the surge in state - directed investment has fuelled fears about its quality .
In its latest China Quarterly Update , the World Bank calculates that government - influenced investment so far this year was 39 % higher ( on a national - accounts basis ) than a year earlier , while “ market - based ” investment rose by a more modest 13 % .
This implies that government - influenced investment accounts for about three - fifths of the growth in investment this year , up from one - fifth last year .
The usual assumption is that government investment is less efficient and will therefore harm long - term growth .
But the fastest expansion in spending has been in railways ( up by 111 % this year ) .
As a developing country , China still lacks decent infrastructure ; railways , in particular , have long been an economic bottleneck .
Investment in roads , the power grid and water should also yield high long - term returns by allowing China to sustain rapid growth .
And the government is focusing its infrastructure stimulus on less developed parts of the country where the benefits promise to be greatest .
According to Paul Cavey at Macquarie Securities , fixed - asset investment in western provinces was 46 % higher in the first four months of this year than in the same period of 2008 , almost double the rise in richer eastern provinces .
Some of the money being spent in China will inevitably be wasted , but it is wrong to denounce all government - directed investment as inefficient .
In the short term it creates jobs , and better infrastructure will support future growth .
It is certainly not a substitute for the structural reforms needed to lift consumer demand in the longer term , but it could help .
After all , without running water and electricity , people will not buy a washing machine .
I have finished a first draft of a brief overview on functional programming featuring type polymorphism , higher - order functions , lazy evaluation , class - based overloading , and equational reasoning .

HARARE , Zimbabwe – Zimbabwe has promised to withdraw its soldiers from diamond fields in the east , an official newspaper reported Sunday — a week after a rights group alleged the military was committing killings and abuses in the area .
The move appeared to be an attempt to diffuse criticism over the military 's takeover of the Marange diamond fields and ensure that Zimbabwe 's precious stones wo n't be tainted with the " blood diamond " label by activists , which would reduce their value .
The Ministry of Mines denied last month 's report by Human Rights Watch that said troops had killed more than 200 people at the Marange diamond fields while forcing children to search for diamonds and beating villagers who got in the way .
Instead , Zimbabwe 's coalition government said the military was there to secure the area , about 150 miles ( 250 kilometers ) east of Harare , where mining is managed by the state 's Mining Development Corp .
The 60,000 - hectare ( 140,000 - acre ) Marange diamond fields were discovered in 2006 — at the height of Zimbabwe 's political , economic and humanitarian crisis .
Villagers rushed to the area and began finding diamonds close to the surface .
The army took over the Marange diamond fields in late October 2008 .
Before that , the police were in control and Human Rights Watch said there were less abuses then .
Officials of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme — the world 's diamond control body — recently visited the fields following allegations that security chiefs and loyalists of President Robert Mugabe were either perpetrating or tolerating rights abuses and illegal diamond exports .
" There can not be effective security where diamonds are concerned with the involvement of the military , " the Kimberley delegation said in a report to the Zimbabwean government , quoted by the state - run Sunday Mail .
The Kimberley report also noted illegal digging and processing of diamonds in Marange and called for stricter controls to stop diamond smuggling across the porous eastern border with Mozambique .
Mines Minister Obert Mpofu on Saturday told Kimberley inspectors that the troops would be withdrawn from the diamond fields and the country would meet international mining standards , the Sunday Mail reported .
" We are going to work toward getting in line with the standards proposed , " the paper quoted Mpofu as saying during the meeting .
Mpofu reportedly also told the Kimberley delegation that the coalition government , formed between Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai in February , planned to relocate villagers away from the diamond fields and find investors to help provide security .
Deputy Mines Minister Murisi Zwizwai — a member of Tsvangirai's former opposition party — said the coalition government had " agreed to remove the soldiers , but it will be done in phases while proper security settings would be put in place , " the Sunday Mail reported .
It is estimated the diamonds could be worth $ 200 million a month to the cash - strapped southern African nation , which is desperately trying to raise international aid to kickstart the economy .
But the unity government has also been under foreign pressure to show signs of reform .
Withdrawing troops from the diamond fields would deflect further negative publicity , show the government 's commitment to meeting international obligations and ensure greater revenue from the diamonds that are sold .
On June 26 , the New York - based Human Rights Watch cited accounts from more than 100 witnesses , miners , police officers , soldiers and children alleging human rights abuses by troops .
It said its researchers had gathered evidence of mass graves and accounts of an incident last year when military helicopters fired on miners , while armed soldiers on the ground chased villagers away .
It said many victims were unwilling to come forward out of fear of the military .
Human Rights
Watch also alleged that some of the income from the diamond fields went to officials of Mugabe 's ZANU - PF party , long accused of trampling on human rights and democracy in Zimbabwe .
Leading Japanese architects SANAA were in attendance at the press viewing for this year ’s Serpentine Pavilion , the temporary summer cafe and event space commissioned annually by the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington Gardens , London .
In line with the brief , the pavilion is the first built structure by the Japanese practice in England .
The ninth commission in the gallery ’s annual architecture commission , the aluminium and stainless steel structure took just six months from contract to completion .
Speaking of the execution of their design , practice founder Kazuyo Sejima said , ‘ The reality is more beautiful than I first imagined ’ .

The structure , whose free and open design co-founder Ryue Nishizawa described as ‘ a non-architecture idea , such as water or a rainbow ’ , will be open to the public in Kensington Gardens until 18 October , before being sold to a private buyer .
Serpentine Gallery director Julia Peyton - Jones said that the pavilion , located just outside the gallery ’s home in Kensington Gardens , ‘ becomes the public ’s town square ’ for its three - month stay .
Previous designers include Frank Gehry , 2008 ; Olafur Eliasson and Kjetil Thorsen , 2007 ; Rem Koolhaas and Cecil Balmond , with Arup , 2006 ; Álvaro Siza and Eduardo Souto de Moura with Cecil Balmond , Arup , 2005 ; MVRDV with Arup , 2004 ( un- realised ) ; Oscar Niemeyer , 2003 ; Toyo Ito with Arup , 2002 ; Daniel Libeskind with Arup , 2001 ; and Zaha Hadid , 2000 .

Constitutional Topic : The Second Amendment
The Constitutional Topics pages at the USConstitution .
net site are presented to delve deeper into topics than can be provided on the Glossary Page or in the FAQ pages .
This Topic Page concerns The Second Amendment .
This topic has a home directly in the Constitution , at the 2nd Amendment .
A great source of information for this topic came from Origins of the Bill of Rights ( Yale Nota Bene , 2001 ) by Leonard W. Levy .
The 2nd Amendment page at the Government Printing Office Site is also of considerable use .
Historical context
The 2nd Amendment , starting in the latter half of the 20th century , became an object of much debate .
Concerned with rising violence in society and the role firearms play in that violence , gun control advocates began to read the 2nd Amendment one way .
On the other side , firearm enthusiasts saw the attacks on gun ownership as attacks on freedom , and defended their interpretation of the 2nd Amendment just as fiercely .
If the authors of the 2nd Amendment could have foreseen the debate , they might have phrased the amendment differently , because much of the debate has centered around the way the amendment is phrased .
Is the amendment one that was created to ensure the continuation and flourishing of the state militias as a means of defense , or was it created to ensure an individual 's right to own a firearm ?
Despite the rhetoric on both sides of the issue , the answer to both questions is most likely , " Yes . "
The attitude of Americans toward the military was much different in the 1790's than it is today .
Standing armies were mistrusted , as they had been used as tools of oppression by the monarchs of Europe for centuries .
In the war for independence , there had been a regular army , but much of the fighting had been done by the state militias , under the command of local officers .
Aside from the war , militias were needed because attacks were relatively common , whether by bandits , Indians , and even by troops from other states .
Today , the state militias have evolved into the National Guard in every state .
These soldiers , while part - time , are professionally trained and armed by the government .
No longer are regular , non-Guardsmen , expected to take up arms in defense of the state or the nation ( though the US Code does still recognize the unorganized militia as an entity , and state laws vary on the subject [ 10 USC 311 ] ) .
This is in great contrast to the way things were at the time of adoption of the 2nd Amendment .
Many state constitutions had a right to bear arms for the purposes of the maintenance of the militia .
Many had laws that required men of age to own a gun and supplies , including powder and bullets .
In the state constitutions written around the time of the Declaration of Independence , the right to bear arms was presented in different ways .
The Articles of Confederation specified that the states should maintain their militias , but did not mention a right to bear arms .
Thus , any such protections would have to come from state law .
The Virginia Declaration of Rights , though it mentioned the militia , did not mention a right to bear arms — the right might be implied , since the state did not furnish weapons for militiamen .
The constitutions of North Carolina and Massachusetts did guarantee the right , to ensure proper defense of the states .
The constitution of Pennsylvania guaranteed the right with no mention of the militia ( at the time , Pennsylvania had no organized militia ) .
One of the arguments of the Anti-Federalists during the ratification debates was that the new nation did not arm the militias , an odd argument since neither did the U.S. under the Articles .
Finally , Madison 's original proposal for the Bill of Rights mentioned the individual right much more directly than the final result that came out of Congress .
Perhaps in the 1780's , the rise of a tyrant to a leadership position in the U.S. was a cause for concern .
Today , in my opinion , the voters are much too sophisticated to elect a leader whose stated aims would be to suppress freedom or declare martial law .
For the leader whose unstated aim it was to seize the nation , the task would be more than daunting — it would be next to impossible .
The size and scope of the conspiracy needed , the cooperation of patriots who would see right through such a plan — it is unfathomable , the stuff of fiction .
There are some who fear the rise in executive power under the second Bush presidency is just such a usurpation , and in some ways it may be .
But similar usurpations of power by the Congress and the President , such as the Alien and Sedition Acts , the suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War , or the internment of Japanese - Americans during World War II , were all eventually overturned or struck down and then condemned by history .
My hope is that history can be our guide this time , too .
The defense of our borders had not been a cause for concern for nearly a century before the subject really came up again around the time of the turn of the millennium , in 1999 .
Concern with border defense again became an issue after September 11 , 2001 , when a series of terrorist attacks , both in the form of hijacked airliners crashing into buildings and anthrax - laced mail , made people realize that we do have enemies that wish to invade our nation , though not on the scale of an army .
But while each state has its National Guard it can call up to guard the borders , the coordination needed is much more on a national scale , and special units of the regular army or border patrol are better suited for such duty than the Guard .
Today 's debate
With the historical context set above , a look at the current interpretations of the 2nd Amendment are appropriate .
These interpretations tend to lean in one of two ways .
The first is that the amendment was meant to ensure that individuals have the absolute right to own firearms ; the second is that the amendment was meant to ensure that States could form , arm , and maintain their own militias .
Either way , it is a bar to federal action only , because the 2nd Amendment has not been incorporated by the Supreme Court to apply to the states .
This means that within its own constitution , a state may be as restrictive or non-restrictive as it wishes to be in the regulation of firearms ; likewise , private rules and regulations may prohibit or encourage firearms .
For example , if a housing association wishes to bar any firearm from being held within its borders , it is free to do so .
The Supreme Court , in permitting the United States to apply a stamp tax to sawed - off shotguns ( a move , it was argued , that was intended to make such weapons de facto illegal ) , essentially said that if a weapon does not contribute to the maintenance of a militia , and has no use in ensuring the common defense , it can be regulated ( United States v. Miller , 307 US 174 [ 1939 ] ) .
Though the outcome of Miller was never fully resolved ( the Court asked that Miller prove the relevance of the sawed - off shotgun to the maintenance of the militia , but Jack Miller died before he could , and the case died with him ) , the rationale used in Miller has been the basis for all gun control laws since 1939 .
As the GPO page notes , " At what point regulation or prohibition of what classes of firearms would conflict with the Amendment , if at all , the Miller case does little more than cast a faint degree of illumination toward an answer . "
Both contemporary interpretations are correct , in a way .
As illustrated in the first section , the amendment does appear to have been designed to protect the militias , and it was also designed to protect an individual 's right to own and bear a gun .
The question , then , is do we have to adhere to both tenets of the amendment today ?
If we decide to do away with the individual ownership aspect of the Amendment , reinterpreting the amendment to allow highly restricted gun ownership , we seem to open the door to radical reinterpretation of other , more basic parts of the Constitution .
If we decide to do nothing , and allow unrestricted gun ownership , we run the risk of creating a society of the gun , a risk that seems too great to take .
So the real question seems to be , can we have the a constitutional freedom to bear arms , and still allow restriction and regulation ?
Reasonable restrictions do seem to be the way to go , acknowledging the Amendment , but molding it , as we 've done with much of the Constitution .
After all , we have freedom of speech in the United States , but you are not truly free to say whatever you wish .
You cannot incite violence without consequence ; you cannot libel someone without consequence ; you cannot shout " Fire ! " in a crowded theater without consequence .
Why can not gun ownership by similarly regulated without violating the Constitution ?
Of course , prosecution for speech violations only take place after the fact , and regulation of gun ownership is necessarily different — it is a " prior restraint , " a condition rarely allowed in speech restrictions , but necessary in gun restrictions .
The trick is finding that balance between freedom and reasonable regulation , between unreasonable unfettered ownership and unreasonable prior restraint .
Gun ownership is indeed a right — but it is also a grand responsibility .
With responsibility comes the interests of society to ensure that guns are used safely and are used by those with proper training and licensing .
If we can agree on this simple premise , it should not be too difficult to work out the details and find a proper compromise .
Recent developments
In 2007 , the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in the case of Parker v District of Columbia .
In the case , the court ruled that D.C. laws that essentially prohibit the private ownership of handguns within the District , were unconstitutional .
Specifically , the appellants , residents of D.C. , were denied their 2nd Amendment rights by laws that bar the registration of handguns by anyone except retired D.C. police officers ; that bar the carrying of a pistol without a license , even within one 's home ; and that require that lawfully owned firearms be kept unloaded and disassembled unless used for " lawful recreational purposes . "
The Court found that in spite of the first part of the 2nd Amendment — that which refers to the militia — " the Second Amendment 's premise is that guns would be kept by citizens for self - protection ( and hunting ) . "
The court acknowledged the history the militia played in the creation of the 2nd Amendment , but did not allow the militia to be sole measure to be viewed when looking at these laws restricting gun ownership and reasonable use .
Parker , the court ruled , should be allowed to keep handguns in his home .
The case , filed as District of Columbia v Heller , was granted certiorari by the United States Supreme Court , and was heard in March , 2008 .
At issue were two questions .
The first , raised by the District , is whether the District is forbidden by the Second Amendment to ban the possession of handguns while allowing the possession of rifles and shotguns .
The second , broader issue is raised by Heller ( another of the original petitioners in the Parker case ) : whether the Second guarantees that guns , including handguns , can be kept in homes by law - abiding citizens .
The Court decided that the issue it should hear is " Whether the [ D.C. laws ] violate the Second Amendment rights of individuals who are not affiliated with any state - regulated militia , but who wish to keep handguns and other firearms for private use in their homes ? "
The Supreme Court ruled on the Heller case at the end of its term in June , 2008 .
The Court , which found for Heller in a close 5 - 4 decision , wrote that the 2nd Amendment did , in fact , protect an individual right .
While the court was careful to note that the case did not call into question any laws that regulate guns , it did state , unequivocally , that Heller and his fellow petitioners had a right to own guns in their home .
The Court also ruled that while reasonable regulation may be permitted , the requirement that guns be locked and disassembled was not reasonable .
The Court finally noted that its ruling affected only the District of Columbia , as a federal enclave .
Another case wss decided by the Court in 2010 .
In McDonald v Chicago , the constitutionality of restrictive local and state gun control laws was challenged .
The case specifically challenged four limits placed on handgun registration by the city of Chicago and a suburb , Oak Park : a ban on the registration of handguns ; that all guns must be registered prior to purchase ; that all guns must be reregistered annually ; and that any lapse in a gun 's registration renders the gun permanently unregisterable .
The plaintiffs in the case asked the Court to not only render the regulations unconstitutional , but to overrule the rule of selective incorporation the Court has used since the late 1800's .
The Court ruled that the Chicago regulations were unconstitutional , and that the rights previously found in the Heller case were individual rights that also applied to state and local governments .
Justice Samuel Alito , writing for the majority , was matter - of - fact in his conclusion : " In Heller , we held that the Second Amendment protects the right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose of self - defense .
Unless considerations of stare decisis counsel otherwise , a provision of the Bill of Rights that protects a right that is fundamental from an American perspective applies equally to the Federal Government and the States .
We therefore hold that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right recognized in Heller . "
The Court refused , however , to abandon the selective incorporation process .
It also refused to remove all gun restrictions , recognizing that some , such as restrictions against felons and the mentally ill and geographical restrictions , were constitutional .
A proposed amendment
Recognizing that the need to arm the populace as a militia is no longer of much concern , but also realizing that firearms are a part of our history and culture and are used by many for both personal defense and sport , this site has proposed a new 2nd Amendment — an amendment to replace the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution .
This proposed text is offered as a way to spark discussion of the topic .
Section 1 . The second article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed .
Section 2 .
The right of the people to keep arms reasonable for hunting , sport , collecting , and personal defense shall not be infringed .
Section 3 . Restrictions of arms must be found to be reasonable under Section 2 by a two - thirds vote of Congress in two consecutive sessions of Congress before they can be forwarded to the President for approval .
This proposed amendment is a truer representation of how our society views our freedom to bear arms .
Because " reasonableness " can be far too elastic , the two - Congress restriction requires that two Congresses in a row pass the same bill — this allows both thoughtful reflection and for the opinions of the people , to be expressed between these votes , to be heard ( both at the ballot box and in general ) .
It is an unusual , but not unprecedented , way of passing legislation .
Finally , the courts would have the ultimate authority in determining if a restriction is not reasonable , providing a final layer of protection ( after the two pairs of debate in the House and Senate and the President 's own agreement ) .
The militia is removed from the equation , greatly clarifying the purpose of the amendment .
Historical note : in Section 2 , the " collecting " clause was added , and Section 3 is a replacement for " The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation " after concerns over " reasonableness " were examined more fully .

Documentary history
It is often useful to not only try to interpret what the words of a part of the Constitution mean today , but also to see what they meant in the past .
Proponents of the Original Intent method of interpretation always use the original meaning when looking at the Constitution .
But even those who do not adhere to Original Intent still find the documentary history to be useful .

Diplomats called in as cleric says UK embassy staff face trial in Iran over election demonstrations
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
The EU decided today to summon all Iranian ambassadors in capitals across Europe in a co-ordinated protest over the detention of UK embassy staff .
The move came after a senior cleric said some of the staff accused of inciting protests following last month 's disputed presidential election would be put on trial .
The head of Iran 's guardian council , Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati , said the detained staff members had " made confessions " in connection with the unrest .
The surprise move by the council , Iran 's top legislative body , will cause relations between London and Tehran to deteriorate further after tit - for - tat diplomatic expulsions last week .
Sweden , which holds the rotating EU presidency , said in a statement : " It 's not acceptable to file charges against the ones released or to the ones still in custody . "
Jannati , a hardliner who is close to Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , said during a Friday prayer sermon : " Following the election , the enemy could n't bear to see the people 's happiness and tried to pour poison down their throats .
" They had plotted the velvet revolution prior to the election , and even on the British foreign ministry website in March it was announced that Iran 's election might be accompanied by some unrest and that British citizens were warned to be careful .
" What is the meaning of these predictions ? "
His comments are not an official announcement from Tehran – Jannati does not hold a position in the government or judiciary .
But his status as the head of the guardian council , a powerful body of clerics that stands above the elected government , gives him a degree of authority .
Jannati did not say how many embassy staff members would be tried , or on what charges .
The threat of a trial came as the 27 EU countries examined potential steps to protest against Iran 's crackdown on dissent .
Future measures could include visa bans on Iranian officials , diplomats said .
Earlier , Iranian officials said all but one of the nine embassy personnel arrested on 27 June had been released , but EU officials said they believed more than one was still being held .
Downing Street said it was seeking urgent clarification from the Iranian government as the Foreign Office again rejected Iranian accusations against its staff .
" All we can say is that two of our staff remain in detention , " a Foreign Office spokeswoman said .
" I would reiterate what we said earlier this week , that the accusations against them are without foundation . "
Iran arrested the embassy workers in a co-ordinated operation last weekend .
The matter seemed to be winding down after most were released in the face of a strong response from the EU .
The brutal response by Iranian security forces against demonstrators who claimed the election had been rigged in favour of the incumbent president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , drew western condemnation .
At least 20 people were killed .
Iran said the vote was fair and has made Britain the target of some of its fiercest rhetoric .
Iranian hardliners continue to harbour resentment at Britain for its role in toppling the democratically elected government of Mohammed Mossadeq in 1953 .
Is America Overstretched ?
O! Bama !
Whither takest thou us ?
There are two broad theories concerning the great men of history .
One says that history is made by great men .
The other says great men are made by history .
But here at The Daily Reckoning we think they ’re both wrong .
In our book , great men do n’t really exist .
They are merely invented by the historians .
History needs heroes .
Sometimes tragic heroes … sometimes comic … the historians take what they ’ve got to work with and set them spinning .
But if you look at their leading characters closely , they look little different from the rest of us … just fellow passengers on the big bus .
Poor Obama .
He seems like such a likable fellow .
He would probably make a good college president .
Or a good butcher .
You ’d enjoy going into his shop to buy cutlets .
But now the poor man finds himself in what has to be one of the tightest spots in history .
At least in economic history .
The crash of ’08 - ’09 clipped stock market investors for half their nominal wealth .
The bear market in property has put one out of every four homeowners underwater .
And now the recession / depression threatens to knock the stuffing out of the rest of the economy .
How can he get us out of this jam ?
He has n’t a clue .
So , he turns to his advisors … his hacks … his pollsters and his hangers - on …
… and what do they come up with ?
“ U.S. deficit four times last year ’s record , ” comes the press report .
“ Federal government will borrow almost 50 cents of every dollar it spends this year . ”
This news would have taken our breath away .
If we had any breath left .
But after so many wonders , each one more breathtaking than the last , our lungs are all squeezed out .
We ca n’t even give an audible sigh .
Hold a mirror up to our nose and you would think we were dead .
You ’ll recall that President Obama announced that he had found budget savings of $ 17 billion .
We were exhaling on that for a moment until we realized that it represented less than 36 hours ’ worth of federal spending .
Then came news a week later that instead of cutting the budget , the latest estimates showed it going up by some $ 89 billion .
Let ’s face it , at this point $ 89 billion is chicken feed .
Here at The Daily Reckoning we carry that much in our wallet .
We pass it out to subway bums and use it to tip cab drivers .
So , we ’re not about to get excited about such a trivial amount .
But coming on top of a budget deficit already estimated at four times the record deficit set last year … and we begin to think of straws and camels .
The idea of spending twice as much as you earn should take even a camel ’s breath away .
An ordinary man…hearing that fact … would feel like breaking the glass and pulling the alarm .
“ You ca n’t do that …you ’ll go broke , ” he would say .
Basic arithmetic reveals the trap .
In one year , you ’ve built up debt equal to all of next year ’s revenue .
In two years , you ’ve got debt of 200 % of annual revenues .
In 10 years , you ’ve got debts equal to 1,000 % of your annual receipts .
Let ’s see…say you only pay 5 % interest … then , the interest alone takes up HALF your revenues .
What creditor would lend you money ?
The feds have their own projections , of course .
According to them , they wo n’t continue this hell - for - leather spending much longer .
Their estimates show the deficits declining in future years .
Ten years out , they show a fairly modest total of $ 7.1 trillion in accumulated deficits .
It is a measure of how breathtaking the financial news has been that $ 7.1 trillion can in any way be regarded as modest .
It is half America ’s total GDP .
It is also a measure of how out - to - lunch the federal estimators are .
Their projections imagine a “ worst of worlds ” that would be a “ best of worlds ” to most people .
In the Great Depression , national output went down by some 30 % … and continued for a decade ( depending on how you figure it ) .
In Japan , the on- again , off - again slump has gone on for 19 years .
Yet , the official guess is that this downturn in the US will take output down by only 1.2 % and that it will be over in a few months … with a return to growth of 3.2 % in 2010 .
No one knows how bad it will become .
The last report showed GDP declining at a 6 % rate .
And our friend Nassim Nicholas Taleb says it will be “ vastly worse ” than the ‘ 30s .
But give a man enough education and he ’s ready to believe anything .
He can even convince himself that such reckless spending is a “ stimulus ” effort … that it merely “ replaces ” spending that would have been done by the private sector ( if the private sector were stark raving mad ) … and that it will bring about a “ recovery ” in the entire economy .
You could even glance at the latest financial news and say : “ Look …it ’s working ! ”
The Dow lost 155 points yesterday .
A minor setback in what has been an agreeable interlude .
Oil , the dollar , and gold stayed about where they were yesterday .
Our thoughts return to Mr. Obama .
He is surely the man of the hour .
He is the fellow historians will take for the leading man .
Will he be a tragic hero ?
A comic hero ?
One of America ’s greatest presidents ?
A black Lincoln ?
A Roosevelt with two good legs ?
Like Lincoln and Roosevelt , he is a man with no apparent convictions that will stand in his way .
Perhaps he is just the man the U.S. of A. needs – a man capable of bankrupting the nation with a smile .
Yes , Dear Reader , the ‘ great man ’ always seems to come along when you need him .
Longtime Daily Reckoning readers will recall our theory :
After the Berlin Wall came down …
America had no enemies worthy of the name .
She had a monopoly franchise on the world ’s money – the dollar was the undisputed queen of the planet ’s reserves .
And she had a monopoly on military power too – the undisputed king of the hill , with a Pentagon budget nearly as large as all other nations ’ military spending put together .
But nature abhors a vacuum and detests a monopoly .
Lacking a suitable challenger , America had to become her own worst enemy .
Lacking a rival who could destroy her , she had to destroy herself .
And so , when Americans went to the polls in November of 2000 , they elected a president who was up to the job : George W. Bush .
Eight years later , the Clinton surpluses had turned into the biggest deficits ever …an immense bubble had impoverished the middle class …and the country was engaged in two unwinnable , unnecessary , and hugely expensive wars .
Mission accomplished !
But it ’s not over .
The millstones of history may grind slowly … but they grind exceedingly fine …
The American empire is clearly overstretched and over - indebted .
If it is to save itself , it should scale back immediately … cutting the Pentagon budget in half , for example , and eliminating all unnecessary expenses ( which is most of them ) .
Instead of spending $ 3 trillion , it should spend … say … $ 1 trillion , and run a surplus .
What about the depression , you might be wondering .
Is n’t this the time to increase government spending , rather than decrease it ?
Ah…if you are even asking the question , you are the victim of a dead economist .
Keynes ’ theory was that the state should run contra-cyclical surpluses and deficits – to offset the ups and downs of the business cycle .
But that is too soggy a bog for us to trod in today .
Instead , we will skirt it with another of our dicta :
People come to believe what they must believe when they must believe it .
When an empire is new and fresh and growing … people believe in saving , hard work , and small frugality .
When an empire is old and decaying … they think the government should spend “ whatever it takes ” to take care of them .
This attitude helps destroy the empire … thus making room for the next one .
But if America really wanted to protect its wealth , its power , and its position in the world , it should fight the depression in an entirely different way .
Instead of bailing out failed businesses it should let them go bust .
Instead of coddling the executives who mismanaged their companies , it should turn them loose .
Instead of shoring up reckless banks , it should help knock them down .
And instead of spending money on stimulus programs … it should give money back to the taxpayers so they can stimulate the economy , or not , as they choose .
Taxes should be cut in line with government spending .
This would boost savings , reduce debt , and … gradually … increase investment and consumer spending too .
But that is not the road Americans have chosen .
Instead , they found a president willing to go along with history .
Instead of scaling down , he is scaling up .
Instead of reducing America ’s indebtedness , he is increasing it .
Instead of going for safety , he ’s going for broke .
No one knows how this will turn out , of course .
None of us get to read the history books before they are written .
But our guess is Mr. Obama will emerge from the tomes as another ‘ great man . ’
Doing history ’s dirty work …he is continuing the destruction of America ’s monopoly position on money and power .
Until tomorrow ,

'' Go into any inner-city neighborhood , '' Barack Obama said in his keynote address to the Democratic National Convention , '' and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach kids to learn .
They know that parents have to parent , that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white . ''
In a speech filled with rousing applause lines , it was a line that many black Democratic delegates found especially galvanizing .
Not just because they agreed , but because it was a home truth they 'd seldom heard a politician say out loud .
Why has it been so difficult for black leaders to say such things in public , without being pilloried for '' blaming the victim ' ' ?
Why the huge flap over Bill Cosby 's insistence that black teenagers do their homework , stay in school , master standard English and stop having babies ?
Any black person who frequents a barbershop or beauty parlor in the inner city knows that Mr. Cosby was only echoing sentiments widely shared in the black community .

Thirty - five thousand years before nanotechnology became a buzzword , a different kind of diminutive innovation transformed India .
The advent of stone microblades set the stage for the subcontinent ’s explosive population growth , new research suggests .
The easy - to - manufacture tools – also known as microliths – were a vast improvement over larger stone flake tools used previously , says Michael Petraglia , an archaeologist at the University of Oxford , UK , who led the study .
Because microblades could be cut from stone more quickly and in higher volumes than flakes , hunting probably became a vastly more efficient endeavour .
“ It allows people to more reliably and more cheaply slaughter animals , ” says Lawrence Guy Straus , a paleoanthropologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque , who was not involved in the study .
Petraglia and his colleagues contend that the beginnings of a global ice age pushed ancient populations of Indians into closer contact – and competition – with one another .
“ They need to develop new strategies to produce new resources .
They invent microlithic technology and it spreads very rapidly . ”

Though proving causality of any ancient upheaval is difficult , if not impossible , Petraglia ’s team argue that genetic , environmental and archaeological records make a strong circumstantial case for their theory .
Genetic evidence
Between 30 and 35,000 years ago , the Earth cooled dramatically .
In Europe , these changes brought with them massive glaciers , pushing Neanderthals and newly arrived humans into small pockets , and perhaps contact .
In India , however , this ice age shortened the monsoon season and transformed what had been a rather homogenous tropical landscape into a patchwork of savannahs and deciduous forests bordered by desert , Petraglia says .
“ When you get more deserts you ’re getting environmental fragmentation .
That is conducive to hunter - gatherers , Petraglia says .
“ They like mosaic environments because you tend to have a lot of diversity in flora and fauna . ”
These changes almost certainly would have split up ancient populations , but they could have spurred their growth as well , Petraglia says .
By treating the mitochondrial DNA of contemporary Indians as a sort of molecular clock , the researchers documented an expansion in Indian genetic diversity dated to around the time of this ice age .
Shrinking tools
And this is where microblades come in handy .
The tools – narrow and up to 4 centimetres long – began appearing in large numbers around 30,000 years ago , archaeological records from across the subcontinent show .
Prior to this , Indians wielded bulkier , less - efficient stone flakes .
Microblades , which were probably attached to spears and later arrows , were a game - changing technology that allowed more densely packed hunter - gatherers to thrive , Petraglia says .
Later innovations – namely agriculture and livestock domestication – undoubtedly pushed population densities higher .
But Petraglia thinks that the shifts that occurred 35,000 years ago got the ball rolling .
Its influence can still be seen today , he says .
Modern legacy ?
“ It ’s a mystery why there are so many people in that part of the world and it was n’t just domestication that led to more than a billion people being around in South Asia .
We argue that is has to go back to a much earlier period . ”
Straus , who mentored Petraglia in the 1980s , buys that argument , but says populations could only swell so much in the ice age period .
“ We ’re still talking about hunter - gatherers ; hunter - gatherers are never found in hugely dense numbers , ” he says .
Ofer Bar - Yosef , a paleoanthropologist at Harvard University says the discovery of widespread microblade use in India 30,000 years ago “ closes an important gap in our knowledge . ”
Similar tools have been found from around this period in Africa , Europe and west Asia .
But climate change is n’t necessary to spur technological innovation and adoption , Bar - Yosef says .
Hominins that predated modern humans wielded stone axes that changed little over hundreds of thousands of years and numerous wild climatic swings .
Journal reference : Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( DOI : 10.1073/pnas.0810842106 )
( CNN ) -- Dave Howe , the president of the Sci Fi Channel , knows that many people will be upset .
" Warehouse 13 " " epitomizes the new Syfy , " says the channel 's president .
On Tuesday , the Sci Fi Channel changes its name to Syfy -- pronounced " sigh - fie , " the same as the current name -- a moniker that 's attracted its share of mockery since its announcement three months ago .
The idea is to expand Sci Fi's audience , but some members of that audience have expressed their displeasure .
" Perhaps the most ill - advised branding move since New Coke , " wrote CNet 's " Digital City " blogger Dan Ackerman .
Even some of Sci Fi's own SciFi.com commenters were dismissive .
" This is a terrible idea , " Grateful Josh wrote .
" You mean the announcement was n't an April Fool 's joke ? "
Sue Lee asked , adding that the channel should have changed its name to " FRAK , " a common expletive on Sci Fi's popular " Battlestar Galactica . "
Some critics have taken to pronouncing the new name " Siffy . "
Howe says " we 're not worried , " despite the old admonition that " if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . "
" We needed a unique and distinct brand name that we can own for the future , that works in the multiplatform , on - demand world , " he said , adding that " Sci Fi " is n't a brand name , it 's " a genre name . "
" Syfy , " he said , " gives us a unique brand name .
" The last thing we want to do is alienate our core audience , " he added .
With the new name , shows such as " Galactica " can be exposed to a wider audience , one not scared away by all that " Sci Fi " connotes ( " space and aliens and the future , " in Howe 's words ) .
And , of course , it 's about the bottom line , which has been true for a number of cable networks over the past few years .
There was a time when the name of a cable network said it all .
" A& E " aired arts and entertainment .
" TLC " was about learning , the " L " in its original name , " The Learning Channel . " " Bravo " was devoted to fine arts .
But over the years , as the cable universe has grown , each network has sought to grab a distinctive slice for itself in hopes of bringing in viewers -- and money .
Some have changed names entirely , such as The Nashville Network , once a country music channel that became TNN and then Spike , devoted to younger males .
Others have simply refocused their branding , as in the case of USA -- once a general - interest hodgepodge -- and its slogan , " Characters Welcome , " which has allowed the network to cast a wide net with original shows such as " Monk " and " Burn Notice " and reruns of popular dramas such as " House " and " NCIS . "
Marketing expert Rachel C. Weingarten , who was part of the team that helped turn TNN into Spike , says the network 's old name was n't attracting the key male demographic or the advertiser dollars that came with it .
" With the way it was , nobody was excited , " she recalled .
Changing the name to Spike gave the network visibility and -- thanks to more programming of action movies and combat - oriented shows -- more appeal to men .
" Viewers were n't embarrassed to have a beer and ... talk about [ the shows ] , " she said .
She praised TLC , USA , HGTV and the Turner networks of TNT and TBS for cleverly and pointedly redefining themselves .
( The latter two are units of Time Warner , as is CNN . )
Having initials that can mean everything -- or nothing -- helps , she adds .
" When you have really clever initials , you can do what you want . "
However , she cautioned , she 's not convinced that changing Sci Fi into Syfy is a good idea .
" I think they 're trying too hard , " she said .
" Also , the timing 's unfortunate . "
With the struggling economy , advertisers are taking more of a wait - and - see approach to buying spots , she said , and so the changeover may not get the marketing support it should .
Howe , however , says that changing the name was a necessary move .
With Sci
Fi more popular than ever and planning a major expansion into international markets , the network needed a name that was n't so confining .
" This was a two - year exercise , " he said .
The new name , he says , needed to be usable all over the world in Internet URLs , brand extensions and merchandising , and " the only way to do that is to create an empty name .
" We explored them all , " he said .
" We wanted a word that was uniquely ours , " while not straying too far from the sound of " Sci Fi . "
As part of Syfy 's launch , the network has a new slogan -- " Imagine Greater " -- and new programming on the way .
The flagship , which premieres Tuesday , is " Warehouse 13 , " about two Secret Service agents who explore the paranormal and supernatural .
It 's been described as combining elements of " The X - Files " and the Indiana Jones films .
" ' Warehouse 13 ' epitomizes the essence of the new Syfy , " Howe said .
He hopes that the show , along with other programs , helps " continue the journey we 're already on , " skewing younger and more upscale .
He observed that the network is already gender - balanced , with an audience that 's 55 percent male , 45 percent female .
Seton Hall advertising professor Walt Guarino thinks the network is making a good move .
" I do not think that the SciFi Channel will lose an ounce of equity by changing to Syfy , " he said via e-mail .
" I think the name change is a reason to create new awareness to the brand .
However , given their appeal to such a defined audience , I do n't see many new people ' entering their tent ' as a result of this name change . "
Indeed , added Kelly O'Keefe , managing director of Virginia Commonwealth University 's Brandcenter communications school , Syfy is taking a risk .
" It waters down what has been a very focused brand , " he said .
He understands the desire to expand the audience but says that changing a successful concept often loses customers -- and allows competitors to jump into the fray .
He points to the retailing world to make his point .
Circuit City was once the country 's strongest electronics retailer ; when it diversified with its Carmax used - car subsidiary , the lack of focus allowed Best Buy to take over the electronics market .
Similarly , companies can lose the goodwill of its most devoted customers by being short - sighted , he says , noting that Starbucks suffered a backlash when it stopped serving decaffeinated coffee in the afternoons .
" You can look at the bottom line and say it 's a justified decision ... but that 's where sometimes a short - sighted decision may tarnish the brand , " he said .
" If Sci Fi owns the geeky , science fiction - loving audience , it has to be careful to hold on to that customer . "
Still , Howe is unfazed .
He believes that " Sci Fi " was a barrier to possible viewers and that if the programming is good , the viewers will follow .
" We think it will be recognized enough [ for new viewers ] make the leap , " he said .
And then , will people pronounce the name correctly ?
" We 've heard about this ' Siffy ' thing , but very few people pronounce it ' Siffy , ' " he said .
" It 's not something we 're concerned about . "
All About SCI FI Channel
This morning I had the opportunity to interview Maurice Jones - Drew .
Yes .
BlackandTeal interviewed Maurice .
Jones .
Drew .
You can sit on awe for a minute before you continue on , it is okay .
We wo n’t judge you .
Jones - Drew took the opportunity to talk about his partnership with Gatorade and the NFL in their “ Beat the Heat ” campaign .
The whole purpose of the program is that people in general are unaware of how the heat can affect their bodies , even in the extreme .
They want to educate people on the importance of keeping yourself hydrated .
MJD : Good morning , how are you ?
BlackandTeal : I am awake , and that is an accomplishment , I assure you .
MJD : If you had looked on twitter , you would have saw that I wrote that Gatorade is really cutting into my beauty sleep today but that I am willing to let that slide .
BlackandTeal : Well I will definitely check that out !
Why did you choose to help out Gatorade with the Beat the Heat campaign ?
MJD : I definitely think it is something that the high school kids in Florida and where I am from , California , need to hear about .
Where I am from it can get to 115 , 120 in August .
Kids do n’t understand how important it is to hydrate and I think this is a chance for myself and other NFL families and coaches to pull in that gap between the players , parents and coaches in high school and college .
I just think that hydration is the key thing to being the best player on the field because if your body is not able to run how are you going to be able to go out there catch passes , block , whatever it is that you ’re going to do out there .
The key thing to that is hydration .
You have to drink water three , four days before because it has to get in your system and your body has to be able to use it .
Gatorade comes into play when you start to sweat and you lose electrolytes , sodium .
Gatorade is able to replenish that .
I definitely think that it will help you improve your game .
BlackandTeal : Well , I know from the experience of being a Jaguar fan that I have seen people like Donovan McNabb throw up on the field during the August games and so obviously the NFL still has some issues .
What do the Jaguars do to make sure you guys are ready for the heat that comes in August ?
MJD : Well our trainers and coaches always have Gatorade and water wherever we meet .
We usually go fifty / fifty on Gatorade and water .
What they do is that they try to make sure you ’re drinking all the time so you keep re-hydrating your body .
That helps you with the soreness and a bunch of other different things .
They try to keep you as cool as possible being as the heat index is Jacksonville can get up to 120 .
It can get pretty rough .
I think a lot of the players that are n’t from this or are n’t used to this — like , when I was a rookie you end up cramping up because you do n’t understand how hot it gets and how the heat can get to your body .
BlackandTeal : Yeah , I understand because I have lived in Jacksonville all my life .
It can be brutal .
Have the rookies that we ’ve drafted … are they doing okay with everything ?
MJD : You never know until August .
I mean , it really is n’t hot until August here so right now it is going to be a little hot in July or something but when August comes around , like when hurricane season comes around , towards the end … those two , three weeks it gets real , real rough .
It gets real muggy .
I hope you guys listen and understand .
When you get a full body cramp that is the first sign of heat stroke .
So in Jacksonville we do take those seriously .
Whenever you cramp up , they take you inside , they re-hydrate you , put IVs in you , they make you drink a bunch of Gatorade , which is key .
Obviously , Gatorade helps you play and be at your best longer than any other sports drink so hopefully you guys understand you need to push the fluids .
BlackandTeal : Yeah , Gatorade was invented in Florida for a reason .
MJD : Yeah , I did n’t know Florida Gators could invent the drink like that , I thought they were only good for football .
They did a pretty good job , I guess .
BlackandTeal : Before I let you go , what do you have to say to those of us who plan to draft you in the first round of our fantasy football leagues ?
MJD : If you do n’t , some one else will !
Nah , I am just playing .
This year is going to be a fun , exciting year for the Jaguars .
I think we have a lot of upside right now looking at the players and how we ’ve been playing .
It is just a different attitude here .
It definitely going to be a great year for us and I hope it is going to be a great year for those guys in fantasy because I am going to play myself this year .
If you would like to help Maurice Jones - Drew and the other NFL players and coaches in the Beat the Heat campaign , you can do your part by going here and downloading the Beat the Heat safety package .
For every unique download , a 1 dollar donation will be given to charities that specialize in heat related illnesses .
You may learn something and you ’ll also do it for a good cause !
See , learning new things does have its benefits .
A complete list of all the species on the planet is , for many biologists and conservationists , the natural history equivalent of the Holy Grail .
So the recently - launched EoL ( it stands for ' Encyclopedia of Life ' ) , which aims to create not just a list , but an individual web - page , for every single one of the world 's plant and animal species , is bound to cause a buzz .
Make no mistake , this will be a truly Herculean task .
There may only be about 5,000 species of mammals , 8,000 species of reptiles , and 10,000 or so species of birds .
But once we get to groups like flowering plants ( about 250,000 species , and that 's not including hybrids ) , insects ( over 1 m species described , with perhaps another 5 m new ones waiting to be discovered ) , let alone micro-organisms such as viruses and bacteria , it 's easy to see why EoL might seem little optimistic .
So how does EoL work ?
Well , like its forerunner Wikipedia , EoL is a self - perpetuating encyclopedia , written by and refereed by anyone who wants to contribute .
In practice , the contributors are likely to be mainly professional scientists or talented amateur naturalists – in some cases the leading experts on a species or group .
Others can add text , images and even video clips to each entry , with the ultimate goal of making information about all the world 's organisms freely available .
Accuracy will be ensured ( hopefully , at least ) by an expert team of curators , who will weed out any inaccuracies and clarify any confusions .
Like Wikipedia , there will be no charge for anyone wishing to access the information , so writers must be willing to share their knowledge with anyone else under a ' creative commons licence ' .
Original sources will also be credited where possible .
So far , so good .
But anyone familiar with recent controversies in biological science – and in particular taxonomy , classification and nomenclature – will immediately be aware of problems beyond the sheer workload involved .
Broadly , these break down into three areas of potential confusion :
• What is a species ?
Although we know that the African elephant and Indian elephant are different species , and likewise the house sparrow is a different species from the tree sparrow , many divisions between species are not so clear - cut .
Scientists may lump two previously separate species together ( like the Bullock 's and Baltimore orioles of the US ) , or split one apart ( as in bean and pink - footed geese ) .
And when it comes to the differences between closely related plants and their many hybrids , things can get really confusing .
• What is its name ?
Brits call divers " divers " , Americans call them loons ; likewise " skua " ( UK ) and " jaeger " ( US ) .
In Africa things get even more confusing , while many species of insect and plant do n't have an English name at all .
And what about the non English - speaking world ?
OK , we could use scientific names , but even these change , as has recently happened with the classification of such common and widespread species as the tits .
• How many species are there ?
I 've already touched on this – but when you realise that the 2 m species currently identified represent as little as 2 % of all the species on Earth , it 's easy to see why EoL may turn out to be a bit like painting the Forth Bridge – just when you think it 's finished , up pops some other obscure organism begging for entry to the club .
Despite these caveats , though , I think the founders of EoL do deserve praise and support .
And as one representative of our own species , the poet Robert Browning , wrote :
Even though I have been following Seattle enlightened man John de Graff of Take Back Your Time Day fame for a while , I completely forgot his related campaign for a Right 2 Vacation act as I was writing about our need for vacations and lack of it in the US .
In March 2008 , he shared his thoughts on the topic for Experience Life Magazine with powerful pointers such as Take a Break or Be Broken , More than Fond Memories and A Month of Sundays under the banner of health and wellness .
Funny coincidence as I noted in my previous No Vacation Nation piece that vacations should be included in Health Benefits .
Under Take a Break — or Be Broken , John de Graff quotes the author of Work to Live ( Perigree , 2003 ) , Joe Robinson , a former Los Angeles Times outdoor writer who is now a life - balance trainer stating that :
“ Men reduce their risk of a heart attack by 30 percent and women by 50 , ” he adds , citing data from the ongoing Framingham Heart Study and a State University of New York at Oswego study .
“ There seems to be no positive effect when you just take a day off here and there .
It may help you de-stress a little mentally , but it does n’t reduce your risk of heart failure .
You need a block of time to do that . ”
Many of us know from personal experience that it often takes a week to decompress and another week to get meaningful rest at a snail pace ( hence the illustration above , a ' grapesnail ' from Wikipedia )
As Slow Planet puts it " Slow is not about doing everything at a snail 's pace ; it 's about working , playing and living better by doing everything at the right speed . "
Have a relaxing moment ( or two ) if not a relaxing day !

The Obama administration may start its program to spur purchases of mortgage - backed securities from banks with about $ 20 billion in public and private money , down from as much as $ 100 billion when the effort was announced in March , sources said .
The Treasury Department will pro vide about $ 1.1 billion in capital to eight to 10 money managers it will select for its Public - Private Investment Program .
[ It is interesting that no mention is made of the fact that the Fed is creating ( monetization ) $ 3 trillion to purchase US Treasuries , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds and CDO toxic waste from banks .
The Fed will not tell us what they are paying for the CDOs and part of the game is that the banks rotate the money into Treasuries , a sweet little daisy chain .
As you can see , the Treasury might get an additional $ 20 billion into CDOs .
We do n’t see it happening .
The private interests do n’t want to get involved .

US consumers made 675,351 bankruptcy filings in the first half of 2009 , a 36.5 percent increase from a year ago , according to the American Bankruptcy Institute .
June filings by consumers totaled 116,365 , up 40.6 percent from the same period in 2008 , the ABI said .
Oracle plans to cut as many as 1,000 jobs in Europe , the CFDT labor union said on its Internet site .
Of the total , about 250 jobs will be lost in France , equivalent to 16 percent of the company 's workforce there .
British authorities have started an investigation into millions of dollars of payments from the operations of the convicted money manager Bernard L. Madoff to companies linked to the Austrian banker Sonja Kohn , an Austrian official confirmed yesterday .
The Serious Fraud Office had asked Austrian prosecutors in May for help in investigating payments made by Madoff ’s London office for research reports by Bank Medici , which was majority - owned by Kohn , who also served as its chairman .
“ We ’re closely cooperating with the SFO and the US Justice Department in that case , ’’ the official , Gerhard Jarosch , a senior public prosecutor in Austria , said yesterday .
A separate investigation by the Austrian prosecutor into whether Kohn and Bank Medici were involved with Madoff is continuing , he said .
Prosecutors are looking into whether Madoff paid more than $ 40 million to Kohn in exchange for turning three Bank Medici funds into feeder funds for his business , The Wall Street Journal reported , citing affidavits filed by prosecutors in the United States and Britain .
The Austrian daily Der Standard reported last week that Kohn received about $ 11.5 million , for research reports for which prosecutors were unable to find receipts .
U.S. service industries from retailers to homebuilders contracted last month at the slowest pace in nine months , as measures of new orders and employment improved .
The Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non- manufacturing businesses , which make up almost 90 percent of the economy , rose to 47 -- higher than forecast -- from 44 in May , according to data from the Tempe , Arizona - based group .
Readings less than 50 signal contraction .
Our President favors torture just like his predecessor did .
He threatens other governments if they expose what his administration is up too .
He blocks any and all exposure of government activities , a culture of non-disclosure .
In addition , there is a large list of dissidents , such as myself and other publishers and radio personalities of every political persuasion .
Anyone who exposes what the Illuminists are up too is an enemy of the state .
We wish George Orwell were here to see this .
Last week we filled you in on the scandal that could envelope and crush the administration .
That is the illegal arbitrary dismissal of Investigator General Gerald Walpin who tried to get criminal charges brought against Barry ’s close friend and Mayor of Sacramento , Kevin Johnson who misappropriated some $ 500,000 .
The AG later layed a $ 73,000 payback on Johnson .
As you can see , crime pays .
More blatant corruption .
We have done scores of programs on the mainline media regarding the scandal , something the kept media themselves refuses to do .
Sir Alan Greenspan was a disaster for America .
His latest lying , idiotic comment was , “ I do n’t think it is an economic problem – it is a political problem . ”
What we have is a monetary and fiscal problem that translates into an economic problem .
The American engine of growth has grounded to a halt over the past two years as a result and has taken the entire world economy with it .
Today ’s problems are very much an out growth of Greenspan ’s terribly flawed monetary management , followed by an equally incompetent Ben Bernanke .
What else would you call non-financial growth in the early nineties , which averaged $ 565 billion annually that peaked at $ 3.545 trillion in 2007 ?
Does that sound like monetary sanity ?
This was the massive system of credit that inflated asset prices , incomes , corporate profits and government revenues .
This caused the wild orgy of consumption , services , including de-industrialization and massive imports spawned by free trade , globalization , offshorting and outsourcing .
Those horrendous events will take decades to reverse .
Who can call prudent or reasonable the creation of those combined Treasury , GSE and MBS obligations surging $ 1.949 trillion , or 15.3 % in 2008 to $ 14.709 trillion ?
This is called Ponzi finance dynamics .
The word is bubble and that bubble is still being sustained .
How does Sir Alan justify Total Mortgage Debt growth from the 90s averaging $ 269 billion to $ 1 trillion by 2003 and $ 1.390 trillion in 2006 ?
ABC , asset backed securities , went from $ 200 billion in 2003 and beyond $ 800 billion in 2006 .
MBS doubled in four years to $ 4.5 trillion by the end of 2007 .
That was the bad news ; unfortunately there is worse news on the way .
Today ’s credit crisis finance bubble will make the residential and commercial bubble look like a joke .
Multiply by 5 or 10 .
Who knows where this can end up ?
The bomb is in the air and has n’t even hit yet .
The quality of Treasury , GSE ( Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ) , CDO and ABS falls every day .
The debt is massive and it is not producing real economic wealth creation .
This is a tremendous drag on the system .
Wage increases are miniscule , inflation grows as purchasing power falls as does general confidence .
There is major misallocation of assets and a maladjusted economic structure that can only end in dire inflationary consequences .
The private creation of real jobs has generated about 100,000 jobs a year and the public sector more than double that , or 240,000 a year .
Most jobs created over the past ten years have been low paying .
290,000 have been created in healthcare , 157,000 in food and drinking establishments and 139,000 in government education .
Declining jobs , free trade , globalization , offshoring and outsourcing , have decimated living standards and have caused a massive transfer of wealth to BRICs ; OPEC and slave labor countries that cheapen their currencies by manipulating them and by subsidizing their industries .
In just the first quarter GDP fell 5.5 % due to a decline in inventories and trade .
The 37.3 % decline in business investment and inventories was a record .
The greatest decline since 1947 when records began .
The 38.8 % decline in homebuilding is the largest contraction since 1980 .
Next comes the planned reduction of Fed market support programs , including swap lines with 14 international central banks , due to expire in October to February .
The Fed says it will reduce the maximum size of its term securities lending facilities , TSLF , from $ 200 billion plus options , and the maximum size of its term auction facility , TAF , to $ 500 billion from $ 600 billion .
This is part of the Fed ’s glide path to normalization .
This rhetoric can’t happen unless the Fed has finally decided to allow deflation to take over and we do not see that happening .
On of the more instigators of our current credit crisis , Goldman Sachs , are now recording record bonuses in the greatest financial crisis in almost 80 years .
This success by Goldman is not shared throughout the industry .
The walls of capitalism are falling and Goldman is making a fortune .
We ask how ?
The answer is inside information and that they are even more corrupt than Washington is .
Goldman is part of a triumvirate that rules America although few Americans are aware of their power – a power that sucks the very lifeblood out of our country and has for at least the last 100 years .
These people and others have controlled our country for a long time .
It is a marriage made in hell .
Many country ’s politicians and Wall Street and bankers control money and in turn control almost every nation today .
This past April we saw tax reductions and increased benefits of $ 121 billion on an annualized basis .
As a result consumer spending increased by a paltry $ 1 billion .
In May , stimulus was $ 163 billion and consumer spending only increased by $ 25 billion .
As a result personal savings jumped from 4.3 % in March , 5.6 % in April and 6.9 % in May .
This result needless to say is not what the Frankenstein elitists in Washington had in mind .
The next step , of course , is to force consumers to spend , otherwise the consumer cycle wo n’t work .
The public is spending $ 0.08 of every stimulus dollar and the rest is being used to pay down debt or is going into savings .
We predicted 90 % would not be spent and again we were right , that means as a percentage of GDP only 70 % is coming from the consumer , down from 72 % at the peak .
The stimulus package did another thing and that is distort income in the second quarter resulting in income gains of 1.4 % in May .
The year - on - year trend is still - 1.1 % .
This year 5 % of workers took unpaid leave and 15 % had to accept a pay cut .
Ten percent had to take an extra job last year and 20 % of 45 to 54 - year olds took second jobs .
Between now and 2013 , $ 5 trillion in wealth will have to be liquidated .
A good part of that will occur over the next 3 - 1/ 2 years .
That means continued monetization and depression and an ever - depreciating dollar .
This depression will last 8 to 20 years .
The workweek has fallen to 33.1 hours .
We see that number below 30 next year .
Probably more than 50 % of workers will stop funding 401( k ) ’s , IRA ’s and Roth ’s .
Twenty - five percent of companies are suspending 401 ( k ) ’s and that number will grow .
That will have a devastating affect on the stock and bond markets .
Again , get out of all stocks except gold and silver shares and Canadian Treasuries .
Get out of corporate bonds .
Interest rates will rise over the next two years .
Get rid of cash value life insurance policies and annuities .
No CDs of any kind .
Unemployment has doubled in seven months from 7 to 14 million .
In the previous eight years , due to free trade , globalization , offshoring and outsourcing , we lost 5 million jobs .
We are calling U6 unemployment at 20.5 % .
Officially it is 16.5 % .
Even the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University says real unemployment is 18.2 % .
Our President is just realizing that he is presiding over the bankruptcy of the US .
In order to bring this to a halt he would have to cut mandatory programs that underline the welfare state , which makes up 60 % of the budget .
We see no chance of that happening .
That means in the next three years the Treasury will go broke .
Once the insolvency occurs welfare , Social Security and Medicare will end along with many other programs .
Imperial America will cease to exist .
Those occupations in Japan , South Korea , Europe , Iraq , Afghanistan and hundreds of other bases , will end , unable to be financed .
The burden will be too much to any longer bare .
How can any national government expect to survive fiscally as tax revenue falls 18 % and spending increases 18 % ?
All the players know this , so the only conclusion we can come to is that they want our government to collapse .
Worse yet , spending wo n’t be the official $ 1.84 trillion , but $ 2 to $ 2.5 trillion .
Corporate tax revenues have fallen 61 % and individual returns are off 22 % as of May .
The US government and the Fed are committed to spend $ 12.8 trillion , but if we add in further Fed monetization declared to be created by 9/30/09 , that figure will be closer to $ 15.8 trillion .
This is much greater than our entire GDP for last year .
As a result the 30 - year bond is off almost 30 % this year , and the 10 - year note has lost 11 % .
Overall all Treasuries are off more than 6 % and that is while the Fed has been manipulating the bond market .
While all this has transpired the dollar has fallen from 89.5 on the USDX to 79.9 - that is close to 10 % .
Thus , if you owned 10 - year T - notes you have lost 20 % of your capital , plus the inflation loss of 9 % .
You are a net loser of some 30 % .
Two types of investors buy T - bills , or bank CD ’s , they are either dumb or they have a vested interest in not seeing the system collapse .
Buyers of treasuries and Agencies cannot absorb these losses indefinitely .
This has been going on for 9 years .
From this level we believe losses could be the intrinsic value of all the funds invested .
One is certainly looking at in excess of a 60 % loss in purchasing power .
The average foreign nation holds 64.5 % of their reserves in US dollars .
That should break just about everyone .

Cyclists are no strangers to breaks and fractures , but Andrew Coggan could be forgiven for not expecting a hip fracture from a bike crash at age 30 .
He may have been less surprised than most of his peers though , having recently been diagnosed with low bone density .
For many cyclists , an injury like Coggan ’s is the first sign that bones are not as strong as they should be .
Although cyclists are known for staying on top of their training heart rate zones and pedal cadence , increasing research suggests they should also pay attention to their risk of thinning bones .
“ Sometimes athletes in their late 20s and early 30s will come in for a femur or a hip fracture , and they ’ll be surprised because the fall was really not that bad , ” says Dr. Max Testa , a sports medicine physician at the Orthopedic Specialty Hospital in Salt Lake City who routinely treats elite cyclists .
“ But we ’ll look at the X - rays and see that there is some osteopenia [ lower - than - normal bone density ] there . ”
Many factors contribute to osteopenia or osteoporosis ( very low bone mineral density ) in cyclists , but one of the culprits is the nature of the exercise itself .
Cycling is a low - impact sport that puts little mechanical load on the bones .
That ’s great if you have joint problems , but it ’s the weight - bearing nature of exercise that signals bones to create more mass .
Without such stress , bones do n’t get stronger , making them more prone to injury .
Advertisement
Avid cyclists , both amateur and professional , seem to be especially at risk of bone injuries if they do n’t do any type of cross-training .
( Swimmers may also be in danger , since that sport requires little mechanical loading as well . )
The lower spine is a particularly susceptible area , since it gets almost no loading .
The hips may get some from the action of pedaling .
Coggan , now a senior scientist and exercise physiologist at Washington University in St. Louis , had been cycling one to two hours a day for about 15 years when he crashed in 1989 .
“ And I recall prior to that , ” he says , “ when I ’d be chatting with a group of cyclists , I ’d be taking note of the fact that everybody had scars from things like broken arms and broken collarbones . ”
A recent study in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise found that competitive male road cyclists had significantly lower bone mineral density in their spines than a control group of men who were moderately physically active while doing other recreational activities .
They were also more likely to have osteopenia and osteoporosis than those in the control group , despite the fact that the cyclists had a greater calcium intake .
Another study , published in the journal Bone in 2002 , found that male road cyclists had lower bone mineral density than male mountain bikers after adjusting for body weight and controlling for age .
The difference there could be that mountain biking , with its bumps and jumps , perhaps provides more impact and stimulation for bone growth than does road cycling .

Youthful risks
Young cyclists are n’t immune .
“ You do n’t achieve peak bone mass until your late 20s , ” says Debra Bemben , co-author of the more recent study and an associate professor in the health and exercise science department at the University of Oklahoma .
“ If cyclists are in their early 20s and they ’re not doing anything else for exercise that ’s going to load their spine and help them achieve peak bone mass , it may put them at risk if they fall , since they ’ll have a greater chance of fracture .
This is a pretty important health issue . ”

Further , some hard - core cyclists may not be eating enough to offset what they burn when exercising , depriving their bodies of bone - strengthening nutrients such as calcium and vitamin D. Especially at risk are women who have disordered eating , menstrual disruptions and bone loss -- known as the “ female athlete triad . ”
“ If there ’s a deficit in the energy balance , ” Bemben says , “ then the body is not able to build things up , like bone . ”
That caloric shortfall could also trigger other physiological problems , such as hormone imbalances .
For women this could mean lower estrogen levels ; for men , lower testosterone levels .
Bemben says estrogen and testosterone have protective effects on bones , slowing the rate of bone breakdown .
But hormones are n’t only affected by calories .
“ If people overexercise , that can suppress testosterone in men , as it can suppress estrogen in women , ” says Dr. Aurelia Nattiv , director of the Santa Monica - UCLA Osteoporosis Center , although studies have not always borne out the low testosterone - low bone density connection .
Advertisement
“ Too much of a good thing can cause negative effects on bone .
We do see that sometimes not only do women lose their periods and have low levels of estrogen , but elite male runners can have low testosterone .
So adequate hormonal balance is important . ”
She adds that a family history of osteoporosis can contribute as well .
Even perspiration can be a factor , Bemben says : “ Cyclists may lose a lot of calcium in their sweat , ” she says .
“ Even if they ’re taking in amounts [ of liquid ] that are seemingly high for the average man , that might not be enough to balance what they ’re excreting . ”

Getting the word out
Advertisement
Though the subject of bone density occasionally pops up on cycling message boards , it ’s not exactly a hot topic .
“ Some people have no clue , ” Testa says .
“ They do n’t even know it ’s an issue . ”
A dual energy X - ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan is most often used to test bone density , a non-invasive test that uses low levels of radiation .
Testa adds , “ Often people are surprised to find that their results are not ideal . ”
And though women are reminded ( via the media or their physicians ) to up their calcium intake to prevent osteoporosis , men usually do n’t get the same messages .
Young male cyclists , especially , figure they ’re healthy and do n’t need to be concerned .
Some sports medicine physicians , orthopedists and cycling coaches discuss the issue with patients , but Testa and others say more education may be necessary .
Coggan , still a competitive amateur cyclist , got another DXA scan a few weeks ago and the news was n’t great -- he has osteopenia in his lumbar spine and osteoporosis in his hips .
He says that while he does do weight training and runs occasionally , he knows he needs to focus his athletics more on health rather than performance .
“ I have a couple more athletic goals I want to achieve , ” he says , “ and then I may have to start jumping rope . ”

Some help for at - risk cyclists
Advertisement
Cyclists who may be at risk for osteopenia or osteoporosis include those who have been cycling for years without doing any other activities , are very thin , have a family history of osteoporosis or are post - menopausal .
Those athletes should consult a physician to see if any treatments or tests are necessary , such as a bone density scan , known as a DXA ( not all insurance plans cover the test ) .
They should also discuss lifestyle changes such as eating more foods that contain protein and essential bone - building nutrients such as calcium and vitamin D. A registered dietitian -- preferably one who has worked with athletes -- can help design a meal plan that includes key foods .
And , of course , they should cross -train .
Cross -training for cyclists does n’t require hours of doing other exercises .
Some light strength - training can help build bone mass and squats are especially good for loading the spine .
Jumping rope -- or just jumping -- also provides impact the bones need .
Advertisement
Running , soccer and basketball are good plyometric sports , but doing too much too soon could cause fractures , especially if bones are already compromised .
Keep in mind that bone loss ca n’t be reversed overnight .
Depending on the severity of the loss , it may take months or even years to see an improvement in bone mineral density .

Cancer is a natural consequence of human evolution .
Our genes have not developed to give us long and happy lives .
They are optimized to copy themselves into the next generation - irrespective of our personal desires .
According to Jarle Breivik , an associate professor at the University of Oslo , Norway , we are therefore unlikely to find a final solution to cancer .
Doing research at the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , Breivik explores the connection between cancer development and Darwinian evolution .
In a recent interview with Scientific American , and the research magazine Apollon , published by the University of Oslo , he concludes that “ Cancer is a fundamental consequence of the way we are made .
We are temporary colonies made by our genes to propagate themselves to the next generation .
The ultimate solution to cancer is that we would have to start reproducing ourselves in a different way . ”
Genes that repair genes
As a medical student at the Norwegian Radium Hospital , Breivik discovered a curious phenomenon .
He found that cancer cells that developed in the upper colon had other types of mutations than those found in tumours closer to the rectum .
This finding was confirmed by other researchers and could be traced to mutations in particular DNA repair genes .
Such genes have evolved to prevent mutations in other genes and play a vital role in defending the organism from cancer .
But why do cells in the upper region of the intestine lose a different type of repair mechanism than those further down ?
Breivik was determined to find an explanation .
After several years of data mining and theoretical modelling , he was able to demonstrate a connection between loss of DNA repair and harmful environmental factors in the intestines .
Curiously however , the cancer cells appeared to have lost the repair mechanisms that would protect them from DNA damage in their particular environment .
Breivik thus proposed the following hypothesis : Although DNA repair is favourable to the organism ; it may not be favourable to the individual cell .
The theory was developed in several science papers , including an invited Commentary in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA , and may be illustrated as the effect of alternative strategies in a car race .
“ Deciding when to stop for repairs and when to keep on going is a difficult challenge .
Making repairs assures an optimized vehicle , but it also consumes valuable time and resources .
At first thought , it may seem obvious that a damaging environment calls for more repair .
Paradoxically , however , the effect may be exactly the opposite .
Imagine that you are racing through a war zone with constant bombardment .
Stopping for repair can then be a fatal strategy , and it is better to keep on going with flat tires and a screaming engine than to stop for repairs , ” says Breivik .
This illustration thus explains why genetically unstable cancer cells are favoured in hostile environments — such as in the lungs of a heavy smoker .
The model may also be described mathematically and has been experimentally confirmed in cell cultures and animal models by leading research groups in the field .
advertisement
“ Cells exposed to particular carcinogens die if they have the relevant repair mechanism , while genetically unstable cancer cells continued to grow , ” Breivik explains .
Evolution within
This research shows how the environment influences the selection of genes inside of the body and is identical to the principle that Darwin found to explain the origin of species .
“ The body is not a static system .
Our cells are in a constant state of development , and new genetic variants arise every day .
Many of these mutants are removed by the immune system but , sooner or later , a cell will break through the defences and develop into a tumour of wild - growing renegades . ”
Cancer development is an evolutionary process within the multicellular organism , but it is also related to the general process of evolution through the generations .
Life begins when our parent ’s genes are united in the zygote .
These genes have been selected through millions of generations for their ability to create a functional organism , but few days after fertilization the genes split up in two different directions .
Some end up in the germ cells ( sperm and ova ) that will bring them to the next generation , while the rest end up in the somatic cells that make up our body .
The somatic cells are initially programmed to cooperate , but as we age and new mutations arise , the evolutionary process will favour cells that break ranks and propagate freely within the body .
Thus , according to Breivik , the division between germ cells and somatic cells represents the Darwinian explanation to cancer ( figure 2 ) .
Time bombs
advertisement
Natural selection favours genes for their ability to replicate in their given environment .
Through the course of evolution , they have thereby developed increasingly more complex mechanism for self - replication , first as single celled organisms and later as cells that cooperate in complex colonies .
“ This is where humans belong .
We are cell colonies developed for propagating our genes from one generation to the next .
As soon as our children can take care of themselves , we are irrelevant to the genes .
Caring grandparents may be good to have , but dozens of enduring ancestors will not increase a gene ’s chance for survival — on the contrary , they may represent a waste of valuable recourses .
The entire human genome is therefore probably developed to give us a limited lifespan , ” says Breivik .
He believes that many of our genes are constructed such that they protect against cancer in the first part of our lives , but that they are programmed for destruction as we get older .
“ We see that DNA repair genes , which protect us from cancer in early life , contain unstable DNA sequences that increase their probability for breakdown as time passes .
These sequences are ticking time bombs in our genome and represent a paradox if we consider what is best for the organism .
If we take the perspective of the genes ’ , on the other hand , the phenomenon is quite logical , ” says Breivik .
He is currently studying the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms that lead to such unstable repair genes .
The next step in evolution
Despite important advances in therapy , all statistics show that the cancer incidence will continue to rise .
“ The better we get at treating cancer , the older we become and the more cancer there will be in the population .
Additionally , better therapy for children and young people implies that more cancer genes are passed on to the next generation .
From what we know about evolutionary dynamics , I believe it ’s impossible to find a therapeutic solution to cancer .
The basic problem is that we are trapped in a body that the genes have made to be disposable .
A solution will therefore be something much more radical than a new drug , ” says Breivik .
He argues that cancer therapy is an attempt to counteract the natural decay of the body .
If we think about it , however , it is not really the body we care about .
After all , most people are more than happy to trade in a defect organ for a new one .
“ It 's the mind , our thoughts and consciousness that we desperately want to preserve .
If we look at technological developments as a whole , that may be exactly what ’s happening .
The ongoing revolution in information and biotechnology may be interpreted as the mind ’s liberation from the genes .
It ’s difficult to imagine the alternative , but if I could see a thousand years into the future , I would be very surprised if earth is still dominated by two - legged creatures with a limited life span , ” says Jarle Breivik
It takes an hour of pedalling to charge a phone completely Two Kenyan students are hoping to market a device that allows bicycle riders to charge their mobile phones .
Jeremiah Murimi , 24 , and Pascal Katana , 22 , said they wanted their dynamo - powered " smart charger " to help people without electricity in rural areas .
" We both come from villages and we know the problems , " Mr Murimi told the BBC .
People have to travel great distances to shops where they are charged $ 2 a time to power their phone , usually from a car battery or solar panel .
" The device is so small you can put it in your pocket with your phone while you are on your bike , " said Mr Murimi .
It is estimated that some 17.5 million people out of Kenya 's 38.5 million population own a mobile handset - up from 200,000 in 2000 .
We took most of [ the ] items from a junk yard

Young Malawian invents wind generator
Although similar devices already exist in other countries , they are not available in Kenya .
The two electrical engineering students from Nairobi University have been working on their own invention , which they are selling for 350 Kenyan shillings ( $ 4.50 ) each , over the last few months during their university break .
In Kenya , bicycles are sold with a dynamo to be attached to the back wheel to power the lights .
The dynamo lead can be switched to plug into the charger instead , they explained .
Mr Katana explained it takes an hour of pedalling to fully charge a phone , about the same time it would if it were plugged into the mains electricity .
The BBC's Ruth Nesoba says after a short ride , the phone 's battery display indicated that it was charging .
Guinea pigs
The cash - strapped students used old bits of electronic equipment for the project .
" We took most of [ the ] items from a junk yard - using bits from spoilt radios and spoilt televisions , " said Mr Katana .
The dynamo is attached to the back wheel Workers with bicycles at the campus were used as guinea pigs , including security guard David Nyangoro .
" I use a bicycle especially when I 'm at home in the rural areas , where we travel a lot , " he said .
" It 's very expensive nowadays charging a phone .
With the new charger I hope it will be more economical , as once you have bought it , things will be easier for you and no more expenses . "
Mr Murimi says so far they have only made two chargers - but are making five more for people who have seen it demonstrated .
" And a non-government organisation in western Kenya wants 15 so they can test them out in rural areas to see how popular they prove , " he said .
The two friends are about to start their fifth and final year at university in September .
" We are not planning to stop our studies , " Mr Murimi said .
Kenya's National Council for Science and Technology has backed the project , and the students hope they will find a way of mass - producing the chargers .

Welcome to the Edmonton Police Service ’s Neighbourhood Crime Mapping Website .
The Edmonton Police Service is committed to innovative and responsive community policing , which is why we have developed this Neighbourhood Crime Mapping Website .
Neighbourhood crime is more than just numbers ; it 's about knowing where reported crime is happening in the area where you live .
Knowing the real picture of neighbourhood crime reported to the Edmonton Police Service is the first step in doing something about it .
You can select a neighbourhood of interest by ' clicking ' on the city map , select a date range , and then select one , some or all of 8 crime type groups to plot on the map .
By accessing this timely and relevant information on reported crime you will be able to know what 's really going on in your neighbourhood .
By knowing what 's really going on , you should be better informed in relation to crime prevention decision - making .
The US Government has started a new crack down on online poker , freezing accounts that handle the winnings of thousands of players .
The Poker Players Alliance says that the US Attorney for the South District of New York instructed three banks to freeze accounts that held $ 30 million .
Internet gambling has always been illegal in the United States , however online poker companies have claimed that the law does n’t apply to poker due to poker being a game of skill , as opposed to other types of gambling .
Copies of the orders , obtained by AP state that banks should treat the frozen accounts “ as legally seized ” by the FBI .
The letters claims that the government has probable cause that the gambling payments of U.S. residents had been directed to offshore illegal Internet gambling businesses , and state that the accounts “ constitute property involved in money laundering transactions and illegal gambling offenses . ”
It ’s not known at this stage which poker sites are affected .
By now , most Americans are familiar with the horrific murder of a Pensacola , Florida , couple by the name of Byrd and Melanie Billings .
They were the parents of 17 children , 13 of whom were adopted  most of whom had disabilities .
This case hits home with me , because they lived in my hometown of Pensacola .
I did not know them personally , but they were fairly well known around town .
Byrd was a well - to - do businessman who owned a used car business and financial loan service .
Byrd and Melanie were shot to death in their own home a week ago Thursday .
So far , eight people have been arrested in the case : seven men and one woman .
The seven men are each charged with two open counts of murder , and the woman is charged with accessory to murder after the fact .
Law enforcement officials said yesterday that at least one more " person of interest " is being sought .
The Billings murder case was broken open by the fact that their home was equipped with a surveillance system , which recorded the vehicle used to transport the murderers to the home and probably much of the criminal activity inside the house , although the sheriff ’s office has not released the video of what was recorded inside the house .
The video of the van led police to the suspects .
Our State Attorney , Bill Eddins , says that all of the perpetrators who actively took part in the shootings are in custody .
At least five of the men were inside the house when the murders took place ; and police said the killers were in and out of the house in four minutes .
Armed Response : A Comp ... David Kenik Best Price : $ 1.23 Buy New $ 6.99 ( as of 11:40 EST - Details )
In a news conference yesterday , Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan and State Attorney Bill Eddins said they have the murder " weapon or weapons . "
They also said that the remaining " person of interest " was supposed to disable the surveillance system but did not do so , which is why the system was still operational when the crimes occurred .
In addition , Morgan and Eddins said the motive was robbery , because a small safe was taken from the house , but that other motives could also apply to the killings .
Federal agencies are also assisting with the Billings murders , including the FBI , BATFE , and DEA .
To my way of thinking , this case smacks of much more than a robbery gone badly .
There were at least eight , and maybe nine , people involved .
Maybe more .
The invasion and killings were perpetrated in less than four minutes , by multiple assailants , and with " military precision . "
The home invasion took place at approximately 7:30 p.m. local time .
And at the time of the shooting , nine of the Billings children were in the home .
I believe murder , not robbery , was the motive .
Extraordinary planning and the number of personnel involved indicate to me that the Billings were executed , and that robbery was an afterthought  or was even intended to be a ruse to mislead law enforcement .
The real reason behind the killings may never be known , of course .
Regardless of the " why " and " how " of the killings , one thing is painfully obvious : a violent attack took place against a man and his wife inside their own home .
And while the circumstances of the Billings case may be sensational , the simple fact that a couple was murdered inside their own home has become rather commonplace throughout the United States .
Nationwide , home invasions are skyrocketing .
The Concealed Handgun ... Chris Bird Best Price : $ 2.00 Buy New $ 6.97 ( as of 12:05 EST - Details )
Home is the one place where most of us feel safe and protected .
Even those who have a keen sense of self - defense feel free to let their guard down at home .
And , sadly , most people do not possess a keen sense of self - defense .
Most people have the deluded opinion that law enforcement will protect them .
But even law enforcement professionals will tell you it is not their job to protect citizens ; it is their job to apprehend and bring those who have committed crimes to justice .
In other words , after you are dead , the cops will try to catch the guys who killed you .
It is time that people wake up to the fact that the responsibility of self - defense rests with each individual citizen .
We are all vulnerable to attack  even in our homes !
For this reason , our federal Constitution and most ( if not all ) State constitutions recognize the Natural Law right of people to keep and bear arms .
Over the past 40 - plus years , however , miscreants in Washington , D.C. , and in our State capitols have been whittling away at the right of the people to keep and bear arms .
Lawful gun dealers are being harangued and harassed out of existence by the BATFE .
Law enforcement agencies and State prosecutors often side with criminals when they are shot in self - defense by intended victims ( especially in the Northeast ) .
The media often characterizes lawful gun owners as " gun nuts " or " militia members " to try to create the impression that they are " dangerous " or " extremist . "
Public education  especially higher education  is often a willing participant in helping to demonize gun owners .
Even Hollywood often uses its influence to sway public opinion against gun owners .
All this , coupled with a natural lazy tendency of urban living , equates to a careless and defenseless society : something both would - be tyrants in government and street criminals love .
Fortunately , America ’s founders were wiser than most of today ’s generation .
They understood the relationship between the citizen ’s right ( and determination ) to keep and bear arms and his or her safety and security .

For example , Thomas Jefferson said , " No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms . "
He also said , " Laws that forbid the carrying of arms . . . disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes . . .
Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants ; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides , for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man . "
Likewise , Thomas Paine said , " [ A ]rms , like laws , discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe , and preserve order in the world as well as property . . .
Horrid mischief would ensue were one - half the world deprived of the use of them ; for while avarice and ambition have a place in the heart of man , the weak will become prey to the strong .
The history of every age and nation establishes these truths , and facts need but little arguments when they prove themselves . "
The Billings double murder is the latest example of just how vulnerable we all are to the violent tendencies of evil people .
For this reason ( and more ) , every American should ( 1 ) resist any and all attempts by government to curtail or restrict our legal right to keep and bear arms , and ( 2 ) purchase , practice with , and always keep our own personal firearms handy .
Furthermore , we should always live in a heightened " state of alert " ( even in our own homes ) , because both our lives and our liberty may depend on it .

The growing adoption of the Linux operating system on netbook devices has compelled Linux distributors to focus on improving startup performance .
Ubuntu 9.04 , which was released last month , is one distribution where these improvements are particularly noticeable .
In a presentation at the Ubuntu Developer Summit in Barcelona , developer Scott James Remnant noted that boot time decreased from 65 seconds in version 8.10 to only 25 seconds in 9.04 .
This is already a substantial improvement , but he believes that there is still room for more aggressive optimization .
Canonical , the company behind Ubuntu , will continue pushing the limits of boot performance during the upcoming development cycle for Ubuntu 9.10 , which is codenamed Karmic Koala .
According to Remnant , the company aims to achieve a ten - second boot time next year for Ubuntu 10.04 , the release that will follow after Karmic .
In a message posted to the Ubuntu developer mailing list , Remnant describes how the additional boot performance improvements will be achieved .
An important part of their speedy startup strategy will be getting the Xorg display server up and running as soon as possible .
This means that a big part of the focus will be cutting down the amount of time that is needed to bring up the components that have to be in place before Xorg can start — the udev device manager and initramfs , a temporary filesystem that is loaded into system memory to facilitate the startup process .
Initramfs is mostly responsible for mounting the root filesystem and loading the requisite kernel modules .
It also plays a role in the logic for software RAID , disk encryption , booting from a network filesystem , and a bunch of other similar tasks .
Remnant wants to slim it down and remove some of the unnecessary " cruft " that is bogging down the startup .
There are established time budgets for individual parts of the boot process .
Those targets will have to be met in order to fulfill the goal of a ten second boot .
Remnant says that loading the kernel and initramfs should take two seconds , driver loading , filesystem mounting , and other " plumbing " should take two seconds , launching Xorg should take two seconds , and the remaining four seconds should be used to launch the desktop environment and other services that are part of the user 's session .
The computer should be fully booted and ready to use at the end of ten seconds , he says .
One of the side effects of starting Xorg sooner , he says , is that the boot splash and associated progress bar will no longer be displayed at all .
That 's a pretty surprising revelation and it should give you an idea of just how substantial the performance improvement will be from a user 's perspective .
" In the default case , there will be no splash screen , " he wrote .
" I hope to demonstrate that X can be started sufficiently fast that we do n't need one . "
The reference hardware for benchmarking is the Dell Mini 9 , a netbook that is available with Ubuntu preinstalled .
Although a single netbook has been selected as the benchmark target for the purpose of consistency , it 's important to note that the ten second goal is for the regular desktop Ubuntu installation .
Remnant expects that they can go even further with hardware - specific versions of Ubuntu that are customized for netbook devices .
" 10 [ seconds ] is a good number , especially for a generic , hardware agnostic , non-stripped down Linux distribution .
From that starting point , development teams will be able to customise and tailor Ubuntu for specific hardware — and the OEM team will be able to produce custom Remixes of Ubuntu that boot even faster , " he wrote .
" I think it likely that we 'll match Moblin's 5 [ second ] benchmark on similar hardware , with a device - tailored Moblin - based remix of Ubuntu . "
This emphasis on boot performance will make Ubuntu a more competitive option for hardware makers who are seeking a fast and lean distribution to preinstall on netbook devices .
It will also improve the Live CD and desktop user experience .
This aspect of system performance will continue to grow in relevance as Linux expands to other kinds of mobile and embedded devices in a multitude of different form factors .

New life - related geology beckons Opportunity rover
BY CRAIG COVAULT
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : July 19 , 2009
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) has found clay - bearing rocks lying directly in the path ahead for the Mars rover Opportunity , giving the rover the unexpected chance to sample a totally new rock type that could have provided a wet , warm , and non acidic habitat for the formation of early life on Mars .
Massive Endeavour crater dwarfs Victoria crater ( top left ) that Opportunity spent two years exploring .

The finding increases stakes for Opportunity to reach the site which scientists at Cornell University now find has the same high priority geologic character as those on the final landing target list for the Mars Science Laboratory ( MSL ) rover " Curiosity " planned for launch in 2011 .
" This discovery by MRO is very important because clays are an indicator of aqueous processes , formed at a neutral acidity level says Steve Squyres , Mars rover principal investigator Cornell University .
" The clays we have found are not only indicative of abundant water , but also a watery environment more suitable for life , " Squyres told Spaceflight Now .
The rover team never thought areas within their reach harbored such potential - but new hope beckons .
MSL 's development , however , is increasingly as perilous on Earth as its mission to Mars will be .
Its funding reserves are increasingly low just as its development team finds additional hardware problems .
Those problems include new assessments that show MSL nuclear power system will fall short of what will be required to keep critical actuators warm and to operate the rover 's Sample Analyses at Mars ( SAM ) instrument as intended .
" Rover nuclear power system design does not meet present mission requirements , requiring additional battery capacity and possibly addition of a solar array , " according to a July 9 review at NASA Headquarters .
The SAM instrument development itself , is also lagging at the Goddard Spaced Flight Center , the report finds .
But in a rare lucky break for the search for evidence of life on another planet , Opportunity will be able to directly sample the newly found phyllosilicate formations , if it can survive for the next 12 - 18 months , the time needed to drive ten more miles to the location .
It will take that long for the rover to drive to Endeavour crater where it has been aimed anyway for the last 9 months .
Endeavour , is nearly 15 mi. in diameter with spectacular rims , already visible on the horizon to Opportunity 's imaging systems .
North Rim of Endeavour crater is imaged by Opportunity still 12 mi. distant when image was taken .
Rover has now closed to within 10 mi. of newly discovered clay rich soil meaning neutral acidity water was present possibly supportive of life .
Credit : NASA / JPL
Both " Oppy " and the rover Spirit , have been operational for more than 5 years on the Red Planet now 170 million mi. from Earth .
Opportunity has already driven 10 miles in the last 5 years , while Spirit has driven about 6 mi. in its more rugged landscape .
Sprit also remains stuck in water altered soils where it became bogged down several weeks ago on the opposite side of Mars .
Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineers are working with an engineering duplicate of the rover they have placed in specialized soil mix for driving tests on how to free it .
One promising mode is a crab maneuver where all six wheels are pointed toward the left or right side to drive out of the trap sideways .
" Within days of landing on Mars , Opportunity discovered evidence for a past aqueous environment .
But this environment was characterized by high acidity and low water activity both significant challenges for astrobiology , " says James Wray , at Cornell who led the assessment of what the Reconnaissance Orbiter findings could mean for Opportunity .
" We analyzed images of Endeavour from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars ( CRISM ) on MRO .
Spectra of portions of the crater rim contain absorption bands diagnostic of phyllosilicates , " says Wray .
" Images of the clay - bearing surfaces from the MRO High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRISE ) reveal layering and a range of polygonal textures similar to those observed in phyllosilicate - bearing rocks elsewhere on Mars .
These textures are seen virtually everywhere bedrock is exposed on the Endeavour crater rim , suggesting the bedrock is pervasively altered , " he says .
Neither Opportunity nor Spirit has been able to sample such clay - rich rocks indicative of early Martian geology when the planet was warmer and wetter and potentially more habitable to organisms beginning to thrive on Earth at the same time after the planets ' formation .
It had been thought such terrain had to be left for MSL to explore .

Opportunity 's landing site was selected for the hematite rich plane discovered by the Mars Odyssey thermal emission spectrometer instrument .
The MRO imagery also provides conclusive evidence that Endeavour crater was blasted out by a meteorite billions of years before Meridiani plane filled with more acidic water .
By then the planet was much colder and less hospitable to life .
Although wind blown deposits have buried part of Meridini , its original crater rims and part of its older floor remained exposed above the level where the hematite plane flooded or blew in around it eons later .
" Investigation by the rover could illuminate outstanding questions regarding how these phyllosilicates formed , potentially shedding light on regional or global - scale processes of aqueous alteration predating the acidic conditions that produced the sulfate - rich rocks Opportunity has studied to date , " says Wray .
" If Opportunity reaches it with its Cornell / Athena instrument payload still largely functional , the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer and the Mossbauer spectrometer could each independently confirm the presence of clays , possibly determine their hydration and iron oxidation states , and identify associated minerals .
The Alpha Particle X - Ray Spectrometer could reveal major and minor element chemistry , while the Pancam and Microscopic Imager could document possible sedimentary textures , grain sizes and shapes to constrain the processes that emplaced these phyllosilicate - bearing rocks , " says Wray .
Although it may remain largely unspoken outside the halls of the rover control center at JPL in Pasadena , if Opportunity reaches such clays , the team will also be looking in the rock formations for tiny fossils �life on Mars - that may have formed in previously warmer , wetter conditions that now beckon for rover exploration 10 mi. ahead .
Job losses accelerated more quickly than expected last month and the unemployment rate rose to 9.5 % , casting doubt on prospects for the U.S. economy to soon rebound .
U.S. employment fell by a seasonally adjusted 467,000 jobs in June , after declining by 322,000 the month before , the Labor Department said Thursday .
The report is at odds with such signs of recent economic improvement as growing home sales and increased business investment .
" I think we 're past the period of free fall in the economy but it would be premature to say that we 've reached the bottom , or might , within the next couple of months , " said Jeffrey Frankel , an economics professor at Harvard University .
" I 'm expecting the recovery to be a slow one . "
The quickening pace of job losses fed a growing concern within financial markets that a recovery may be further off than previously thought .
Investors fled stocks and commodities Thursday for the relative safety of U.S. Treasurys and the dollar .
The unemployment data helped set a negative tone on the eve of earnings season .
Analysts began cautioning that stocks may still be priced too high relative to earnings , despite the 5.9 % pullback of the past three weeks .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 223.32 points Thursday , or 2.6 % , to 8280.74 , the biggest decline ahead of a July 4 holiday in more than 50 years .
Oil slumped 3.7 % .

The News Provenance Project has been exploring how news organizations might contribute to the fight against misinformation by adding …
The racist policies of the Greek government were stepped up last weekend with the violent evacuation and torching of the large Afghan immigrant settlement in Patras , shooting of immigrants in Omoinoia square and institutionalised torture of Pakistanis in the island of Simi .
The Greek state 's response to the December Uprising and the politicisation of immigrants across the country has solidified in a programme of what critics are describing as " nazification " that includes open endorsement of neo - nazi vigilante combat groups , a series of the most repressive laws seen since the junta , and open attack against both the social antagonistic movement and immigrants across the country .
On early Saturday 11/7 morning armed Nazis riding a car drove by the heavily policed Omonoia square in down town Athens and opened fire on bystander immigrants near the offices of the Golden Dawn neo -nazi party .
Three wounded immigrants were taken to hospital and are out of danger .
Later the same night fascists set fire on Palio Efetio , the Old Appeal Court opposite their offices which is being squatted by immigrants and is being vilified by the bourgeois press .
The same day , the Pakistani Community denounced yet another incident of institutionalised stripping and torture committed by the fascist greek police in the island of Simi .
For 8 hours Wassim Sanjat , Mazhjar Ali and Mohamet Ali were tortured : cops tortured Wassim by " placing a gun on his head , beating him with a glob and iron stick on the soles of his feet ( a torture loved by the junta called phallanga ) and on his bottom and stripping him again and again .
The other two persons were severely beaten .
The Pakistani Community demands the immediate punishment of the torturers - policemen .
In the early hours of Sunday 12/7 strong riot police forces surrounded the big Afghan immigrant settlement in Patras , cordoning off the area .
The riot policemen then moved to evacuate the thousands of asylum seekers using maximum force , while bulldozers moved in to demolish their houses .
During the evacuation operations , the settlement was ' mysteriously ' set on fire , and torched to the ground .
The settlement is believed to have been housing more than 2,000 Afghans and has been repeatedly targeted by fascists receiving the solidarity of a wide spectrum of progressive social forces in the city of Patras .
The Red Cross has condemned the evacuation and torching of the settlement as ' terrorist ' .
The Communist Party ( KKE ) has condemned the attack as barbaric and the Coalition of Radical Left as ' beastial ' and ' criminal ' .
The evacuated immigrants are held in concentration centers of zero hygienic facilities , host to continuing greek police torture and brutality .
These racist policies of the Greek state , which is endorsing parastate groups to ' clean and patrol ' areas , comes in a climate of acute social antagonistic upheaval .
Besides the continuing resistance locals of Grammaticos villages who rose against the construction of an open refuse dump in their area , erecting barricades and clashing with the police , last week saw a series of dynamic antifascist antiracist protest marches against State - nazi attacks against immigrants .
At the same time , on the early hours of Saturday the house of the ex-Minister of Public Order ( active during the December Uprising and Alexis Grigoropoulos assassination by the police ) and ex-chief of the Greek Army , General Hinophotis , was bombed with a strong explosive device after prior warning call to the press .
A few hours later earlier yet another armed attack against riot police forces occurred near the HQ of PASOK with no victims
On the early morning Sunday , following the surge of State - fascist attacks the HQ camp of the riot police ( MAT ) in Athens came under attack by protesters which piled the riot policemen with stones leading to a half hour battle .
Summer comes and all of the old fears and myths about sharks reappear as we hit the beaches .
Shark attacks , thankfully , are very rare .
What humans ought to be fearful about is the survival of an essential species .
Humans kill 73 million sharks every year , nearly all for consumption , mainly in shark fin soup .
The fins are cut off and the bodies dumped overboard , a barbaric practice known as finning .
Commercial fishermen are taking more and more sharks for their meat as well .
Nearly a third of shark species in the open oceans are threatened with extinction .
Losing these top predators creates a cascading imbalance .
The species whose numbers the sharks once controlled begin to explode ; they then wipe out smaller fish , some of which humans depend on for food .
Water quality suffers .
Healthy oceans require sharks , and without healthy oceans , healthy fisheries are impossible .
Though the appetite for shark fin soup is greatest in Asia , the carnage is global .
There are no international limits on the numbers of sharks that may be taken .
At a recent meeting in Spain , regional fishing organizations agreed to begin collecting data and considering measures to conserve sharks .
That is barely a beginning .
What is needed is a global agreement to establish serious catch limits and end finning .
The task is to scramble into the searing heat and swirling dust of Afghanistan on a few minutes ' notice and fly into combat zones , manoeuvring through some of the most difficult flying conditions in the world .
Some missions will involve trading fire with the Taliban on the ground , others will mean landing in the middle of a battle .
This will happen day after day , month after month .
This is the reality for British helicopter pilots in Afghanistan , amid accusations and recriminations at home over shortages of aircraft .
For the men doing the flying – and for those they ferry – the focus is on survival with what they have got , rather than what may materialise from the promises of politicians .

Yesterday , pilots and infantrymen trained on Salisbury Plain ahead of 11 Light Brigade 's deployment to Helmand in September , under Brigadier James Cowan , the former commander of the Black Watch .
Wing Commander Simon Paterson and Captain David – who did not wish to give his surname – were among the pilots training .
They have toured Afghanistan before and learnt of the dangers in the conflict , which has cost 188 British lives to date .
The latest fatality named was 28 - year - old Captain Daniel Shepherd , an explosives specialist , killed while attempting to defuse a roadside bomb of the type which has taken such a terrible toll among British troops .
A soldier from 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards , attached to the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards , was killed yesterday morning by an explosion while on a dismounted patrol in Nad e Ali District .
A lack of helicopters , senior officers say , makes the soldiers dependant on road movement and so more vulnerable to lethal blasts .
Wing Cdr Paterson , a Chinook pilot , and Capt David , who flies Apaches , are returning to the war .
Wing Cdr Paterson , 36 , Officer Commanding 28 Squadron , RAF , also served in Iraq .
He will be taking in a squadron of Merlins , some of the much - needed additions to the helicopter fleet due to arrive at the end of the year .
" Flying in Afghanistan poses more dangers than we faced in Iraq , we have to cope with a lot more ground - to - air fire , something we did not have to really cope with in Iraq after the initial phase , " he said .
" We have problems because of the altitude and the dust which is very fine , almost like talcum powder , which makes visibility quite difficult .
Of course , it also takes its toll on the aircraft .
But we do feel a tremendous sense of responsibility to the guys on the ground .
We need to evacuate the injured , ensure that the supplies get through .
We do not take unnecessary risks – we will not fly in the mail in the middle of a battle for instance , but essential jobs must be done and the transport helicopters get invaluable help from the Apaches . "
The Taliban have learnt to fear the Apaches , with their devastating firepower , and melt away at the sight of the aircraft .
" They are right to be nervous , " said Capt David , of 3 Regiment Army Air Corps .
" Our role is not just to fight but act as a deterrent as well and if that works , that 's fine .

" I am not in a position to talk about the numbers of helicopters , all I can say is that we are working very , very hard and this is going on 24/ 7 .
We are on a very short notice to move , you could be just sitting around with a cup of tea and then 15 minutes later you are flying .
Obviously it does get very tense and you are on edge , but it is a question of learning to cope .
" It is dangerous , we have to climb high enough to get beyond the Taliban small arms fire , but we have pretty good defences and we have adapted our flying to be as safe as possible .
At the end of the day it is a very good feeling to know that you help bring some casualties out because these guys are going through a hell of a lot out there .
They need all the help and support that they get . "
The 11 Light Brigade will specialise in counter - insurgency and Brigadier Cowan 's plan has been approved by the Army 's high command .
His soldiers are preparing for the campaign against a backdrop of almost daily news of bomb fatalities , and approach the mission with trepidation and hope .
Corporal Rob Whiffin , of 3rd Battalion , The Rifles , said : " People are nervous .
There is anxiety about what is happening .
But this is what we do and we are looking forward to going .
The main thing is to do our job well and come back alive . "
Sergeant Gareth Gardner , pictured left , of the same regiment , said : " Anyone who says they are not nervous is lying .
But we have trained very hard and that will be hugely helpful ...
I have been in the Army 11 years and we have seen a lot of improvement in kit in that time , that is something we should bear in mind . "
Lance Corporal Liam Jones , also of 3rd Battalion , The Rifles , said : " The feeling is that this tour ... is going to be particularly difficult .
But that is n't surprising .
There is nothing we can do about it except put everything we have learnt into good practice . "
Major Mark Melhorn , 30 , fire support group commander , said : " I hope all my boys come back .
But I 'm a realist .
The boys are nervous , they'd be crazy not to be , but they 're still desperate to get out there . "
The man taking them all , Brigadier Cowan , said : " One can always do with more helicopters , but one needs to cope with the reality on the ground ...
As far as more troops are concerned , it is up to the ministers to decide , I 'll make do with what I am given , I am a practical man . "
He will lead Britain 's new strategy in Afghanistan , which aims to dovetail with the plans of General Stanley McChrystal , the new US commander of Nato forces there .
The strategy emphasises winning over the public , hastening reconstruction and adopting new measures to avoid civilian casualties .
" In conventional warfare the aim is to defeat the enemy , " said Brigadier Cowan .
" In counter - insurgency it is winning over the people .
That is what we will be doing . "

About Dopefish
What is Dopefish ?
Dopefish was one of the characters that appeared in Commander Keen , Episode IV back in 1991 .
That 's it .
All the rest of this " Dopefish mania " came later .
You can read about it here at dopefish.com , the definitive source of info on everyone 's favourite fish !
Dopefish is the product of the fertile mind of Tom Hall .
It was one of 24 drawings he did of ideas for characters for Commander Keen : Goodbye , Galaxy !
while part of id Software .
Dopefish was one of the characters from these drawings that made the cut .
According to Tom , " I just drew this stupid little fish , " and the rest is history .
Want to see Tom 's original sketches for Dopefish he did in late 1990 ?
Click Here !
It was pointed out to me recently that the Dopefish can predict the future .
How ?
Well , the original Dopefish sketch referenced above was drawn back in 1990 .
Dopefish theologists point out that when the Dopefish was called into being by Tom , it made Tom have a foreshadowing of a future id release , Quake .
You want proof ?
Look at this cutout from the picture .
See the Quake logo there ?
Makes you think , does n't it ?
Especially when Tom was no longer with id Software when they began work on Quake .
Dopefish is described in the cast of characters for Secret of the Oracle as the second dumbest creature inthe universe .
His thought patterns go , " swim swim hungry , swim swim hungry . "
Dopefish " will eat anything alive and moving near them , though they prefer heroes . "
( What 's the most dumbest creature in the universe ?
Why , of course , the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal .
It 's so stupid that it thinks if you can't see it , it ca n't see you .
One way to avoid the BugBlatter Beast is to throw a towel over your head . )
Dopefish was " adopted " by the Tech Support staff at Apogee soon after I came on board .
Then Steve Quarrella came onboard and it balooned from there .
Dopefish was my favorite character , and Steve was the resident Keen expert -- Lee provided a few vocal effects and some art .
We got hold of some screen capture software and went to town .
Dopefish reproduction ?!?
One thing that 's never really been covered before is how Dopefish reproduce .
I got a letter from a guy who did not include his name , but did give me the nickname " Altruismisdead " .
In it he asks this ( food for thought ) ..
I was curious as to how the dope fish mates ?
With its thought patterns just being " swim swim hungry , swim swim hungry " it seems like it does n't have any time for procreation .
And if it does ever mate , how come we have never seen a " female " Dopefish ?
I have devised a sketch composite of what I believe may be a female Dopefish .
Please correct me if I am wrong .
Well , Altruis has some interesting theories , but this female Dopefish looks like she 's going through PMS or something .
Dopefish in Games
To date , Dopefish has been involved in three Apogee games : Commander Keen : Goodbye , Galaxy ! ( as a character ) , Wacky Wheels ( making a secret cameo appearance - See picture below ) , and Rise of the Triad ( as a command line parameter and a secret message ) .
Beyond the appearance of Dopefish in Commander Keen , most everything else Dopefish has appeared in has been a cameo .
As I loved Dopefish , when I started working at Apogee , I was always talking about sticking Dopefish in our other games as a gag .
As time has gone on and folks who used to work here , and folks who are friends of mine have gone on to other companies , the " joke " of using Dopefish as a gag cameo character has lived on .
This section details appearances of the Dopefish in known games and addons .
Some are user created , some are actual industry creations .
Commander Keen
This one does n't require much explanation , as it's the only " legitimate character use " of Dopefish .
If you play Keen 4 , you 'll find this one . :)
Basically , just play the game , and get to the level " The Well of Wishes " .
Keen will be underwater , and his job is to avoid several Dopefi in that level , and make it to the end .
That 's pretty much it .
Dopefish really does n't do anything in the game other than swim , and try and eat you .
But the Burping RULES ! :)
Dopefish could be hard though as this quote by Keen fan Averos goes in a story about Keen on Slashdot in 1993 .. " God , I hated that Dopefish .
Probably the single most terrible creature in the Commander Keen universe , bar none .
Not even the Vorticons had anything on this green aquatic moron .
My very dreams were haunted by that fish as I paddled in vain to keep ahead of that buck - toothed mouth .
I lost more lives on that damn overgrown fscking tuna than anywhere else in the game .
* Shudder * . "
Wacky Fish ?
Back when we were working on Wacky Wheels , I was talking with Andy Edwardson about Dopefish , and he thought it was a funny gag .
So he programmed in a cameo for Dopefish in Wacky Wheels .
It 's pretty obscure , and neither of us could figure out why anyone would find this legitimately , but here 's how to get Dopefish in Wacky Wheels .
When a race starts , you need to hold down the brake , and spin your animal in a circle to the right two complete turns ( keep spinning and braking ) .
The Dopefish will then appear .
Do n't let your animal disappear off the screen , or the gag wo n't work right .
Someone ( We have no idea who did this ) took the time to capture a whole lot of frames from Dopefish 's appearance in Wacky Wheels , and turn them into an animated GIF file .
If you 'd like to see that , click here .
( The image is about 690 k , it can take a long time on a slow modem ) .
ROTT Fish ?
In addition to what 's mentioned in the last paragraph for ROTT , the first level in the rejected ROTT level set is called " Use the Fish . "
If you load this level up , use the map cheat , and look at the map , you 'll see that the entire level is essentially the Dopefish -- you 're playing inside .
The title " Use the Fish " comes from the fax that Jay Wilbur ( then of id Software ) sent Apogee when he granted us permission to use the Dopefish as a cameo character .
If you want to see a picture of what Dopefish looked like in Ted , ( Apogee 's ROTT Level editor ) as designed by Joe Selinske , click here .
In the registered version of Rise of the Triad , there was a level I did called Eight Ways to Hell .
In it a little over halfway through the level , are a group of walls in a hidden area that are shaped very strangely .
When you 're playing the game , you wo n't notice it , but if you look at this section of the game in the automap , the walls are shown to be in Galactic Alphabet , which is an alphabet that Tom Hall had created for the Commander Keen games .
These walls spell out the message " Dopefish Lives " .
There is a screen capture of this section of the map below this paragraph , should you care to translate it for yourself . :)
( You can see this image below ) Yet another incarnation of the Dopefish in ROTT is only in version 1.3 of the game -- when you complete it , there 's a picture of a bucked tooth version of my character ( Heinrich Krist - teeth compliments of artist Stephen Hornback ) with a Dopefish pillow ( again , made by Lee Jackson 's wife Brenda ) in my lap .
Also , in Feburary of 1998 , I released what is probably the final patch of any kind for Rise of the Triad , the long - awaited " ROTT Dopefish " patch .
What this patch does is add Chuck Jones ' rendered Dopefish into v1.3 of Rise of the Triad .
If you 'd like to download this , click here .
Please note that this is not an official Apogee patch , it 's released strictly as a gag by myself ; do n't ask Apogee about this .
In addition , I 've had several messages from people asking me about this possible Dopefish cameo in Rise of the Triad .
A user writes ..
" When you 're playing a Multi - player game in ROTT , you can see your mugshot up in one of the corners , which is next to your score .
If you kill yourself , say by standing next to and facing a wall and firing an explosive weapon , you die ( duh ) , but in addition to dying , your mugshot gets bucktoothed .
If you still are n't sure what I 'm referring to , just go into a multiplayer game , kill yourself and look around .
So , is this a dopefish reference ? " .
The answer is no , it is not .
I asked Tom Hall about this , and this is what he said ..
" That is not an intentional dopefish reference , but made by Dopefish 's dad , so I guess you can see my themes recurring ... or my material running dry .
;^)
One of the five [ ROTT characters ] goes bucktoothed when their kills go negative . "
Duke Fish ?
One planned cameo appearance of Dopefish that will not come to the light of day was one planned for Duke Nukem 3D ( more precisely it was ordered removed by George Broussard ) .
Early in development , there was a shark as a character in Duke3D that would appear when Duke was underwater .
What was to happen was that when you 'd start the game with a DOPEFISH command line parameter , the sharks were to be replaced with Dopefish .
However , the sharks got cut from the game , and alas , the Dopefish appearance in Duke Nukem 3D went with it .
( At the last second before the game was released , the sharks were reinstated to the game , but Dopefish was not . )
However , the work done for this does survive .
Later on this page , Dopefish music is talked about , and a song written for Dopefish 's appearance is downloadable from there .
Also , Chuck Jones , the 3D modeler for Duke Nukem 3D created an animaton file for Duke , and if you want to see what Dopefish would have looked like in Duke3D , you can download this file .
Also , around the same time , Chuck created a much larger FLI file of his first attempt at a 3D rendered Dopefish just spinning in place .
If you want that , you can download this file .
The released version of Duke Nukem 3D did have one single Dopefish reference , that being this picture you see to your left .
It 's a hidden message deep in Level 5 ( The Abyss ) of the shareware episode of Duke Nukem 3D .
In June of 1996 , Dopefish has been put pack into Duke 3D !
Well , not by 3D Realms , but someone by the name of Roland made a file that you can use in the registered version of Duke3D that will turn the drones ( the flying things ) into Dopefish !
It 's pretty funny !

Shadow Warrior Fish ?
No , Dopefish did n't make an appearance in 3D Realms ' Shadow Warrior game , but there is a connection !
During the production of the game , the hero of Shadow Warrior ( Lo Wang ) was interviewed , and in the interview he was asked about Dopefish .
Here is what Lo Wang had to say about Dopefish : [ 34 k .wav file ]
Quake fish ?
Dopefish cameos in games has come full circle ( sort of ) .
With id Software 's 1996 release of Quake , Dopefish makes yet another appearance !
Dopefish appears in the registered version of Quake .
There is a " hint " of Dopefish 's appearance in the shareware episode , however .
If you take the path that leads to the Nightmare difficulty level selection , and shoot the square on the wall at the end of the stairwell , you 'll get a cryptic message that says " The Well of Wishes awaits in the Crypt of Decay " .
In the Crypt of Decay ( Episode 2 Level 3 of Quake ) , towards the end of the level you 'll come across a pathway that has lots of nails being shot out a few directions .
That hallways leads to a big open area ( see picture to right ) .
If you go into the corridor that is shown in the picture to the right , and turn around , you will see a very thin walkway that leads to the area marked " In Here " in the picture .
If you follow this pathway and jump into the " In Here " archway , you 'll be led to the Dopefish ( see other picture below ) .
In the summer of 1998 , I was alerted to the existance of a Dopefish trading card .
It 's actually part of a set of Quake based trading cards , of which Dopefish has a card .
I 've never physically seen these cards ( has anyone ? ) , and I do n't know if they 're an official id Software product or not , but if you want to check 'em out , go here .
The Death of the Dopefish in Quake II ?
I think not , although someone over at id Software might think so . :)
Remember what id did to Commander Keen in Doom ( had several dead Keens hanging dead in a secret room in Level 32 ) ?
Well , they 're at it again .
In Quake II , Dopefish makes an " appearance " .
In the " Cooling Facility " level of Quake II , Dopefish is in there .
But , in similar form to Keen 's apperance in Doom , Dopefish appears to be dead .
Is Dopefish really dead ?
You can judge for yourself by finding him in this level .
After you the reactor is destroyed , come back to this level before going to the Big Gun .
Go all the way to the outdoor pools near the end .
In one of the pools a new door has opened leading to a new area with a large post , which of course has a crack in it .
Meet our weird friend inside .
If you have Quake II , you can download this save game file to make it more easy on yourself to see it . :)
( I 've been sent an additional save game that works with Quake II v3.20 )
Also in January of 1998 , some proof turned up that Dopefish did not die in Quake II .
Want to see the proof ?
Click here ( picture by Carsten Witte ) Thanks to Brandon Fish ( no relation to Dope ) for the pictures of Dopefish in Quake II , as well as the description for how to find him .
Slightly more detailed info on this is available here .
Quake Fish Again ?
I 've gotten numerous emails about the " appearance " of Dopefish in Quake III .
Personally , I do not believe that it is a Dopefish .
I'm of the thinking that just because a fish is green , it does n't automatically mean it 's supposed to be Dopefish .
Two inquiries to id Software about this were not replied to .
Until I hear otherwise , I do n't personally believe that it 's Dopefish in Quake III .
It could be , but my gut feeling says it 's not .
If I 'm proven wrong otherwise by id Software , I 'll change this .
Update 6/22/00 : I got an email from John Romero telling me that he had spoken with id Software , and they intend it to be a Dopefish .
Quite frankly , I 'm disappointed by that .
The thing does n't even look like Dopefish , the features are n't the same at all - if there 's going to be a Dopefish cameo in a game , it should at least look like the thing !
Jazz Fish ?
In late spring of 1998 Epic released Jazz Jackrabbit 2 .
There is a Dopefish reference in Jazz Jackrabbit II by Epic Megagames .
At some point in the game , you will see the message " Spaz ate the Dopefish " .
If you click on the thumbnail to your right here , you will see the message .
Here 's how to get it in the game ( thanks to Nicholas Killewald for the details ) :
Work your way to " A Diamondus Forever " as either character , any difficulty .
From the start of the level , work your way to the point where there are blocks with the blue bouncy bullet symbol on them ( Two spheres together , you 'll know it if you play the game ) .
Keep going through that path , through a couple springs , to the tall tree .
Shoot it and walk over it .
Next , you should see two blocks with stars on 'em , tucked up at the top of a passage .
Shoot 'em and get up there .
See the passage directly below ?
There 's a fall - through - the - floor to it .
Go to the springs on the right .
Make sure you hold left when you spring after you go through the ceiling , else you 'll shoot past the crate you need to smash .
Might take you a couple tries .
Smash the metal crate .
Now , hit the blue spring below you and shoot up through the small log above you .
( Translation : hit the spring and shoot straight up )
Those three green - and - blue blocks you see will lead you up to another platform .
Go to the left , kill a turtle , and find the sign .
It 's actually easier than it sounds .
Just remember to take the high road .
There 's actually a " sort of " Dopefish appearance in Jazz Jackrabbit 2 .
If you start the game in easy mode , you see this picture .
It 's not quite Dopefish , but it kinda looks like 'em . :)
Descent Fish ?
In June of 1999 , we were told of an appearance of Dopefish in Descent 3 .
Before the game was released , the folks who made the game were running a " contest " where you could send in a picture and a character name , and they 'd put it in there as a default character in the game .
Well , the guy above who did the Dopefish Halloween costume above sent in the picture of himself in the halloween garb , and the Descent folks put it in the game !
Here 's some details from mscooper about how to get Dopefish in the game : " Make a pilot called " Dopefish " and you can choose a pilot picture , which automatically comes up as me in my dopefish Halloween getup . "
Battle Fish ?
In 1999 , we were informed by Robert E. Wareing about an appearance of Dopefish in the game Battlezone .
Well , it 's " The Red Odyssey " add - on for Battlezone .
Click on the small thumbnail to your left and you 'll see what shows up in the game . :)
Robert tells us how to get it ...
You type DOPEFISH in at any success screen in Red Odyssey , and a little picture of him pops up with a small bio of his history .
There 's also a Duke Nukem reference in the game , too .
At the end of The Red Odyssey , they decide to Nuke the emeny , so this big ass Nuke comes screaming across the landscape , slowing rotating as it hurls towards impact - and on it 's side it 's name is painted as Duke .
Get it ?
We nuke'd 'em with a nuke named Duke " .
Dopefish in Kingpin ?
I had a skin screenshot submitted to me by someone from the game Kingpin .
Unfortunately , I do n't have any info on how to download this or how to make it appear in the game .
If you do , please let me know .
If you want to see what it looks like , you can click here for a shot .
Dopefish in Daikatana !
Once again , I 've gotten some cool stuff from John Romero about an appearance of Dopefish in one of his games .
A couple of years ago , he was cool enough to send me some info about Dopefish in Quake .
Recently , his long awaited Daikatana was released - and John sent over some screenshots and detailed information on how to get to all of them .
OK Joe , here 's your Dopefish info :
The Dopefish is hidden in four places in Daikatana , one location per episode .
Here 's the list of places : E1 : In the Sewer System , part 2 , there 's a secret area that contains the Shotcycler - 6 and a bunch of Sludge Minions .
In the screenshot ( dopefish_e1_1.jpg ) you can see one of the four corner lights in the room .
Shoot each one until they descend into the floor .
When all four have been shot , you 'll hear a strange sound and at the bottom of the pool in the center of the room , a grating will slide open and reveal the first Dopefish 's lair ( dopefish_e1_2.jpg ) .
E2 : In the Acropolis , part 1 , the first major structure that you enter will have a huge water fountain in it ( dopefish_e2_1.jpg ) .
Jump into the water in the fountain , find the open spot and swim into it .
You have to break the wall under here ( dopefish_e2_2.jpg ) to gain access to the second Dopefish 's lair ( dopefish_e2_3.jpg ) .
E3 : In the Plague Village , part 1 , near the very end of the level is a final bridge that you must cross ( dopefish_e3_1.jpg ) .
Under this bridge is a boarded - up well ( dopefish_e3_2.jpg ) -- break off the wood and swim down into the well , moving around the protruding rocks the whole way until you find the third Dopefish 's lair ( dopefish_e3_3.jpg ) .
E4 : In the Tower of Crime , part 2 , there 's an elevator shaft that has a little secret under the water at the bottom .
You need to climb the ladder in the shaft and go all the way down to the floor where your feet will be barely covered in water and you cannot duck under it to see where the secret is located ... you must simply shoot at the ground until it breaks out from under you ( dopefish_e4_1.jpg ) .
When you go down into the new opening , you 'll find a Vitality powerup ( dopefish_e4_2.jpg ) .
To the right of the Vitality is a wall that is breakable and behind that wall is the fourth and final Dopefish 's lair ( dopefish_e4_3.jpg ) .
In each Dopefish 's lair there 's a Manaskull invulnerability artifact -- it will allow you to either look at the Dopefish for a while , or allow you to try to completely destroy the Dopefish , which takes a LOT or work to do .
A special thanks goes out to John Romero for getting this information together and over to me . :)
Anachronofish ! - Well , as Tom Hall 's Anachonox is about to hit the shelves , speculation has run rampant that Dopefish would make an appearance in the game .
I can now announce that not only is there a Dopefish - there are three baby Dopefish in the game as cameo characters .
Yours truly has done the voice for the Dopefish again . :)
After Anachronox was released , Tom sent me some info on the various appearances of Dopefish in Anachronox .
Here 's the info he sent me :
Here you go !
1 . In Rho 's lab , in a tank to the side .
( MAP LABBUILDING )
2 . In Moon Burger on Hephaestus , occasionally jumping out of the ball pit .
( MAP MBURGER )
3 . In the Krapton Ship , in a tank in the room with the Orange Roughy monsters .
( MAP KRAPTONMAZE )
Tom also sent along several screen shots of Dopefish 's appearances in the game .
Here they are - you can click on any of them to have a larger version open up in another window :
Krapton Maze 1
Krapton Maze 2
Lab Building 1
Lab Building 2
Lab Building 3
Lab Building 4 Moon Burger 1 Moon Burger 2 Moon Burger 3
Special thanks to Tom Hall for sending me over this information on Anachronox .
Keen & Dopefish return ! -
Sort of .
In 2001 , id licensed someone else ( David Palmer productions ) to make a new Keen game for the Gameboy Color .
Tom Hall was n't involved , so my personal expectations were pretty low for the game .
I played the game a little bit , but quite frankly , it 's crap .
That 's not surprising , since Tom was n't involved .
Plus it 's insaneo hard .
Even if I liked it for Tom not being involved , it 's almost unplayable .
Dopefish does make a cameo in the game .
He 's not a full fledged character as such , just kind of the level of usage he had in Keen 4 .
First , some dopefish art is on a wall in the game .
Check out the screen captures here from the Gameboy Color Keen game for shots of the Dopefish appearances .
Later on in the game , the Dopefish does make an appearance as a game character .
He 's jumping in and out of the water , and you have to jump over him to progress in the level .
You do n't actually get eaten , but if you 're touched by the Dopefish , you will die .
Max Dopefish -
The plan to get Dopefish into as many games as possible continues with the apperance of Dopefish in Max Payne .
It started about 5 weeks before the game went gold - I was contacted by Petri of Remedy asking if any " hi res art existed for Dopefish " .
I chuckled , and said no , of course it did n't - the only art was the 10 year old EGA art , as well as anything you might see on dopefish.com .
He ended up whipping up some art on his own , and that art has been on dopefish.com ever since - although no one has said anything about it during the time it was here and Max Payne was not out .
If you want to see that art , click here .
Anyway , check out this screen capture above from Max Payne - you can click on the thumbnail for a larger version .
The hidden room happens in Chapter 1 Level 7 .
It 's the one where you 're chasing Gognitti over the rooftops .
When you get to the point where Gognitti tries to go through a door , and it 's locked , there 's an area where you can go into battle at the bottom of the stairs .
Do n't go down there , turn around , and head back towards the basketball court .
From there you can jump down to this secret area ( behind a fence ) .
However , if you 're too lazy to do the work yourself , you can download this save game and use it . :)
In Jan of 2004 , we were sent this file from Jeff Stein .
It 's an update of the Dopefish art in Max Payne , Jeff wanted to share , so here it is . :)
Hyperspace Delivery Fish -
The spread of Dopefish cameos to more games continues unabated into 2002 .
Late in December of 2001 , Tom Hall & John Romero's new company , Monkeystone Games released their first game , " Hyperspace Delivery Boy " .
In this game , another Dopefish cameo makes it 's appearance - see the graphic to your right .
As I do n't have a Pocket PC ( which is what this game is available for ) , I can't tell you first hand how to see this , but I did ask Tom Hall how to get to the Dopefish in Hyperspace Delivery Boy , and he told me ... "
You must collect at least 21 Monkeystones to get access to that area . "
Hope that 's useful information for those of you who have the game !
Later in 2002 , a version of this game was released for the PC as well , and yours truly provided a voice for the " Worker Siegler " character saying " It is the Dopefish - behold ! " :)
Wolfenstein Fish -
In September of 2002 , I was sent a screenshot which the sender ( whose name and email I have since lost ) says is from the recent game " Return to Castle Wolfenstein " .
It shows a stairwell which has " Dopefish " in grating at the top .
The Dopefish itself does n't appear there , but these words do .
Can someone get back to me with info on how to find this in the game ?
Thanks .
I was also told that this was part of a user map , and not actually part of the main game - I can't confirm that .
I also have a file that you can use if you have the registered 6 episode version of the original Wolfenstein 3D .
This modification comes from Steven Pappas , and it changes Episode 1 Level 10 ( the secret level ) to be " The Well of Wishes " .
Some of the characters are replaced with a Dopefish ( which appears to be a boss character transplant , as it's rather lethal ) .
You can download the file here - unpack to your registered Wolf3D directory and enjoy .
You can also check out a screen capture of this modification on this page , and a few others here , here , here , & here .
Hitman 2 Fish - During my layoff of 2003 , I was notified ( by several people ) that a Dopefish appearance happened in Hitman 2 .
In the level " Jacuzzi Job " , Dopefish appears as a fish bobbing up and down ( kinda like a bobblehead ) on a desk in a room where your target is .
I was sent many shots of this appearance .
Other than the one shown here , you can click on a few more for various looks of the Hitman 2 Dopefish appearance .
[ Link | Link | Link | Link | Link | Link | Link ]
N - Fish - Shortly before Tom Hall & John Romero moved to San Diego in 2003 to go work for Midway , they released the game Red Faction on the N - Gage through their company Monkeystone that has Dopefish in it .
John showed it to me while they were working on it , and he told me he was going to get some screenshots of it , and some info on how to find the Dopefish in the game .
Once I get that info from Romero , I 'll post it here .
Dopefish Music
Dopefish music has been ongoing for a few years now .
The original music was done by Bobby Prince sometime in 1990 , and is called " Eat Your Veggies " .
As Bobby tells it , this song was originally intended for the Softdisk title , Keen Dreams , but since Softdisk insisted that the game fit on a 360 k disk , music had to be left out .
However , the song survived , and was used in Commander Keen IV : Secret of the Oracle .
The music itself appears in more than one level , but to Keen ( and Dopefish ) purists , the song has been dubbed " Dopefish Level Music " .
If you 'd like to download a MIDI file created by Bobby Prince in 1993 of this music , click here .
Also in there was a joke we did sometime in 1994 , where we turned the MIDI file around backwards . :)
The universe notwithstanding , Dopefish music continued unabated .
In 1994 , Lee Jackson composed a very silly song called Fish Polka .
This song only appears in the level warp cheat mode of Rise of the Triad .
And , in 1995 , Lee Jackson took Bobby 's original veggies song , and made it a bit more sinister .
This version of the song was originally intended for Dopefish 's aborted cameo in Duke Nukem 3D .
That one is called " DopeJaws " , and it can be downloaded here .
In the last paragraph , a Quake Clan for Dopefish was mentioned .
These folks created their own variant of the Dopefish song called " Kill Your Veggies " .
You can download that here .
In this zip file there is another variant of the theme that I 'm at a loss to explain the origin of .
In early 1998 , Dopefish music has come alive !
I was sent a new version of the Dopefish theme called " Swing Your Veggies " .
This is an it v2.14 file , and can only be played with something like ModPlug or Impulse Tracker .
Swing your Veggies can be downloaded here , and was created by Dave Hilling .
If you stick Swing Your Veggies on a repeating loop in your player , it sounds really cool !
Who knows where the future will take Dopefish in the realm of music ?
Thanks to Bobby Prince & Lee Jackson for granting their permission to allow these songs to be on this web page .
Bobby Prince has a web page with samples of lots of his music , and it can be reached at http://www.bpmusic.com.
Speaking of Bobby Prince ..
If you click on the picture of Bobby above , you 'll be taken to a page about the lyrics to the Dopefish Theme Song ( which is actually called Eat your Veggies .
As of July 1998 , you can also download a video of Bobby singing the lyrics !
Dopefish " Merchandise " & Fan Items
Please note that the Dopefish merchandise mentioned is not , and was not ever , for sale to the general public .
They were all strictly in - house gags , so please do n't ask us how to get any of these items , you can't .
However , if you 're a Dopefish fan yourself , and have created some goofy Dopefish items yourself , I would like to hear about them .
The Dopefish " product line " started with an ANSI screen which Lee and myself did -- I converted a screen capture to raw ANSI , and Lee cleaned it up and made it presentable .
You used to be able to see the results by logging into Software Creations and typing DOPEFISH ( or just DO for short ) at the menu prompt .
Of course , Software Creations does n't exist anymore -
If you want to download a file containing this ANSI , as well as a CGA ANSI of Dopefish , and 6 ASCII representatons of Dopefish ( one is at the bottom of this page ) , click here .
( In Feb of 1999 , we were sent some more ASCII dopefi by Sander Romeijn .
If you want to see them , click here .
And in Feb of 2004 , I got a new ASCII contribution from Christian Jensen - it has a dopefish and the Standard Galactic Alphabet .
You can check out that ASCII here . )
After this , we convinced Jay Wilbur ( formerly of id Software ) to have some Dopefish polo shirts made from an EPS file of the front facing burping Dopefish ( a.k.a. " Burpfish " ) .
When Christmas rolled around , Lee 's wife decided we needed to bring Dopefish into the real world , so she made 20 or so stuffed Dopefish dolls ( mostly side view , with a couple of Burpfish for good measure ) .
These were done in both EGA ( green ) and CGA ( purple ) versions and were given out at the Apogee Christmas party that year .
When Jay Wilbur heard of this , his first thought was that we needed to get a life .
On Christmas 1993 , Brenda Jackson ( Lee 's wife ) took a printed enlargement of a screen capture and did a pixel - for - pixel - accurate needlepoint tree ornaments , and I had coffee cups made ( out of my own pocket ) with a Burpfish on them .
Below the Burpfish on the mugs is the caption , " Eat Your Veggies ! " , which is the title of the music for the level that Dopefish appears in , composed by Bobby Prince .
Brenda also made a mobile of Dopefish for Christmas 1994 , but due to extreme delays in getting it done , it was never delivered until July 1995 .
You can see a picture of one of the Xmas tree ornaments here .
This is a picture of my ( now late ) cat Flash trying to knock the ornament off my 1997 Xmas Tree .
Not much happened with Dopefish development until early 1996 .
In early 1996 , some of the Apogee staff had some more items made up in the Dopefish product line .
Only one of these exist , but now we have a Dopefish Baseball Cap , a T - Shirt , as well as a mouse pad , & a soda can cooler .
The Baseball Cap and the T - Shirt have the Keen IV Credit Screen emblazened on them .
Hopefully , we 'll get some pictures of these items online shortly .
In June of 1996 , Andre Viens at Software Creations released his Dopefish Screen Saver for Windows .
This is a freeware product that you can download .
It 's freeware , so if you 're into Dopefish , and run Windows or Win95 , then you should get this !
Andre sent us an update in Feb of 2004 not of his screen saver , but of his new cel phone - he said we had to see a picture of it , and so do you . :)
Other Dopefish items in the product line that have appeared over time include a Windows95 Dopefish Theme ( by Ben Slinger ) , ( if you are going to use the Win95 Dopefish Theme , make sure to read the readme .
1st file inside the zip file before attempting to install it ) a Windows Icon , an OS / 2 Icon , an OS / 2 Warp Startup Logo , an OS / 2 Warp Web Explorer Animation File , and a Win95 Animated Burpfish Icon .
There 's also a MS Windows BMP that Tom Hall put together that , when tiled , looks great as a Windows background .
More recently , a newer version of the Windows Background was created by a Dopefish fan .
This new version has a color resolution of 16.7 million colours !
To download the 16.7 million colour version , click here .
( In the summer of 1999 , we were sent a second 16.7 million colour version which you can get here ) .
And to top it off in Feb 2004 , we have yet another variant of the Windows background image . :)
Shawn Swift also created a really cool Windows background image with a " Dopefish Lives " theme , and Rene Rijkhof created this Windows background image .
Rene also has a rather large self extracting Photoshop file of his background image if you want that ( it 's about 4.5 Mb ) Terry Herrin ( one of the old Software Creations Chat Regulars ) created an .flc animation file of Joe Siegler morphing into Dopefish .
To check that out , click here .
Also , I have a full - page Dopefish that will occasionally mysteriously show up in someone else 's fax machine .
Dopefish has also appeared in countless taglines , Internet signature files ( described by Tom Hall as " Pisces Swimeatus " ) , and even in a reinterpretation of the birth of the universe , where the Big Bang is replaced by the Big Burp .
Steve even holds the title , granted via a mail - order ordainment service , as " Pope of the Church of the Dopey Fish . "
The title is legally recognized , by Texas state law .
Check it out with the State of Texas if you do n't believe it !
Steve also owns the Internet domain name http://www.dopefish.org, but as of yet has n't actually done anything with it .
The FarSide cartoon above was given to me on November 2 , 1995 by Matt Long of Software Creations .
This cartoon originally said Pirahna where it says Dopefish .
VRML Fish !
Back in 1995 , a programmer by the name of Billy Zelznack was working with me at Apogee / 3D Realms ( he is now at Rebel Boat Rockers ) .
Billy & I had started work on a VRML version of Dopefish .
It was never completed ( which is why it was never released here for awhile ) .
However , in April of 1997 , I decided to release it as is .
If you want to see Dopefish in VRML , click here .
Please note however , that this was not completed , and Dopefish does n't look quite right , plus he 's only one colour , and it 's the wrong one at that . :)
Perhaps one day I 'll get around to finishing it .
UPDATE - In January of 1998 , I was sent a second VRML Dopefish image by James Thomas .
Check it out .
Flash Fish !
In April of 2003 , a noted Keen aficionado Sluggy created a really cool Dopefish Flash animation called " Dopefission " - using lots of graphics from this site .
It was sort of inspired by the " All Your Base " craze .
You can view it online here , or you can download the flash animation file by clicking here .
It 's quite awesome .
It takes some time to load , so be patient - but it 's worth it !
It 's quite silly , but is most definitely worth the time to watch .
We also got another Dopefish flash animation submission .
This time from Deacon Ross , who tells us that he had to create a flash animation as part of a school class lesson .
He created this Dopefish fishbowl animation .
Check it out here .
In addition , we got this file from Sam Hardy .
It 's a program that you can load into the Flash editor ( not the plugin , but the program that creates Flash files ) and mess around with the Dopefish . :)
Dopefish Grafitti -
In December of 1996 , I received a letter from Steven Paradise .
Steven was living on a US Army Base on Kwajalein , Republic of the Marshall Islands and was going to Kwajalein High School there .
Their school has a tradition where Seniors spraypaint something on the street , and guess what Steven painted ?
That 's right .
Dopefish !
Dopefish has now spread to street grafitti !
The picture to the left was taken shortly before the principal of the school ( Dr. Sebanc ) decided that he did n't like the word " dope " , and had the word painted over .
However , after Dr. Sebanc had " DOPE " painted over , Steven made a little fix .
He painted " D8RE " , which reads " DoPE " if you cover half of the 8 and the leg of the R .
A sad finale to this story , though ...
Steven wrote me in March of 1998 and informed me that the Dopefish grafitti is no longer on the street .
The painting ritual there is an annual event , and ( in Steven 's words ) " my Fish 's time on the street ran out in October 1997 " .
More Dopefish Items started popping up late in 1997 .
There seems to be some big spike in the fascination with Dopefish in late 1997 , I 'm not quite sure why .
The first that I saw was the rendered Dopefish that appears on the intro page to this site .
It was done by some cool artists over at Slipgate .
They wo n't tell me who actually did it , though .
November 12th saw a hack of Netscape v3 ( does n't work on Netscape 4 - I already tried ) in the form of the " Dopefish Throbber " by Chris Geroux .
This will replace the pulsing " N " in the Netscape network activity window with a Dopefish !
In January of 1998 , I was sent an Email by someone calling himself " Brain " .
It contained two icons and a cursor file for Windows95 .
You can get these files here .
February of 1998 saw Benjamin
Orth release his " Pac - Fish " image .
It 's a Pac - Man themed Dopefish image .
Check it out , it 's pretty funny !
Also , in March 1998 , Joe Siegler put this picture online .
It 's a picture sent to him some time ago by former Apogee Beta Tester Eric Baker .
This is Eric's TI Calculator , with a Dopefish drawn on it !
The actual date of when this was done has now been lost , since Joe Siegler took so long in getting this online . :)
In June of 1998 , I was sent a program called " Dopefish Tank " by Michael Dzicek .
He says this about it ..
" It is a little tank with a Dopefish swimming in it . "
If you want to check this out , you can download it here .
( NOTE :
When I put this online , I had not tested it to see if it had any problems - if this notice is here when you 're reading this , I still have n't checked it ) .
Even more items !
Later in 1998 , we were sent pictures of a " Stuffed Dopefish " .
These were from Christian Geroux .
There 's a total of three pictures .
Christian says " Got a few jpg's of a stuffed Dopefish my sister made for me . "
Click here to see the various pictures : [ Stuffed 1 | Stuffed 2 | Stuffed 3 ] .
In the summer of 1999 , we were sent a Dopefish Windows font by someone named Justin .
I 've not actually installed this font on my machine , so I do n't vouch for whether it works or not .
Dopefish in 2000 !
Well , there 's no new Dopefish as a game , or anything like that , but I had quite a pile of user submissions that I have n't done anythiung with , and since they have n't been posted to dopefish.com until June of 2000 , I 'm counting them as " 2000 Items " .
Anyway , first up is a Dopefish sculpture ( seen to your right ) .
It was sent in by Bryce Emmett - he says that his little sister made it for him in a school class .
I can just imagine what that teacher was thinking .
Bryce also sent us this picture of a Dopefish shirt he made .
It 's quite cool - wish I had one .
You can also download this user art from Nathan Davis called " The Dopefish Lives " .
It 's some nice hand drawn custom art .
Check it out .
Also , in a slight update to the Dopefish Throbber for Netscape 3 above , we have this file from Rob Kuebler .
It 's an updated Dopefish Throbber for Netscape 6 PR1 .
If you have the new Netscape , check this out .
There is a readme inside the zip archive which tells you what to do - this is not guaranteed to work on any version of Netscape other than v6PR1 .
Cool !
Dopefish discovers alien life !
Well , not really , but it 's a possibility .
If you 're familiar with the SETI@Home project , it 's where the SETI group ( Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence ) folks let you download data packets from the huge satellites that listen for such things , and process it yourself .
Anyway , in addition to doing it on your own , you can join groups of folks who share your same fascination .
That 's right - there 's a Dopefish group on SETI@Home .
What 's really interesting is that I have the nickname " Dopefish " , and by some freak I happen to discover a real transmission , the headline Dopefish discovers alien life will come true !
Click here to check out the Dopefish SETI group !
If you 're doing SETI@Home and do n't belong to a group , how about joining the Dopefish group ?
Not doing SETI@Home ?
You can download the software for free .
DopeAMP !
The net 's most popular MP3 ( and other ) player is Winamp .
A submission came in from Elizabeth Walsh , and it's a skin plugin for Winamp .
A shot of it can be seen to your left - the program itself is free , as is this download !
You can grab the skin here , and if you do n't have Winamp ( why not ? ) - you can get that for free too by visiting the Winamp Home Page .
There 's instructions inside the zip file you download for the skin on how to install it ( this skin was originally created for WInamp 2 ) .
While putting together this entry about DopeAMP - I discovered that I already had a Dopefish Winamp skin that was sent to me by Chris Ivarson .
His DopeAMP skin has a different look than the one above - his is mostly black with some Dopefish overtones .
You can download that one here , too !
Dopefish : The Game !
It 's been discussed , but it 's never happened until now .
In April 1997 , Apogee was sent a program from Chris Geroux called " Dopefish Lives ! " .
It 's a short Windows game ( using the Klik & Play Game Creation System ) that lets you play as the Dopefish , and your goal is to swim around and eat schoolfish while avoiding being hit by mines and being shot at .
Featuring music and art from this page as well as from Commander Keen Episode IV , this freeware game can be downloaded here !
The file is about 373k zipped .
In the summer of 1997 , Chris did a sequel game called Dopefish Forever !
It 's got more options , and is also freeware .
If you 'd like that , you can download it here .
If you 'd like to check out Chris ' page , go here .
I was also made aware of a web based tile game where you can shuffle around the pieces to unscramble a puzzle ( I believe they 're called slider games ) .
You can check that game out here .
Fishagotchi !
Jared Diogo sent in this email .
Check it out : " I recently got a Tamagotchi simulator for my computer off the Internet .
The webpage I got it from had some " plugins " for the Simulator , which would change some things like turning it Japanese ( I really think so :) ) or changing characters .
Unfortunately , none of them really seemed that appealing to me , so I made my own .
So I thought , " What better to have as a Tamagotchi than a Dopefish ? "
I just took one of the other plugins , copied it , and changed it so it turns the Secret Character into Dopefish . "
If you want to download this , you can do so here .
Ich Bin Ein Dopefish ?
In November of 1997 , a German Magazine called " Bravo Screen Fun " Printed some dopefish !
The article ( in german , on Page 68 of the magazine ) has some Dopefish , and a link to Andre Viens ' Dopefish Screen Saver .
If anyone has a copy of this magazine , and can read German , and would be willing to translate it , please contact myself or Andre Viens about it .
Thanks .

Mobile Dopefish - On March 23 , 1998 , my newer car ( a 1996 GREEN Chevy Cavalier ) got a new personalized license plate from the state of Texas .
I had put that off for a long time , mainly because the state of Texas charges a lot of money for this .
However , I finally went for it in February of 1998 .
I mailed in the form and waited .
On Monday March 23rd , I went over to the DMV here , and waited in line ( ughh ) and finally got my plate .
It reads DFISH , with a small State of Texas inbetween the D and the F .
Unfortunately , the state of Texas only allows for 6 letters on a plate , so I could n't spell Dopefish .
I considered going with DOPFSH , but went with what you see here .
Click on the license plate picture for a much larger picture of my entire car with the plate .
The green car really fits the license plate .
However , on March 21st , 2001 , the Fish mobile was no more .
I decided that I did n't want to pay the state of Texas an extra $ 40 a year just to have that plate , so I surrendered the plate and got a conventional state of Texas license plate .
I still have one of the plates on my desk as a memory , however ( TX has plates on both the front and back of the car - I just turned in one of them ) .
That was n't the first of my cars to be " Dopefishized " .
Back in early 1995 , shortly after the release of Rise of the Triad , I was driving a 1989 Blue Chrysler LeBaron .
I had a propensity for letting it get rather dirty , and the dust and general dirt level on the outside of the car was rather alot .
Anyway , Chuck Jones , one of our artists at the time , decided to draw in the dirt on my car with his finger .
What did he draw ?
Dopefish , of course .
There are two images on this site that show the " work " Chuck did on my old car .
Click here to see the first image , and click here to see the second .
Dopefish invades Halloween !
On November 16 , 1998 , I got an Email from a user with the handle of mscooper informing me that he had gone out as Dopefish for Halloween 1998 .
This is another first in the world of Dopefish lore .
A dopefish halloween costume .
It 's rather funny - I showed them around to a few people here at 3D Realms , and they got a big laugh .
We hope you do too - click on either of them for a larger image .
This picture also made it into Descent 3 ( see below ) .
Steven Spielberg & Dopefish !
What ?
I 've got to be making this up , eh ?
Well , a report came in that Dopefish made a cameo appearance on " Tiny Toons Adventures " , which is produced by Steven Spielberg .
The screenshot is of a device that measures Dizzy Devil 's intelligence , which apparently is in - between that of the Dopefish & a chicken wing .
Thanks to Shawn Swift for the picture !
' The Dopefish before Christmas !
What 's this ?
One of the more unique submissions I 've ever gotten is this poem ( in Word 97 format ) from Caleb Child .
The poem is very cool - and starts off like this :
T�was the night before Christmas , and all through the house ,
Not a creature was stirring , but me and my mouse ;
I was by my computer surfing with care ,
Type � dopefish - dot - com , � and soon I�d be there .
My family was sleeping , all warm in their beds ,
Whilst I had insomnia inside my head .
And so now the Internet did feature
This incredibly stupid dumb creature !
More in 2004 !
As I do this update , I have n't updated in ages ( 16 months ) .
Over the time since the last update , I 've collected many submissions that folks have sent me , I 'm going to chronicle some of them here ( yeah , I know most of these were n't actually submitted in 2004 ) .
First off is a pillow image that was sent to me by Alexander Johnson .
Alexander had this to say about the pillow , " my father 's girlfriend made this dopefish pillow for christmas !
Sadly my father is breaking up with her , but we will keep this sacred pillow as a memory of her , and maybe it will become a family heirloom . "
Click here to see more of Alexander 's Dopefish pillow .
There was a new clothing item , too .
We got a picture of this shirt from Archagon .
Also in the clothing related item section , we have this vector file image of Dopefish from Yossa .
This is a good file to use if you want to make your own clothing or hats , or something like that .
Here 's what the vector fish looks like .
This next one does n't really count as clothing , but it 's close .
In the spring of 2003 , Dopefish fan Jaap Laan went to a LAN party in Holland , and he said he wanted to look really cool , so he had his hairdresser doctor up his hair to have a Dopefish in it !
Check out the picture to your right or these other pictures of him [ link | link | link ] .
We got a program from Klaus Breuer which he describes as " a Dopefish Easter Egg " .
Seems that Klaus works for a banking company and worked in a Dopefish cameo into his software .
I do n't know what the software is , and he did n't tell me ( probably so that it can't be found out ) , but he did extract the Dopefish cameo into it's own program which you can download here ( complete with Delphi source code ! ) .
There were several more things .
We also received three " spinners " for the web browser Galeon , another animated cursor file by Alex Hartz , a spray paint of Dopefish in Counter Strike , a Milkshape Dopefish Model , a PocketPC Dopefish theme , A Windows background picture by " Speed Racer " both for regular size screens , and one designed for dual monitor computers , more fan art ( by Owen Kinton ) , an AOL Instant Messenger
Theme , more fan art ( Clive Trower ) , Nokia Cel Phone Dopefish Logos ( Ewan MacDougall ) , more fan art ( Alex Hartz ) , and fan art for Worldcraft ( Manuel Lorenz ) .
We also were sent these two screen captures from an episode of the TV series " Invader Zim " .
Apparently , in the first season was an episode titled " Bad Bad , Rubber Piggy " .
There is a fish in the episode on a rampage eating everything in sight while wearing a bear suit .
If anyone from the Invader Zim production reads this , and can confirm this cameo , let me know .
Thanks . :)
Dopefish 2012
Bet you never thought you 'd see another update to this , eh ?
I never thought I 'd be using MS Frontpage to edit a page in 2012 , either ! :)
Anyway ,
In the summer of 2012 , I was sent an email from Tom Hall , saying that Dopefish had made an appearance in his newest game , a Google + specific title called ' Pettington Park " .
He enclosed a picture of it :
I wrote Tom back and asked him how this appeared in the game , and he told me this :
When you play the game , which is a weekly competition between cats and dogs ( really , cat persons vs. dog persons ) , you shake / hammer / chop various items in the game to get resources .
Occasionally collection items drop out too .
Some collections are only completable by a Gift from a Friend , from the Free Gifts interface .
The Plastic Dopeyfish is one of these .
A new Dopefish reference in 2012 .
Told ya " Dopefish Lives ! "
Summing up Dopefish
Why Dopefish ?
Well , he swims , he eats , and he burps .
What more can you ask for ?
We think that the latter reason is why I like him so much .
I 'm known for a few wall rattlers and personally did the voice of Dopefish in Wacky Wheels and Rise of the Triad .
I really practiced for it , too .
Sitting at my computer at four in the morning with a two liter bottle of Diet Coke , I ran through take after take , hurting myself a couple times in the process , until I came up with just the right length and resonance .
Click here to download an archive of the recording session mentioned here .
Watch out for the blooper .wav contained within .
That 's the one where I hurt himself !
Even though he Dopefish legally belongs to id Software , he is a welcome adopted member of the Apogee family .
If there are ever any new Keen games , you can wager a goodly amount that the Dopefish will be in it .

Human trafficking is a global problem where men , women and children are transported for the purposes of slavery , prostitution , forced labor and servitude .
Human trafficking is the fastest growing criminal industry in the world .
Trafficking victims are usually recruited by using coercion , deception , fraud , abuse of power and outright abduction .
The exploitation of people includes an assortment of different things that are forced onto the victims .
It can range from sexual exploitation , slavery or similar practices of forced servitude , forced early marriage , recruitment of child soldiers , beggars and even international adoption .
Trafficking is controlled by large criminal organizations in some countries such as Russia , Eastern Europe , Hong Kong , Japan and Colombia .
The majority of trafficking is done by smaller networks or groups .
It is an industry that lures people in because of the promise of profits .
Little capital is needed to start up the business and prosecution is relatively rare .
Trafficking of humans is not only illegal , but highly immoral and demeaning to the human life in general .
The exact extent of human trafficking is unknown due to the illegal nature and differences in methodology used among traffickers .
According to the United States State Department it is estimated that anywhere between 600,000 to 820,000 men , women and children are trafficked across international borders each year .
Approximately 70 percent are women and girls .
Up to 50 percent are minors .
The most common destinations for victims of human trafficking are Thailand , Japan , Israel , Belgium , the Netherlands , Germany , Italy , Turkey and the U.S.
The major sources of trafficked persons include Thailand , China , Nigeria , Albania , Bulgaria , Belarus , Moldova and Ukraine .
The majority of transnational victims are trafficked into commercial sexual exploitation .
There are currently about 10,000 forced laborers in the U.S.
The University of California at Berkeley conducted research and found that about 46 % of people in slavery in the United States are forced into prostitution .
Domestic servitude claims 27 % , agriculture 10 % and other occupations 17 % .
Many people think that slavery no longer exists , but that is not true .
Slavery still exists today in the form of human trafficking .
It is estimated that 14,000 people are trafficked into the United States each year .
There are efforts to reduce human trafficking .
Governments , international associations and non-government organizations have all tried to end human trafficking with various degrees of success .
The OSCE ( Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ) established an anti-trafficking mechanism aimed at raising public awareness of the problem and building the political will within states to tackle it effectively .
In 2000 the United Nations adopted the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime , also called the Palermo Convention which included protocol to prevent , suppress and punish trafficking in persons , especially women and children and protocol against the smuggling of migrants by land , sear and air .
Many human rights organizations have campaigned against human trafficking .
Several new non-governmental organization and human rights organizations have been formed to combat human trafficking .
There have also been several movies which portrayed human trafficking .
There are many horrors of human trafficking .
The statistics are not exact because it is hard to know exactly how many people are trafficked worldwide each year .
The sad thing is that there is not more done about it and the fact that it is not well known like other problems of the world .
In order for human trafficking to stop there needs to be more awareness about the fact that human trafficking is real and is becoming an increasing problem and there need to be more laws against organized crime in the United States and abroad .

Teleportation Of Information
The development of quantum computing seems firmly on the way , now that information has been teleported about a meter .
Christopher Monroe , of the University of Maryland 's Joint Quantum Institute , spoke of this achievement as a milestone in quantum information processing .
The type of information involved — now transferable without going through any physical medium — can be the spin of a sub-atomic particle or even a photon 's polarization .
Prior to this , teleportation had been achieved between photons over distances , between photons and atom ensembles , and between two atoms by means of the intermediary action of a third atom .
But none had made use of effective methods of managing quantum information over a distance .
Now , the Joint Quantum Institute team , with the help of University of Michigan colleagues , have teleported a quantum state from one atom to another .
The basis of their process works because two particles can become " entangled , " where they become one entity ( describable in a single equation ) — and any change to one is a change to the other , even if at a distance .
In a new hybrid approach , light is utilized for transferral of quantum information between atoms .
In the January 23 , 2009 Science journal , the JQI scientists mentioned that information teleported from atom to atom could be accurately recovered 90 percent of the time by using their protocol .
Thus it could possibly provide a basis for future quantum repeaters helping the networking of quantum memories over great distances .
At this point , their experiments have far to go , since the success rate is still very low .
But developments appear promising .
The paper describes that the " scheme may be used for scalable quantum computation and quantum communication . "
In the described process , both ytterbium ions are initialized in a particular ground state .
( An ion is an atom that has gained or lost electrons . )
The first ion gets irradiated by a tailored microwave burst .
Then both ions are excited by a laser pulse of a duration of one trillionth of a second .
The set - up used to accomplish this is an odd combination of semitransparent beam splitters , fiber optics , lasers , and vacuum chambers .
The result qualifies as teleportation because the information vanishes during measurement of the ion at the first point ( in a way that does not reveal the information ) and reappears when a microwave pulse is applied to the ion at the second point .

Modern Hollywood loves to reboot .
Star Trek , Batman Begins , Halloween , Friday the 13th ...
It is a brilliant means of both exploiting a familiar brand and making the new product seem fresh and innovative .
And by repackaging a franchise , the canny studios are appeasing die - hard fans while simultaneously providing an entry point for newcomers who have not followed the established mythology .
It 's also a teeny bit post - modern and self - reflexive , and we love that sort of stuff these days .
With rebooting so common in the movie and comic book worlds , could the tactic be similarly employed by the games industry ?
Well , yeah , it already is .
Prince of Persia : Sands of Time effectively rebooted Ubisoft 's athletic platformer series , and arguably , last year 's Prince of Persia did it again - adopting the familiar rebooting tactic of reverting to the original title ( see also Turok and the forthcoming Wolfenstein ) .
Tomb Raider : Legend was marketed as a reboot to a tired series , which was dealt a sickening blow to the cranium by the awful Angel of Darkness ; there are also rumours knocking about that the next title in the series will restructure the game as an open - world survival horror romp , bringing Lara slap - bang up to date with current design trends .
Elsewhere , EA is very much selling Need for Speed : Shift as a reboot , getting it back to the basics of driving slick cars really fast , rather than coming on like an interactive version of The Fast and Furious , ripped from the idle imaginings of an attention deficit adolescent .
Capcom , though , has hinted that the next Resident Evil game will be a more radical rethink of the survival horror genre , out - rebooting Resi 4 , which , come to think of it , was more a re-tune than a reboot because it existed largely in the same narrative continuity as its predecessors .
And on the subject of survival horror , the forthcoming Silent Hill : Shattered Memories purports to be a re-thinking of the first title , using the same lead character and plot , and banishing memories of the later , much less successful , sequels .
Fans of fighting robots can also look forward to a reboot of the MechWarrior franchise , which was massive on the PC in the nineties .
According to IGN , it 's being designed by Jordan Weisman who was one of the creators of the BattleTech role - playing game from which the PC sims were taken .
If anything , the concept of the reboot makes more sense in the videogame sector than it does in movies .
For a start , games are complex entities , with each new iteration in a familiar series adding many , many hours of fresh narrative content .
Entering , say , the Zelda , Resident Evil , Half - Life , Dragon Quest or Metal Gear worlds at this stage must be massively intimidating - even if the developers go to great lengths to make each entry work as a singular , self - contained entity within the canon .
Also , videogames are going through a paradigm shift in terms of popular appeal at the moment .
The faithful audience of young males has been joined by new demographics brought in by the Wii , PC casual games , and now the iPhone .
Many of these people may be vaguely aware of long - running game brands , but wo n't have a clue about the key characters , sign post events and basic gameplay mechanisms .
These issues can easily be resolved via a quick switch off / switch on - as JJ Abrams brilliantly proved with the recent movie , Star trek , which explicitly jettisoned decades worth of mythology , plot and character development to welcome in a fresh batch of kids brought up on flashier sci-fi fare ( like , of course , the rebooted Battlestar Galactica ) .
So , which videogame series ' - defunct or current - do you think would be ripe for this kind of re-appraisal and re-imagining ?
The remake of the original Monkey Island title may show there 's a market for classic adventure titles , so I could see Zork , Myst ( recently re-released on iPhone ) or King 's Quest making a welcome return in new forms .
I 'd also love to see mid-nineties faves like Baldur 's Gate and Oddworld re-thought for the 21st century .
How about you ?
18 July 2009
Just yesterday I discovered a fruit - bearing vine overhanging my apartment complex .
The fruits look vaguely fig-ish , but the leaves do n't match that of a typical fig tree .
The plant itself appears to be some kind of vine , climbing up a tall group of bushes that surround it .
Any thoughts on what this particular plant is ?
A couple of leaves I grabbed from the vine ( big )
The exterior of the fruit ( big )
The insides look kind of figgy ( big )
Inasmuch as I 'd rather not poison myself , but I really like the idea of fresh figs , I 'm eager to figure out exactly what this thing is .
You can't quite tell from the pictures , but the leaves have smooth , round tips with no spines of any kind .
Update : when I sniff the fruit , it smells vaguely like honeysuckle .
But then , it could just be my nose making things up .

ALSIP , Illinois ( CNN ) -- A Cook County cemetery where hundreds of graves were dug up and allegedly resold has been declared a crime scene , meaning that relatives of people believed buried there will not be allowed to visit for several days , an official said Friday .
Family members and police gather outside the Burr Oak Cemetery office in Alsip , Illinois , on Wednesday .
" It would be the height of irresponsibility for me to invite people in , to raise expectations and then crash them , " Cook County Sheriff Thomas J. Dart told reporters in a news conference held at Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip , Illinois .
He pleaded for patience , saying he hoped to reopen the 150 - acre cemetery to the public in five to seven days .
Dart said the scope of the investigation has broadened to include " Babyland , " a section of the cemetery intended for children .
" A lot of women came up to me and asked for help with Babyland , " he said .
" To a person , every one I talked to could not find any of their children in Babyland . "
Watch sheriff discuss gruesome revelation »
A large number of grave sites " are completely missing , " he said , adding that he had received more than 5,000 telephone inquiries and 1,700 e-mails about the matter since the investigation began .
As many as half of the complaints were about missing headstones , 25 to 30 percent were about loved ones who had been relocated , he said .
He cited the experience of one family looking for 10 relatives buried there .
" They could n't find anybody , " he said .
In addition , in some cases there are no records of burials having taken place , despite relatives ' insistence that they did , he said .
In other cases , records have been altered , destroyed or found in people 's houses , he said .
" Our office has to investigate over 5,000 grave sites due to the vast amounts of inquiries from grieving family members , " he said .
Dart said he himself walked through the cemetery on Friday and what he saw was disturbing .
" I found bones out there , " he said .
" I found individuals wandering aimlessly looking for their loved ones who can't find them . "
Some people told him that an entire area that used to have gravestones facing in one direction now has them facing in another direction , he said .
" This is getting bigger , " he said .
" We do n't have an end in sight ... more people have not found relatives than have found them . "
More than 2,000 families have descended on the cemetery since authorities uncovered what they say was a scheme to resell the plots , excavate the graves , dump the remains and pocket the cash .
Four people face felony charges for their alleged involvement .
He had said earlier this week that the number of disturbed graves was around 300 , but said Friday that number was sure to rise .
One family arrived on Thursday to bury a woman in a plot they had purchased and found the plot was already occupied , he said .
Authorities also discovered Emmett Till 's original casket in a dilapidated garage on the cemetery grounds .
The casket had been replaced by a new one after Till 's body was exhumed in 2005 .
" There was wildlife living inside of it , " Dart said of the old casket , found in the corner of a garage filled with lawn care equipment and other " piles of things . "
Till was killed in August 1955 in Mississippi after the 14 - year - old reportedly whistled at a white woman .
His body was exhumed 50 years later as part of a renewed investigation into his death .
The Chicago Tribune reported that he was reburied in a different casket .
Thousands of people had viewed Till 's body in the original casket in Chicago shortly after he was killed , the Rev. Jesse Jackson said at the news conference .
" His mother had the gut and grit to say that ' I want America to see what they did to my baby 's body , ' " Jackson said about Till , whose body was mutilated .
" More than 100,000 saw his body lying at the church .
It is said that those who saw his body were never the same again , " he said .
" Emmett Till 's lynching redefined emotions in our culture in very fundamental ways .
So to see his casket in this state of desecration and neglect is very painful . "
Cemetery groundskeepers told investigators that Till 's grave was not among those disturbed in the alleged resale scheme , Dart said earlier this week .
Carolyn Towns , an office manager for the cemetery ; and Keith Nicks , Terrance Nicks and Maurice Daley , all gravediggers , have each been charged with dismembering a human body , a felony charge for which sentences range from six to 30 years , authorities said .
Steven Watkins , an attorney for Towns , said his client is innocent .
The public defender 's office in Cook County said it had represented the three others at the bond hearing but could not provide a statement for them .
Authorities began investigating the cemetery -- where , along with Till , blues legend Dinah Washington and some Negro League baseball players are buried -- about six weeks ago after receiving a call from its owners , who said they suspected " financial irregularities " regarding the business , Dart said earlier this week .
He said the owners are not believed to be involved in the alleged scam .
All About Illinois • Emmett Till
Harvard University will endow a visiting professorship in lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender studies , a position that , it believes , will be the first endowed , named chair in the subject at an American college .
The visiting professorship was made possible by a gift of $ 1.5 million from the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus , which will formally announce it at a dinner on Thursday , after Harvard ’s commencement exercises .
With the gift , Harvard said it would regularly invite “ eminent scholars studying issues related to sexuality or sexual minorities ” to teach on campus for one semester , according to a draft of a university press release .
The chair is being named for F.O. Matthiessen , a Harvard scholar and literary critic who “ stands out as an unusual example of a gay man who lived his sexuality as an ‘ open secret ’ in the mid-20th century , ” according to the release .
Professor Matthiessen , the release added , “ leapt to his death from the window of a Boston hotel room ” in 1950 , despondent , at least in part , over the death several years earlier of his partner , the artist Russell Cheney .
Editor 's note : Leah Ward Sears stepped down this week as Chief Justice of the Georgia Supreme Court .
In 1992 , she became the first woman -- and youngest person -- appointed to Georgia 's highest court .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
After Tommy 's sudden death , we found among my brother 's personal effects a questionnaire he had completed in 2005 for a church class .
Leah Ward Sears , with her brothers William Thomas ( Tommy ) Sears , left , and Michael Sears .
The very first question was a fill - in - the - blank that went like this : " At the end of my life , I 'd love to be able to look back and know I 'd done something about ..... "
" Fathers , " Tommy wrote .
When asked to identify something that angered him that could be changed , Tommy wrote , " Re-establishment of equity and balance and sanity within the American family . "
My brother was born to be a father , and he grew into a good and loving one .
Tommy was tall and handsome , smart , witty and fun .
A graduate of the Naval Academy and a Stanford - educated lawyer , he married and fathered a little girl and boy who were the center of his life .
Tommy felt that one of the worst problems in our country today was family breakdown and fatherlessness .
He railed against intentional unwed childbearing and the ease with which divorce was possible .
He did n't like that we have become a society that values the rights of adults to do their own thing over our responsibility to protect our children .
As a judge I have long held a front row seat to the wreckage left behind by our culture of disposable marriage and casual divorce that my brother so despised .
No - fault divorce was a response to a very real problem .
The social and legal landscape that preceded it largely prevented casual divorce , but it often trapped people in abusive marriages .
It also turned divorces into even uglier affairs than they are today , forcing people to expose in court damaging information about their children 's other parent .
That system was intolerable , and we should never go back to that .
But no - fault divorce 's broad acceptance as an unquestioned social good helped usher in an era that fundamentally altered the seriousness with which marriage is viewed .
It effectively ended marriage as a legal contract since either party can terminate it , with or without cause .
This leaves many people struggling to remake their lives after painful divorces that they do not want .
It also left many parents cut off from , or sidelined in , the lives of the children they love .
When Tommy divorced , as in so many cases , a bitter struggle over resources and the children ensued .
My brother came to believe that the legal system turned him into a mere visitor of his children .
Tommy eventually accepted a job as a lawyer for the State Department and went to Iraq ( and later to Dubai ) in order to make the money needed to support his children .
Being in a war zone , under terrible conditions without the children he loved , was unbearable to him .
On November 5 , 2007 , my phone rang before daybreak .
A U.S. Foreign Service officer was on the other line .
Was I the sister of William Thomas Sears ?
I knew before I was told what had happened .
Tommy had died .
But the cause took my breath away :
My brother had taken his own life .
I know I 'll never understand fully all that factored into his decision to kill himself .
No doubt Tommy was wrestling with more demons than he had ever admitted to me or knew himself .
But as a divorcee myself and , for a number of years , a single parent , I know the immense pain of divorce and its aftermath .
The limitations the law placed on Tommy 's right to raise his own children after his divorce magnified my brother 's pain and was , I believe , more than he could live with .
Tommy was only 53 when he committed suicide .
That was more than a year ago , and I am still learning to live without him and live with the fact that this man I looked up to all my life chose to end his own life .
Tommy 's loss has catapulted me even farther down a path I was already on .
This may sound like heresy , but I believe the United States and a host of Western democracies are engaged in an unintended campaign to diminish the importance of marriage and fatherhood .
By refusing to do everything we can to stem the rising rate of divorce and unwed childbearing , our country often isolates fathers ( and sometimes mothers ) from their children and their families .
Of course , there are occasions when divorce is necessary .
And not everyone should marry .
But it has become too easy for people to walk away from their families and commitments without a real regard for the gravity of their decision and the consequences for other people , particularly children .
Removing no - fault divorce as a legal option may not be the right way to move forward , and the solutions we need may not be entirely legal in nature .
But answers must be found .
The coupling and uncoupling we 've become accustomed to undermines our democracy , destroys our families and devastates the lives of our children , who are not as resilient as we may wish to think .
The one - parent norm , which is necessary and successful in many cases , nevertheless often creates a host of other problems , from poverty to crime , teen pregnancy and drug abuse .
The loss of my brother has changed my life , as these losses so often do to people .
This summer , after 26 years , I 'm hanging up my robe as a judge to return to private practice .
I will spend some of my time teaching a course in family law at the University of Georgia Law School .
And I have accepted a fellowship at the Institute of American Values in New York -- a private , nonprofit , nonpartisan organization that contributes intellectually to strengthening families and civil society in the United States and the world .
At my request , the fellowship is named after my brother .
As the William Thomas Sears Distinguished Fellow in Family Law , perhaps now I can truly do " something about fathers " -- a mission I 'm on for Tommy and a critical calling for all of us .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leah Ward Sears .

Senator Bernie Sanders makes the excellent point .
The Republicans try to scare us that socialized medicine will be terrible , but the truth is that we already have socialized medicine in this country — it is run by the Veterans Administration .
If any politician tried to get rid of the VA health benefits , they would quickly lose their job .
Likewise , the Republicans try to scare us that single payer health insurance will be horrible , but the truth is that we already have single payer health insurance in this country — it is called Medicare .
And any politician who tried to get rid of Medicare would also find themselves quickly out of a job .
In fact , even Dubya added a prescription benefit to Medicare .
So when Republicans try to scare you by throwing around terms like single payer or socialized medicine , it is n’t because they wo n’t work or wo n’t be popular , they are scared that they will work and they will be popular .
Of course , that ’s if the Republicans do n’t manage to purposely make health care reform horrible ( like they did with the prescription drug benefit they added to Medicare ) .
UPDATE : The Anonymous Liberal makes the point that in order “ to adopt the Republican position on health care requires believing that every other country in the world is wrong , that their policy experts are misguided and their citizens confused .
Indeed it requires believing that the American people themselves are wrong , that despite endless opinion polls to the contrary , people in this country really love the system we have . ”

I 'll admit , McDonald 's is not always very speedy with their food .
Sometimes you have to wait for a few minutes before your order is finally done .
Still , that 's no reason to pull a gun on the people inside .
Especially when you 're a police officerDenver police officer Derrick Curtis Saunders has been charged with " felony menacing " for pulling his gun at an Aurora , Colorado McDonald 's while waiting for his food .
According to a story in the Denver Post , Saunders and another off - duty police officer were waiting at the drive - through window back in May , when Saunders got tired of waiting and thought that a show of force would somehow make the microwaves work faster .
Saunders has been charged with felony menacing and weapons charges , as well as prohibited use of a weapon , reckless endangerment , disorderly conduct and trying to order breakfast items after 11:00 am .
There is no truth to the rumor that Saunders was actually trying to apprehend Hamburglar .
Saunders needs to make sure he does n't burn any bridges with McDonald 's , since that may be his only career option left open to him when this is all over .---
During the General Assembly ’s aborted rush to adjournment Friday , the Senate approved a resolution — introduced earlier the same day — to create a nine - member special commission to study a swath of issues surrounding marijuana .
The sponsors of the eleventh - hour measure — which requires no further action — include Senators Joshua Miller , D- Cranston ; Leo Blais , R- Coventry ; Rhoda Perry , D - Providence ; Charles Levesque , D - Portsmouth , and Susan Sosnowski , D - South Kingstown .
In a brief interview Wednesday , Miller said the resolution was sparked by the referendum - driven move to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana in Massachusetts , and by what he perceives as “ a national trend towards decriminalization . ”
In November 2008 , Massachusetts voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana , making getting caught with less than an ounce of pot punishable by a civil fine of $ 100 .
Asked why he waited until what was to be the last day of the session to introduce the measure , Miller said he and his fellow sponsors felt it was “ very important ” for this study to be “ defined as an issue ” completely separate and apart from the passage — over Governor Carcieri ’s veto — of legislation allowing the creation of state - regulated dispensaries to sell marijuana for medicinal use .
Miller said it also “ took that long for it to be taken seriously . ”
The resolution creates a “ Special Senate Commission to Study the Prohibition of Marijuana ” made up of “ elected members of the Rhode Island Senate , local law enforcement officials , physicians , nurses , social workers , academic leaders in the field of addiction studies , advocates or patients in the state ’s medical marijuana program , advocates working in the field of prisoner reentry , economists , and members of the general public . ”
The measure poses a number of specific questions for study , among them : “ Whether and to what extent Rhode Island youth have access to marijuana despite current laws prohibiting its use .
...
Whether adults ’ use of marijuana has decreased since marijuana became illegal in Rhode Island in 1918 .
...
Whether the current system of marijuana prohibition has created violence in the state of Rhode Island against users or among those who sell marijuana .
...
Whether the proceeds from the sales of marijuana are funding organized crime , including drug cartels .
...
Whether those who sell marijuana on the criminal market may also sell other drugs , thus increasing the chances that youth will use other illegal substances . ”
The resolution also cites questions about the “ dangers associated with marijuana resulting from it being sold on the criminal market , including if it is ever contaminated or laced with other drugs . ”
The panel has until Jan. 31 , 2010 , to report its findings and recommendations to the Senate , though it would stay alive through Jan. 31 , 2014 .
Miller , a bar owner who says he does not use illegal drugs — or even drink liquor more than a few times a year — said he is not hoping or expecting any specific outcome .
“ I am more open - minded that that , ” he said .
“ I am hoping to react to the best research and data we can get out of looking at it . ”
A year ago , Carcieri vetoed a joint House and Senate call for a study of the wisdom of creating state - regulated marijuana dispensaries .
But “ since this was only a Senate resolution , it does not come to the governor for his approval , ” Carcieri spokeswoman Amy Kempe said .
In February , one of the cosponsors , pharmacist Leo Blais , proposed a bill — The Sensible State Marijuana Policy Act — that would have decriminalized the possession of an ounce or less of marijuana , reducing it to a civil offense for which anyone age 18 or older would face a $ 100 fine and forfeiture of the marijuana .
The bill never made it out of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
As of Wednesday , no person or group had formally applied for the license to run the first of the three marijuana dispensaries allowed by the so - called “ compassion centers ” bill .
Both the House and Senate have each passed , for the second year in a row , their own versions ( S39 and H5007 ) of a bill to eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for certain drug crimes .
But no one version of the measure has yet cleared both chambers , in this year when the House and Senate went on hiatus , with no certain return date , and no final action on a bevy of high - profile bills .

Energizer Adds DSLR / Camcorder USB Charger
Energizer ’s Energi To
Go line has some pretty sweet stuff , including a solar battery charger for just $ 50 .
They ’re adding another device to the line later this year that ’s turning some heads – the DSLR / camcorder battery USB charging clip .
I really hope they have a better name .
This nifty little toy looks great .
Two prongs hang from the top of what is essentially a chip clip with a usb stick attached .
The prongs line up with the contacts on most DSLR / camcorder batteries , giving you an ultra portable way to charge on the go .
The only setback is that the clip may require one of Energizer ’s USB - equipped battery packs , but even so , it ’s USB , and that ’s awesome .
Now if we could just get universal charging adapters for our cell phones .
Energizer has yet to release pricing and availability for the clip , but I ’d guess it ’ll fall somewhere around $ 20 .
Watch for it in Q3 this year .

Why the pirates are on the rise in Sweden
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Newsnight 's Matt Prodger visits Sweden 's Peace and Love music festival in Borlange to investigate what it is about the Swedes that has put them at the heart of a raging debate about internet freedom .
For 24 - hour party people a visit to the land of the midnight sun is a must .
For one thing , the Swedes are serious when it comes to having fun - and at this time of year the sun never sets .
The Pirate Party does n't want to be perceived as a bunch of computer hackers that just want to download the latest Angelina Jolie movie for free
Katrine Kielos , Aftonbladet columnist
And so it is that I find myself at the Peace and Love festival in Borlänge long after bedtime , negotiating a sea of tents which stretches far into the blood - red glow of a night - long dusk .
I am here to try to find out what it is about Swedes that has put them at the heart of a raging debate about internet freedom .
It is estimated - but nobody really knows - that at least one in 10 Swedes swap music illegally via BitTorrent file - sharing websites like Sweden 's notorious Pirate Bay , and it is thought that in 2008 , some 15 m films were illegally downloaded here .
' Sharing is caring '
Sitting in the shelter of a waist - high pile of beer crates I find my target demographic - a group of music - loving festival - goers .
Out of the five of them , three voted for the Pirate Party in this year 's European elections , helping to put a representative , Christian Engström , into the European Parliament .
Falkvinge 's Pirate Party won seven percent of the vote in the EU elections Twenty - year - old Erik Lennermo explains why he voted for the Pirate Party .
" Civil rights .
Everybody has a right of privacy for their own e-mails , SMS messages and phone calls .
File - sharing is just a small bit of the whole cake . "
His friend Daniel Gustavsson 's support for the Pirate Party is more straightforward : " I just care about the file - sharing , " he says .
" Sharing is caring . "
Such views have propelled the country into what Swedish MP Camilla Lindberg describes as the biggest political debate for 20 years .
At its heart is a controversial law passed in parliament last year .
Known as the FRA Law , in honour of the Swedish electronic intelligence agency , equivalent to Britain 's GCHQ , it permits the monitoring of international phone calls , e-mail and internet traffic .
Some of the world 's most powerful computers will scan all cross - border e-traffic in real time for a quarter of a million trigger words and phrases that the security services believe warrant further investigation .
And it can be done without judicial oversight .
Anti-terror necessity
In the UK the Home Office recently put out to consultation proposals which would give GCHQ similar powers .
Erik said he voted for the party because of its civil rights stance Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt told Newsnight the law is directed not at file - sharers , but terrorists : " I think we struck a clear balance between integrity and security , " he said .
" Take for instance a bomb blowing up in Stockholm or London - a lot of the electorate would ask me ' What did you do [ to prevent it ] ? '
" For a long time we have n't seen such things in Sweden , and then it 's very easy to say we do n't need ( the FRA Law ) .
But I have to take a long - term responsibility . "
Popular support
But that argument does not wash with Pirate Party founder Rick Falkvinge , who advocates reforming copyright laws to allow free file - sharing , downloading , and the right to copy everything from the latest Hollywood blockbuster to patented pharmaceuticals .
" The thing is you ca n't just monitor some internet traffic , " he told me .
" In order to find out what you want to see you need to see all of it .
It 's not about swapping music as such .
It 's about the Big Brother society that is being set up using the excuse of catching file - sharers .
The Swedish PM says the FRA law is designed to combat terrorism " We know where this road ends , even though each step of the way can be justified , because so many societies have been down it before . "
To make the point , activists deluged Swedish parliamentarians with copies of George Orwell 's totalitarian satire 1984 ahead of last year 's vote .
Yet among MPs in the ruling coalition , only Camilla Lindberg of the Liberal People 's Party voted against the wiretapping law .
" Two weeks before the vote last year we had big demonstrations , 10,000 people here , " she says , pointing at the parliament building in Stockholm .
" Each MP got thousands of emails suddenly I realised I 'm not the only one against this .
It 's people from the left and right , young and old feel the same thing . "
But why Sweden ?
Part of it is , of course , the country 's technological prowess .
While Finland has Nokia , Sweden gave us Ericsson .
Swedes enjoy some of the highest - and fastest - rates of connectivity in the world , a development that has been spurred by necessity because of the country 's sparsely populated geography .
Cultural differences
And then there is Sweden 's liberal culture , part of which is the principle of Allemansratten .
" Allemansratten means everyone 's right .
It 's an important part of Swedish culture and identity , " Katrine Kielos , a columnist on Sweden 's best - selling daily tabloid Aftonbladet , explained to me .
We are going to put the record industry out of business ... we are very much looking forward to that
Pirate Party founder Rick Falkvinge
" It means that the law of trespass is very weak in Sweden , so you have the right to access somebody 's property in a way that is not possible in other countries . "
Ms Kielos ' tutorial in Allemansratten came as we stood together on the roof of Sweden 's historic parliament building .
This would be trespass pretty much anywhere else in the world .
Here , the only restriction on my Stockholm rooftop tour is a safety harness .
" The Pirate Party does n't want to be perceived as a bunch of computer hackers that just want to download the latest Angelina Jolie movie for free , " she said .
" So they 're trying to frame this issue in the way of Allemansratten because this is something that resonates a lot in Swedish culture . "
Political kingmaker According to political analyst Stig - Bjorn Ljunggren if , as expected , the Pirate Party wins seats in the Swedish parliament in elections next year , it could well find itself the kingmaker between the country 's two established political blocs .
" You have two blocks in parliament : one green and red , and one blue .
And if a third party comes into parliament they could choose which one of these two parties will form a government .
" They ( the Pirate Party ) will sell the post of prime minister to the party that gives most to them , " he said .
Talking ' Allemansratten ' on the roof of Sweden 's parliament building
And the prime minister has not ruled out doing a deal with the party .
Some musicians and artists , like Abba 's Bjorn Ulvaeus , have spoken out against the Pirate Party , but few will go on the record because the debate is so explosive .
An exception is Alexandar Bard , a musician behind 100 Swedish top 40 hits , and latterly an academic specialising in the internet .
He says file - sharing is killing the Swedish music industry : " Six years ago Sweden was the third biggest producer of music in the world and last year we were only the ninth .
" So today in Sweden it 's impossible to get a recording contract because there are no record companies around to sign with .
It means you can't get paid for making music and you can't get a budget to make music .
" File - sharing is not a big issue politically , it 's not like climate change or the environment .
And the Pirate Party has turned it into a big issue to win votes . "
But Pirate Party founder Mr Falkvinge is unrepentant .
" We are going to put the record industry out of business " , he says .
" And we are very much looking forward to that . "
And like the Vikings of yore , the pirates ' philosophy has spread far and wide .
Independent pirate parties have sprung up in dozens of countries across the world .
It is now a global battle .

Comparisons between New York and Iran are hard to resist these days .
Consider a pronouncement this week by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iranian president and front - runner for the title of world leader with the creepiest smile .
Mr. Ahmadinejad is not exactly a beacon of democracy .
But even he seems to understand that using the police to enforce cultural values is probably not a good idea .
“ Cultural issues should be dealt through cultural channels , and I am against security confrontations , ” he said .
Would n’t you know that New York City , its Police Department and the New York Yankees find themselves in sync with him ?
The police , they all agree , have no business enforcing cultural values .
To be more specific , they have no business stopping anyone who wishes to wander around while a certain Irving Berlin song is being played .
The song is “ God Bless America . ”
It is played  usually in the Kate Smith version  at every Yankee home game during the seventh inning .
All baseball teams performed this ritual after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
But before long , most stopped routinely doing so .
How many times in a single game is it necessary to assert one ’s patriotism ?
Is n’t the pregame “ Star - Spangled Banner ” enough ?
Not for the Yankees .
Come the bottom of every seventh inning , their fans are told to stand .
Some no doubt still find the song inspiring .
But after eight years , others barely pay attention , no more moved to love of country than they are by the late - inning blaring of “ Cotton - Eyed Joe . ”
eSolar
A picture was worth 24,000 mirrors when eSolar , a company based in Pasadena , Calif. , that specializes in solar thermal power , transformed a vast field of heliostats at its Southern California solar farm into a Fourth of July tableau of the American flag and the Statue of Liberty .
The Google - backed start - up , which is building solar farms for Southern California Edison , P.G.&E. and El Paso Electric , uses software and imaging technology to create a dynamic parabola from tens of thousands of closely packed mirrors , focusing the sun ’s rays on water boilers that sit atop towers .
The intense heat vaporizes the water to create steam that drives an electricity - generating turbine .
As the holiday weekend approached , eSolar ’s software engineers got a bit creative .
“ The programmers have very accurate software control over the field , ” said eSolar ’s chief executive , Bill Gross , in an e-mail message Friday evening .
The company ’s five - megawatt Sierra demonstration power plant northeast of Los Angeles deploys 24,000 mirrors — each one capable of being individually moved by computer .
“ To celebrate Independence Day , ” the company announced at its Web site late last week , “ eSolar ’s Sierra SunTower power plant has employed this high - precision technology to declare energy independence . ”
The display , of course , was designed to show off eSolar ’s technological prowess — and it ’s not the first time the company has deployed the gimmick .
Mr. Gross , the founder of the tech - incubator Idealab , contends that eSolar can deliver electricity cheaper than natural gas by using sophisticated algorithms to control inexpensive and lightweight mirrors called heliostats .
“ The bigger picture here is that we invested like crazy in Moore ’s Law instead of more steel , ” he said , referring to Intel ’s co-founder , Gordon Moore , who famously remarked that computer processing power doubles about every two years .
“ We have such precise control over the field that we can do anything with the mirrors we want , ” Mr. Gross said , “ and this is proof of it . ”

The roots of path tracing are outside of computer graphics , in the Monte Carlo simulations developed for neutron transport .
A great strength of path tracing is that it is conceptually , mathematically , and often - times algorithmically ... more

Coherent Noise for Non-Photorealistic Rendering
Michael Kass , Davide Pesare
July 2011
A wide variety of non-photorealistic rendering techniques make use of random variation in the placement or appearance of primitives .
In order to avoid the " shower - door " effect , this random variation should move with the objects in the scene .
Here we present coherent noise tailored to this purpose .
We compute the coherent ... more

M and M
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ran his re-election campaign against the old clerical elite , charging them with corruption , luxurious living and running the state for their own benefit rather than that of the people .
He particularly targeted Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , an extremely senior leader , and his family .
Indeed , during the demonstrations , Rafsanjani ’s daughter and four other relatives were arrested , held and then released a day later .
Rafsanjani represents the class of clergy that came to power in 1979 .
He served as president from 1989 - 1997 , but Ahmadinejad defeated him in 2005 .
Rafsanjani carries enormous clout within the system as head of the regime ’s two most powerful institutions -- the Expediency Council , which arbitrates between the Guardian Council and parliament , and the Assembly of Experts , whose powers include oversight of the supreme leader .
Forbes has called him one of the wealthiest men in the world .
Rafsanjani , in other words , remains at the heart of the post -1979 Iranian establishment .
Ahmadinejad expressly ran his recent presidential campaign against Rafsanjani , using the latter ’s family ’s vast wealth to discredit Rafsanjani along with many of the senior clerics who dominate the Iranian political scene .
It was not the regime as such that he opposed , but the individuals who currently dominate it .
Ahmadinejad wants to retain the regime , but he wants to repopulate the leadership councils with clerics who share his populist values and want to revive the ascetic foundations of the regime .
The Iranian president constantly contrasts his own modest lifestyle with the opulence of the current religious leadership .
Recognizing the threat Ahmadinejad represented to him personally and to the clerical class he belongs to , Rafsanjani fired back at Ahmadinejad , accusing him of having wrecked the economy .
At his side were other powerful members of the regime , including Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani , who has made no secret of his antipathy toward Ahmadinejad and whose family links to the Shiite holy city of Qom give him substantial leverage .
The underlying issue was about the kind of people who ought to be leading the clerical establishment .
The battlefield was economic : Ahmadinejad ’s charges of financial corruption versus charges of economic mismanagement leveled by Rafsanjani and others .
When Ahmadinejad defeated Mir Hossein Mousavi on the night of the election , the clerical elite saw themselves in serious danger .
The margin of victory Ahmadinejad claimed might have given him the political clout to challenge their position .
Mousavi immediately claimed fraud , and Rafsanjani backed him up .
Whatever the motives of those in the streets , the real action was a knife fight between Ahmadinejad and Rafsanjani .
By the end of the week , Khamenei decided to end the situation .
In essence , he tried to hold things together by ordering the demonstrations to halt while throwing a bone to Rafsanjani and Mousavi by extending a probe into the election irregularities and postponing a partial recount by five days .
The key to understanding the situation in Iran is realizing that the past weeks have seen not an uprising against the regime , but a struggle within the regime .
Ahmadinejad is not part of the establishment , but rather has been struggling against it , accusing it of having betrayed the principles of the Islamic Revolution .
The post-election unrest in Iran therefore was not a matter of a repressive regime suppressing liberals ( as in Prague in 1989 ) , but a struggle between two Islamist factions that are each committed to the regime , but opposed to each other .
The demonstrators certainly included Western - style liberalizing elements , but they also included adherents of senior clerics who wanted to block Ahmadinejad ’s re-election .
And while Ahmadinejad undoubtedly committed electoral fraud to bulk up his numbers , his ability to commit unlimited fraud was blocked , because very powerful people looking for a chance to bring him down were arrayed against him .
The situation is even more complex because it is not simply a fight between Ahmadinejad and the clerics , but also a fight among the clerical elite regarding perks and privileges -- and Ahmadinejad is himself being used within this infighting .
The Iranian president ’s populism suits the interests of clerics who oppose Rafsanjani ; Ahmadinejad is their battering ram .
But as Ahmadinejad increases his power , he could turn on his patrons very quickly .
In short , the political situation in Iran is extremely volatile , just not for the reason that the media portrayed .
Rafsanjani is an extraordinarily powerful figure in the establishment who clearly sees Ahmadinejad and his faction as a mortal threat .
Ahmadinejad ’s ability to survive the unified opposition of the clergy , election or not , is not at all certain .
But the problem is that there is no unified clergy .
The supreme leader is clearly trying to find a new political balance while making it clear that public unrest will not be tolerated .
Removing “ public unrest ” ( i.e. , demonstrations ) from the tool kits of both sides may take away one of Rafsanjani ’s more effective tools .
But ultimately , it actually could benefit him .
Should the internal politics move against the Iranian president , it would be Ahmadinejad -- who has a substantial public following -- who would not be able to have his supporters take to the streets .
The question for the rest of the world is simple :
Does it matter who wins this fight ?
We would argue that the policy differences between Ahmadinejad and Rafsanjani are minimal and probably would not affect Iran ’s foreign relations .
This fight simply is n’t about foreign policy .
Rafsanjani has frequently been held up in the West as a pragmatist who opposes Ahmadinejad ’s radicalism .
Rafsanjani certainly opposes Ahmadinejad and is happy to portray the Iranian president as harmful to Iran , but it is hard to imagine significant shifts in foreign policy if Rafsanjani ’s faction came out on top .
Khamenei has approved Iran ’s foreign policy under Ahmadinejad , and Khamenei works to maintain broad consensus on policies .
Ahmadinejad ’s policies were vetted by Khamenei and the system that Rafsanjani is part of .
It is possible that Rafsanjani secretly harbors different views , but if he does , anyone predicting what these might be is guessing .
Rafsanjani is a pragmatist in the sense that he systematically has accumulated power and wealth .
He seems concerned about the Iranian economy , which is reasonable because he owns a lot of it .
Ahmadinejad ’s entire charge against him is that Rafsanjani is only interested in his own economic well - being .
These political charges notwithstanding , Rafsanjani was part of the 1979 revolution , as were Ahmadinejad and the rest of the political and clerical elite .
It would be a massive mistake to think that any leadership elements have abandoned those principles .
That means that Obama , as the primary player in Iranian foreign affairs , must now define an Iran policy -- particularly given Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak ’s meeting in Washington with U.S. Middle East envoy George Mitchell this Monday .
Obama has said that nothing that has happened in Iran makes dialogue impossible , but opening dialogue is easier said than done .
The Republicans consistently have opposed an opening to Iran ; now they are joined by Democrats , who oppose dialogue with nations they regard as human rights violators .
Obama still has room for maneuver , but it is not clear where he thinks he is maneuvering .
The Iranians have consistently rejected dialogue if it involves any preconditions .
But given the events of the past weeks , and the perceptions about them that have now been locked into the public mind , Obama is n’t going to be able to make many concessions .
The immutable law of unintended consequences , in this case , short - sighted American meddling in Afghanistan , brought us Osama bin-Laden and 9/11 and , worst of all , the Bush - Cheney assault on American democracy .
On one of the plane rides I took recently I watched Charlie Wilson 's War for the first time .
Wilson , a colorful Texas Democrat had flare and verve but he was as utterly clueless about Afghanistan as the prohibitively uncolorful Mike Pence -- who has neither verve nor flare -- is about Iran .
With GOP potential presidential contenders dropping off the face of the map weekly , the narrow - minded , priggish and extraordinarily churlish Pence has tossed his unlikely hat into the ring .
He 's # 3 in the House Republican hierarchy and he embodies the GOP strategy of obstructionism and the " Just Say No " mentality .
He 's even less in tune with what America is looking for in a national leader than John McCain was and his presence in the race will only serve to make a bland and visionless Mitt Romney appear to be a political giant by comparison .
He may appear to have more intellectual heft than Sarah Palin but ... appearances can be very deceptive .
Most Americans have never heard of Mike Pence and they 're not missing much .
But in the last few weeks he made himself a champion of his own disconnected definition of Iranian " freedom , " irresponsibly decrying President Obama 's unwillingness to put an American imprinteur on the dangerous political upheaval in Tehran .
Other than being a thorn in the side of Obama , Pence did n't seen to know quite what he wanted -- unless it was the blood of innocent Iranians flowing in the streets .
A friend of mine stationed in Baghdad turned me on the Stratfor's .
It may occasionally get things wrong but it speaks with a lot more authority than a clown like Mike Pence and a recent edition explained how the real struggle in Iran is very different from what fools like Pence thought they were seeing .
That struggle was never really about us and never really about the liberalization of the detestable theocratic / military dictatorship there .
" Rather , it has been about the role of the clergy -- particularly the old - guard clergy -- in Iranian life , and the future of particular personalities among this clergy . "
It 's ground Mike Pence knows nothing about and has no feel for -- not that that would ever cause him to think before he speaks .
Sounds like just the kind of character someone like Pence , who probably was n't even aware that Rafasanjani was president nor that Mousavi , as prime minister , was no friend of the U.S. by any stretch of the imagination , would get behind -- at least in domestic Indiana politics .
Nor would someone like Pence care .
He 's just a Party of No hack -- in it to make some trouble and to let the chips fall where they may .
Reuters -- as well as other western mass media outlets -- seems to arbitrarily assign political positions to members of the regime .
Ex -President Khatami criticizes the election and , in their world , it makes him a " moderate " and " pro-reform , " just like Hezbollah 's best friend Mousavi .
I do n't expect our dumbed down media to go into any really serious analysis but at least they can just try remembering for a few seconds while they turn out this drivel that the world really is n't as U.S. - centric as they seem to believe it is .
Meanwhile , Stratfor makes 3 overall points : " there was no democratic uprising of any significance in Iran ... there is a major political crisis within the Iranian political elite , the outcome of which probably tilts toward Ahmadinejad but remains uncertain ... there will be no change in the substance of Iran ’s foreign policy , regardless of the outcome of this fight .
The fantasy of a democratic revolution overthrowing the Islamic Republic -- and thus solving everyone ’s foreign policy problems a la the 1991 Soviet collapse -- has passed , " regardless of what bozos like Mike Pence , John McCain and Marco Rubio think .

Playing For Change : One Love
Posted by Pete Berg on Wednesday , July 15th , 2009 at 12:03 am
A few months ago , I posted Playing For Change : Stand By Me , which features artists from all over the world singing different parts of the same song , which are then expertly edited together to make a beautiful international collaboration .
Here is another song from this series , this time covering Bob Marley ’s classic reggae song “ One Love . ”
Below it is a similar video — same concept , same song — but it ’s not with artists around the world … it ’s artists from around Los Angeles .
But considering how multicultural LA is , it ’s actually quite diverse .
See the jaw - dropping first look at Neill Blomkamp 's alien - intolerance movie District 9 .
Including a blurred out ( for their safety ) alien interrogation .
The mockumentary - looking film focuses on the slums we force an unfortunate alien race to live in on Earth , and our not so human response to their presence .
If this film is anything like we 've seen from Blomkamp before it promises to be an incredibly challenging and thought provoking feature , with the visual appeal of producer Peter Jackson .
D9 will be released on August 14 .
Google is putting Linux front and center with its new , in - development operating system .
But will the introduction of its Chrome OS create a new challenger to existing Linux distributions or will it play nice with the community and help grow Linux as a whole ?
That 's just one of the many questions sparked by Google 's formal unveiling of the Chrome OS late Tuesday -- though a public release of the open source licensed operating system is not set until 2010 .
Already , it 's clear that Google 's Chrome OS may be bumping heads with existing operating systems .
For starters , the netbook - and Web- centric OS may overlap with Android , another open source operating system in which Google is invested .
Android may be aimed at smartphones , but it's also garnered interest as a netbook platform .
That could put it into contention with Chrome OS , which will be available for x86 and ARM processors .
For now , at least , open source industry insiders are optimistic , seeing Chrome OS as being most threatening to Microsoft Windows .
" With Linux as the foundation of Chrome , as well as the foundation of other challengers to Microsoft 's desktop OS monopoly , we do see this as very good news , " Amanda McPherson , vice president of marketing and developer programs at the Linux Foundation , told InternetNews.com .
" As more and more people use Linux as the base for their products , Linux gets stronger and stronger . "
A Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) spokesperson declined to comment .
Microsoft is currently in the midst of preparing its own netbook - focused offering -- a low - end version of the upcoming Windows 7 .
For existing Linux vendors , however , Google 's arrival on the OS scene may be more complex , with the backers of various distribution greeting the news with a mixture of concern and cautious optimism .
Joe Brockmeier of Novell 's openSUSE community Linux distribution voiced some concerns about how Google has started off Chrome OS -- without the larger Linux and open source world .
" It 's disappointing that they 've chosen to go it alone this far rather than working with the existing communities , " Brockmeier , who serves as openSUSE 's community manager , told InternetNews.com .
He pointed to the example set by Intel 's Moblin mobile Linux , which was transferred to the Linux Foundation earlier this year in an effort to encourage broader community adoption and participation .
" I think Intel made the right call with Moblin to put the effort in the hands of the Linux Foundation and try to work with the larger community , " he said .
" Maybe Google will ultimately go that route .
It 's hard to tell from the announcement so far . "
Others were more overly positive about the effect Chrome OS could have on overall Linux adoption .
" Open source has proven to be a better model of development and the platform of the future , " a Red Hat spokesperson told InternetNews.com .
" The momentum and interest from leading technology vendors continues to build .
We look forward to seeing how this project will progress . "
Red Hat may be able to better afford such a stance :
While it does have desktop aspirations , it is not as actively engaged in the netbook space as are other Linux vendors -- like Novell 's SUSE Linux and Canonical 's Ubuntu .
Gerry Carr , platform marketing manager at Canonical , downplayed the news , telling InternetNews.com that , at this point , all Google has delivered is a blog post stating its intent -- and as a result , it 's too early to speculate on how the competitive landscape will shape up .
" I think we would rather focus on a new entrant bringing a bunch of energy to the open source space and validating the choice of Linux for developing new operating systems that will replace legacy Windows , " Carr said .
" But by whom and how that Linux choice will be delivered is predicting the future with little data -- not something that is smart to do . "

JOHANNESBURG , South Africa ( CNN ) --
An undersea cable plugging east Africa into high speed Internet access went live Thursday , providing an alternative to expensive satellite connections .
The cable links southern Africa to Europe and Asia . more photos »
SEACOM , the cable provider company , opened its 17,000 kilometer submarine cable , capable of 1.28 terabytes per second , allowing the region true connectivity .
Most Africans rely on expensive and slow satellite connections , which make the use of applications such as YouTube and Facebook extremely trying .
" This is going to reduce the cost of doing business in Africa , within Africa and with international parties " said Suveer Ramdhani , SEACOM spokesman in South Africa .
" The cable is as thin as a hair strand , and in one second it can download the same amount of data that 160 people use in a month . "
SEACOM , privately funded and 75 percent African owned , will provide retail carriers with open source access to inexpensive bandwidth .
It has taken less than three years to complete the mammoth project , providing landing stations at South Africa , Kenya , Madagascar and other points along the east coast of Africa .
But telecoms analyst James Hodge said that some of the more ambitious hopes for the system -- such as impacting the continent 's socioeconomic problems -- will be long - term , and that initially it will be those already connected who will see the benefits .
The launch was delayed by a month because of increased activity by pirates along parts of the African coast .
Security teams were beefed up to protect the slow moving cable layers .
Neotel , a South African communications network operator , is the largest SEACOM customer in South Africa and is the country 's landing partner , providing both the coastal landing station and Johannesburg data center for the submarine cable .
Neotel managing director Ajay Pandey is excited about the opportunities for growth presented by the SEACOM cable .
" With this cable coming in , the pipe size opens up , so more and more people are able to get faster and better connectivity , hopefully at a lower price .
It ca n't be more expensive than what it is today . "
SEACOM Chief Executive Officer Brian Herlihy added : " Turning the switch ' on ' creates a huge anticipation , but ultimately , SEACOM will be judged on the changes that take place on the continent over the coming years . "
South Africa has been hobbled by high costs and extremely slow bandwidth , effectively keeping the country on an information back road rather then the superhighway .
There is much anticipation and hope that the cable will ensure Africa keeps up with the developed world in Internet connectivity , providing greater speed , flexibility and , potentially , a complete socioeconomic transformation .
Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete said in his opening address : " It 's the ultimate embodiment of modernity . "
His speech was beamed via SEACOM from a launch in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , to the simultaneous launch in Johannesburg , South Africa .

In time the 2008 - 09 season will come to be viewed as an added extra to Cristiano Ronaldo 's Manchester United career , a hastily agreed option that did not really work out to the entire satisfaction of any of the parties concerned and a contractual obligation that merely delayed the inevitable .
Knowing what we know now , Ronaldo might have been better packing his bags and his Champions League winner 's medal at the end of last season and leaving United wanting more .
He might even have commanded a higher sum 12 months ago , before the credit crunch kicked in , and he would have found himself the centre of attention as the only galáctico at the Bernabéu instead of having to share top billing with Kaka .
From United 's point of view a record - breaking £ 80 m represents good business for a player who clearly wanted to leave .
It does not matter what Ronaldo might have gone on to achieve with United , how difficult it will be to replace him or what it actually says on his contract .
Once a player has indicated he would rather be somewhere else it is time to stop talking legalese and start talking money .
United did well to resist Ronaldo 's attempts to leave last summer , but apart from the two stunning long - range strikes that propelled the team into a second successive Champions League final , they did not enjoy the same sort of enthusiasm and input from a player who finished the previous season with 42 goals .
Ronaldo still managed to weigh in with a far from insignificant 26 goals in the season just ended , but it was obvious a parting of the ways would come sooner rather than later and noticeable that Sir Alex Ferguson stopped bristling with defiance whenever the subject of Real Madrid was raised and instead simply claimed he was tired of discussing the matter .
At 24 , Ronaldo arguably has his best years ahead of him , although it remains to be seen whether Real Madrid get as much out of him as Manchester United .
They will not be getting the same value for money , for a start .
The £ 12 m United paid in 2003 looks trifling when set against the trophies , goals and moments of individual brilliance that lit up his six years at Old Trafford , and though a certain petulance and willingness to fall over in search of free - kicks could be entered in the debit side of the ledger , there is no doubt United fans greatly enjoyed watching a precocious teenager grow up to be a world - beater .
One hopes , quite literally , that Ronaldo can keep his feet on the ground in Madrid .
He has the talent and the temperament for the Bernabéu , although one suspects if things ever start to go wrong they could go wrong quite badly .
One thing Ronaldo is going to have to get used to straight away is more meetings , and more relentless comparisons , with Barcelona 's Lionel Messi .
The pair have been rivals in the World Player of the Year and Ballon D'Or stakes for the past few seasons with Ronaldo pipping Messi to the awards this season , although there was no doubt the Barcelona player won hands down in the head - to - head contest that was the Champions League final .
If that trend continues in La Liga next season , Ronaldo is going to have to prove he can live up to his reputation and his transfer tag .
As for United , they have £ 80 m in the kitty after losing a player they always knew they were going to lose .
It is a bit like the George Best scenario but with a world - record transfer fee as compensation .
Although Best spent 11 seasons with United , only nine of them could be described as full seasons .
Ronaldo gave United six full seasons , took them to three league titles and two European Cup finals and left for £ 80 m .
It 's good business all round , assuming United can source another tricky winger with the whole of the world to choose from .
The only nagging doubt is that unlike Best , Ronaldo has plenty of time left to come back and haunt them .
He is not going to turn up at Dunstable Town , Stockport County or Fulham , after all .
If Real Madrid get their act together quickly , with Ronaldo and Kaka linking up , there could soon be two Spanish teams blocking United 's path to another European Cup .
Checks on who is buying a knife need to be more rigorous , say campaigners Children 's charities are backing a plan to make web retailers ensure young people cannot buy age - restricted goods .
A private members bill going through the House of Lords is calling for it to be mandatory for web retailers to adopt age verification systems .
The bill on age - checking has the backing of charities who say it is too easy for children to buy alcohol , knives and violent video games online .
A check on twelve sites found that thorough checks were not being done .
No tests The Online Purchasing of Goods and Services ( Age Verification ) Bill has been proposed by Baroness Massey and calls for " robust " checking systems to be used by any site selling age - restricted goods .
These systems should go further than just making customers tick a box , it said .
The age - checking systems would have to be used if one of 20 separate products were sold including knives , alcohol , tobacco , age - restricted video games and DVDs , solvents and spray paints .
Trading standards officers from Greenwich Council carried out tests on a number of websites to check their age verification processes .
In a supervised test , a 16 - year - old bought pre-paid credit cards and then went online to see if he could buy age - restricted goods with it .
The credit card was registered with the minor 's real date of birth and address .
The teenager managed to buy knives , drink , and 18 - rated DVDs and games from 12 separate online retailers .
Oddbins , one of the sites visited , said it was aware of the tests and that it welcomed the second reading of Baroness Massey 's bill .
" We do take this matter seriously and are investigating procedures that may assist us in ensuring that sales of alcohol are to over 18s only , " added a spokesperson .
Debenhams , which sold knives to the teenager , said it had a " very clear policy " on the issue of selling knives online .
" Customers who visit Debenhams ' website pages where knives are for sale are made aware that these are age - restricted products and should therefore only purchase them if they are over 18 , " it said in a statement .
" Debenhams would never knowingly sell knives to anyone under the age of 18 years old , " it added .
Only three of the retailers asked for the teenager to confirm his age at the time of purchase .
He got round these by lying about his age .
The other sites simply said that buying the goods was a declaration that he was the right age to buy them .
Few sites asked buyers to prove their age , found a study " Although a small sample , our findings from this operation seem to show the danger to which young people can be exposed on the internet , " said councillor Maureen O'Mara , Greenwich Council 's cabinet member for neighbourhood services , in a statement .
Greenwich Council has written to all the web firms involved in the test .
" Retailers ' increasingly successful efforts to control the sale of age restricted products over the counter on the High Street are being seriously undermined by their failure to take similarly effective steps to limit sales of exactly the same items on the internet , " said Zoe Hilton , a policy advisor for the NSPCC speaking on behalf of the Children 's Charities Coalition on Internet Safety .
The Coalition , which includes Barnardo's , the National Children 's Bureau and Action for Children , said a precedent on age - verification systems had already been set with gambling sites .

The government has set a secret target to reduce illegal filesharing of music and films by up to 80 % over the next three years , MediaGuardian.co.uk can reveal .
The goal was outlined in a letter by Baroness Vadera , the business minister , relating to the agreement the government struck with internet service providers and the film and music industries to curb illegal filesharing .
The leaked letter , dated July 22 , was sent to all the proposed signatories of the memorandum of understanding which proposes to " significantly reduce " illegal filesharing in the next two to three years .
" Although this letter has no effect on the agreement , which stands in its own terms , this may help to ensure all signatories have the same expectations , " Vadera wrote .
" I would regard a reduction as ' significant ' if it had reduced the number of people filesharing unlawfully in the UK by well over 50 % , and we hope in the region of 70 % - 80 % from a baseline to be agreed , with work to start immediately , rather than waiting for legislation . "
But Vadera 's target did not form part of the memorandum of understanding , released yesterday and other parties to the agreement have not signed up to it .
Industry estimates put the number of illegal filesharers in the UK at between 6 and 7 million people .
" Success will significantly depend on the effectiveness of the letter writing , awareness raising and other measures , " Vadera adds .
Part of the memorandum requires the UK's six biggest ISPs - BSkyB , Tiscali , BT , Orange , Virgin Media and Carphone Warehouse - to send out 1,000 letters a week to subscribers identified as having engaged in illegal uploading or downloading of music .
Following the three - month trial , media regulator Ofcom will agree an " escalation " in the number of letters and broaden the campaign to target other content being illegally shared , such as films .
Ofcom will look to use other measures to deal with repeat offenders , including slowing internet speeds or blocking content .
Rights holders will consider prosecuting " particularly serious infringers " .
Some analysts are sceptical that the government 's goal can be achieved without heavy measures being introduced .
" I think trimming off a million filesharers from the total number in the UK would be a great measure of success for this letter campaign , but even that would be an unprecedented success in tackling global file sharing , " said Mark Mulligan , a vice - president at analysts Jupiter Research .
" In the US , where the Recording Industry Association of America has been very aggressive , the result has predominately been one of containment . "
The BPI , the body that represents record labels , is keen on a three - step procedure to tackle illegal filesharers .
First , an " educational " letter would be sent to customers explaining the account abuse .
If a customer was identified a second time , their account would be suspended until an undertaking promising no more illegal use was signed .
A third breach would result in cancellation of their internet account .

From the way the U.S. media talk about the boom in Mandarin classes , it ’s easy to get the impression that Mandarin is about to become the most studied language in the United States .
So I offer the following overdue reality check .
The data come from the results of a large survey of foreign - language enrollments in U.S. post - secondary schools .
The survey was conducted by the Modern Language Association .
I started work on this post when the results were released in November 2007 ; but , well , I got distracted .
This post has lots of tables and figures , so for those who do n’t want to scan through everything I offer some basic points up front .
Spanish has more enrollments than all other foreign languages put together .
By far the biggest enrollment boom since 1990 has not been for Mandarin but for American Sign Language .
The boom in enrollments in Arabic also surpasses that for Mandarin .
Mandarin is indeed growing in popularity — but in recent years only at the undergraduate level .
Japanese continues to be more popular than Mandarin , though by an ever - smaller margin .
Mandarin is the seventh most studied foreign language in U.S. post - secondary schools , behind Spanish ( which leads Mandarin by a ratio of 16:1 ) , French , German , American Sign Language , Italian , and Japanese .
Relatively speaking , enrollments in foreign languages are much lower than they were 30 years ago .
A few summary remarks of my own :
I do n’t expect the high growth rates for Mandarin to continue for many more years unless the programs are dumbed down ( in which case they would n’t count for much ) or Pinyin gains a much more prominent role in Mandarin pedagogy ( and not just at the introductory level ) .
The difficulties of Chinese characters will help keep numbers down , as will the eventual realization that learning Mandarin is n’t an easy ticket to riches ( or even a ticket to riches at all ) .
Japanese received a big boost in the 1980s , when the media cranked out story after story about the power of Japan ’s rising economy and the need to learn the language .
Yet Japanese did n’t become the next big world language .
I predict a similar path for Mandarin .
A high percentage of those taking Mandarin classes in U.S. high schools are students who are both ethnically Chinese and already familiar with the language .
The MLA did n’t provide figures on that for post - secondary students .
But I would be surprised if such “ heritage ” students do n’t represent a higher percentage of those in Mandarin language courses than heritage students in most other language classes .
OK , now on to some details .
Look below at the growth for American Sign Language since 1990 .
If Mandarin had had that sort of growth ( 4,820 percent ! ) the pundits would no doubt be telling us that the Chinese had already taken over the planet and were going to rule the entire galaxy within the next decade .
( And do n’t get me started about the supposed Mandarin in Serenity / Firefly . )
But American Sign Language just does n’t seem to get the same sort of respect , despite the fact that it still has more than 50 percent more enrollments than Mandarin .
Arabic , which has also had a much faster growth rate than that of Mandarin , has n’t received the same level of hype either .

One thing I find particularly troubling is that the number of graduate students studying Mandarin has fallen .
( Please click on the link in the previous sentence , since the relevant table is too wide to fit on this page . )
The much - ballyhooed but also much - deserved increase in students studying Mandarin has all been at the undergraduate level .
Given that the grad enrollment as a percentage of total enrollment for Mandarin is about the same as that for French ( 2.63 percent and 2.73 percent , respectively ) it might appear that Mandarin has simply reached a “ normal ” ratio in this regard .
But native speakers of English generally need much more time to master Mandarin than to master French .
Simply put , four years , say , of post - secondary study of French provides students with a much greater level of fluency than four years of post - secondary study of Mandarin .
Also , there is a great deal more work that needs to be done in terms of translations from Mandarin .
I do not at all mean to belittle the work being done in French — or in any other language .
In fact it pains me that the MLA ’s list of languages being studied included neither Old French nor Provençal , both of which I have studied and love dearly .
I just mean that Mandarin has historically been underrepresented in U.S. universities given the number of speakers it has and its body of texts that have not yet been translated into English .
U.S. universities need to be producing many more qualified grad students who can handle this specialized work .
And right now , unfortunately , that ’s not happening .

The figures in the table above are probably too low .
Literary Sinitic ( “ classical Chinese ” ) is probably especially underrepresented because often too little differentiation is given between it and modern standard Mandarin .
But at least the numbers can provide minimum figures .
Enrollments in Introductory Classes : 2 - Year Schools vs. 4 - Year Schools
Language Ratio of Intro Enr. in 2 - Year Schools to Intro Enr. in 4 - Year Schools Greek , Ancient 0.00:1 Hebrew , Biblical 0.01:1 Latin 0.04:1 Hebrew , Modern 0.07:1 Portuguese 0.11:1 Russian 0.15:1 German 0.20:1 Italian 0.23:1 French 0.24:1 Arabic 0.26:1 Mandarin 0.26:1 Korean 0.28:1 Japanese 0.39:1 Spanish 0.49:1 American Sign Language 1.47:1
Other languages 0.24:1
American Sign Language sticks out here as the only language that more people take at the introductory level at junior colleges than at universities .
Roughly twice as many people take introductory Spanish in universities as at junior colleges .
Introductory Japanese classes are surprisingly popular at the two - year college level , well above the level for introductory Mandarin , though Mandarin is not unpopular itself .

Although more U.S. postsecondary students are studying languages other than English than ever before , that ’s unfortunately not because U.S. students as a whole have finally embraced the study of languages .
Rather , there are simply more students now .
Relatively speaking , enrollments in foreign languages are much lower than they were 30 years ago .
If “ ancient ” foreign languages such as Latin and Ancient Greek were included in the graph , the imbalance between the 1960s and the present in foreign - language enrollments would be even greater .

If you are seeking a blue morpho butterfly , one of the world 's most spectacular and brilliantly - coloured rainforest creatures , you would n't normally head for St Albans .
But that is about to change .
Out there in the depths of Hertfordshire , where the background noise is not monkey screeches but the humming of traffic on the M25 , London 's orbital motorway , blue morphos have begun to flap their flashing sapphire wings , as the world 's biggest walk - through butterfly house takes shape .
Other extravagantly beautiful species are flitting around them , but are only a taste of what is to come with the Butterfly World project , the first stage of which was launched yesterday .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
When completed in 2012 , the £ 27 m visitor attraction in the countryside north of London will feature 10,000 brightly coloured tropical butterflies and moths , as well as other insects and hummingbirds , all flying free in an imitation rainforest under a 300 ft - wide , 60 ft - high transparent dome .
The giant " biome " has strong echoes of the Eden Project in Cornwall , and Butterfly World 's developers hope it can repeat the Eden Project 's success and pull in more than a million visitors a year .
But it is also receiving enthusiastic backing from conservationists , led by Sir David Attenborough , who hope it will focus attention on the plight of butterflies , key indicators of the health of the environment , which are in decline .
Yesterday the actress Emilia Fox , one of Butterfly World 's patrons , launched the initial phase of the scheme , a butterfly - themed garden festival called Future Gardens , which will last through the summer .
There is also a smaller - scale walk - through butterfly house , where visitors can find themselves becoming a perch for some of the world 's most spectacular insects , such as the blue morpho from Central America , or the scarlet swallowtail from the Philippines .
The botanist David Bellamy , another of Butterfly World 's patrons , found himself with a blue morpho on his nose , while the project 's founder , Clive Farrell , found his own nose being decorated by a huge tree nymph butterfly from Malaysia .
Mr Farrell conceived the idea in 1979 with an exhibit in Syon Park , west London , and has since gone on to open similar butterfly houses in Stratford - upon - Avon , Switzerland and Florida .
At the moment the centre of the biome floor is decorated with an enormous image of one of Britain 's best - known butterflies , the large white , made up of chalk .
Walking around it I was pleased to see a real large white , fluttering over its edge .
Later , examining the gardens designed to attract British butterflies , which will be an essential part of the complex , I spotted a painted lady , one of our most beautiful species .
" I hope this will make people think about how we can bring back the wildlife we have lost , " Dr Bellamy said .

CORONA , Calif .  Mary Thompson , an inmate at the California Institution for Women here , was convicted of two felonies for a robbery spree in which she threatened victims with a knife .
Her third felony under California ’s three - strikes law was the theft of three tracksuits to pay for her crack cocaine habit in 1982 .
Like one out of five prisoners in California , and nearly 10 percent of all prisoners nationally in 2008 , Ms. Thompson is serving a life sentence .
She will be eligible for parole by 2020 .
More prisoners today are serving life terms than ever before  140,610 out of 2.3 million inmates being held in jails and prisons across the country  under tough mandatory minimum - sentencing laws and the declining use of parole for eligible convicts , according to a report released Wednesday by the Sentencing Project , a group that calls for the elimination of life sentences without parole .
The report tracks the increase in life sentences from 1984 , when the number of inmates serving life terms was 34,000 .
Two - thirds of prisoners serving life sentences are Latino or black , the report found .
In New York State , for example , 16.3 percent of prisoners serving life terms are white .
A new study finds that in sharp contrast to the overall declining rates of colorectal cancer in the United States , incidence rates among adults younger than age 50 years are increasing .
The authors theorize that these increases may be related to rising rates of obesity and changes in dietary patterns , including increased consumption of fast food .
The study , which appears in the June 2009 issue of Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention , says further studies are necessary to elucidate causes for this trend and to identify potential prevention and early detection strategies .
Overall incidence rates for colorectal cancer in the United States have been on the decline since the mid-1980s , with the drop accelerating in the most recent time period .
Rates are now dropping 2.8 percent per year in men and 2.2 percent per year in women , largely due to an increase in screening , particularly colonoscopy , among individuals ages 50 years and older .
Screening can reduce colorectal cancer incidence by detecting and removing polyps before they become cancerous .
But recent incidence trends among adults younger than 50 years , for whom routine screening is not recommended , have not been analyzed thoroughly .
A previous study did find an increase in incidence from 1973 to 1999 for all races combined , but that study did not include 40 to 49 year - olds , who represent 73 percent of colorectal cancer patients under age 50 .
In a new analysis , American Cancer Society researchers led by Rebecca L. Siegel , M.P.H. , looked at trends in colorectal cancer incidence rates between 1992 and 2005 among young adults ( ages 20 to 49 ) by sex , race / ethnicity , age , stage at diagnosis , and anatomic subsite .
The study found that among individuals ages 20 to 49 , incidence rates of colorectal cancer increased 1.5 percent per year in men and 1.6 percent per year in women from 1992 to 2005 .
Among non-Hispanic
Whites , rates increased for both men and women in each 10 - year age grouping ( 20 - 29 , 30 - 39 , and 40 - 49 years ) and for every stage of diagnosis .
They found the largest annual percent increase in colorectal cancer incidence was in the youngest age group ( 20 - 29 years ) , in whom incidence rates rose by 5.2 % per year in men and 5.6 % per year in women .
They say the rises are due to an increase in left - sided tumors , particularly in the rectum .
The researchers address several possibilities for the rise , including rising rates of obesity , which is a major risk factor for colorectal cancer .
Dietary factors may also come into play .
The researchers note that between the late 1970s and the mid-1990s , fast - food consumption in the United States increased 5 - fold among children and 3 - fold among adults .
A diet high in fast food is associated with both greater meat consumption and reduced milk consumption .
Increased consumption of red and processed meat has been shown to increase risk of cancers of the distal colon and rectum , while milk and calcium consumption have shown a protective effect against the subsites in which the rise in incidence was most prominent .
They say it is plausible that the emergence of unfavorable dietary patterns in children and young adults over the past three decades may have contributed to the increase in CRC among young adults observed in the study .
The authors conclude : " The disparate increase in left - sided CRC suggests that particular attention be given to studies to elucidate the behavioral and environmental risk factors responsible for this trend and potential prevention and early detection strategies . "

I have always believed that extracurricular activities in high schools are a good thing .
A varied offering of sports , band , cheerleading , drama clubs , debate teams , Beta Club and other such activities gives every student a place where he or she can fit in .
These activities also teach a lot of qualities not otherwise taught in high schools .
In some cases , I believe , students who might be prone to dropping out of school do n't because of these activities .
Most of these programs require that a student maintain a minimum grade - point average to participate .
The Alabama High School Athletic Association is currently considering the addition of competitive bass fishing to the list of sanctioned sports in Alabama high schools .
That is definitely out of the box thinking and it borders on brilliance .
I believe even the AHSAA would be shocked by the acceptance should it become a reality .
The AHSAA has a process that it must go through to make competitive bass fishing a championship sport in this state .
That process would end with 10 percent of its member schools signing up to participate .
The final hurdle would not be a problem , I assure you .
The unspoken truth is that it will take money to make high school bass fishing a sport in Alabama .
There 's a short supply of it in these tough economic times .
Regardless , I called Jerry deBin , the director of outdoor marketing for Academy Sports and Outdoors , at the company 's headquarters in Katy , Texas .
I told the former Alabama resident of the possibility of bass fishing becoming a high school sport in his former state .
He thought it was one of the greatest ideas he had ever heard .
" We will watch this closely , " he said .
" I believe it would be something we 'd definitely be interested in .
I think it 's something the whole fishing industry would be interested in . "
I think it 's safe to assume that every high school in Alabama has a number of students with parents who own bass boats .
I know bass fishermen and bass clubs well enough to know that they will be slobbering at the mouth to participate as soon as they learn that high school bass fishing is even a possibility .
What would it cost the cash - strapped high schools ?
Absolutely nothing .
Should it become a reality , they would have volunteer coaches waiting in line .
Illinois this year became the first state to offer bass fishing on the high school level .
A total of 198 of the 700 high schools in that state participated in the inaugural season .
This upcoming school year , more than 400 of the high schools have signed up .
I believe the interest would be even higher in Alabama .
On top of that , the sport could become a money - maker for the AHSAA .
Imagine cities such as Birmingham , Gadsden , Eufaula and Guntersville bidding for the right to host the state championship .
Imagine boat manufacturers , lure companies and rod manufacturers signing on as sponsors .
Should the AHSAA not get on board , I suspect that high school bass fishing competition will be a reality anyway .
Advocates for such a program in this state have a back - up plan that would create high school bass fishing on a club level , as Illinois did .
That would be fine , I suppose , but the AHSAA would give the program instant credibility .
The AHSAA is currently studying the addition of " emerging sports . "
I do n't know what other sports are being considered but I assure you they pale in comparison to the popularity of bass fishing in this state .

The City of Vancouver will move as quickly as possible to adopt prevailing open standards for data , documents , maps and other formats of media .
The City of Vancouver will move as quickly as possible to adopt prevailing open standards for data , documents , maps and other formats of media .
Open source software : The City of Vancouver , when replacing existing software or considering new applications , will place open source software on an equal footing with commercial systems during procurement cycles .
" So it 's great , " said Andrea Reimer , the city councillor who proposed the motion that passed Thursday afternoon .
" The local online community was all very , very happy , and now we just have to look forward on implementation and figuring sort of the order with which we do that . "
Reimer had argued that supporting the motion would allow the city to improve transparency , cut costs and enable people to use the data to create new useful products , including commercial ones .
She had also noted that taxpayers paid for the data to be collected in the first place .
The motion , which specifies that the city will respect security and privacy concerns while supporting openness , went through as proposed , Reimer said , even though one councillor did try to " water it down " and voted against parts of the motion .
About 15 members of the public signed up to speak about the motion .
All who spoke were in favour , Reimer said .
" The only sort of negative [ comment ] was ' Ca n't you go further ?
Ca n't you do more ? ' "
She added that some felt open - source software should be favoured , rather than just be put on equal footing with proprietary software .
" But I think the city would want to know how it works first before it jumps into that . "
Some immediate changes likely : Reimer
She added that many city staff are excited about the policy , as they had tried to implement more openness in some areas before , but did n't have a policy framework to work from .
She expects staff to report back on an implementation plan in the fall , but thinks some changes will begin to happen immediately .
For example , she said , videos made at city hall , including videos of council meetings , are currently in a proprietary format that cannot be posted on YouTube .
They can only be viewed on the City of Vancouver website by people who have the latest version of Microsoft Internet Explorer .
She expects that to change .
" They 're tiny little things , but they have so much ripple effect in the community , " she said .
" There 's probably a few more thousand people that we could be talking to out there if we could send them videos [ instead of written material . ] "
According to Reimer , only a few other cities such as Washington , D.C. , San Francisco and Toronto have started moving toward this kind of increased openness .
As far as implementation goes , the motion suggested that Vancouver 's city manager be asked to :
Identify immediate opportunities to distribute more of its data .
Index , publish and syndicate its data to the internet using prevailing open standards , interfaces and formats .
Develop a plan to digitize and distribute archival data to the public .
Ensure that data supplied to the city by third parties such as developers , contractors and consultants are unlicensed , in a prevailing open standard format , and not copyrighted except if otherwise prevented by legal considerations .
License any software applications developed by the City of Vancouver such that they may be used by other municipalities , businesses and the public without restriction .
The motion also proposes that Vancouver develop a plan to share its information with the Integrated Cadastral Information Society ( ICIS ) .
The non-profit group already shares mapping information among the B.C. provincial government , utilities and municipalities .
Vancouver is " one of a few " cities in the province that is not a member of ICIS , Reimer said .
The motion also suggests that ICIS be encouraged to share its data with the public .

Excerpt :
' WASHINGTON — Both boys and girls are doing better in school , so there 's no reason to fear that school systems favor girls at boys ' expense , a women 's advocacy group says in a study to be released today .
It 's the freshest argument in the boys vs. girls debate in education , one in which the group , the American Association of University Women ( AAUW ) , has been a major player .
Having said in an influential 1992 study that the education system worked against girls , it now argues that the real crisis is racial and economic disparities , not gender .
" The mythology of the boy crisis continues to be influential , " said Catherine Hill , the association 's director of research .
One reason , she added , is that " people feel uncomfortable with the success of girls and women . " '
Marshall told police in ’07 that he “ hated Denver ”
During an arrest in October of 2007 for suspicion of DUI , Broncos receiver Brandon Marshall reportedly told police that he hated Denver and that he hoped that the team would trade him .
“ I hate Denver .
I hope I get traded .
I hate this f******* city , ” an officer wrote in the police report .
The report was only made public after CALL7 Investigators asked for it , after receiving a tip about the report ’s content .
Read full report — WARNING : Graphic Language
“ What we know about Brandon Marshall is he is a supremely talented football player on the field with the habit of getting in trouble off the field , ” said Adam Schefter , NFL correspondent for ESPN .
The information is particularly relevant because Marshall has recently asked for a trade .
“ I think that we ’ve known Brandon Marshall is interested in a change of scenery , and I think these comments show that that change of scenery is probably not very new in his thinking its something that dates back to his arrest , ” Schefter said .
“ These are some deep - seated feelings that came out during this incident and now they have come to light . ”
Marshall also berated police for stopping him and not finding the killer of fellow Bronco Darrent Williams .
“ Why are n’t you guys out looking for Williams ’ killer ? ” the report says .
Marshall ’s situation in Denver just went from a player who is frustrated over his contract , to a player that has wanted out for some time and will stop at nothing to do so .
He may be upset about the fact that his entering the final year of his rookie contract and the way the team ’s doctors handled his hip injury , but the real crux of the issue is that he just wants out .
Yesterday , ESPN.com reported that the Broncos were going to stand firm and not trade Marshall .
They do n’t want to set a precedent where whenever a player demands a trade , they give in a la Jay Culter .
But they ’re dealing with an extremely disgruntled receiver right now and chances are that if he wants out , he ’s going to be willing to sit out training camp and push Denver into a tight corner .
One of the best catches I 've seen .
Sri Lanka : view from the ground
Even those Sri Lankans , including Tamils , who were dubious about their government ’s decision to pursue the military option against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , are relieved that the venture appears successful .
They also are surprised at the reaction to the victory by nations such as the US , the UK , India and Israel , and the sharp criticism about civilian casualties and displaced people .
From Sri Lanka , it feels as if the Tamil diaspora in the UK , Canada , US and Australia has overly influenced the media in those places .
People in the West seem to believe that all Sri Lankan Tamils were confined to a narrow strip of beach under shellfire from government troops , and are now herded into concentration camps .
I do not wish to downplay the suffering of those in the north , but the reality is that Tamils are spread throughout Sri Lanka and many are prosperous and influential .
A distinguished Tamil journalist based in Canada , DB Jeyaraj , wrote : “ The Tamils need to remind themselves that the LTTE , despite its prolonged campaign , has ultimately achieved nothing for the Tamil people .
If the LTTE had converted the military strength it once enjoyed into bargaining power at the negotiating table , the Sri Lankan Tamils would have been much better off .
It did not and in the process has brought misery and despair to the Tamil people . ”
Dr Noel Nadesan , editor of Uthayam , a Tamil newspaper in Australia , wrote : “ The Sri Lankan president deserves the congratulations of all Sri Lankans regardless of their ethnicity .
More than any other community , the Sri Lankan Tamils owe him their thanks for ending their misery . ”
As a Tamil blogger remarked : “ I hold no brief for the Sri Lankan government which , unfortunately , is growing more despotic by the day ” , but he wondered why Sri Lanka should have agreed to a ceasefire when it had the Tiger leader trapped ; it was unlikely that , in similar circumstances , the US would let Osama bin Laden escape .
Hillary Clinton has criticised Sri Lanka for being too tough on the Tamil Tigers — and Pakistan for not being tough enough on the Taliban .
( In Swat there are up to two million displaced civilians .
There is a shortfall in humanitarian aid and NGOs are pulling out . )
The current Indian government promotes reconciliation and a just settlement for Sri Lankan Tamils .
Memories of India ’s previous interventions are still acute in Sri Lanka .
Indira Gandhi ’s government funded and armed Sri Lankan terrorists , including the LTTE .
In 1987 an Indian Peace Keeping Force ( IPKF ) tried and failed to disarm the LTTE .
Tamil sources asserted that more than half of the victims of the IPKF 1987 offensive were Tamil civilians and Brigadier Manjit Singh admitted : “ We could not differentiate between the LTTE and the civilians . ”
In October 1987 Indian troops stormed into Jaffna hospital , throwing grenades and firing , killing 70 doctors , staff and patients .
Michael Roberts , a Sri Lankan historian , argues that the Sri Lankan army had similar problems recently , noting that “ the category ‘ civilian ’ is an ambiguous category ” , because the LTTE command - state integrated civilians into the front line .
Roberts makes a comparison with the end of the second world war , when the Allies insisted on unconditional surrender and carpet bombed civilians ( and exploded the atomic bomb ) to attain that goal .
The Sri Lankan government was taken by surprise when Israel , in spite of or because of , its actions in Gaza , accused Sri Lanka of indiscriminate military action and violations of human rights in fighting LTTE terrorism .
Israel supplied military hardware and expertise which were probably significant factors in the LTTE ’s defeat .
The writer and journalist Neil Ascherson has written about the way the British delude themselves that they built and divested themselves of their empire in a decent fashion , although , in fact , “ In the detention and work camps , and the resettlement villages , the British created a world no better than the universe of the Soviet Gulag . ”
The British foreign secretary , David Miliband , was involved during a recent visit to Colombo in a shouting match with Sri Lanka ’s defence supremo , Gotabhaya Rajapakse , who felt it necessary to remind Miliband that Sri Lanka was no longer a British colony .
Miliband has been complicit in US rendition and torture and Britain continues to allow the US to use the British colony of Diego Garcia , from which it expelled the inhabitants , for those purposes .
A recent report by Philip Alston , UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions , found that accountability in the US has been “ deplorable ” ; few would doubt that the US has killed civilians and used torture in Iraq .
In Britain , Miliband proposes that an inquiry into the UK ’s involvement in Iraq be held in secret , but Air Marshal Sir John Walker , the former head of Defence Intelligence , said : “ There is only one reason that the inquiry is being heard in private and that is to protect past and present members of this government .
There are 179 reasons [ 179 dead soldiers ] why the military want the truth to be out on what happened over Iraq . ”
Major General Julian
Thompson said that the military wanted to be heard in public “ the allegation that a British government manipulated intelligence to take part in an illegal war . ”
Dayan Jayatilleka , Sri Lankan ambassador to the UN has said : “ Sri Lanka is not the case of an army of occupation invading and occupying another country .
Sri Lanka ’s army is a military that serves a constitutional democracy , a military that fought a war strictly within its recognised borders against a separatist , terrorist militia , with whom the state had tried to arrive at a peaceful settlement on numerous occasions .
Therefore , we will not have forced upon us formulae and paradigms derived from entirely different contexts . ”
Because those accusing Sri Lanka of war crimes are not free of guilt themselves , should the issue of war crimes in Sri Lanka be ignored ?
Some would argue that a full investigation of war crimes would be a distraction from the reconciliation process ; others argue that reconciliation is impossible if war crimes are not investigated ( perhaps more bitterness is felt among the diaspora than among Tamils in Sri Lanka ) .
The reconciliation process in countries such as South Africa , Rwanda , Chile and Northern Ireland have been cited .
There is no doubt that Sri Lankan Tamils have suffered discrimination and there has , in the past , been horrific anti-Tamil violence .
Nevertheless , Sri Lanka is not an apartheid society like South Africa , Palestine or even Louisiana .
The government was fighting terrorists , not trying to wipe out the Tamil population .
In Sri Lanka a democratically - elected government increased its popularity with voters by overthrowing a de facto unelected , totalitarian military dictatorship in part of its internationally recognised sovereign territory , and intends to restore democracy to that area .
In Northern Ireland peace was achieved through long negotiations when both sides became exhausted and accepted that neither could win .
The IRA gave up its arms and put its goal of a united Ireland in abeyance .
The LTTE went into any “ negotiation ” with an uncompromising demand for a separate state of Tamil Eelam .
There are arguments that the government must blame itself because of inept PR and censorship .
Certainly , the news has been manipulated under the cover of “ prevention of terrorism ” and press freedom will continue to be threatened .
Anti-terrorism laws ( perhaps not as draconian as in the UK or US ) remain in place and many investigations into attacks on the media remain unresolved .
President Rajapakse ’s reputation is high with the Sinhalese majority and he should now have the political capital to reach out for the hearts and minds of the Tamil community and bring them within a unified nation without fear of backlash .
It is to be hoped that other governments and the international media will help the nationbuilding by supporting reconciliation , rehabilitation and reconstruction .
In any debate there are particular key arguments that are used to undermine the opponent .
A debate as heated as that over the importance , or not , of population growth is sure to feature these .
It should be clear to readers of my essay published last week that I regard population growth as the core issue in any discussion on sustainability .
Many of the arguments used by those who wish to dismiss or lessen the importance of population growth are false , misleading or simply mental tricks allowing their advocates the comfort of self - deception .
Some of the main arguments refuting population growth as a problem are :
Consumption growth is more important than population growth
This argument is based on the idea that humanity ’s impact on the environment is the product of both population size and the amount that each member of the population consumes ( consumption per capita ) .
Impact increases both with increasing population numbers and increasing individual consumption .
We can have more people without increasing the stress on the environment if each person consumes less .
Alternatively we can have more consumption per person but not increase our environmental impact if we reduce the number of consumers ( i.e. the population ) .
Advertisement
Unfortunately we live in a world where most people consume very little ( i.e. are in poverty ) but want to consume more and where a privileged few ( the industrialised nations ) consume relatively huge amounts and will not willingly consume less .
If an average citizen of Bangladesh moves to Australia then their environmental impact ( ecological footprint ) will increase by 13 - fold .
This is the same as giving birth to an additional 12 Bangladeshis ( who remain in Bangladesh ) .
Thus , it is true that consumption growth can have an impact that is equal to or more than the birth of an extra individual if that additional individual is poor .
However , there is one very important difference between growth of consumption and growth of population .
Consumption growth is easily reversible but population growth is not .
In other words , in a crisis where a resource ( for example , energy ) becomes limiting it is far easier to reduce use of that resource by reducing per capita consumption than it is to reduce it by reducing the number of consumers .
This may seem like a theoretical point but it becomes very important when efficiency gains are being used to allow continued population growth .
For example , in the city where I live , Adelaide in South Australia , we are in a severe drought and we are all being encouraged to use less water .
Our gardens are dying and it is difficult to grow one ’s own food when watering is only allowed with a watering can and even that may be banned if things get worse .
Obviously , Adelaide has reached the limit of population that is sustainable at current standards of living and that limit is set by the particular critical resource that is currently least available - water .
However , the government has a plan to increase Adelaide ’s population by 50 per cent by 2050 .
The only way they can do that is by making each person use water more efficiently and by using energy - and technology - intensive desalination to generate additional water ( although the energy crises anticipated before 2050 throw the desalination plant ’s future into doubt ) .
At Adelaide ’s current population size there is obviously some degree of reserve capacity in our water use that allows us to continue to perform essential functions despite reducing consumption ( if we do not regard keeping our gardens alive as important ) .
The drought conditions have forced us to reduce consumption but we still have enough to survive on .
However , we can only increase our population if the current lower ( more “ efficient ” ) consumption levels are accepted as the new norm .
If we now increase our population to the limit allowed by the new norm then , if the drought worsens , we will have to reduce our water consumption per person further but this will not be as easy to do as previously .
There is , after all , a lower limit to the amount of water per person that we can consume and still have a functioning society .
As we get closer to that limit it becomes harder and harder to reduce water use and so we become more and more vulnerable to the effects of reduced water availability .
In fact , a society operating at the maximum level of efficiency with respect to an essential resource ( such as water , energy , phosphate and so on ) is very vulnerable and will collapse if the essential resource is restricted further .
To be truly sustainable and secure a society must operate well within its resource limits .
In fact , the security and sustainability of a society is reflected by its capacity to waste resources .
( This does not mean that it should waste resources , only that it has the capacity to do so if it wishes . )
After all , one can only waste resources when the reserve capacity to do so exists and it is this reserve capacity that is the true measure of “ sustainability ” .

I should perhaps point out briefly that “ sustainability ” is , of course , a time - dependent concept .
At any instant in time , everything is sustainable or it would not exist .
When thinking of environmental impact sustainability is commonly used to mean the ability of an activity ( such as a civilisation ) to persist for a long period ( indefinitely ) .
Maybe if the environmental movement adopted the word “ persistence ” it might focus people ’s minds more on the long - term survival of our society and be less prone to abuse by commercial interests wishing to greenwash their activities .
China ’s one child policy is a violation of the human right to control ones own fecundity
We need to decide which human right is more important - the right to unrestricted reproduction or the right not to starve to death .
People who reproduce at a rate that increases the population size threaten the survival of their own children and the children of all others .
People who oppose population growth are really just opposed to immigration ( because they are racist )
Believe it or not , it is actually possible to have immigration without population growth .
One simply operates a “ one in , one out ” policy .
Immigrants are only allowed to enter an area if the population is kept stable by the death of inhabitants ( without internal replacement ) or by emigrants leaving the area .
One example of such a policy in operation is for Norfolk Island ( PDF 189KB ) off the Australian east coast .
( It is commonly said that people living on islands have a greater appreciation of the limitations imposed by finite resources . )
The issue came to a head after a fire in August 2006 , in a subway tunnel near the Brooklyn end of the Manhattan Bridge .
The manager who was to be the liaison did not arrive until more than an hour after the fire began .
Firefighters began evacuating a stranded D train , even though the third rail was still electrified ; the firefighters were unaware that the subway command center was about to order that the train be moved .
A December 2006 report by the agency ’s office of system safety concluded that passengers were unnecessarily put in danger , and it strongly urged changes in the way the agency dealt with emergencies .
It suggested that the agency form a dedicated unit of responders whose main responsibility would be to go quickly to subway emergencies and act as a liaison with other agencies , passing information between them and the subway ’s control center .
The result was the formation of the emergency response officer unit , which began operation in March 2008 .
At most times , two members of the unit were on duty .
During peak commuting periods , they were assigned to busy subway stations to be on hand to help with problems as they arose .
When it became clear the agency wanted to eliminate the response team , Cheryl Kennedy , the agency ’s vice president of system safety , raised alarms .
“ Our concern is that the improvements in response and communication that we have seen with the dedicated E.R.O. staff will be lost and we will return to the days of slow response and poor communication , ” she wrote in a memo to Mr. Feil on Dec. 24 , 2008 , referring to the emergency response officer unit .
The memo noted that with the new unit in place , “ the response time for the E.R.O. ’s has been much less than it had previously been . ”
It also noted that police and fire officials had spoken “ positively ” about the unit ’s performance .
The concert was organized quickly ; performers said they had been invited within the last few weeks .
It was part of a series that began in June with a jazz event and will continue with a classical music program in the fall .
Mr. Paisley , whose new album “ American Saturday Night ” is currently No. 1 on Billboard ’s country chart , said the lineup reflected the “ different worlds ” of country .
“ They grabbed the contemporary popular chart , ” he said , referring to himself .
“ They grabbed the artistic bluegrass side , ” he continued , referring to Ms. Krauss .
“ And then they grabbed the legend side ” : Mr. Pride , country ’s most successful African - American performer , has had more than three dozen No. 1 country singles since the mid-1960s .
Mr. Paisley performed the title song of “ American Saturday Night , ” about the United States as a melting pot , and “ Welcome to the Future , ” which has a verse about race relations that starts with the recollection of a burning cross and concludes , “ From a woman on a bus to a man with a dream / Hey , wake up Martin Luther . ”
He wrote it , Mr. Paisley said before the concert , after the 2008 election , when he was in New York City on election night and saw jubilation in Times Square .
“ It just felt like the world had shifted on a dime , ” he said .
“ I wanted to encompass this big theme of how far we ’ve come in a song . ”
He added , “ The dream of a songwriter is to write some account of a current event like that , and then deliver it for the person that ’s responsible for the current event . ”

Thomas " Painter of Darkness " Kinkade , the world 's single most objectionable mass - producer of wall - hangings for middle American Baptists , is not just a terrible offender against aesthetics — he's also a crook !
An appeals court has awarded $ 2.1 million to two gallery owners who say they were duped into selling Kinkade 's schlock , then double - crossed by the Godly master himself in a scheme designed to let Kinkade buy out his own company at a low price :
In its February 2006 decision , the arbitration panel said Kinkade and other company officials used terms like " partner , " " trust , " " Christian " and " God " to create " a certain religious environment designed to instill a special relationship of trust " with the couple .
What the company did n't tell them , said their attorney , was that they would have to sell Kinkade 's works at minimum retail prices while the artist undercut them with discount sales , some of which he made himself on cable television .
It was part of a plan , they claimed , to lower the value of the publicly traded company before Kinkade bought it in 2004 , at steep losses to many investors .

Okay , question time : Imagine you ’re a major national newspaper whose crosstown archrival has somehow obtained two million pages of explosive documents that outed your country ’s biggest political scandal of the decade .
They ’ve had a team of professional journalists on the job for a month , slamming out a string of blockbuster stories as they find them in their huge stack of secrets .
How do you catch up ?
If you ’re the Guardian of London , you wait for the associated public - records dump , shovel it all on your Web site next to a simple feedback interface and enlist more than 20,000 volunteers to help you find the needles in the haystack .
Your cost for the operation ?
One full week from a software developer , a few days ’ help from others in his department , and £ 50 to rent temporary servers .
Journalism has been crowdsourced before , but it ’s the scale of the Guardian ’s project — 170,000 documents reviewed in the first 80 hours , thanks to a visitor participation rate of 56 percent — that ’s breathtaking .
We wanted the details , so I rang up the developer , Simon Willison , for his tips about deadline - driven software , the future of public records requests , and how a well - placed mugshot can make a blacked - out PDF feel like a detective story .
He offered four big lessons :
— Your workers are unpaid , so make it fun .
Willison started coding one week before the Thursday launch date , teamed with a designer on Tuesday , a system administrator on Wednesday and leaned on everyone in his 15 - person department for ad - hoc help on Thursday .
But the bulk of the labor would come from Guardian readers .
How to lure them ?
By making it feel like a game , said Willison , 28 .
The Guardian ’s four - panel interface — “ interesting , ” “ not interesting , ” “ interesting but known , ” and “ investigate this ! ” made categorization easy .
And the progress bar on the project ’s front page , immediately giving the community a goal to share .
But a video game needs more than an interface and a score .
It needs a narrative — and this project offered that , too .
That was what Willison discovered when , on a whim , he added the Guardian ’s mugshots of each MP to their pages in the database .
Participation shot up , he said .
“ There ’s that wonderfully personal element , because everybody in the U.K. has an MP , ” Willison said .
“ You ’ve got this big smiling face looking at you while you ’re digging through their expenses . ”
On Monday , to add a competitive edge , Willison posted lists of the top- performing volunteers .
By that point , the project had drawn 36,000 unique visitors and 20,440 participants .
“ Any time that you ’re trying to get people to give you stuff , to do stuff for you , the most important thing is that people know that what they ’re doing is having an effect , ” Willison said .
“ It ’s kind of a fundamental tenet of social software . …
If you ’re not giving people the ‘ I rock ’ vibe , you ’re not getting people to stick around . ”
— Public attention is fickle , so launch immediately .
Before Parliament released its records Thursday , Willison ’s team thought they might be able to postpone their launch to Friday if necessary .
When they saw Thursday ’s newsbroadcasts , they realized they ’d been wrong .
The country ’s imagination was caught .
“ It became quickly clear on Thursday that it was a huge story , and if we failed to get it out on Thursday , we ’d lose a lot of momentum , ” Willison said .
The result :
No time to load - test the program , perfect the interface , or even set up a system for Guardian reporters to view the vast amount of data that started pouring into their servers .
( The first overview was n’t ready for publication until Monday . )
Some programmers would be uncomfortable in those circumstances .
Welcome to journalism , folks .
“ We kind of load - tested it with our real audience , which guarantees that it ’s going to work eventually , ” Willison said impishly .
“ It ’s a very realistic way of debugging the application . ”
— Speed is mandatory , so use a framework .
Willison ’s project was built on Django , the custom Web framework “ for perfectionists with deadlines ” that he and Adrian Holovaty created for the Lawrence Journal - World .
In the world of database programming , a framework is like an offset press : hard to build — Django 1.0 required three years of open - source development — but once it ’s set up , there ’s no faster way to churn out content .
Hand - coding an application like the Guardian ’s would have been like publishing a daily newspaper with movable type .
Other frameworks and languages would have worked , too .
“ You absolutely could build this in Ruby on Rails or in PHP , ” Willison said , but “ as far as I ’m concerned , this is absolutely Django ’s sweet spot .
This is absolutely what Django is designed to do …
Once I had a designer and a client - side engineer working on the project , I could really just hand it over to them and I did n’t have to worry about the front - end code any more . ”
— Participation will come in one big burst , so have servers ready .
As well as the Guardian ’s first Django joint , this was its first project with EC2 , the Amazon contract - hosting service beloved by startups for its low capital costs .
Willison ’s team knew they would get a huge burst of attention followed by a long , fading tail , so it would n’t make sense to prepare the Guardian ’s own servers for the task .
In any case , there was n’t time .
“ The Guardian has lead time of several weeks to get new hardware bought and so forth , ” Willison said .
“ The project was only approved to go ahead less than a week before it launched . ”
With EC2 , the Guardian could order server time as needed , rapidly scaling it up for the launch date and down again afterward .
Thanks to EC2 , Willison guessed the Guardian ’s full out - of - pocket cost for the whole project will be around £ 50 .
As for the software , it was all open - source , freely available to the Guardian — and to anyone else who might want to imitate them .
Willison hopes to organize his work in the next few weeks .
“ There ’s a lot of stuff in there that ’s potentially reusable , ” Willison said .

The mother of an 11 - year - old girl who died of undiagnosed diabetes as the family prayed for her to get better has testified that she believes sickness is caused by sin and can be cured by God .
Leilani Neumann told the jury in her husband 's trial in Wausau , Wisconsin , on Tuesday she thought her daughter 's illness in March last year was a test of her religious faith and she did n't take the girl to a doctor because that would have been " complete disobedience to what we believe " .
Dale Neumann , 47 , is charged with second - degree reckless homicide in the death of his daughter , Madeline Neumann , called Kara by her parents .
His wife was convicted of the same charge and faces up to 25 years in prison when sentenced on October 6 .
US prosecutors contend Dale Neumann recklessly killed the youngest of his four children by ignoring her deteriorating health .
They claim Neumann had a legal duty to take her to a doctor .
President Obama ’s ability to shape the debate on health care appears to be eroding as opponents aggressively portray his overhaul plan as a government takeover that could limit Americans ’ ability to choose their doctors and course of treatment , according to the latest New York Times / CBS News poll .
Americans are concerned that revamping the health care system would reduce the quality of their care , increase their out - of - pocket health costs and tax bills , and limit their options in choosing doctors , treatments and tests , the poll found .
The percentage who describe health care costs as a serious threat to the American economy  a central argument made by Mr. Obama  has dropped over the past month .
Mr. Obama continues to benefit from strong support for the basic goal of revamping the health care system , and he is seen as far more likely than Congressional Republicans to have the best ideas to accomplish that .
But reflecting a problem that has hindered efforts to bring major changes to health care for decades , Americans expressed considerable unease about what the end result would mean for them individually .
“ We need to fix health care , ” Mary Bevering , a Democrat from Fort Madison , Iowa , said in a follow - up interview , “ but if the government creates the system , I ’m afraid the quality of care will go down and costs will go up :
We will pay more taxes . ”

But what about the even more common household fly ?
Turns out all you need to deal with that is a plastic bag or two .

Question - and - answer web site The Straight Dope gives more detail on why this trick works :
Evidently , houseflies , being highly edible and defenseless , are nervous types , and do n't like to sit still when they see something moving nearby , because it could be a predator .
The water bag acts a bit like a lens — try it some time — in which the movements of people in the area are reflected .
Even if the fly is too far from the action to see it directly , it can see a shifting of light and dark in the water bag , which it interprets as nearby movement , and it will fly away from the bag .
So , next time you have a fly problem , grab a few plastic bags , fill 'em up , and let us know how this trick works for you .
Likewise , share how you keep unwanted insects out of your backyard — including whether or not you 've tried this method before — in the comments .
What 's the Purpose of bags of water hanging in restaurants ?

As an adviser to the Baghdad Operations Command , which is led by an Iraqi general , Abud Qanbar , Colonel Reese drew examples from Baghdad Province , which is less volatile than the area near Mosul in northern Iraq , where the Sunni insurgency is strongest .
But he noted that he had read military reports from other regions and that he believed that there were similar dynamics nationwide .
Colonel Reese , who could not be reached for comment , submitted his paper to General Odierno ’s command , but copies have circulated among active - duty and retired military officers and been posted on at least one military - oriented Web site .
Colonel Reese ’s memo lists a number of problems that have emerged since the withdrawal of American combat troops from Baghdad , completed June 30 .
They include , he wrote , a “ sudden coolness ” to American advisers and the “ forcible takeover ” of a checkpoint in the Green Zone .
Iraqi units , he added , are much less willing to conduct joint operations with their American counterparts “ to go after targets the U.S. considers high value . ”
The Iraqi Ground Forces Command , Colonel Reese wrote , has imposed “ unilateral restrictions ” on American military operations that “ violate the most basic aspects ” of the security agreement that governs American and Iraqi military relations .
“ The Iraqi legal system in the Rusafa side of Baghdad has demonstrated a recent willingness to release individuals originally detained by the U.S. for attacks on the U.S. , ” he added .
A spokeswoman for General Odierno , Lt. Col. Josslyn Aberle , said of the memo :
“ The e-mail reflects one person ’s personal view at the time we were first implementing the Security Agreement post - 30 June .
Since that time many of the initial issues have been resolved and our partnerships with Iraqi Security Forces and G.O.I. partners now are even stronger than before 30 June . ” G.O.I. is the abbreviation for the government of Iraq ; the Iraqi Security Forces are sometimes referred to as the I.S.F .
Colonel Reese appears to have anonymously circulated a less detailed version of his memo on a blog called “ The Enchanter ’s Corner . ”
The author , listed on the site as “ Tim the Enchanter , ” is described as an active - duty Army officer serving as an adviser in Iraq who is “ passionate about political issues . ”
That post on Iraq , along with one criticizing President Obama ’s health care proposals , has been removed but can be found in cached versions .

Zelda theme on beer bottles ?
Check .
Digg it !
If there 's one thing we 've seen a lot of listeners request , it 's a rendition of Koji Kondo 's beloved title theme from the very first Zelda ... played on Heineken beer bottles .
Actually , that 's a lie , but sometimes people do n't know what 's good for them : Mattias Holmgren 's last posted mix was alllllllll the way back in July of 2002 , but he marks a triumphant and product - endorsing return here with this premium quality , lager arrangement .
He submitted a previous version of this mix using Milwaukee 's Best , but our judges panel felt that it lacked the purified water , malted barley , and quality hops and yeast that was necessary for a full - bodied yet satisfying VGM experience .
Yes , again , mistruth .
However , given Link 's penchant for green attire , the choice DOES seem appropriate .
Either way , let 's get an explanation from the man himself :
" The other day while having the friday beer I came up with a weird idea ( as always ) .
Why not make a song totally made up of sounds from a Heineken bottle ?
So later that evening I went into my studio with a beer , sampled it in all kinds of weird ways .
Clapping the bottom ( makes for a good and solid bass drum sound ) , hitting the sides with my nails , a screwdriver and some other stuff .
Then finally to create a melodic instrument with actual tones I sampled the windy sound of blowing into the bottle with different levels of beer in the can ( which obviously gives different pitch ) .
I sampled the beer at 5 different levels and at each level I made 4 different distinct sounds ( like hard , light , and sustained - note blow ) .
Then some sounds from the cap hitting a table etc .
The sampling sessions gave me 28 samples of Heineken notes ( all articulations included ) and 25 samples of drum - like sounds from the can , and I was ready to start making some music of it .
Well , not yet ... actually I had to build the instruments in some sort of sampler and I chose Kontakt 3 since it's my main sampler and I love all it 's features .
Building the instrument patches took about 2 - 3 hours and then I arranged a really experimental remix of Zelda with the sounds ... creazy stuff ! "
Seriously , pretty awesome .
Are we looking at the birth of a whole new line of beverage - themed sample libraries ?
Probably not , but the art of found sounds can certainly yield some interesting results ; I 've often thought about trying to put a mix together out of primarily found , sampled sounds , but I never got around to it ... clearly I was too busy DRINKING the Heineken ( silly me ) to see what a lovely sound source its drained carcass provides .
Larry says :
" The drinking " Ahhh " SFX at :48 was baller .
This was nothing but creative and fun .
I would have loved more melodic interpretation , but this was nice and expansive , including some solid original sections that pieced together fine with the main theme .
The comping style section got kind of hairy , but resolved OK .
Great stuff , and a really unique approach that 's already an instant classic with me . "
The OTHER Mattias writes :
" Very cool and creative arrangement , much because of the limitations .
The different sounds you get from the bottle and how you processed them ( the low - pass filtered " drums " especially " are very cool .
The mix is for the most part crystal clear and the exception is your own reverb and fx which adds a lot to the soundscape .
The arrangement is interpretive enough to be interesting even if it had n't been played on bottles .
I do think it suffers a bit from loose timing at places , probably a result of pitching samples without a very clear attack , but it does n't take away much from the piece as a whole .
The original section is really cool with the pitch bends and everything , very nice .
All in all this is a unique mix that still manages to fit our guidelines despite the limitations of the idea .
Well executed and interesting . "
I 'm personally not too sure the arrangement would work without a novelty sound source of some kind , because it seems written to the sounds themselves , not around them , but the point is that there 's enough going on compositionally that it does n't just sound like some drunk dude playing the Zelda theme verbatim .
This is planned , premeditated Zelda - on - beer - bottles , in the first degree .
The multisamping of the blowing , to allow for flares on ( presumably ) higher velocities , is really quite nice : impressive from a production and to a lesser extent arrangement perspective , this mix is equally impressive as an example of sample mapping and Kontakt expertise .
Mattias has been doing some commercial game composition - check out www.morningdewmedia.com for some cool sample tracks & info .
At the time of submission , he was working on two XBOX 360 titles , one DS title and 2 iPhone games - pretty sweet .
So , there you have it : Zelda Heineken .
I 'll note that you should listen , game , AND drink responsibly , and that this is an unofficial fan work which in no way represents endorsement of , by , or between Heineken , Nintendo , or OverClocked ReMix .
After Civ4 and Doug 's percussion - only CT mix , it does seem like we 're seeing a lot of fresh approaches ; good to see Mattias back and glad to hear he 's rockin ' the dream , making some awesome music , and apparently still able to spend some quality time with a beer bottle .
For all of our UK readers , now is the time for all good citizens to come to the aid of their country ( and science ) .
The Met Office refuses to release data and methodology for their HadCRUT global temperature dataset after being asked repeatedly .
Without the data and procedures there is no possibility of replication , and without replication the Hadley climate data is not scientifically valid .
This is n’t just a skeptic issue , mind you , others have just a keen an interest in proving the data .
What is so bizarre is this .
The FOI request by Steve McIntyre to the Met Office was for a copy of the data sent to Peter Webster .
If the restrictions on the data hold for Steve McIntyre , why did they not prevent release of the data to Webster ?
When asked by Warwick Hughes for this data , Dr. Jones famously replied :
Even if WMO agrees , I will still not pass on the data .
We have 25 or so years invested in the work .
Why should I make the data available to you , when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it .
This is just wrong on so many levels .
This is n’t state secrets , it is temperature data gathered from weather stations worldwide and the methodology of collating and processing it .
Much of the weather station data is available online and live via hundreds of Internet sites , so the argument that “ strict understanding by the data providers that this station data must not be publicly released ” is in my opinion , bogus .
You can get a list of CRU stations .
Go to : http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/landstations/ and download the file : crustnsused.txt
And then look up any number of these stations on the Internet and get the data .
The fact that Hadley / Met Office repeatedly refuses to disclose the data and methodology only deepens the likelihood that there is something amiss and Hadley does not want to be caught out on it .
Dr. Jones is looking more and more like a “ very bad Wizard ” with each denied FOI request .
Science and scientists should demand open access to this data .
If GISS can do it , why not Hadley ?
They share much of the same data .
Steve McIntyre tells the complete story below .
My advice to UK readers , start sending an FOI request every week and complain loudly to your UK representatives and write letters to the editor .
Details are in the body of the post below .

UK Met Office Refuses to Disclose Station Data Once Again
by Steve McIntyre on July 23rd , 2009
It must be humiliating for the UK Met Office to have to protect Phil Jones and CRU .
Even a seasoned bureaucrat must have winced in order to write the following :
Some of the information was provided to Professor Jones on the strict understanding by the data providers that this station data must not be publicly released and it cannot be determined which countries or stations data were given in confidence as records were not kept .
Here is the complete text of the UK Met Office ’s most recent refusal of their station data .
Our Ref : 22-06-2009-131902-003 23 July 2009 Dear Mr McIntyre Request for Information – Information not Held and Refusal to Disclose Information Your correspondence dated 9 June 2009 has been considered to be a request for information in accordance with the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 .
The Ministry of Defence is permitted to withhold information where exceptions are considered justifiable .
You asked “ You stated that CRUTEM3 data that you held was the value added data .
Pursuant to the Environmental Information Regulations
Act 2004 , please provide me with this data in the digital form , together with any documents that you hold describing the procedures under which the data has been quality controlled and where deemed appropriate , adjusted to account for apparent non-climatic influences ” .
Your request has been assessed and this letter is to inform you that the Met Office does hold some information covered by the request .
We do not hold documents describing the procedures under which the data has been quality controlled or adjusted to account for apparent non-climatic influences .
The information held by the Met Office is withheld in accordance with the following exceptions pursuant to the Environmental Information Regulations Act 2004 : • Section 12 ( 5 ) ( a ) Information likely to prejudice relations between the United Kingdom and any International organisation ; • Section 12 ( 5 ) ( e ) Confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest .
• Section 12 ( 5 ) ( f ) ( i ) ( iii )
The supplier was not under legal obligation to supply the information and has not consented to its disclosure .
As the above exceptions are qualified exceptions , a public interest test was undertaken by the Met Office to consider whether there are overriding reasons why disclosure of this information would not be in the public interest .
The Met Office has duly considered these reasons in conjunction with the public interest in disclosing the requested information , in particular the benefits of assisting the public having information on environmental information , whereby they would hope to influence decisions from a position of knowledge rather than speculation .
Access to environmental information is particularly important as environmental issues affect the whole population .
Consideration of Exception Regulation 12 ( 5 ) ( a ) Much of the requested data comes from individual Scientists and Institutions from several countries .
The Met Office received the data information from Professor Jones at the University of East Anglia on the strict understanding by the data providers that this station data must not be publicly released .
If any of this information were released , scientists could be reluctant to share information and participate in scientific projects with the public sector organisations based in the UK in future .
It would also damage the trust that scientists have in those scientists who happen to be employed in the public sector and could show the Met Office ignored the confidentiality in which the data information was provided .
We considered that if the public have information on environmental matters , they could hope to influence decisions from a position of knowledge rather than speculation .
However , the effective conduct of international relations depends upon maintaining trust and confidence between states and international organisations .
This relationship of trust allows for the free and frank exchange of information on the understanding that it will be treated in confidence .
If the United Kingdom does not respect such confidences , its ability to protect and promote United Kingdom interests through international relations may be hampered .
Competitors / Collaborators could be damaged by the release of information which was given to us in confidence and this will detrimentally affect the ability of the Met Office ( UK ) to co-operate with meteorological organisations and governments of other countries .
This could also provoke a negative reaction from scientist globally if their information which they have requested remains private is disclosed .
Consideration of Exception Regulation 12 ( 5 ) ( e )
The information is also withheld in accordance with the exception under regulation 12 ( 5 ) ( e ) because the information comprises of Station Data which are commercially sensitive for many of the data sources ( particularly European and African Meteorological services ) release of any data could adversely affect relationships with other Institutions and individuals , who may plan to use their data for their own commercial interests .
Some of this is documented in Hulme , 1996 but this is not a globally comprehensive summary .
The Met Office are not party to information which would allow us to determine which countries and stations data can or cannot be released as records were not kept , or given to the Met Office , therefore we cannot release data where we have no authority to do so .
Competitors or collaborators could be damaged by the release of information which was given to us in confidence and could affect their ability to trade .
The Met Office uses the data solely and expressly to create a gridded product that we distribute without condition .
Consideration of Exception Regulation 12 ( 5 ) ( f ) ( i ) and ( iii ) The information is also withheld in accordance with the exception under regulation 12 ( 5 ) ( f ) ( i ) ( iii ) as Professor Jones was not legally bound to release the data to the Met Office and has not consented to the disclosure to any other party .
As stated above in 12 ( 5 ) ( a ) Some of the information was provided to Professor Jones on the strict understanding by the data providers that this station data must not be publicly released and it cannot be determined which countries or stations data were given in confidence as records were not kept .
The Met Office received the data from Professor Jones on the proviso that it would not be released to any other source and to release it without authority would seriously affect the relationship between the United Kingdom and other Countries and Institutions .
I hope this answers your enquiry .
If you are not satisfied with this response or you wish to complain about any aspect of the handling of your request , then you should contact me in the first instance .
If informal resolution is not possible and you are still dissatisfied then you may apply for an independent internal review by contacting the Head of Corporate Information , 6th Floor , MOD Main Building , Whitehall , SW1A 2HB ( e- mail CIO-XD@mod.uk ) .
Please note that any request for an internal review must be made within 40 working days of the date on which the attempt to reach informal resolution has come to an end .
If you remain dissatisfied following an internal review , you may take your complaint to the Information Commissioner under the provisions of Section 50 of the Freedom of Information Act .
Please note that the Information Commissioner will not investigate your case until the MOD internal review process has been completed .
Further details of the role and powers of the Information Commissioner can be found on the Commissioner ’s website , www.ico.gov.uk.

The Unconventional Lifestyle of a Cocaine Dealer .
Part 2
No one despite what they may think decides to grow up to become an axe murderer , a porn star , an overpaid wall street trader or for that matter a cocaine dealer .
Such things suddenly happen without the subject being fully cognizant that it is happening to them .
That of course is not to say that the guy who I am currently visiting , who we shall for the sake of anonymity call Andrew has no idea what he is doing .
There in front of him lies at least 6 ounces ( each ounce contains 28 grams ) of the purest white powder that will by the end of the week be consumed by the scenesters , models , porn stars and over paid wall street traders that generally make up his clientele .
Of course when I say consumed that ’s after he ’s finished cutting the white lady to a ratio he likes to call the 1 for them and 3 for me rule …
It ’s a recent Saturday night and it ’s a little after four in the afternoon and Andrew ’s phone has been going off the way a call center distributing seventeen dollar tickets to Miami would go off .
As his cell goes off ( rest assured it ’s a pre paid one for obvious reasons ) he looks to see who ’s calling .
At first he pays little attention to the number which has Nancy ’s ( another like all names in this article fictitious one ) name pop up as it rings .
Instead he just sits there tending to all the art books in his vast library , occasionally rising to look for another one that he thinks he ought to be showing me .
“ You see , ” his eyes momentarily pausing to gaze at the pedestrians walking up and down the street one flight below “ people have this perception that just because I burn cd’s that all I do is in life is spin tricks .
But the truth is that could n’t be further from the truth .
See , ” he stops to point at a three dimensional plaque with abutments and coded color schemes “ I was the valedictorian of my school .
If only you knew the number of buildings I have helped design , the awards I won and the clients I ’ve worked for , you ’d be asking me for my autograph . ”
It ’s at this point the first of many door buzzes that the buzzer goes off .
Feeling sheepish I begin to bury my head deep in the book on Salvador Dali while I carefully sip the Jasmine Green tea that Andrew has gone to great lengths to make for me .
( like all things in Andrew ’s life , he is a fickler for detail , high art , contraptions and the nuances that are necessary to appreciate if one is to make a high concept building , an exceptional tasting green tea or a bag of coke that will send you flying ) .
As the door finally opens I notice with intrigue as Andrew greets a man who if I were asked before he set foot in the building had he had a penchant for the white lady I would have categorically said no .
Barely lifting my head and gently nodding my head I look on quietly as Andrew briefly introduces me to a man who ’s hair is falling away , his rigid glasses in place and his wedding band ring firmly in place before being led away to another room in the house .
A few minutes goes past and as much I want to run the hell out of here ( the idea does occur to me that if the place suddenly got raided I ’d be in big trouble ) I also want to go in the other room and see what is actually going on .
Of course out of respect to Andrew I remain seated , my eyes dancing from the image of Salvador ’s melting watch to the commercial on TV for a new diet supplement .
In some brilliant way the whole scene is completely remarkable but the truth is I actually wonder otherwise …
If anyone has ever had a career as a wall street trader at some point during their tenure they are introduced to the white lady .
Introduced to her because like the stocks , bonds , currencies , and derivatives they trade , she is sexy , capable of giving much needed adrenalin and the kick to help one believe they are invincible .
Thankfully such days and career have long gone for me but the notion of chopping up three big lines in the bathroom and rushing back to the trading pits have never quite left me .
Of course this article is n’t about people who realize their limitations , rather it ’s an article about a society and collective of people who are loathe to recognize limitations .
Or at least that ’s what I imagine …
For anyone who has never used or tried cocaine ( yes - as outrageous as this sounds for a country that has more drug abuse than any other industrialized nation in the world ) the general concept of cocaine is the forced sense of euphoria that is created by the overloaded creation of dopamine in the brain which the drug serves to create once it enters one ’s system .
For most people it ’s a rite of passage that barely lasts a year , a school semester , but for others it eventually becomes the only way to make sense of the world .
Not that making sense of the world is an easy task in the first place .
A few more minutes finally goes past and Andrew and his guest ( client ? ) finally return to the living room before Andrew gives the man with the rigid looking glasses a big pat on the back and tells him to call him later .
With a click the door opens , the man disappears into the world that he is trying to disappear from while Andrew now returns closing the door behind him .
For a while nothing is said , we go on watching some show about super heroes or something about how the cold war was won before I finally turn to ask who had arrived .
Turn to ask but rather than ask openly I think to reflect on his general disposition .
“ Wow , he looks like one of those guys who you see picking up kids at some nursery school . ”
“ Who Tom ?
Sure .
He ’s got two young kids .
But you know how it is .
It ’s the weekend , work ’s been stressful , and he ’s going to be hanging out with the boys tonight . ”
I stop and turn to look at Andrew who was recently introduced to me at a party and after careful wrangling , and assurances from my part agreed to let me sit in with him one afternoon .
Part of me was thrilled that he had said yes , another part of me disturbed that I would be visiting a chapter in a previous life but most of me intrigued that this character , like any stage character , be it an axe murderer , sought out socialite or over paid wall street trader had given me entry into the particular nuances of their lives .
As much as I want to find out what goes on here I am careful not to over reach my boundaries .
Of course part of me has the feeling that I am the commissioned artist who has arrived to give the subject the validation of his being or rather the preferred validation of their being …
I now get up and follow Andrew to the other room where next to a half open bottle of Vivue Clique champagne in a cooling bucket lies the remnants of scales , plastic bags and the zip lock bags that Andrew uses to keep his produce fresh .
Turning to a cupboard Andrew then takes out an acrylic black plate and a large plastic bag with Cinderella in it .
Taking out a putty knife he then dumps a giant blob onto the plate before taking out a hundred dollar bill which he tightly rolls up into a tight cylinder .
He then reaches over to find a strainer from which he dumps half of the plate ’s contents into before taking out a giant spoon and crushing it back onto the plate .
In a way it ’s like watching someone make a cake , but the last time I checked cakes like this did n’t leave one feeling so sensory overloaded .
Prisoners could be forced to build their own jail cells from shipping containers to cope with a " dangerously high " prison population that is expected to spill over in six months .
The Key government has asked Corrections to produce options to cope with the burgeoning prison muster , which has increased by 700 so far this year .
It is the latest of the government 's hardline " tough on crime " measures , which have included removing parole eligibility for the worst repeat violent offenders , allowing the cars of illegal street racers to be crushed and the seizure of the assets and profits of gangs .
Police have received powers to issue on - the - spot protection orders in family violence cases , and prison release conditions for serious child - sex offenders have been tightened .
Corrections Minister Judith Collins said the issue of housing prisoners was expected to reach crisis point in the new year .
Double - bunking the standard practice of putting two prisoners into a single cell was not sustainable and the economic downturn meant the government could not afford to build new prisons in the short term .
Using prisoners to build their own cells was " a great idea " and " a lot better than being locked up all day in a cell " , Collins said .
" We are getting dangerously high in our capacity .
We will not have the capacity by the beginning of next year to house all the prisoners that we will have . "
Corrections has yet to respond to Collins on the proposal for shipping - container cells , which she said would " be spartan but humane and clean .
We are looking at whether we could make good use out of prisoner work teams to help build these , and obviously things like landscaping .
We 're quite keen to have prisoners learning useful construction skills and helping to build their own environment .
Prisoners need to learn construction skills so they can earn their keep and , frankly , it 's a lot better than being locked up all day in a cell . "
Kim Workman , the director of alternative justice thinktank Rethinking Crime and Punishment , said the idea of housing prisoners in shipping containers was inhumane , and forcing prisoners to fit them out was asking for serious trouble .
" A container is a container and to have prisoners living in containers ... this is stuff they were talking about in Australia 10 - 15 years ago and the department decided then that what was happening was inhumane .
" This is likely to create a considerable backlash .
I think they are going one step too far with the idea of housing prisoners in containers .
I think it 's a major breach of human rights and a contravention of the United Nations minimum rules for accommodating prisoners . "
Workman did not have a problem with prisoners working , " but this is a little bit like asking a person who 's been sentenced to hanging to build their own gallows .
You can imagine how they would feel , building these atrocities and then being expected to live in them you might get a very negative reaction from prisoners .
" I think she [ the minister ] is on the verge of creating a situation where there will be major riots and people will die . "
But Collins said the shipping containers would provide a better standard of housing than some of the country 's older prisons such as Auckland 's Mt Eden and Wellington 's Mt Crawford .
The average prison population in 1996 - 97 was about 5000 .
Today it is about 8500 and is continuing to rise .
New Zealand is said to have the second highest rate of imprisonment among western countries , after the US .
Collins said the issue was not so much overcrowding , but having too many prisoners concentrated in certain areas of the country .
It was expensive and unsafe to constantly transport prisoners and it was also wrong that some were moved far from their families .
The shipping containers would give prison authorities more flexibility in managing the inmate population .
Auckland , Rimutaka and Hastings were the immediate pressure points , and the intention would be to put the containers on land next to existing prisons , effectively increasing the bed -count .
" The previous government did not actually build enough space and bunks basically , and we 've been left with this to deal with , " Collins said .
The cost of building accommodation to the standard of the new Spring Hill prison in Meremere , south of Auckland , works out at about $ 643,000 per bed .
Using shipping containers , the cost is an estimated $ 380,000 per bed .
Opposition corrections spokesman Clayton Cosgrove accused Collins of playing popular politics and said the proposal would create more tension for prison officers .
" It 's a nice little slogan to whip out you know , let 's have them in shipping containers but there 's no detail . "
Meanwhile , the government 's election promise to scrap parole for prisoners who refuse to take part in jail work programmes has hit a legal snag .
Collins says she is pushing ahead with the plan but admits there are human rights concerns .
National promised to amend the Parole Act to ensure prisoners who could work but refused were not eligible for parole , and Collins believes the legal issues can be overcome .
The Corrections
Act allows prison officers to direct inmates to work , but only in chores such as laundry , cleaning and prison maintenance .
Work that requires labour market skills such as building or forestry is voluntary and prisoners are paid less than the minimum wage .
Only low - risk prisoners can work outside prisons .
Collins said the prisoners who might benefit the most from learning work skills often chose not to help themselves .
" If you are ever going to break the life of crime , it is through work , education and spiritual values . "
A 15 - year - old boy who subjected a schoolgirl to racist abuse has been found guilty of racially aggravated harassment .
The boy , who cannot be named for legal reasons , was convicted at Lincoln Magistrates ' Court .
He will be sentenced next month .
The girl suffered months of racist abuse from the boy including being called racist names , the court heard .
The jury was told the victim had considered committing suicide .
Another 15 - year - old accused of the same offence was found not guilty .
Jaswant Narwal , chief crown prosecutor for Lincolnshire , said : " This is a sad case where a young girl who was so distressed that she attempted to end her life as a result of racial bullying in school .
" We would like to thank the victim for her courage in coming forward and strongly encourage other young people in the same situation to report to the police when they have been targets of campaign of racial bullying . "

Stanislaw Lem
Philip K. Dick : A Visionary Among the Charlatans
Translated from the Polish by Robert Abernathy
No one in his right mind seeks the psychological truth about crime in detective stories .
Whoever seeks such truth will turn rather to Crime and Punishment .
In relation to Agatha Christie , Dostoevsky constitutes a higher court of appeal , yet no one in his right mind will condemn the English author 's stories on this account .
They have a right to be treated as the entertaining thrillers they are , and the tasks Dostoevsky set himself are foreign to them .
If anyone is dissatisfied with SF in its role as an examiner of the future and of civilization , there is no way to make an analogous move from literary oversimplifications to full - fledged art , because there is no court of appeal from this genre .
There would be no harm in this , save that American SF , exploiting its exceptional status , lays claim to occupy the pinnacles of art and thought .
One is annoyed by the pretentiousness of a genre which fends off accusations of primitivism by pleading its entertainment character and then , once such accusations have been silenced , renews its overweening claims .
By being one thing and purporting to be another , SF promotes a mystification which , moreover , goes on with the tacit consent of readers and public .
The development of interest in SF at American universities has , contrary to what might have been expected , altered nothing in this state of affairs .
In all candor it must be said , though one risk perpetrating a crime laesae Almae Matris , that the critical methods of theoreticians of literature are inadequate in the face of the deceptive tactics of SF .
But it is not hard to grasp the reason for this paradox : if the only fictional works treating of problems of crime were like those of Agatha Christie , then to just what kind of books could even the most scholarly critic appeal in order to demonstrate the intellectual poverty and artistic mediocrity of the detective thriller ?
Qualitative norms and upper limits are established in literature by concrete works and not by critics ' postulates .
No mountain of theoretical lucubrations can compensate for the absence of an outstanding fictional work as a lofty model .
The criticism of experts in historiography did not undermine the status of Sienkiewicz 's Trilogy , for there was no Polish Leo Tolstoy to devote a War and Peace to the period of the Cossack and Swedish wars .
In short , inter caecos luscus rex-where there is nothing first - rate , its role will be taken over by mediocrity , which sets itself facile goals and achieves them by facile means .
What the absence of such model works leads to is shown , more plainly than by any abstract discussions , by the change of heart which Damon Knight , both author and respected critic , expressed in SFS # 3 .
Knight declared himself to have been mistaken earlier in attacking books by van Vogt for their incoherence and irrationalism , on the grounds that , if van Vogt enjoys an enormous readership , he must by that very fact be on the right track as an author , and that it is wrong for criticism to discredit such writing in the name of arbitrary values , if the reading public does not want to recognize such values .
The job of criticism is , rather , to discover those traits to which the work owes its popularity .
Such words , from a man who struggled for years to stamp out tawdriness in SF , are more than the admission of a personal defeat — they are the diagnosis of a general condition .
If even the perennial defender of artistic values has laid down his arms , what can lesser spirits hope to accomplish in this situation ?
Indeed , the possibility cannot be ruled out that Joseph Conrad 's elevated description of literature as rendering " the highest kind of truth to the visible universe " may become an anachronism — that the independence of literature from fashion and demand may vanish outside SF as well , and then whatever reaps immediate applause as a best - seller will be identified with what is most worthwhile .
That would be a gloomy prospect .
The culture of any period is a mixture of that which docilely caters to passing whims and fancies and that which transcends these things — and may also pass judgment on them .
Whatever defers to current tastes becomes an entertainment which achieves success immediately or not at all , for there is no such thing as a stage - magic exhibition or a football game which , unrecognized today , will become famous a hundred years from now .
Literature is another matter : it is created by a process of natural selection of values , which takes place in society and which does not necessarily relegate works to obscurity if they are also entertainment , but which consigns them to oblivion if they are only entertainment .
Why is this so ?
Much could be said about this .
If the concept of the human being as an individual who desires of society and of the world something more than immediate satisfactions were abolished , then the difference between literature and entertainment would likewise disappear .
But since we do not as yet identify the dexterity of a conjurer with the personal expression of a relationship to the world , we cannot measure literary values by numbers of books sold .
But how does it ever happen that something which is less popular can , in the historical long run , hold its own against that which scores prompt successes and even contrives to silence its opponents ?
This results from the aforementioned natural selection in culture , strikingly similar to such selection in biological evolution .
The changes by virtue of which some species yield place to others on the evolutionary scene are seldom consequences of great cataclysms .
Let the progeny of one species out - survive that of another by a margin of only one in a million , and by and by only the former species will remain alive — though the difference between the chances of the two is imperceptible at short range .
So it is also in culture : books which in the eyes of their contemporaries are so alike as to be peers part company as the years go by ; facile charm , being ephemeral , gives way at last to that which is more difficult to perceive .
Thus regularities in the rise and decline of literary works come into being and give direction to the development of the spiritual culture of an age .
Nevertheless , there can be circumstances that frustrate this process of natural selection .
In biological evolution the result will be retrogression , degeneration , or at the very least developmental stagnation , typical of populations isolated from the outside world and vitiated by inbreeding , since these are most lacking in the fruitful diversity that is guaranteed only by openness to all the world 's influences .
In culture an analogous situation leads to the emergence of enclaves shut up in ghettos , where intellectual production likewise stagnates because of inbreeding in the form of incessant repetition of the selfsame creative patterns and techniques .
The internal dynamics of the ghetto may appear to be intense , but with the passage of years it becomes evident that this is only a semblance of motion , since it leads nowhere , since it neither feeds into nor is fed by the open domain of culture , since it does not generate new patterns or trends , and since finally it nurses the falsest of notions about itself , for lack of any honest evaluation of its activities from outside .
The books of the ghetto assimilate themselves to one another , becoming an anonymous mass , while such surroundings thrust whatever is better downward toward the worse , so that works of differing quality meet one another halfway , as it were , in the leveling process forced upon them .
In such a situation publishing success not only may but must become the sole standard of evaluation , since a vacuum of standards is impossible .
Hence , where there are no ratings on the merits , these are replaced by ratings on a commercial basis .
Just such a situation reigns in American SF , which is a domain of herd creativity .
Its herd character manifests itself in the fact that books by different authors become as it were different sessions of playing at one and the same game or various figures of the selfsame dance .
It should be emphasized that , in literary culture as in natural evolution , effects become causes by virtue of feedback loops : the artistic - intellectual passivity and mediocrity of works touted as brilliant repel the more exigent authors and readers , so that the loss of individuality in SF is at once a cause and an effect of ghetto seclusion .
In SF there is little room left for creative work that would aspire to deal with problems of our time without mystification , oversimplification , or facile entertainment : e.g. , for work which would reflect on the place that Reason can occupy in the Universe , on the outer limits of concepts formed on Earth as instruments of cognition , or on such consequences of contacts with extraterrestrial life as find no place in the desperately primitive repertoire of SF devices ( bounded by the alternative " we win " / " they win " ) .
These devices bear much the same relation to serious treatment of problems of the kind mentioned as does the detective story to the problems of evil inherent in mankind .
Whoever brings up the heavy artillery of comparative ethnology , cultural anthropology and sociology against such devices is told that he is using cannon to shoot sparrows , since it is merely a matter of entertainment ; once he falls silent , the voices of the apologists for the culture - shaping , anticipative , predictive and mythopoeic role of SF are raised anew .
SF behaves rather like a conjurer pulling rabbits from a hat , who , threatened with a search of his belongings , pretends to think we are crazy to suggest this and indulgently explains that he is just performing tricks — after which we promptly hear that he is passing himself off in public for an authentic thaumaturge .
IS CREATIVE WORK WITHOUT MYSTIFICATION possible in such an environment ?
An answer to this question is given by the stories of Philip K. Dick .
While these stand out from the background against which they have originated , it is not easy to capture the ways in which they do , since Dick employs the same materials and theatrical props as other American writers .
From the warehouse which has long since become their common property , he takes the whole threadbare lot of telepaths , cosmic wars , parallel worlds , and time travel .
In his stories terrible catastrophes happen , but this too is no exception to the rule , for lengthening the list of sophisticated ways in which the world can end is among the standard preoccupations of SF .
But where other SF writers explicitly name and delimit the source of the disaster , whether social ( terrestrial or cosmic war ) or natural ( elemental forces of nature ) , the world of Dick 's stories suffers dire changes for reasons which remain unascertainable to the end .
People perish not because a nova or a war has erupted , not because of flood , famine , plague , drought , or sterility , nor because the Martians have landed on our doorstep ; rather , there is some inscrutable factor at work which is visible in its manifestations but not at its source , and the world behaves as if it has fallen prey to a malignant cancer which through metastases attacks one area of life after another .
This is , be it said forthwith , apposite as a castigation of historiographic diagnostics , since in fact humanity does not as a rule succeed in exhaustively or conclusively diagnosing the causes of the afflictions which befall it .
It is sufficient to recall how many diverse and in part mutually exclusive factors are nowadays adduced by experts as sources of the crisis of civilization .
And this , be it added , is also appropriate as an artistic presupposition , since literature which furnishes the reader with godlike omniscience about all narrated events is today an anachronism which neither the theory of art nor the theory of knowledge will undertake to defend .
The forces which bring about world debacle in Dick 's books are fantastic , but they are not merely invented ad hoc to shock the readers .
We shall show this on the example of Ubik , a work which , by the way , can also be regarded as a fantastic grotesque , a " macabresque " with obscure allegorical subtexts , decked out in the guise of ordinary SF .
If , however , it is viewed as a work of SF proper the contents of Ubik can be most simply summarized as follows :
Telepathic phenomena , having been mastered in the context of capitalistic society , have undergone commercialization like every other technological innovation .
So businessmen hire telepaths to steal trade secrets from their competitors , and the latter for their part defend themselves against this " extrasensory industrial espionage " with the aid of " inertials , " people whose psyches nullify the " psi field " that makes it possible to receive others ' thoughts .
By way of specialization , firms have sprung up which rent out telepaths and " inertials " by the hour , and the " strong man " Glen Runciter is the proprietor of such a firm .
The medical profession has learned how to arrest the agony of victims of mortal ailments , but still has no means of curing them .
Such people are therefore kept in a state of " half - life " in special institutions , " moratoriums " ( a kind of " places of postponement " — of death , obviously ) .
If they merely rested there unconscious in their icy caskets , that would be small comfort for their surviving kin .
So a technique has been developed for maintaining the mental life of such people in " cold-pac . "
The world which they experience is not part of reality , but a fiction created by appropriate methods .
None the less , normal people can make contact with the frozen ones , for the cold - sleep apparatus has means to this end built into it , something on the order of a telephone .
This idea is not altogether absurd in terms of scientific facts : the concept of freezing the incurably ill to await the time when remedies for their diseases will be found has already come in for serious discussion .
It would also be possible in principle to maintain vital processes in a person 's brain when the body dies ( to be sure , that brain would rapidly suffer psychological disintegration as a consequence of sensory deprivation ) .
We know that stimulation of the brain by electrodes produces in the subject of such an operation experiences indistinguishable from ordinary perceptions .
In Dick we find a perfected extension of such techniques , though he does not discuss this explicitly in the story .
Numerous dilemmas arise here : should the " half - lifer " be informed of his condition ?
Is it right to keep him under the illusion that he is leading a normal life ?
According to Ubik , people who , like Runciter 's wife , have spent years in cold sleep are well aware of the fact .
It is another matter with those who , like Joe Chip , have come close to meeting with a violent end and have regained consciousness imagining that they have escaped death , whereas in fact they are resting in a moratorium .
In the book , it must be admitted , this is an unclear point , which is however masked by another dilemma : for , if the world of the frozen person 's experiences is a purely subjective one , then any intervention in that world from outside must be for him a phenomenon which upsets the normal course of things .
So if someone communicates with the frozen one , as Runciter does with Chip , this contact is accompanied in Chip 's experiences by uncanny and startling phenomena — for it is as if waking reality were breaking into the midst of a dream " only from one side , " without thereby causing extinction of the dream and wakening of the sleeper ( who , after all , can not wake up like a normal man because he is not a normal man ) .
But , to go a step further , is not contact also possible between two frozen individuals ?
Might not one of these people dream that he is alive and well and that from his accustomed world he is communicating with the other one — that only the other person succumbed to the unfortunate mishap ?
This too is possible .
And , finally , is it possible to imagine a wholly infallible technology ?
There can be no such thing .
Hence certain perturbations may affect the subjective world of the frozen sleeper , to whom it will then seem that his environment is going mad — perhaps that in it even time is falling to pieces !
Interpreting the events presented in this fashion , we come to the conclusion that all the principal characters of the story were killed by the bomb on the Moon , and consequently all of them had to be placed in the moratorium and from this point on the book recounts only their visions and illusions .
In a realistic novel ( but this is a contradictio in adiecto ) this version would correspond to a narrative which , after coming to the demise of the hero , would go on to describe his life after death .
The realistic novel cannot describe this life , since the principle of realism rules out such descriptions .
If , however , we assume a technology which makes possible the " half - life " of the dead , nothing prevents the author from remaining faithful to his characters and following them with his narrative — into the depths of their icy dream , which is henceforward the only form of life open to them .
Thus it is possible to rationalize the story in the above manner — on which , however , I would not insist too seriously , and that for two reasons at once .
The first reason is that to make the plot fully consistent along the lines sketched above is impossible .
If all Runciter 's people perished on the Moon , then who transported them to the moratorium ?
Another thing which does not yield to any rationalization is the talent of the girl who by mental effort alone was able to alter the present by transposing causal nodes in a past already over and done with .
( This takes place before the occurrence on the Moon , when there are no grounds for regarding the represented world as the purely subjective one of any " half - life " character . )
Similar misgivings are inspired by Ubik itself , " the Absolute in a spray can , " to which we will devote attention a little later on .
If we approach the fictional world pedantically , no case can be made for it , for it is full of contradictions .
But if we shelve such objections and inquire rather after the overall meaning of the work , we will discover that it is close to the meanings of other books by Dick , for all that they seem to differ from one another .
Essentially it is always one and the same world which figures in them — a world of elementally unleashed entropy , of decay which not only , as in our reality , attacks the harmonious arrangement of matter , but which even consumes the order of elapsing time .
Dick has thus amplified , rendered monumental and at the same time monstrous certain fundamental properties of the actual world , giving them dramatic acceleration and impetus .
All the technological innovations , the magnificent inventions and the newly mastered human capabilities ( such as telepathy , which our author has provided with an uncommonly rich articulation into " specialties " ) ultimately come to nothing in the struggle against the inexorably rising floodwaters of Chaos .
Dick 's province is thus a " world of preestablished disharmony , " which is hidden at first and does not manifest itself in the opening scenes of the novel ; these are presented unhurriedly and with calm matter - of - factness , just in order that the intrusion of the destructive factor should be all the more effective .
Dick is a prolific author , but I speak only of those of his novels which constitute the " main sequence " of his works ; each of these books ( I would count among them : The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch , Ubik , Now Wait for Last Year , and perhaps also Galactic Pot- Healer ) is a somewhat different embodiment of the same dramatic principle — the conversion of the order of the universe to rack and ruin before our eyes .
In a world smitten with insanity , in which even the chronology of events is subject to convulsions , it is only the people who preserve their normality .
So Dick subjects them to the pressure of a terrible testing , and in his fantastic experiment only the psychology of the characters remains non-fantastic .
They struggle bitterly and stoically to the end , like Joe Chip in the current instance , against the chaos pressing on them from all sides , the sources of which remain , actually , unfathomable , so that in this regard the reader is thrown back on his own conjectures .
The peculiarities of Dick 's worlds arise especially from the fact that in them it is waking reality which undergoes profound dissociation and duplication .
Sometimes the dissociating agency consists in chemical substances ( of the hallucinogenic type — thus in The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch ) ; sometimes in " cold- sleep technique " ( as precisely in Ubik ) ; sometimes ( as in Now Wait for Last Year ) in a combination of narcotics and " parallel worlds . "
The end - effect is always the same : distinguishing between waking reality and visions proves to be impossible .
The technical aspect of this phenomenon is fairly inessential — it does not matter whether the splitting of reality is brought about by a new technology of chemical manipulation of the mind or , as in Ubik , by one of surgical operations .
The essential point is that a world equipped with the means of splitting perceived reality into indistinguishable likenesses of itself creates practical dilemmas that are known only to the theoretical speculations of philosophy .
This is a world in which , so to speak , this philosophy goes out into the street and becomes for every ordinary mortal no less of a burning question than is for us the threatened destruction of the biosphere .
There is no question of using a meticulous factual bookkeeping to strike a rational balance for the novel , by virtue of which it would satisfy the demands of common sense .
We are not only forced to but we ought to at a certain point leave off defending its " science - fictional nature " also for a second reason so far unmentioned .
The first reason was dictated to us simply by necessity : given that the elements of the work lack a focal point , it can not be rendered consistent .
The second reason is more essential : the impossibility of imposing consistency on the text compels us to seek its global meanings not in the realm of events themselves , but in that of their constructive principle , the very thing that is responsible for lack of focus .
If no such meaningful principle were discoverable , Dick 's novels would have to be called mystifications , since any work must justify itself either on the level of what it presents literally or on the level of deeper semantic content , not so much overtly present in as summoned up by the text .
Indeed ,
Dick 's works teem with non sequiturs , and any sufficiently sensitive reader can without difficulty make up lists of incidents which flout logic and experience alike .
But — to repeat what was already said in other ways — what is inconsistency in literature ?
It is a symptom either of incompetence or else of repudiation of some values ( such as credibility of incidents or their logical coherence ) for the sake of other values .
Here we come to a ticklish point in our discussion , since the values alluded to cannot be objectively compared .
There is no universally valid answer to the question whether it is permissible to sacrifice order for the sake of vision in a creative work — everything depends on what kind of order and what kind of vision are involved .
Dick 's novels have been variously interpreted .
There are critics , such as Sam Lundwall , who say that Dick is cultivating an " offshoot of mysticism " in SF .
It is not , though , a question of mysticism in the religious sense , but rather of occult phenomena .
Ubik furnishes some grounds for such a conclusion — does not the person who ousts Ella Runciter 's soul from her body behave like a " possessing spirit " ?
Does not he metamorphose into various incarnations when fighting with Joe Chip ?
So such an approach is admissible .
Another critic ( George Turner ) has denied all value in Ubik , declaring that the novel is a pack of conflicting absurdities — which can be demonstrated with pencil and paper .
I think , however , that the critic should not be the prosecutor of a book but its defender , though one not allowed to lie : he may only present the work in the most favorable light .
And because a book full of meaningless contradictions is as worthless as one that holds forth about vampires and other monstrous revenants , since neither of them touches on problems worthy of serious consideration , I prefer my account of Ubik to all the rest .
The theme of catastrophe had been so much worked over in SF that it seemed to be played out until Dick 's books became a proof that this had been a matter of frivolous mystification .
For science - fictional endings of the world were brought about either by man himself , e.g. by unrestrained warfare , or by some cataclysm as extrinsic as it was accidental , which thus might equally well not have happened at all .
Dick , on the other hand , by introducing into the annihilation ploy — the tempo of which becomes more violent as the action progresses — also instruments of civilization such as hallucinogens , effects such a commingling of the convulsions of technology with those of human experience that it is no longer apparent just what works the terrible wonders — a
Deus ex machina or a machina ex Deo , historical accident or historical necessity .
It is difficult to elucidate Dick 's position in this regard , because in particular novels he has given mutually incongruent answers to this question .
Appeal to transcendence appears now as a mere possibility for the reader 's conjectures , now as a diagnostic near - certainty .
In Ubik , as we have said , a conjectural solution which refuses to explain events in terms of some verion of occultism or spiritualism finds support in the bizarre technology of " half - life " as the last chance offered by medicine to people on the point of death .
But already in The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch transcendental evil emanates from the titular hero — that is , by the way , rather lowgrade metaphysics , being akin to hack treatments of " supernatural visitations " and " ghost , " and all that saves the thing from turning into a fiasco is the author 's virtuosity as a storyteller .
And in Galactic Pot -Healer we have to do with a fabulous parable about a sunken cathedral on some planet and about the struggle which takes place between Light and Darkness over raising it , so that the last semblance of literalness of events vanishes here .
Dick is , so I instinctively judge , perfidious in that he does not give unambiguous answers to the questions provoked by reading him , in that he strikes no balances and explains nothing " scientifically , " but rather just confounds things , not only in the plot itself but with respect to a superordinated category : the literary convention within which the story unfolds .
For all that Galactic Pot -Healer leans toward allegory , it does not adopt this position either unambiguously or definitively , and a like indeterminacy as to genre is also characteristic for other novels by Dick , perhaps to an even higher degree .
We thus encounter here the same difficulty about genre placement of a work which we have met with in the writing of Kafka .
It should be emphasized that the genre affiliation of a creative work is not an abstract problem of interest only to theorists of literature , but is an indispensable prerequisite to the reading of a work ; the difference between the theorist and the ordinary reader reduces itself to the fact that the latter places the book he has read in a specific genre automatically , under the influence of his internalized experiences — in the same way that we employ our native language automatically , even when we do not know its morphology or syntax from specialized studies .
The convention proper to a concrete genre becomes fixed with the passage of time and is familiar to every qualified reader ; consequently " everybody knows " that in a realistic novel the author cannot cause his hero to walk through closed doors , but can on the other hand reveal to the reader the content of a dream which the hero has and forgets before he wakes up ( although the one thing is as impossible as the other from a common sense point of view ) .
The convention of the detective story requires that the perpetrator of a crime be found out , while the convention of SF requires rational accounting for events that are quite improbable and even seemingly at odds with logic and experience .
On the other hand , the evolution of literary genres is based precisely on violation of storytelling conventions which have already become static .
So Dick 's novels in some measure violate the convention of SF , which can be accounted to him as merit , because they thereby acquire broadened meanings having allegorical import .
This import cannot be exactly determined ; the indefiniteness which originates in this way favors the emergence of an aura of enigmatic mystery about the work .
What is involved is a modern authorial strategy which some people may find intolerable , but which cannot be assailed with factual arguments , since the demand for absolute purity of genres is becoming nowadays an anachronism in literature .
The critics and readers who hold Dick's " impurity " with respect to genre against him are fossilized traditionalists , and a counterpart to their attitude would be an insistence that prosaists should keep on writing in the manner of Zola and Balzac , and only thus .
In the light of the foregoing observations one can understand better the peculiarity and uniqueness of the place occupied by Dick in SF .
His novels throw many readers accustomed to standard SF into abiding confusion , and give rise to complaints , as naive as they are wrathful , that Dick , instead of providing " precise explanations " by way of conclusion , instead of solving puzzles , sweeps things under the rug .
In relation to Kafka analogous objections would consist in demanding that The Metamorphosis should conclude with an explicit " entomological justification , " making plain when and under what circumstances a normal man can turn into a bug , and that The Trial should explain just what Mr. K. is accused of .
PHILIP DICK DOES NOT LEAD his critics an easy life , since he does not so much play the part of a guide through his phantasmagoric worlds as he gives the impression of one lost in their labyrinth .
He has stood all the more in need of critical assistance , but has not received it , and has gone on writing labeled a " mystic " and thrown back entirely on his own resources .
There is no telling whether or how his work would have changed if it had come under the scrutinies of genuine critics .
Perhaps such change would not have been all that much to the good .
A second characteristic trait of Dick 's work , after its ambiguity as to genre , is its tawdriness which is not without a certain charm , being reminiscent of the goods offered at county fairs by primitive craftsmen who are at once clever and naive , possessed of more talent than self - knowledge .
Dick has as a rule taken over a rubble of building materials from the run -of - the - mill American professionals of SF , frequently adding a true gleam of originality to already worn - out concepts and , what is surely more important , erecting with such material constructions truly his own .
The world gone mad , with a spasmodic flow of time and a network of causes and effects which wriggles as if nauseated , the world of frenzied physics , is unquestionably his invention , being an inversion of our familiar standard according to which only we , but never our environment , may fall victim to psychosis .
Ordinarily , the heroes of SF are overtaken only by two kinds of calamities : the social , such as the " infernos of police state tyranny , " and the physical , such as catastrophes caused by Nature .
Evil is thus inflicted on people either by other people ( invaders from the stars are merely people in monstrous disguises ) , or by the blind forces of matter .
With Dick the very basis of such a clear - cut articulation of the proposed diagnosis comes to grief .
We can convince ourselves of this by putting to Ubik questions of the order just noted : who was responsible for the strange and terrible things which happened to Runciter 's people ?
The bomb attack on the Moon was the doing of a competitor , but of course it was not in his power to bring about the collapse of time .
An explanation appealing to the medical " cold - pac " technology is , as we have pointed out , likewise incapable of rationalizing everything .
The gaps that separate the fragments of the plot cannot be eliminated , and they lead one to suspect the existence of some higher - order necessity which constitutes the destiny of Dick 's world .
Whether this destiny resides in the temporal sphere or beyond it is impossible to say .
When one considers to what an extent our faith in the infallible beneficence of technical progress has already waned , the fusion which Dick envisages between culture and nature , between the instrument and its basis , by virtue of which it acquires the aggressive character of a malignant neoplasm , no longer seems merely sheer fantasy .
This is not to say that Dick is predicting any concrete future .
The disintegrating worlds of his stories , as it were inversions of Genesis , order returning to Chaos — this is not so much the future foreseen as it is future shock , not straightforwardly expressed but embodied in fictional reality , it is an objectivized projection of the fears and fascinations proper to the human individual in our times .
It has been customary to identify the downfall of civilization falsely and narrowly with regression to some past stage of history — even to the caveman or downright animal stage .
Such an evasion is often employed in SF , since inadequacy of imagination takes refuge in oversimplified pessimism .
Then we are shown the remotest future as a lingering state of feudal , tribal or slave - holding society , inasmuch as atomic war or invasion from the stars is supposed to have hurled humanity backward , even into the depths of a prehistoric way of life .
To say of such works that they advocate the concepts of some cyclic ( e.g. Spenglerian ) philosophy of history would amount to maintaining that a motif endlessly repeated by a phonograph record represents the concept of some sort of " cyclic music , " whereas it is merely a matter of a mechanical defect resulting from a blunt needle and worn grooves .
So works of this sort do not pay homage to cyclic historiosophy , but merely reveal an insufficiency of sociological imagination , for which the atomic war or the interstellar invasion is only a convenient pretext for spinning out interminable sagas of primordial tribal life under the pretense of portraying the farthest future .
Nor is it possible to hold that such books promulgate the " atomic credo " of belief in the inevitability of a catastrophe which will soon shatter our civilization , since the cataclysm in question amounts to nothing but an excuse for shirking more important creative obligations .
Such expedients are foreign to Dick .
For him , the development of civilization continues , but is as it were crushed by itself , becoming monstrous at the heights of its achievement — which , as a prognostic viewpoint , is more original than the assuredly unilluminating thesis that , if technical civilization breaks down , people will be forced to get along by returning to primitive tools , even to bludgeons and flints .
Alarm at the impetus of civilization finds expression nowadays in the slogans of a " return to Nature " after smashing and discarding everything " artificial , " i.e. science and technology .
These pipe dreams turn up also in SF .
Happily , they are absent in Dick .
The action of his novels takes place in a time when there can no longer be any talk of return to nature or of turning away from the " artificial , " since the fusion of the " natural " with the " artificial " has long since become an accomplished fact .
At this point it may be worthwhile to point out the dilemma encountered by futuristically oriented SF .
According to an opinion quite generally held by readers , SF ought to depict the world of the fictional future no less explicitly and intelligibly than a writer such as Balzac depicted the world of his own time in The Human Comedy .
Whoever asserts this fails to take into account the fact that there exists no world beyond or above history and common to all eras or all cultural formations of mankind .
That which , as the world of The Human Comedy , strikes us an completely clear and intelligible , is not an altogether objective reality , but is only a particular interpretation ( of nineteenth century vintage and hence close to us ) of a world classified , understood and experienced in a concrete fashion .
The familiarity of Balzac 's world thus signifies nothing more than the simple fact that we have grown perfectly accustomed to this account of reality and that consequently the language of Balzac 's characters , their culture , their habits and ways of satisfying spiritual and bodily needs , and also their attitude toward nature and transcendence seem to us transparent .
However , the movement of historical changes may infuse new content into concepts thought of as fundamental and fixed , as for example the notion of " progress , " which according to nineteenth - century attitudes was equivalent to a confident optimism , convinced of the existence of an inviolable boundary separating what is harmful to man from what benefits him .
Currently we begin to suspect that the concept thus established is losing its relevance , because the harmful ricochets of progress are not incidental , easily eliminated , adventitious components of it but are rather such a cost of gains achieved as , at some point along the way , liquidates all the gain .
In short , absolutizing the drive toward " progress " could prove to be a drive toward ruin .
So the image of the future world cannot be limited to adding a certain number of technical innovations , and meaningful prediction does not lie in serving up the present larded with startling improvements or revelations in lieu of the future .
The difficulties encountered by the reader of a work placed in a remote historical period are not the result of any arbitrariness on the writer 's part , any predilection for " estrangements , " any wish to shock the reader or to lead him up the garden , but are an ineradicable part of such an artistic undertaking .
Situations and concepts can be understood only through relating them to ones already known , but when too great a time interval separates people living in different eras there is a loss of the basis for understanding in common life experiences which we unreflectingly and automatically imagine to be invariant .
It follows that an author who truly succeeded in delineating an image of the far future would not achieve literary success , since he would assuredly not be understood .
Consequently , in Dick 's stories a truth - value can be ascribed only to their generalized basis , which can be summed up more or less as follows : when people become ants in the labyrinths of the technosphere which they themselves have built , the idea of a return to Nature not only becomes utopian but cannot even be meaningfully articulated , because no such thing as a Nature that has not been artificially transformed has existed for ages .
We today can still talk of " return to Nature , " because we are relics of it , only slightly modified in biological respect within civilization , but try imagining the slogan " return to Nature " uttered by a robot — why , it would mean turning into deposits of iron ore !
The impossibility of civilization 's returning to Nature , which is simply equivalent to the irreversibility of history , leads Dick to the pessimistic conclusion that looking far into the future becomes such a fulfillment of dreams of power over matter as converts the ideal of progress into a monstrous caricature .
This conclusion does not inevitably follow from the author 's assumptions , but it constitutes an eventuality which ought also to be taken into account .
By the way , in putting things thus we are no longer summarizing Dick 's work , but are giving rein to reflections about it , for the author himself seems so caught up in his vision that he is unconcerned about either its literal plausibility or its non-literal message .
It is the more unfortunate that criticism has not brought out the intellectual consequences of Dick 's work and has not indicated the prospects inherent in its possible continuation , prospects and consequences advantageous not only for the author but for the entire genre , since Dick has presented us not so much with finished accomplishments as with fascinating promises .
It has , indeed , been just the other way round — criticism inside the field has instinctively striven somehow to domesticate Dick 's creations , to restrain their meanings , emphasizing what in them is similar to the rest of the genre , and saying nothing about what is different — insofar as it did not simply denounce them as worthless for that difference .
In this behavior a pathological aberration of the natural selection of literary works is emphatically apparent , since this selection ought to separate workmanlike mediocrity from promising originality , not lump these together , for such a " democratic " proceeding in practice equates the dross to the good metal .
Let us admit , however , that the charms of Dick 's books are not unalloyed , so that it is with them somewhat as it is with the beauty of certain actresses , whom one had better not inspect too carefully at close range , on pain of being sadly disillusioned .
There is no point in estimating the futurological likelihood of such details in this novel as those apartment and refrigerator doors which the tenant is forced to argue with — for these are fictional ingredients created for the purpose of doing two jobs at once : to introduce the reader into a world decidedly different from the present - day one , and to convey a certain message to him by means of this world .
Every literary work has two components in the above sense , since every one exhibits a given factual world and says something by means of that world .
Yet in different genres and different works the ratio between the two components varies .
A realistic work of fiction contains a great deal of the first component and very little of the second , as it portrays the real world , which in its own right , that is outside the book , does not constitute any sort of message , but merely exists and flourishes .
Nevertheless , because the author , of course , makes particular choices when writing a literary work , these choices give it the character of a statement addressed to the reader .
In an allegorical work there is a minimum of the first component and a maximum of the second , seeing that its world is in effect an apparatus signaling the actual content — the message — to the receiver .
The tendentiousness of allegorical fiction is usually obvious , that of the realistic kind more or less well - concealed .
There are no works whatsoever without tendentiousness ; if anyone speaks of such , what he actually has in mind is works devoid of expressly emphasized tendentiousness , which cannot be " translated " into the concrete credo of a world view .
The aim of the epic e.g. , is precisely to construct a world which can be interpreted in a number of ways — as the reality outside of literature can be interpreted in a number of ways .
If , however , the sharp tools of criticism ( of the structural kind , for instance ) are applied to the epic , it is possible to detect the tendentiousness hidden even in such works , because the author is a human being and by that token a litigant in the existential process , hence complete impartiality is unattainable for him .
Unfortunately , it is only from realistic prose that one can appeal directly to the real world .
Therefore , the bane of SF is the desire — doomed from the start to failure — to depict worlds intended at one and the same time to be products of the imagination and to signify nothing , i.e. not to have the character of a message but to be as it were on a par with the things in our environment , from furniture to stars , as regards their objective self - sufficiency .
This is a fatal error lodged at the roots of SF , for where deliberate tendentiousness is not allowed involuntary tendentiousness seeps in .
By tendency we mean a partisan bias , or point of view which can not be divinely objective .
An epic may strike us as just that objective , because the how of its presentation ( the viewpoint ) is for us imperceptibly concealed under the what — the epic too is a partisan account of events , but we do not notice its tendentiousness because we share its bias and can not get outside it .
We discover the bias of the epic centuries later , when the passage of time has transformed the standards of " absolute objectivity " and we can perceive , in what passed for a truthful report , the manner in which " truthful reporting " was at one time understood .
For there are no such things as truth or objectivity in the singular ; both of these contain an irreducible coefficient of historical relativity .
Now , SF can never be on a par with the epic , since what the SF work presents belongs to one time ( most often the future ) , while how it tells its story belongs to another time , the present .
Even if imagination succeeds in rendering plausible how it might be , it cannot break completely with the way of apprehending events which is peculiar to the here and now .
This way is not only an artistic convention , it is considerably more — a type of classification , interpretation and rationalization of the visible world that is peculiar to an era .
Consequently the problem content of an epic can be deeply hidden , but that of SF must be legible , otherwise the story , declining to deal with nonfictional problems and not achieving epic objectivity , slides fatally down and comes to rest on some such support as the stereotype of the fairy tale , the adventure thriller , the myth , the framework of the detective story , or some hybrid as eclectic as it is trashy .
A way out of the dilemma may consist in works for which componential analysis , designed to separate what is " factual " from what forms the " message " ( " seen " from a " viewpoint " ) , proves altogether impracticable .
The reader of such a work does not know whether what he is shown is supposed to exist like a stone or a chair , or whether it is supposed also to signify something beyond itself .
The indeterminacy of such a creation is not diminished by its author 's commentaries , since the author can be mistaken in these , like a man who tries to explain the real meaning of his own dreams .
Hence I consider Dick 's own comments to be inessential to the analysis of his works .
At this point we might embark on an excursus about the origin of Dick 's science - fictional concepts , but let just one example from Ubik suffice : to wit , the name which figures as the title of the book .
It comes from the Latin ubique ' everywhere . '
This is a blend ( contamination ) of two heterogeneous concepts : the concept of the Absolute as eternal and unchanging order which goes back to systematizing philosophy , and the concept of the " gadget " — the handy little device for use on appropriate everyday occasions , a product of the conveyer - belt technology of the consumer society , whose watchword is making things easy for people at whatever they do , from washing clothes to getting a permanent wave .
This " canned Absolute , " then , is the result of the collision and interpenetration of two styles of thought of different ages , and at the same time of the incarnation of abstraction in the guise of a concrete object .
Such a proceeding is an exception to the rule in SF and is Dick 's own invention .
It is hardly possible to create , in the way just noted , objects which are empirically plausible or which have a likelihood of ever coming into existence .
Accordingly in the case of Ubik it is a matter of a poetic , i.e. metaphorical device and not of any " futurological " one .
Ubik plays an important part in the story , emphasized still more by the " advertisements " for it which figure as epigraphs to each chapter .
Is it a symbol , and , if so , of just what ?
This is not easy to answer .
An Absolute conjured out of sight by technology , supposed to save man from the ruinous consequences of Chaos or Entropy much as a deodorant shields our sense of smell from the stench of industrial effluents , is not only a demonstration of a tactic typical nowadays ( combating , for example , the side effects of one technology by means of another technology ) , it is an expression of nostalgia for a lost ideal kingdom of untroubled order , but also an expression of irony , since this " invention " of course cannot be taken seriously .
Ubik moreover plays in the novel the part of its " internal micromodel , " since it contains in nuce the whole range of problems specific to the book , those of the struggle of man against Chaos , at the end of which , after temporary successes , defeat inexorably awaits him .
The Absolute canned as an aerosol , which saves Joe Chip at the point of death — though only for the time being : will this , then , be a parable and the handwriting on the wall for a civilization which has degraded the Sacred by stuffing it into the Profane ?
Pursuing such a train of associations , Ubik could finally be seen as a take - off on the Greek tragedy , with the role of the ancient heroes , who strive vainly against Moira , assigned to the staff telepaths under the command of a big business executive .
If Ubik was not actually undertaken with this in mind , it in any case points in such a direction .
The writings of Philip Dick have deserved at least a better fate than that to which they were destined by their birthplace .
If they are neither of uniform quality nor fully realized , still it is only by brute force that they can be jammed into that pulp of materials , destitute of intellectual value and original structure , which makes up SF .
Its fans are attracted by the worst in Dick — the typical dash of American SF , reaching to the stars , and the headlong pace of action moving from one surprise to the next — but they hold it against him that , instead of unraveling puzzles , he leaves the reader at the end on the battlefield , enveloped in the aura of a mystery as grotesque as it is strange .
Yet his bizarre blendings of hallucinogenic and palingenetic techniques have not won him many admirers outside the ghetto walls , since there readers are repelled by the shoddiness of the props he has adopted from the inventory of SF .
Indeed , these writings sometimes fumble their attempts ; but I remain after all under their spell , as it often happens at the sight of a lone imagination 's efforts to cope with a shattering superabundance of opportunities — efforts in which even a partial defeat can resemble a victory .
ABSTRACT
Philip
Dick does not lead his critics an easy life , sincehe does not so much play the part of a guide through his phantasmagoric worlds as give the impression of one lost in their labyrinth .
He has stood all the more in need of critical assistance , but he has not received it .
A characteristic of Dick s work , after its ambiguity as to genre , is its tawdriness , which is reminiscent of the goods offered at country fairs by primitive craftsmen who are at once clever and naive , possessed of more talent than self - knowledge .
Dick has as a rule taken over a rubble of building materials from the run -of - the - mill American professionals of SF , frequently adding a true gleam of originality to worn - out concepts , and erecting with such materials constructions truly his own .
The world gone mad , with a spasmodic flow of time and a network of causes and effects which wriggles as if nauseated , the world of frenzied physics , is unquestionably his invention .
If Dicks writings are neither of uniform quality nor fully realized , still it is only by brute force that they can be jammed into that pulp of materials , destitute of intellectual value and original structure , which makes up SF .

Chris WF - the blog is back
This is a blog about me , my life and escpecially my interests .
“ 9/11 TRUTH NOW !!! ”
I first noticed the Obama birther nonsense in MySpace bulletins .
The screennames shoutinghave been transitioning to a new “ cover - up ” obsession ever since .
Yet this never comes up in media examination of birtherism ; even Chris Matthews , who ’s been running a clinic lately on how to crack wingnuts , has n’t taken up this question .
In part , I think that shortfall is mostly due to the MSM ’s problems with social media in general .
Network reporters can build Twitter audiences very easily by announcing their URLs on the air .
They ’ve never had to build an audience ; consequently , they do n’t have a clue about Digg , StumbleUpon , or how they work .
Nevertheless , the recent rise in birther activity has led the MSM to begin picking up the electronic breadcrumbs at last .
The Washington Independent noted a commonality of origin in birtherism and 9/11 “ truth ” today :
In the final months of the 2008 presidential race , Sen. John McCain ’s ( R - Ariz . ) campaign learned of a lawsuit filed in Pennsylvania that asked the state to strip Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) of the Democratic nomination on suspicion that he was not an American citizen .
The complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief was filed by Phil Berg , a former deputy state attorney general who left government in 1990 for a series of gadfly political campaigns .
His last round of notoriety had come when he filed RICO complaints against George W. Bush , Saddam Hussein and multiple members of the Bush administration for “ accountability ” for the 9/11 attacks .
( Emphasis mine )
Like 9/11 conspiracy theory ,
A survey of the lawsuits filed against Obama reveals a reliance on widely debunked rumors , bogus stories sourced back to web sites , affidavits from “ experts ” who refuse to provide credentials or even their real names , and frequent and blatant misunderstandings of basic constitutional law .
The dismissal of “ birther ” lawsuits has allowed conspiracy theorists to believe that the information in those suits is accurate–a belief that manifests itself in the emails , phone calls , and town hall meeting rants that have pushed the theories into the mainstream media and the halls of Congress .
Matthews did great work the other night .
But next time he talks to a birther , he might try sounding them out about some other famous conspiracies .
Birtherism is part of a larger pattern of paranoid maladjustment : why not ask them if they believe in Illuminati airplanes leaving chemtrails in the skies ?
The World Health Organization announced on Saturday an increase in the number of confirmed cases of swine flu , but said there was no evidence of sustained community spread outside of North America , which would lead to raising the pandemic alert .
“ At the present time , I would still propose that a pandemic is imminent because we are seeing transmission to other countries , ” Dr. Michael J. Ryan , the director of the World Health Organization global alert and response team , said in a teleconference on Saturday from Geneva .
“ We have to expect that Phase 6 will be reached .
We have to hope that it is not . ”
The organization said that 15 countries had reported a total of 615 cases of the infection , officially known as influenza A( H1N1 ) , up from 367 cases late Friday .
Dr. Ryan said that several countries in Europe reported additional confirmed cases on Saturday , including France , Germany , Spain , Great Britain , Israel , but he added : “ There are a very small number of cases , it is very limited .
At this stage it would be unwise to say that those events are out of control . ”
In the United States , the number of confirmed cases rose to 160 in 21 states , up from 141 cases in 19 states , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Saturday morning .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The number of Americans collecting long - term unemployment aid fell to the lowest in three months in mid-July , according to government data that implied a slowing pace of layoffs as the economy stabilizes .
The U.S. Labor Department said that while initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits rose by 25,000 to a seasonally adjusted 584,000 last week , the number of people still on benefit rolls after collecting an initial week of aid fell by 54,000 to 6.20 million in the week to July 18 , the lowest since early April .
In addition , the four - week moving average for new claims , considered to be a better gauge of underlying trends , fell by 8,250 to 559,000 , the lowest since late January .
The weekly moving average has declined for five straight weeks .
New applications for unemployment benefits have in recent weeks been distorted by automobile plant closures for retooling which normally happens in July .
Further , automobile plant closures related to General Motors and Chrysler bankruptcies have also caused volatility , making it difficult to gauge labor market trends .
Analysts said the general trend , however , was still toward a slowdown in the rate of layoffs , as illustrated by a consistent decline in the four - week moving average for new claims .
This measure irons out weekly volatility .
“ It is becoming increasingly evident that the underlying pace of layoffs is slowing , ” said Stephen Stanley , an economist at RBS Securities in Greenwich , Connecticut .
“ The reality , outside of the auto sector at least , is that layoffs have probably been moderating steadily for several months . ”
The weekly jobs data , together with a string of stronger - than - expected quarterly corporate profits , sparked a further rally in U.S. stocks on Thursday .
The benchmark Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index .SPX briefly rose to its highest intraday level in almost nine months and came within striking distance of the key 1,000 level .
Recent data , including home sales and prices , have added to growing optimism that the recession is ending but high unemployment still weighs on consumer sentiment , which could result in the anticipated economic recovery being feeble .
But President Barack Obama sounded a word of caution , telling reporters that second quarter gross domestic product ( GDP ) data due on Friday would show the economy contracted and job losses were still a “ huge ” problem .
A Reuters survey forecast GDP fell at a 1.5 percent annual rate in the second quarter after dropping 5.5 in the January - March period .
Analysts reckon the economy will start growing in the third quarter , partly lifted by the government ’s $ 787 billion stimulus package .
Initial jobless claims are being monitored for signs of stability in the labor market and the number of laid off workers on jobless rolls fell for a third straight week .
The insured unemployment rate , which measures the percentage of the insured labor force who are jobless , was unchanged at 4.7 percent in the week ended July 18 , remaining at that level for a third consecutive week .
Analysts said the sustained decline in continuing claims raised the chances of a less steep decline in July nonfarm payrolls data , due to be released next week .
“ More to my liking is that continued claims are falling .
There is the possibility that July ’s payroll number could be better but that number could be suspect because of auto and seasonal adjustments in July , ” said Lee Olver , a fixed income strategist at SMH Capital in Houston , Texas .
A Reuters survey forecast U.S. nonfarm payrolls would be down 340,000 in July after shrinking 467,000 in June .
The unemployment rate is forecast to rise to 9.7 percent from 9.5 .

Luxemburg 's official grave may have contained the wrong body , experts say An unidentified corpse found in the basement of a Berlin hospital could be that of murdered revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg , say German authorities .
A pathologist at Berlin's Charite hospital told Der Spiegel magazine the headless corpse bore " striking similarities " to the left - wing icon .
Ms Luxemburg was murdered by right - wing paramilitaries in 1919 at the age of 47 and thrown in an icy canal .
Months later , a body thought to have been hers was retrieved and buried .
The grave , in Berlin 's Freidrichsfelde cemetery , has since become a place of pilgrimage for communists , feminists and left - wing activists .
But Michael Tsokos , head of the hospital 's Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensics Science department , told Der Spiegel that he doubted the identity of the corpse that was buried there .
He pointed to several inconsistencies in the post mortem examination his predecessors at the hospital had carried out on the interred body , which made him question its conclusions .
We hope that the identity of the body is clarified as soon as possible so that whoever it may be will finally be laid to rest
Murat Cakir
Rosa Luxemburg Foundation
These included the fact that the pathologists made no mention of the hip defect and differing leg lengths which made Luxemburg limp all her life .
The body also showed no sign of the rifle butt blows Ms Luxemburg is known to have received to her skull nor of the bullet in the head which is believed to have killed her .
In contrast , the body which Mr Tsokos found two years ago showed clear signs of having been waterlogged , said Der Spiegel .
Further tests showed the corpse was a woman aged between 40 and 50 , who had suffered from osteoarthritis and had legs of different lengths .
The missing extremities could be explained by anecdotal evidence that weights were tied to Ms Luxemburg 's hands and feet before she was thrown into the canal , said Mr Tsokos .
When the water froze , it could have separated them from the body .
The corpse , said Mr Tsokos , bore " striking similarities to the real Rosa Luxemburg " .
' Disturbing '
The Luxemburg grave is visited by millions every year Mr Tsokos told the DDP news agency there had been rumours for many years that Ms Luxemburg 's body was actually in the hospital .
He said he had been searching for DNA samples to test against the body since he found it - stamps used by Ms Luxemburg had given no insight so he was hoping to be able to find samples of her clothing .
" A hat would be nice , " he said , as it could contain strands of her hair .
Murat Cakir , a spokesman for the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation , told the Local paper it was " conceivable that the authorities at the time made sure [ the body ] would disappear " .
" But it 's also disturbing that her body could have been in a hospital cellar for the last 90 years , " he said .
" We hope that the identity of the body is clarified as soon as possible so that whoever it may be will finally be laid to rest . "
Tests on the body buried in Berlin are not possible , as the grave was desecrated in the Nazi era and the remains removed .
But Mr Cakir said that when and if the identity of the corpse was discovered , Ms Luxemburg 's legacy would not be affected .
" The world over she is thought of as a revolutionary forward thinker - millions visit her grave each year - and she will always be this , regardless of where her body rests , " he said .

( CNN ) -- North Korea may be preparing for a new atomic bomb test a month after its last test , a U.S. official said Thursday .
This screen grab from North Korean television on April 9 shows leader Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang .
The official , who is not authorized to speak on the record , told CNN that Washington has " indications " that North Korea may be planning another test , which would be its third since 2006 .
The official would not provide any details , however .
The possible preparations come as the U.N. Security Council debates whether to impose additional sanctions on the communist state in response to its May 25 test of a nuclear device , as well as several subsequent missile tests .
Susan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said Wednesday that North Korea " must pay a price " for its defiance of the international community , which has demanded Pyongyang halt those tests .
In July 2008 , U.S. , Russian , Chinese , Japanese and South Korean negotiators reached an agreement with North Korea for it to resume the disablement of its nuclear facilities .
But the deal has faltered over plans to allow the other parties to verify whether Pyongyang has revealed all of its nuclear secrets .
North Korea has since threatened to restart its nuclear fuel plant at Yongbyon .
Stephen Bosworth , the Obama administration 's special representative for North Korea , told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday that all parties -- including China , long North Korea 's major ally -- have agreed to " coordinated steps " to get North Korea to reverse its recent moves away from the six - party agreement .
" On our recent trip , we find that China shared a deep concern about North Korea 's recent actions and a strong commitment to achieve denuclearization , " Bosworth said .
" Our challenge now is to work with China to turn that commitment into effective implementation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions . "
But Victor Cha , the former Asia director at the U.S. National Security Council , told the committee that additional sanctions could result in a new North Korean test .
" When the Bush administration undertook some of these financial measures , many people argued it led to North Korea 's first nuclear test , " Cha said .
" And the question arises whether these financial measures will then lead North Korea to their third nuclear test .
And I do n't think we know the answer to that . "
Earlier this month , the eldest son of North Korean leader Kim Jong
Il , in a rare television interview , shed some light on who might eventually take over the secretive Communist nation .
Kim Jong Nam told TV Asahi , a Japanese television network , in Macau that he does not care about politics or about succeeding his father .
Kim Jong
Il is widely reported to have suffered a stroke in August and has been absent from many public functions in recent months .
In April , he named his son , Kim Jong Un , and brother - in - law , Jang Song Thaek , to the country 's powerful National Defense Commission , suggesting his third son may be his heir .
" I hear that news in the media , " Kim Jong Nam said .
" I think it 's true ... however , it is my father 's decision .
So once he decides , we have to support him . "

Plus , read more insight on Iran 's election from other Daily Beast writers .
The Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran ’s supreme leader and the country ’s most powerful man , has unwittingly transformed a protest into a revolution .
“ If there is any bloodshed , leaders of the protests will be held directly responsible , ” he warned Friday , in an attempt to put an end to accusations of voter fraud in the presidential election that returned Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power .
“ The Islamic republic would not cheat and would not betray the vote of the people . ”
What Khamenei seems not to recognize is that the uprising in Iran is no longer about a disputed election .
It is about his own legitimacy as Iran ’s supreme leader .
In throwing down the gauntlet to the protesters , Khamenei spoke with the confidence of a man who believes his is the final word on all matters legal and religious .
In his speech he even implied that questioning his decision on the matter would be tantamount to questioning the authority of the Prophet Muhammad .
But what Khamenei seems not to recognize is that the uprising in Iran is no longer about a disputed election .
It is about his own legitimacy as Iran ’s supreme leader .
It is about the very notion of clerical rule .
It is , ultimately , about the future of the Islamic republic .
Iran ’s confusing and convoluted political structure consists of two parallel governments .
The first , meant to represent the sovereignty of the people , includes a ( usually ) popularly elected president , a parliament charged with creating and debating laws , and a fairly independent judiciary whose task it is to interpret those laws .
The second , “ shadow ” government , meant to represent the sovereignty of God , consists of the supreme leader and a host of powerful subcommittees with wonderfully Orwellian names like the Assembly of Experts or the Council of Guardians , whose primary function is to act as a bridge between the elected government and the unelected supreme leader .
Called Valayat-e Faqih , or “ Guardianship of the Jurist , ” this unique religio- political system was the brainchild of the founder of the Islamic republic , the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , who died in 1988 .
In theory , the faqih — what the West calls the supreme leader — was supposed to be the most learned religious authority in the country .
He was originally supposed to be a sort of pope - like figure that would ensure the Islamic nature of what would otherwise be a democratic state .
He would have moral and spiritual authority , and he would certainly wield enormous political influence , but he would by no means maintain direct political control over the state .
However , in the years following the revolution of 1979 , through a series of constitutional amendments pushed through parliament , the position of faqih was gradually transformed from a symbolic moral authority into the supreme authority of the state .
Suddenly , the faqih had the power to appoint the head of the judiciary , to be commander in chief of the army , to dismiss the president , and to veto all laws created by the parliament .
Originally intended to reconcile popular and divine sovereignty , these reforms essentially paved the way for the institutionalization of absolute clerical control .
The remarkable thing about Khomeini ’s innovative religio- political system is that it stood in contradiction to more than 1,000 years of Shiite theology .
Shiism is a messianic religion in that it eagerly awaits an “ End Times ” when the messiah ( called the Mahdi in Islam ) will return to sweep away the old order and replace it with the perfect state , the kingdom of God .
Hence , only a government administered by the messiah after he returns to earth can be considered legitimate .
A government run by human beings — whether monarchy , democracy , or theocracy — is considered a usurpation of the messiah ’s authority , which is why the religious clergy in Shiism have for centuries maintained a deep and abiding commitment to political quietism .
Khomeini argued , however , that in the absence of the messiah , the people must rely on his agents on earth ( i.e. , the clergy ) to carry out the messiah ’s duties and responsibilities .
That includes establishing the perfect state for him .
Simply put , rather than wait for the messiah to return to create the kingdom of God , the clergy should build the kingdom of God for him , thereby ushering in the messiah ’s return ( a uniquely Islamic take on Christian millenarianism ) .
For the vast majority of Khomeini ’s fellow ayatollahs , including practically all of his superiors , this was a scandalous idea .
Khomeini was accused of appropriating the authority of the messiah for himself ; in effect , declaring himself to be the long - awaited Mahdi .
Of course , Khomeini never made any such statement , nor did he ever explicitly identify himself with the Mahdi .
Rather , like any good messiah , he simply embraced the messianic imagery of the Mahdi and allowed his followers to draw their own conclusions .
For example , he eagerly accepted the title “ The Imam , ” an appellation reserved solely for the Mahdi when he returns to earth .
During Iran ’s horrific eight - year war with Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq , Khomeini cast the battle as revenge for the Sunni massacre of the Prophet Muhammad ’s grandson Husayn and his family at Karbala , even though such vengeance is the exclusive right of the Mahdi .
“ The blood of our martyrs [ is ] the continuation of the blood of the martyrs of Karbala , ” he proclaimed .
But by far the most overt connection Khomeini established between himself and the messiah was his doctrine of the Valayat-e Faqih .
In Khomeini ’s view , the faqih would have more than just supreme authority , he would have infallible and divine authority — authority that , in fact , would be equal to the authority of the Prophet Muhammad .
“ If a knowledgeable and just faqih undertakes the task of forming the government , then he will run the social affairs that the Prophet used to run and it is the duty of the people to listen to him and obey him , ” Khomeini wrote in his magnum opus Islamic Government .
“ This ruler will have as much control over running the people ’s administration , welfare and policy as the Prophet … had , despite the special virtues and the traits that distinguished the Prophet … [ he will have ] the same power as the Most Noble Messenger … in the administration of the society … [ he ] will hold the supreme power in the government and management and the control of social and political affairs of the people in the same way as the Prophet . ”
This was a startling , some would say heretical , statement , but it was vital to Khomeini ’s success in achieving absolute power .
By linking his own authority with the infallible authority of the prophet of God , Khomeini was able to reinterpret traditional Shiism to give him absolutely and unquestioned authority over the state .
When Khomeini died , that authority was passed down not to the next senior - most ayatollah in Iran , as the doctrine of Valayat-e Faqih would require , but to a midlevel cleric who was not even an ayatollah at the time : Ali Khamenei .
There was a simple reason for this .
The senior - most ayatollah and the man who , according to the doctrine , should have been supreme leader was the Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri , who publicly rejected the theory of the Valayat-e Faqih and , as a result , has spent the last three decades under house arrest .
( Montazeri is still the country ’s highest religious authority and has thrown his full support behind the uprising . )
Khamenei was chosen to succeed Khomeini because he was considered a safe bet , someone who would not rock the boat , someone who could be easily controlled by more powerful , more charismatic figures who chaired the various clerical subcommittees , like his fellow revolutionary Hashemi Rafsanjani ( now an ayatollah himself ) , who was instrumental in Khamenei ’s selection to the post of supreme leader .
Devoid of Khomeini ’s charisma and his religious credentials , Khamenei dropped into the background .
Throughout his term as faqih , he has consistently played the role of neutral interlocutor among the competing poles of power in Iran , always strenuously portraying himself as the above the fray of common politics .
This hands - off approach resulted in the gradual diffusion of the faqih ’s powers both to the subcommittees beneath him and , more disastrously , to the state ’s military - intelligence apparatus , the Revolutionary Guard , which has become arguably the most powerful force in Iranian politics ( see my piece on how the stolen elections represent a military coup by the Revolutionary Guard ) .
At the same time , the ranks of junior clergy studying in Iran ’s seminaries have begun increasingly to question the theological validity of the Valayat-e Faqih , especially now that Iraq ’s more traditionally inclined ( read : politically quiescent ) clergy , headed by perhaps the senior - most ayatollah in the world , Ali al - Sistani , have become increasingly active in Iran .
Now it seems Khamenei wants his divine authority back .
Yet by so enthusiastically — and , as even his confidants have admitted , inexplicably — inserting himself directly into the election controversy , he has destroyed his reputation as a “ divinely guided arbiter . ”
Worse , by so forcefully backing the unpopular Ahmadinejad , he has tainted himself with an aura of corruption and scandal .
In short , Khamenei has utterly , perhaps irreparably , damaged the office of supreme leader .
That is why the very people who helped put him in power 20 years ago are now trying to get rid of him .
( As I write this , Ayatollah Rafsanjani is currently in Qom trying to garner support from his fellow Assembly of Expert members to remove Khamenei from power . )
Simply put , Khamenei ’s reckless and rambling Friday sermon has changed the tenor of Iran ’s uprising , making it as much about his own leadership and the nature of clerical rule , as it is about Ahmadinejad ’s presidency .
He has , in other words , helped create a revolution .

Did you know that your amygdala stores every emotional response you choose to make ?
Or are you aware that the same responses – both good and bad – will become your reactions to any similar situations that arise ?
For a tiny sac of neurons , it zaps an ordinary day into havoc – like lightning strikes an iron rod , long before you ’re aware dragon moods strike .
Whenever your day jolts you off reliable tracks , it ’s likely the seething culprit , and in some brains it burns like fury just below the surface .
On the other hand recent research shows your amygdala is also key to socializing , and a larger amygdala means more friends and family involvement .
Want to tackle hot topics without shout outs ?
Perhaps you ’ve heard of the amygdala , or seen current research about its role in creating and storing emotional reactions to frightening situations .
But have you heard how it turns ordinary days into train wrecks ?
At times it ’s a matter of learning to let go , yet once its power over your day is discovered , you can guide the amygdala to work more in your favor .
It even helps you move from fear to freedom .
Are you aware of learning tools that add social and emotional health to all ?
Located deep within your brain ’s temporal lobes , this almond shaped mood bender , helps to shape and store reactions to unexpected shockers in your day .
Will you shout or smile ?
Will you freeze in fear or risk with courage ?
The little neuron group pretty much decides for you .
Sit through an upsetting meeting , and this tiny arousal center may well incite negative emotions i n response .
Have you seen it happen ?
There ’s more too .
This agitated control center engages brain stem circuits that impact facial expressions and body language .
It also triggers release of chemicals such as serotonin or cortisol into the blood , to trigger often unwanted emotional response .
It ’s even activated by nasty odors on occasion .
So why does the human brain come with such a pesky part ?
It ’s quite straightforward .
Without your amygdala , you ’d have no response to screams , cries for help , shocking movies , or other horrific encounters .
It can even help you to bypass bullies and cynics at work .
Unfortunately though , it tends to toss you into turmoil without much notice .
Can you see why people develop skills to tame dysfunctional thinking and modify behaviors that follow their amygdala triggers ?
You ’ve likely experienced how reactions impact and shape the human brain , in almost in knee - jerk responses .
Unwanted panic reactions pop up when you encounter sudden or startling situations , for instance .
It does n’t need to be that way .
Your amygdala can be tweaked to transform panic reactions into calm in the face of fear , anxiety , stress , or frustration encounters .
How does it happen ?
Meet the namungo gang !
Simply act deliberately in the opposite direction of any volatile , negative , or moody feelings .
If feeling fearful or if you are embarrassed , for instance , try disagreeing more with the brain in mind .
In this way , the very act of using a skill to disagree well , begins to rewire your brain for healthier responses in similar situations .
Simply put , you can learn to bypass your amygdala ‘s automatic default operations , in much the same way you choose to tap different buttons on a computer , to enter a different screen .
React in the default mode and your amygdala can heat up a situation by placing you in far too sensitive a mood , flooding your brain with cortisol chemicals , and causing you to overreact .
Caught under attack you ’ll respond accordingly , whether the attack is real or perceived , unless you intervene to help out your brain .
Because of your amygdala , you can develop and use different strategies to add calm under pressure , and as you build emotional patterns for dealing with stressors , you begin to see their practical usefulness .
Brain tactics help you to deal more calmly with life ’s difficult situations , simply by doing what you ’d like others to see in you .
Speaking of others – peers too can help tame an amygdala more than most people realize .
In fearful situations , others can support the opposite of fearful reactions for instance .
With another person ’s encouragement , your stored amygdala ’s typical fear response can suddenly fade or disappear – simply by support from a like minded individual .
Have emotional lightening strikes held you back , or do you snip your amygdala before you snipe back ?
Teach students transformation tone tips that amp up learning from diverse angles with a tamed amygdala !

Today we ’re moving on to the newest and latest of analytic crazes , defense .
With the advent and improvement of such statistics as UZR by Mitchel Lichtman , Total Zone Rating by Sean Smith , and +/- by John Dewan , defense has come into the spotlight as what many are calling “ the new OBP , ” signaling the newest of sabermetric crazes .
We ’ve now learned that defense can play a huge role in the success of a team .
Let ’s consider some numbers .
The Effect of Defense
UZR and most other metrics convert plays made into run values for teams .
As we know , run values are vitally important to statistical analysis because runs are how games are won and lost .
Systems like UZR and TZ use linear weight models .
models that have been used extensively in analyzing offense , for balls hit in certain zones and compares all players to the major league average .
In doing this it provides a reasonable number of “ runs saved ” by defensive players .
Runs can be simply translated into wins using the standard 10 runs / 1 win ratio .
Doing this provides some context to what teams like the Marlins are doing to help their pitching staffs , and gives us something quantifiable to use in judging a field that was previously held to only qualitative analyis .
Let ’s look at the extremes on either end of the UZR spectrum .
Data provided by FanGraphs .
Top 5 Defensive Teams ( UZR )
Tampa Bay Rays ( 35.3 )
Pittsburgh Pirates ( 30.0 )
Seattle Mariners ( 26.8 )
Detroit Tigers ( 26.7 )
Cincinatti Reds ( 24.1 )
Four of the five teams listed here are contenders in their division currently and were bottom - feeders last year .
As the Tampa Bay Rays taught us last year , vastly improving your defense can lead to a significant shift in the standings .
Even though it appears as if Seattle is saving 2.7 wins these season attributed to defense , the differences are drastic considering where these clubs were a year ago .
2007 Defensive Numbers ( UZR )
Pittsburgh ( - 26.2 )
Seattle ( - 20.9 )
Detroit ( - 39.1 )
Cincinnatti ( - 40.3 )
When compared to their numbers the previous year , the change is wins saved from year to year is far more dramatic .
Even if you expect and end - season line for the Tigers of about 35 runs above average , meaning the team did not change much more compared to the league average defensively in the second half , Detroit would have still netted around 74 runs better than their previous season on defense , good for a whopping 7.4 - win bonus to last year ’s record .
If Seattle ends the season about 35 runs better than average , thanks to their drastically improved outfield defense , they will have saved close to 56 runs , or 5.6 wins more than last season .
Often times , ballclubs benefit by just being in the positive defensively , even a more modest 8 - 10 runs better than average , because a larger number of teams are at the average or below .
In this day and age of teams trying to find every edge they can get to succeed , statistical defensive analysis has become a tool that has drastically affected the standings this year and last .
Which takes me to the bottom half of this analysis and our team of interest .
Bottom 5 Defensive Teams ( UZR )
Washington Nationals ( - 29.7 )
Cleveland Indians ( - 23.3 )
New York Mets ( - 22.2 )
Atlanta Braves ( - 21.7 )
Baltimore Orioles ( - 20.6 )
…
Florida Marlins ( - 20.0 )
I placed the ellipse to show that I was done writing the bottom five defensive squads by UZR , but the Marlins actually are n’t far from that list as the sixth worse squad in the majors .
None of these teams should come as any surprise to you .
The Nationals contain one of the worst defensive regulars in the game in Adam Dunn , the Mets have struggled all year long in fielding a baseball team that can actually field , thanks to injuries and their desire to find Daniel Murphy somewhere in the lineup , and the Braves have sported one of the worst regular outfields in the game thanks to their lack of range .
Three of the worst teams in baseball reside in the bottom five in defense , and if you look in years past this has often been the trend .
Check out last year :
Bottom 5 Defensive Teams , 2008 ( UZR )
Texas Rangers ( - 51.7 )
Los Angeles Dodgers ( - 48.0 )
New York Yankees ( - 44.5 )
Cincinatti Reds ( - 40.3 )
Detroit Tigers ( - 39.1 )
Two of those teams were in contention and one of them won their division ( though admittedly that was Dodgers and they won the NL West , the worst division in baseball last year ) , but the other three teams were among the worst in their respective divisions ( OK , the Rangers were n’t , but they were the third worst team in a bad division by Pythagorean expectation ) .
Now that I ’ve had my long diatribe about defense , let ’s talk a bit about the Marlins .
Defense :
Runs Allowed : 399
2009 Team UZR : - 20.0
2008 Team UZR : - 2.4
The Marlins seemingly made long strides last year to improve a squad that was close to dead last in defense the year before .
The team recorded essentially a league average UZR , backed by major improvement by middle infielders Hanley Ramirez and Dan Uggla and a monstrous range season by the surprising Cody Ross .
Of course , the team saw their state brethren in St. Pete go to the World Series on the back of the defense and Larry Beinfest came into the offseason looking to improve the team ’s biggest weakness .
Gone was the statue of Mike Jacobs at first base , and moving into that position was the more nimble Jorge Cantu , who also happened to be the team ’s terrible defensive third baseman last year .
Replacing Cantu at the hot corner was speedy middle infielder Emilio Bonifacio , acquired from the Nationals in the Josh Willingham - Scott Olsen deal .
The Marlins dealt Willingham and his subpar glove in left field and looked to replace it with Cameron Maybin in center .
On the surface these moves seemed to have improved the defense greatly .
The truth of the matter was that the Marlins ’ improvement the previous year was mostly a mirage .
This season the Marlins regressed to what they are defensively and then some .
Dan Uggla appeared to have benefited from Mike Jacobs ’ ineptitude at first , as his range has dropped significantly from last season .
Jeremy Hermida has turned into a boulder defensively , as he ’s posted one of the worst outfielder UZR ’s to date .
It turns out Ross was not in fact a +11 center fielder and instead was merely covering for the ground not made up by Willingham and Hermida .
Since UZR is broken down into many different parts , we can look at individual run measurements for things such as range , outfield arm , double plays , and errors .
Most differences between ballclubs involve range , as it is the largest component of UZR and indeed the first that was quantized by MGL in 2003 .
Two things really stand out for the Marlins this season :
1 ) Their double play runs , which have always been a team strength , are hurting the squad to the tune of - 4.1 runs , and 2 ) The Marlins outfield arms are costing the team 7.2 runs so far this year .
The arms are n’t surprising .
None of the Marlins ’ outfielders had strong guns in the past , and this year is no different .
However , the Marlins traded last season ’s only positively - rated arm , Willingham , away to the Nationals and replaced him with Cameron Maybin , who struggled a bit but was mostly a sample - size victim .
Ross in center field has an average arm , but his right field arm is not plus and he may have to remain in center to get the most of his defensive production .
The difference between last season and this season has been a total of six runs .
The double play runs are far more interesting figure .
Qualitatively , we ’ve watched Hanley and Danny botch a lot more double plays this year than in years past .
Uggla actually led all second basemen in double play runs the last three season , and Ramirez has been average for most of his career .
However , this season Uggla has rated as - 2 runs in terms of the double play , with Ramirez at - 1 run .
That being said , the difference is less than 3 runs over the course of half a season so far , so I would not get wound up about it .
Best Performer : Brett Carroll
I wanted to put a team regular in this spot , but no starter has been above league average this season , with only two players rating as essentially league average so far .
Carroll on the other hand has been nothing short of excellent during his limited time in the outfield , mostly in right field .
In only 142 innings in right field this season , Carroll has been worht 7.2 runs above average .
Overall , Carroll has been worth 9.3 runs better than the average outfielder , an impressive feat in such a small amount of playing time .
Carroll ’s best feature is his plus range ; he ’s been 6.4 runs better than the average outfielder with the same playing time .
His arm has been effective as well , worth 1.9 runs above average .
There are a multitude of sample size issues regarding this analysis however , and it ’s simply not possible for Carroll to be this good over a long stretch of time .
It is reasonable , given what we have qualitatively seen from him , that he could be a +10 to 15 run outfielder .
What we know of his bat is enough to say it would be a stretch for play long - term , but the Marlins are sacrificing a significant number of runs defensively by playing a lineup involving Hermida , Coghlan , and Ross in the outfield .
Carroll ’s glove so far has been worth almost a win above replacement .
If he brings a replacement bat with +15 run defense , that ’s almost a win over replacement for the entire year , passable if guys like Hermida and Coghlan wo n’t hit well enough in the corners anyway .
Worst Performer : Jeremy Hermida
There were a lot of players worthy of this nod , but Hermida ’s amazingly bad defensive year takes the cake .
Hermida can only play the corner outfield positions , limiting his options in getting his bat in the lineup .
And while his bat has been league average so far this season , he ’s erased any benefit of his increased walk rate and patience numbers by being truly atrocious in the outfield .
So far this season , Hermida has posted a whopping 12.9 runs below average playing both corner outfield positions .
In just the first half of the season , he has eclipsed each of his previous three season totals .
The value is truly staggering .
The last week or so since finding out just how bad he truly was , I ’ve been referring to Hermida ’s defense as Dunn -esque .
Adam Dunn of the Nationals is posting similar but more drastic numbers , posting an absurd 16.2 runs below average and fully eliminating his amazing offensive season to date .
Hermida has become Adam Dunn without the offensive ability .
He is still an average offensive player , or at least has been this season , but he has completely lost his range , currently almost 10 runs below average .
This has been clear qualitatively as well and , based on his previously poor track record on defense , can be expected to continue to some degree .
Hermida is plodding in the outfield , a surprise given his atheltic build .
He also has always lacked the arm for right field , sporting currently 3.2 runs below average in outfield arm runs .
Hermida has also only committed one error so far this year , but has been somewhat error - prone throughout his career .
Unlike many of the Marlins players on the field , there is n’t much hope for improvement for Hermida ’s terrible glove .
His value is severely deflated because he has been so poor in the outfield , and if the Marlins continue to run him out onto the field , he will continue to eat up runs in right field .
It ’s imperative the Fish rest him and Coghlan a total of two times a week in order to fit Carroll ’s plus glove to offset this sort of poor performance .
Key Second - Half Improvement : Emilio Bonifacio
It is rare for me to praise Bonifacio in a season where he has been atrocious with the stick , but I will admit that , since the Marlins are insisting on playing him full - time , he should make the most of the situation and play well .
His bat is a completely lost cause and will always be replacement level or worse .
However , his fielding at third base has improved over the course of the season , or at the very least has appeared to improve .
In my maddening rage at Bonifacio ’s inability at the plate , I failed to recognize the reasoning behind his struggles on the diamond .
He was posting an extremely poor UZR , but such small sample sizes were not really effective at telling the whole story of his defensive game .
Looking at the numbers now , he ’s at a more respectable but still reproachable 3.9 runs below average at third .
However , if you look at the breakdown of his numbers , the problems he is having are not in the all - important range category , but in the error mark .
Bonifacio leads all third basemen with 13 errors , but it is plausible to expect his error run total right now to improve if he begins to field the ball more cleanly .
Third base is a position prone for error , and if Bonifacio is indeed improving in his reflexes at the hot corner , he can perhaps cut down on his errors and allow the rest of the league ’s third baseman catch up .
Bonifacio has shown he has league average range at third so far this year .
If he can improve as he gets his bearings at the hot corner , he may be able to improve into the positives as he continues playing .
I do n’t doubt that it would take time , but if he can improve just slightly in his range this season ( again , small sample size issues in hoping for this , as the second - half ”s innings wo n’t be enough to be conclusive about anything ) and show a little more sure - handedness , he could become a + 2 run third baseman this season .
Currently he sits at - 4 runs , but the majority of those are error runs that ideally are behind him .
That being said , this is an improvement of six runs , almost a win but barely anything to get excited about .
Still , anything to improve Bonifacio ’s value can help at this point , as he continues his season - long ineptitude at the plate and Fredi continues to give him chances .

Next up , we ’ll look into the team ’s pitching staff and how the Marlins may have to ride two aces to the finish line if they want to compete in the NL East .
NEWARK -- A New Jersey assemblyman and the mayors of Hoboken and Secaucus were among public officials arrested this morning by FBI agents in an international money laundering and corruption probe that includes rabbis in the Syrian Jewish communities of Deal and Brooklyn .
Assemblyman Daniel Van Pelt ( R - Ocean ) , Hoboken Mayor Peter Cammarano , Secaucus Mayor Dennis Elwell and Jersey City Council President Mariano Vega are among those already brought to the FBI building in Newark .
Jersey City Deputy Mayor Leona Beldini has also been arrested .
A total of 30 people have been taken into custody , officials said .
The arrests are the result of a two - year FBI and IRS probe that began with an investigation of money transfers by members of the Syrian enclaves in Deal and Brooklyn .
Those arrested this morning include key religious leaders in the tight - knit , wealthy communities .
Hoboken Mayor Peter Cammarano III , Secaucus Mayor Dennis Elwell led in handcuffs into FBI building
The federal investigation then expanded into a public corruption probe .
No indictments have been released , though court appearances are expected later today in U.S. District Court in Newark .
Nearly 20 people have already been led into the FBI building in Newark as the sweep continues to unfold in two states .
Agents also raided religious institutions to make arrests and collect information .
The Monmouth County Prosecutor 's Office and the IRS took out at least three boxes from the Deal Yeshiva , as students were arriving at school .
The Deal Yeshiva , on the corner of Brighton and Norwood avenues , is a prestigious religious school in town .
Authorities also searched the Ohel Yaacob synagogue on Ocean Avenue in Deal and removed several boxes .
Assemblyman Van Pelt , 44 , is also the mayor of Ocean Township , a post he has held since 1988 .
He holds degrees from The College of New Jersey ( Criminal Justice ) and Regent University ( Public Policy and Government ) .
Cammarano , 32 , a Democrat , was elected mayor of Hoboken in June .
He was elected Hoboken City Councilman - at - Large in 2005 .
According to his campaign website , Cammarano is an attorney at the law firm of Genova , Burns , & Vernoia , which has offices in New Jersey , New York and Pennsylvania .
Cammarano previously worked as a law clerk for Superior Court Judge Kevin Callahan in Jersey City .
He is a member of the New Jersey State Bar Association and the Association of the Federal Bar of the State of New Jersey , as well as the bar associations for Hudson , Bergen and Essex Counties .
He has also worked as an adjunct professor at Montclair State University .
Elwell , 64 , has served for more than two decades as mayor and a member of the town council .
Elwell and his council slate recently won victory in their contested Democratic June primary contests .
Elwell is the president of a family - owned trucking company .
He is a former Secaucus Board of Education member and a decorated Vietnam combat veteran .
East Linda , CA must have a babies with a candy shortage , because postal worker Dean Hudson had to resort to stealing money out of children 's birthday cards .
Postal officials started an investigation after receiving complaints about opened mail .
The investigation led to Hudson pleading guilty to opening mail and taking money out of the birthday cards .
US District Judge Edward Garcia sentenced him to five months in federal prison followed by five months of home detention , and Hudson must pay nearly $ 3,000 in restitution .
Commonly - Used Drugs Can Wreck Your Genes
by Bill Sardi
Recently by Bill Sardi : A Decade Of Vitamin D Supplementation Would Save $ 4.4 Trillion Over A Decade ; Would Save $ 1346 Per Person Per Annum
Your genetic makeup may not be as fixed and unchanging as first believed .
Not yet a decade into the post - genomic era , following the discovery that humans have about 35,000 genes , researchers have discovered that there are inherited physical or mental traits that are not explained by sequences of DNA in the human genetic ladder or by environmental factors .
While inherited genetic information from your parents and grandparents remains relatively static , there are mechanisms whereby genes can be turned on ( expressed ) or turned off ( silenced ) .
This is the relatively new field of biology called epigenetics .
Your epigenome
All of the genetic information in humans is packaged in chromosomes in every cell in the human body .
This body of genetic information is called the human genome .
While the human genome is somewhat fixed , the epigenome is dynamic and responsive to environmental factors , chemicals ( drugs ) and the diet .
Furthermore , it has become increasingly apparent to biologists that chemicals can turn genes on or off even long after exposure .
Epigenetic changes may not only linger , they may last a lifetime , particularly if they are induced during early development .
[ Human Molecular Genetics 2006 Oct 15 ; 15 Spec No 2 : R131—7 ]
Biologists now claim " the epigenome is dynamic and responsive to environmental signals not only during development , but also throughout life ; and it is becoming increasingly apparent that chemicals can cause changes in gene expression that persist long after exposure has ceased . "
[ Medical Hypotheses June 4 , 2009 online ]
Mechanisms now understood
The two complicated mechanisms which trigger changes in the epigenome , alteration of DNA methylation ( replacement of hydrogen atoms with methyl groups ) and alteration of chromatin ( the packaging of DNA strands around spools called histone bodies ) , are now understood .
Chemicals , particularly drugs , affect both of these mechanisms that control the epigenome .
[ Indian Journal Medical Research 2006 Jan ; 123( 1) :17 — 24 ]
Epigenetics and drug safety
In fact , the first application of epigenetics has been directed toward the evaluation and safety of drugs .
[ Toxicology Applied Pharmacology 2004 May 1 ; 196(3):422—30 ]
Do drugs favorably alter the human epigenome ?
The shocking early answer appears to be no .
Researchers now hypothesize that commonly - used , FDA - approved pharmaceutical drugs can cause persistent epigenetic changes .
Researchers now propose that epigenetic side - effects of pharmaceuticals may be involved in the etiology of heart disease , cancer , nerve and mental disorders , obesity , diabetes , leukemia , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , infertility , and sexual dysfunction .
[ Metabolism Clinical and Experimental 57 : ( 2008 ) S16 — S23 ]
They are calling for epigenetic screening of all existing and future pharmaceutical drugs .
[ Medical Hypotheses June 4 , 2009 online ]
Researchers claim , if their hypothesis is correct , that the " consequences for modern medicine are profound , since it would imply that our current understanding of pharmacology is an oversimplification . "
Up till now , epigenetic review of pharmaceutical compounds has been absent .
Toxicologists have narrowly focused on whether drugs cause cancer in their safety screening of drug molecules .
This may be why so many drugs are now being recalled after gaining FDA approval based upon small - group studies .
Persistent chronic exposure to some chemicals in drugs may eventually induce permanent changes in the human epigenome , producing latent , lasting or periodic effects , based upon exposure patterns ( compliance to drug regimens ) .
Drugs that are known to cause epigenetic changes include statin cholesterol - lowering drugs , antidepressants , beta blockers used to treat high blood pressure and heart problems , anti-cancer drugs like tamoxifen and methotrexate , anti-inflammatory agents like Vioxx , even anesthetics , oral contraceptives and some classes of antibiotics .
All of these drugs are fraught with chronic side effects .
Some patients are exposed to more than one drug that may unfavorably alter the epigenome .
Permanent changes in the epigenome
Researchers are most concerned that drugs may produce defects in subsequent generations .
They speculate that the current diabesity epidemic may be hastened by drugs .
They say " it would be alarming if the worldwide increases in diabetes and obesity , which have been postulated to be epigenetic , were actually being accelerated by the increasing use of pharmaceutical agents . "
[ Medical Hypotheses June 4 , 2009 online ]
Most anti-diabetic drugs cause weight gain and eventual complete dependency upon insulin for blood sugar control .
Epigenetic Therapy
Epigenetic therapy is a new and rapidly developing area of medical exploration aimed at correcting epigenetic defects , particularly because these defects are thought to be more amenable to reversal compared with genetic defects .
Epigenetic therapeutic agents may prevent disease , opening up what biologists now call the " pre-symptomatic era " of modern medicine .
[ Human Molecular Genetics 2006 Oct 15 ; 15 Spec. No. 2 : R131—7 ]
A primary target application is the pervasive diabesity epidemic in developed countries .
For example , the common measure of blood sugar control , hemoglobin A1 c , explains less than 25 % of the variation in risk of developing diabetic complications .
But a transient rise in blood sugar may produce a prolonged epigenetic effect that last up to 6 days even when normal blood sugar levels have been restored .
[ Journal Experimental Medicine 2008 Sep 29 ; 205(10):2409 — 17 ]
Epigenetics is now even poised to address the very reasons why humans age at varying rates .

The Best of Bill Sardi
SARASOTA , Florida ( CNN ) -- Gary Meringer pulled out of his driveway in his red sedan on a rainy Florida morning .
He headed south towards a federal detention center two hours away to visit Youssef Megahed .
Jury foreman Gary Meringer ( left ) meets with Youssef Megahed 's father , Samir , outside the detentention center .
Meringer was apprehensive , unsure of what he would say to a man with whom he'd spent a month in the same room , but had never met .
Meringer was the foreman on the jury that set Megahed free .
But , three days after Megahed was acquitted of charges of possessing and transporting explosives , he was arrested again .
This time , the U.S. government wants him deported , based on evidence authorities say suggests the Egyptian - born Megahed is a terrorist , in violation of his immigration status .
" We never expected anything like this , " said Megahed , reached by phone at the detention center in Moore Haven , Florida .
Neither did his jury foreman .
" I saw the story about the re-arrest , and it literally just took the air right out of my chest , " Meringer said .
" I could not believe what my eyes were seeing . "
Before he left home , Meringer sat in his backyard with his 10 - year - old daughter , Rachel .
They talked about what he should say when he meets Megahed .
Meringer told the child he hoped to deliver this message : " People care about him and are rooting for him and hope things work out for the best , " adding , " Other than that , I do n't know what I 'm going to say to him . "
" Just let him know that there are people out in the world who love him and care about him , " Rachel said .
The Muslim community , the jurors and the Megahed family say they believe that Youssef Megahed is a victim of profiling .
They hope President Obama will intervene .
Earlier in June , in his speech to the Muslim world , Obama called for an end to what he called the " cycle of suspicion . "
" This is like a great starting point for the Obama administration to translate their speech and their vision , into some reality here in the U.S. , " said Yahia Megahed , Youssef 's brother .
Megahed came to the United States from Egypt in 1998 as a legal immigrant when he was 12 .
His problems started two years ago when , as an engineering student at the University of South Florida , he went on a road trip with a new friend , Ahmed Mohamed .
The men were pulled over on a highway , near Charleston , South Carolina , for speeding .
Police say they searched their vehicle and found PVC pipe with potassium nitrate inside , along with detonator cord inside one of Mohamed 's bags .
The government said the materials were " low explosives . "
Mohamed said they were materials for homemade model rockets .
Youssef Megahed claimed he did not know that the materials were in the car .
A search of Mohamed 's laptop computer found research concerning rockets and propellants and how to manufacture them , as well as information about Qassam rockets -- crude rockets used by terrorists in the Middle East , according to prosecutors .
Prosecutors also had a video , made and narrated by Mohamed , in which he demonstrates how to outfit a model car with explosives .
He posted it on " YouTube . "
Mohamed pleaded guilty to providing material support to terrorists and is serving a 15 - year prison sentence .
However , Megahed went to trial and was found not guilty on two charges of possession and transportation of explosives .
He was later set free .
" I 'm very happy with this , " he said , smiling to reporters after his acquittal .
Jurors later said they believed that Megahed did not know the " low explosives " were in the car .
Gary Meringer and the other 11 jurors deliberated for over three days in U.S. district court in Tampa before reaching their unanimous verdict .
" We were all waiting for a shoe to drop , for some kind of a case to be made .... so , after two weeks , it seemed to me there was no case , and nothing for us to decide , " Meringer said .
" This case never should have seen the light of day in a courtroom . "
Megahed left the courthouse on Friday , April 3 , ready to resume his life and his studies .
He and his family spent the weekend at the beach at Fort DeSoto , Florida .
Three days later , federal agents surrounded him , and his father , Samir , as they left a Wal - mart store near their home in Tampa and he was arrested again .
" They surround us .... I 'm in shock .
They did n't give us a chance to speak to somebody to know what was going on , " said Samir Megahed .
" I try to open the telephone , but they did n't allow me , " he said .
Megahed is now being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , or ICE , as someone ICE says is " engaged or likely to become engaged in ... terrorist activity " even though he has never been criminally charged with terrorism .
ICE will present an immigration judge with the very same facts that led to Megahed 's acquittal in the criminal case .
In immigration court , the burden of proof is significantly less .
The evidence , from a search of the computer at his family 's home , includes " numerous videos , documents and an Internet search history that supports Islamic extremism , jihad against the United States ... , " ICE alleged in court documents .
If found guilty , Megahed will be deported .
CNN requested an on - camera interview with Megahed , but ICE would not allow it .
" Because of the national security implications of this case , ICE cannot allow the use of recording devices during in - person interviews with Mr. Megahed , " spokesman Richard Rocha said in an e-mail .
Instead , CNN conducted a phone interview with Megahed from the Glades County Detention Center , near Lake Okeechobee .
" I feel this is double jeopardy because the same allegations here are the same allegations that was there , in the court , in the trial , " he said .
Megahed was asked , " Are you a terrorist ? "
" I would say this is a false allegation , " Megahed responded .
" Baseless .
And I go to court to fight those allegations again . "
ICE spokeswoman Nicole Navas said in response : " He will have the opportunity to present the facts of his case before an immigration judge . "
This is not the first time the government has gone to immigration court as a last resort after failing to win a criminal prosecution .
" The government does n't use this a lot , but I think this is an arrow in the quiver that needs to stay because there are those cases where the government needs to do everything in its power to keep us safe , from some of those same individuals , " said former U.S. Attorney Guy Lewis .
" In one context , the real question is , are you going to jail for a long period of time .
The other context is , are you going to get to live among us , " Lewis said .
But Youssef 's father says it 's pure discrimination against Muslims .
" They did n't want us to live here .
And because he wins the case , they want to destroy him completely , " Samir Megahed said .
At the detention center , Gary Meringer pulled his red sedan into the parking lot .
He had two hours in the car to figure out what he 's going to say to the man he judged in court .
The Megahed family awaits at the prison entrance .
They greet Meringer warmly .
He shakes hands with Samir Megahed , the father .
" Good to meet you after all this time .
God bless , " Meringer said .
The juror and the former defendant meet with a plate of glass between them .
They talk over a phone hook - up .
The conversation is recorded by the prison .
It is over in 15 minutes .
" He did complain about the quality of the food and the laundry , " Meringer said , smiling .
" I told him ...
I was out here rooting for him , that he would get justice at the end of the day , and not to lose hope , not to give up , to hang in there . "
A spiritual man , Meringer said he was grateful he could find the words to communicate with Megahed .
He believes God put him in this position for a reason .
" I had to listen to my heart ... I can't say I do n't want to get involved or I may get audited , " he said .
" I would have walked down here to talk to him , " he said with a smile .
" I want this kid to get a fair shake ...
It was clear to me that I was talking to a fairly depressed individual , fairly depressed kid . "
Meringer says he plans on visiting Megahed again , before his case is heard in August .
He hopes his case will also be heard in Washington .
From his prison phone , Megahed said : " If President Obama wants to talk about change , he should look first inside the U.S. before talking about change worldwide . "

“ No one should assume that the government will step in to bail them out if their firm fails . ”
That ’s Timothy F. Geithner , the Treasury secretary , talking tough with lawmakers last week as he promoted the government ’s remake of the financial regulatory framework .
Talk is cheap , however .
And the notion that the plan shows a new aversion to bailouts is not at all supported by its chapter and verse .
In fact , there ’s precious little in the 88 - page document about how the government will eliminate systemic risks posed by financial firms that are n’t allowed to fail because they ’re simply too big or to interconnected to other important economic players here and abroad .
Rather than propose ways to shrink these companies and the risks they pose , the Geithner plan argues instead for enhanced regulatory oversight of the behemoths .
This suggests the taxpayer safety net will be larger after our national financial train wreck , not smaller .
More than two years after the crisis began , “ too big to fail ” remains “ too problematic to address ” with anything other than more souped - up regulation .
Given that earlier efforts at policing these entities failed so miserably , why should anyone think that a new - and - improved regulatory approach will fare better ?
Ferrari have confirmed seven - time world champion Michael Schumacher will make a sensational return to Formula One to stand in for Felipe Massa .
German legend Schumacher still works for Ferrari as an advisor and , after Massa suffered serious injuries in a crash at the Hungarian grand prix , he will now get back behind the wheel once again .
Although the idea was originally rubbished , Ferrari have confirmed that Schumacher will come out of retirement to replace Massa - provided he passes a fitness test .
" Ferrari intends to entrust Michael Schumacher with Felipe Massa 's car for as long as the Brazilian driver is not able to race , " a Ferrari statement said .
" Michael Schumacher has shown his willingness and in the next few days he will undergo a specific programme of preparation at the end of which it will be possible to confirm his participation in the championship starting with the European Grand Prix on Aug. 23 . "
Retirement
Although Schumacher has been retired for almost three years , he felt that he owed it to Ferrari to step in for Massa until the Brazilian is fit enough to return .
" This afternoon I met with ( team principal ) Stefano Domenicali and ( president )
Luca di Montezemolo and together we decided that I will prepare myself to take the place of Felipe , " Schumacher said on his official website .
" Though it is true the Formula One chapter has been closed for me for some time , it is also true that for loyalty reasons to the team I cannot ignore this unfortunate situation .
" But as the competitor I am , I also very much look forward to facing this challenge . "
Schumacher must prove his fitness first , but he has some time to prepare as the F1 season takes a summer break ahead of the European Grand Prix in Valencia .
Schumacher , 40 , sustained a neck injury in a motorcycle accident in February , and must prove he is fully recovered before embarking on his comeback .
During his career , Schumacher won 91 times in 250 grand grix starts until he called it a day and retired in October 2006 .

BEIJING 
One of the principal student leaders of the 1989 pro-democracy movement flew Wednesday from Taiwan to the Chinese territory of Macao , saying he wanted to surrender to Chinese authorities after two decades in exile .
The former student leader , Wu’er Kaixi , was detained by immigration authorities at the Macao airport on the evening before the 20th anniversary of a bloody military crackdown in Beijing .
He told several news agencies that he would return to Taiwan only if he were deported .
“ His action is kind of an expression of anger and protest , ” said Wang Dan , another former student leader , who is now in the United States .
“ Maybe this is his only way to return to China .
For all of us , this is the only way . ”
In a statement , Mr. Wu ’er said his effort to turn himself in was “ in no way whatsoever an acknowledgment of guilt in the eyes of the law . ”
COURTESY OF JEFF SHARLET
The scandal over Nevada Republican Sen. John Ensign ’s extramarital affair with an employee has renewed interest in a secretive fundamentalist Christian group known as The Family , with whom he lives when in Washington , D.C .
Ensign last month admitted to an affair with Cynthia Hampton , whose husband , Doug Hampton , was a top aide to Ensign and his best friend .
After Doug Hampton asked The Family to intervene , members confronted Ensign at the group ’s house on C Street in Washington .
On Wednesday , the author of a book about The Family was interviewed on KNPR - FM ’s public affairs show “ State of Nevada . ” Author Jeff Sharlet , a contributing editor to Harper ’s and Rolling Stone magazines , lived with The Family in early 2002 .
His book , “ The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power , ” was published last year by HarperCollins .
The following is an account of the State of Nevada interview , conducted by host Dave Berns .
It has been condensed and edited for clarity .
Dave Berns : Scandals involving John Ensign and South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford placed a spotlight on The Family .
The group ’s town house in Washington is a former convent with a chapel and , according to federal tax records , is registered as a church .
Tenants pay below market rent .
We asked Sharlet which is the bigger story : the sex scandals , or the public conversation about The Family .
Jeff Sharlet :
The story begins with these scandals .
The question is , do you make the bigger connection ?
The real issue is not who Ensign or Sanford sleep with , but the organizations with which they pursue their policies and the sources to which they turn for moral and religious authority .
I think that is starting to come out , particularly with Ensign , because we see the role The Family plays in the cover -up .
Doug Hampton said The Family had a role in moving money around for the affair , which I think a lot of outsiders look at as hypocritical .
Knowing The Family , I understand that that ’s not hypocritical from its perspective — that it ’s actually a form of doing God ’s work .
Berns :
Talk about the relationship between members of The Family — they are men , not women — and the role they play as a larger group .
Sharlet :
The Family began with this idea that God does not work through churches but rather through those whom The Family calls the “ New Chosen . ”
They believe they ’re chosen by God .
They ca n’t be expected to pray with the rest of us .
They need to pray in private with people of equal status .
When you join one of these prayer groups , you give these men veto power over your life , over every aspect of your life .
Wives involved with The Family have said , “ In my husband ’s life , his brothers come first , I come second . ”
We saw that happening with the men Doug Hampton went to see .
They were exercising veto power over Ensign ’s life .
A lot of us might think that sounds fine , they were helping him stay on the straight and narrow .
But when we look at the people exercising this veto power , in particular David Coe , who has been in the news as sort of working with Ensign , you have some really questionable moral authority .
Berns : Doug Hampton said that after members of The Family confronted Ensign , the senator wrote a letter saying he would end the relationship .
Did that sound familiar to you ?
Sharlet : Absolutely .
I start my book out with the story of the month I spent living with The Family , during which I got to spend time at the house on C Street .
I was invited into The Family by a man who had dropped everything and moved to Washington to work with them .
While he was there , his fiancee was raped .
He wanted to jump on the next airplane to be with her , and his brothers in Christ decided to exercise their veto power .
They said , “ What was your fiancee doing in a bar without you ?
Perhaps this was God ’s way of telling you that you are not supposed to be with this woman . ”
They called her a Jezebel .
They told him , “ You are not to go and see your fiancee . ”
Thank God this man did not listen , broke with The Family and went to his fiancee .
Berns :
How important is it for Nevadans to know that Ensign belongs to what you call a cult , as something that has an elitist , fundamentalist approach to life where they bring peer pressure , not just on his personal decisions , but in some cases , his public policy decisions ?
Sharlet : I would n’t call them a cult .
They ’re not quite a cult , but they have a lot of cultish tendencies .
When you vote for someone , you want to know that they are their own man , you want to know they make decisions for themselves .
More important , we want to see to what end this group applies its beliefs .
Doug Coe , David Coe ’s father and leader of The Family fellowship going back to the mid ’ 60s , likes to call The Family “ The Christian Mafia . ” I knew Coe when I was part of The Family .
He explained what it means to be a chosen politician .
Talking to another man , he said , “ Let me explain to you the concept of ‘ chosen . ’
Suppose I hear you raped three little girls .
What would I think of you ? ”
The man says , “ You would think I was awful , a monster . ”
And Doug Coe said , “ No , I would not , because you ’re chosen , and when you ’re chosen , the normal rules do n’t apply . ”
I think that ’s important for the voters of Nevada to know .
Berns : Because it frames Ensign ’s thought processes , because it help him shape his religious , political , social philosophy ?
Sharlet : Absolutely .
Everyone is entitled to the freedom of religion .
I am a fanatic about freedom of religion .
Ensign is free to believe these things , but if he ’s going to this place for spiritual authority , he is turning to a group that regularly invokes as leadership models Hitler , Stalin and Mao , whom Doug Coe said are three men who understood the New Testament best in the 20th century .
He means that they are evil men , but what they understood is that the New Testament is not about love , mercy , justice , forgiveness .
It ’s about power .
I ’m saying this not just to the voters of Nevada , but to all the Christian conservatives in Nevada who voted for Ensign because he presented himself as a Christian .
Perhaps they would like to know what he means by Christian .
Does he read the New Testament and think it is only about power , and then does he apply that in the world ?
One of the things that has come out is that when we look at Ensign ’s travel records and Coburn ’s travel records , we find them traveling around the world , doing official government business on The Family dime .
In other words , they ’re representing U.S. interests , but they are going overseas , paid for by The Family and talking about this Family theology with foreign leaders .
That becomes almost a national security issue .
Doug Coe in one presentation talked about Nazi Germany and the allegiance many Germans had to the Nazis .
He said it was something of a role model for the approach that Family members need to have to their organization .
David Coe , a former assistant to George W. Bush at the Office of Faith - Based Initiatives , told NBC Nightly News last year that Doug Coe ’s references to Nazis in his sermons were really a metaphor , a metaphor for commitment .
I do n’t think Jesus used a metaphor of genocidal maniacs for commitment .
I know David Coe and like him , but I think this is where you really get to the heart of the problem with The Family , this confusion over what their faith is about .
Doug
Coe will go so far as to say that he is not a Christian , that Christianity has got it all wrong .
The group began during the Great Depression because the founder thought that God came to him and revealed a vision that the New Deal was satanically inspired and that Christianity was getting it wrong for 2000 years by focusing on the poor , the weak , the suffering .
He said God came one night in April 1935 and said , “ I want you to be a minister to not the down and out , but the up and out , ” he called them , the powerful .
And God ’s going to choose a few powerful people , he ’ll work through those people , and those people will distribute the blessings to the rest of us .
It sort of becomes this trickle - down fundamentalism that ’s all about the fetishization of strength .
Hitler is not an appropriate metaphor for the teachings of Jesus ; neither is Stalin or Mao .
When I was at the C Street house with Coe in a counseling session with Congressman Todd Tiahrt ( Kansas Republican ) , he offered as examples Osama bin Laden and Pol Pot .
These were men , Coe said , who knew how to wield power , and we should wield power that way , too , except we should do it for Christ .
They say it ’s the means , not the ends .
But when I look at Hitler I have trouble with both the means and the ends .
I think any sane human being does .
Berns :
The movement was founded in Seattle in 1935 by Abraham Vereide , a Norwegian immigrant , a traveling preacher who had been working with that city ’s poor .
He opposed the New Deal , was worried that Socialist politicians were about to take over Seattle ’s municipal government .
One of the things they pushed for , and you talk about , is the push in 1947 for the anti-labor initiative , the Taft - Hartley Act , which monitored , limited the activities of the labor unions .
Sharlet : Exactly .
However you look at it , The Family is effectively a union busting organization .
They ’re particularly concerned about the Teamsters and the Longshoremen .
They thought they were run by some sort of devils .
The Family was instrumental in the breaking of the spine of organized labor .
One of the things that makes them different from other Christian conservative organizations , and I think even upset some Christian conservative organizations , is that the issues for them are not abortion or morality or same - sex marriage .
The important issue to them is what they call Biblical capitalism , and I think what even some conservative observers looking at them call crony capitalism .
Berns :
Does some of the criticism of The Family have an anti-religious bent — in a nation that values religious freedom ?
Sharlet : Why is Sen. Tom Coburn ( Oklahoma Republican ) going to the government of Lebanon , one of the most religiously torn countries in the world , and going as a U.S. senator paid for by The Family — and saying to the government that the solution to their problems is to create more Christian prayer cells , like the one he and his friend Ensign and are in ?
That goes beyond the private .
Again , I ’m a freedom of religion fanatic , and that ’s why , in fact , I was reluctant to even comment on this when it was just on the matter of the personal affairs of Sanford and Ensign .
But it crossed the line when we saw money changing hands , when we saw The Family being used as a means not to provide accountability and moral guidance and advice like most religious traditions do , but in fact just the opposite .
Sen. Jim DeMint ( South Carolina Republican ) , another resident of the C Street house , says that the prayer groups are accountability groups .
I think it is a basic truth that accountability is not something that takes place behind closed doors .
Accountability is about transparency .
In The Family , you have a group that deliberately avoids transparency .
Doug
Coe is on record saying that he tries to make the group act like the Mafia , and he says the more invisible you can make your organization , the more influence it will have .
I do n’t know anything in Christianity that preaches secrecy , fetishization of strength .
Ensign , of course , is entitled to those views .
But he is not entitled to use that group as a vehicle for foreign diplomacy , and he ’s not entitled to use that group to hide shenanigans with his campaign finances from the voters of Nevada .
Berns :
You write in the book of some of the members , past and present , of The Family : Sens. Pete Domenici of New Mexico , Chuck Grassley of Iowa , James Inhofe of Oklahoma , John Thune of South Dakota , Mike Enzi of Wyoming .
You characterize Ensign as the conservative casino heir , “ A brightly tanned , hapless figure , who uses his family connections to graft holiness to his gambling fortune name . ”
Why a “ hapless figure ? ”
Sharlet : I apologize to the citizens of Nevada for the description .
When I met Ensign at the house on C Street , he was not an impressive figure .
That ’s a personal impression , and what struck me is that he was not a particularly impressive figure within The Family , either .
One way I was able to tell the story of The Family was by living with them and spending years in this massive , dark archive , the grand center of their papers .
You see over the years there ’s sort of a model — a number of rising star politicians , good - looking guys like Ensign .
Often these are people who do not do a whole lot legislatively , and that ’s certainly true of Ensign .
And then there are the workhorses .
More influential ideologically within The Family than Ensign would be Coburn or DeMint .
Someone lesser known would be Rep. Joe Pitts from Pennsylvania , who is a longtime activist in The Family , and Sen. Sam Brownback from Kansas .
I do n’t want people to say this is a “ get Republicans ” kind of narrative .
It ’s important to recognize that part of the way The Family has endured for 70 years is that it has been wise enough never to attach to one party , one faction .
The Family is in this for the long haul .
That means they welcome a certain number of Democrats .
Sen . Mark Pryor , a conservative , pro-labor Democrat from Arkansas , told me that through The Family he had learned that the separation of church and state was a sort of secular exaggeration and that Jesus did not come to bring peace .
I ’m quoting him , “ Jesus did not come to bring peace .
Jesus came to take over . ”
Berns : Hillary Clinton cites her relationship with The Family boss Doug Coe .
She cites him , and Bill Clinton has cited him , as having a healthy impact on their lives .
Sharlet :
As does Christian right leader Rob Schenck — he ’s with the group called Faith in Action in Washington and is a big admirer of The Family .
He says Doug Coe is the kosher seal of doing religion and politics in Washington .
Berns :
The kosher seal ?
Sharlet : Schenck is a Jewish convert to fundamentalism , a lovely guy who speaks in Yiddishisms .
He is a die -hard , militant Christian conservative .
When Time magazine put together a list of the 25 most powerful evangelical groups , Time asked me for my recommendations .
I said Doug Coe .
They were not familiar with Coe .
I said , “ Tell you what , try out a dozen congressmen and if you do n’t hear his name from at least half of them , do n’t include him . ”
Time , hardly a bastion of leftist thinking , put him No. 4 on the list .
You mention Hillary Clinton .
I think that ’s really interesting .
Hillary calls him a spiritual mentor and guide .
She writes in her book about coming to Washington and Coe organizing a prayer cell of conservative women , wives of conservative politicians .
Keep in mind , The Family believes prayer is most effective when the genders are separated .
And Hillary ’s no stealth fundamentalist by any means .
I teamed up with NBC Nightly News last year to look into her connections and wrote about it with a colleague , Katherine Joyce .
What we saw was Hillary shaving off here and there on issues she did n’t think that the public would notice , trying to win peace with the Christian right .
On the one level , you say that ’s great , Democracy works through compromise .
When you look more closely at some of the legislation , like sex trafficking legislation , she teamed up with Brownback and allowed Brownback to redesign legislation meant to stop sex trafficking , to make it an offense punishable as nothing more than prostitution .
I think most sane people know that prostitutes are not the real criminals in this business , it ’s the people moving human chattel around the world .
The Family looks at it a bit differently .
Berns : Every year since 1954 we ’ve had something called the National Prayer Breakfast , an annual event in D.C.
It ’s bipartisan , drawing members of Congress , lobbyists , political leaders past and present .
What ’s not known to a great degree is it was The Family and their founder who was behind the adoption of this by Dwight Eisenhower .
Sharlet : Much to Eisenhower ’s credit , he did n’t want to do it .
Eisenhower knew it was a violation of the separation of church and state , just like Truman , who had refused before him , and FDR .
But Eisenhower is the first modern Republican who benefited from a conservative evangelical vote .
Billy Graham , who had been a Democrat up to that point , organized an evangelical vote for him , and The Family went to work for him .
Eisenhower said he was afraid the breakfast would become a tradition , and this is exactly what The Family wanted .
The Family says it will invite anyone to this event .
The real action is n’t at the breakfast .
It ’s the weeklong lobbying session organized around it .
If you want to understand , look at the foreign delegations from around the world .
Again and again , you see they send a leader from their country who is spiritually motivated , but it happens to be the defense minister , and the defense minister is coming for meetings with defense contractors , organized by The Family at seminars on how to pursue this business for the glory of God .
Berns :
You note that many of these defense ministers are from those classic authoritarian Third World countries : Central America , South America , Africa .
Sharlet : I looked at the travel records of Ensign and Coburn and others who travel with them .
As they explain it , they have been going to build relationships with brothers in Christ in places like Serbia , Sudan , Albania , Belarus , Ukraine , Pakistan , ruled by Musharraf .
These are not known as great democratic nations .
At times I asked Family members about their relationship with , say , a dictator of Uganda .
I would ask , “ Perhaps we should hold him accountable ? ”
And they would say , “ He ’s a better dictator because of his relationship with The Family . ”
They said that of Suharto , too , the Indonesian ruler to whom a death toll of 1.2 million is attributed by very reliable sources , killed with weaponry supplied by the U.S. , through the agency of congressmen who thought Suharto was a man of God .
Berns :
You characterize
The Family ’s mission as a trickle - down fundamentalism and then you point to two concepts : populist fundamentalism and elite fundamentalism .
As I read those words , I could n’t help thinking about trickle - down economics .
Sharlet :
In some ways the greatest effect of The Family is the influence of their ideas , the elite fundamentalism ideas , free - market fundamentalism trickling down into popular fundamentalism , the regular churches of America filled with Christian conservatives with very good hearts who are democratic in spirit , even if they hold very conservative views about morality and so on .
I saw The Family ’s influence when I spent time at a megachurch in Colorado Springs run by Ted Haggard , who a lot of people are now familiar with because of a sex scandal .
Haggard had 11,000 church members believing that the most important aspect of the gospel related to free trade .
He had ordinary folks talking about getting rid of steel tariffs as God ’s work , and they did so , he said because where capitalism goes , God follows .
I think that ’s a sad thing when churches have been steered away from their real mission into this very specific economic set of ideas .
Berns :
Has there been any blowback on you ?
Have you been threatened for having lived among the members of The Family and then writing about them , researching them , talking about them so openly ?
Sharlet : I first wrote about this in Harper ’s Magazine , and The Family responded in a lot of interesting ways .
I had a speaking engagement in Germany paid for by the U.S. Embassy .
I got off the plane and my German host picked me up and said , “ There ’s a problem .
Your ambassador has said that he cannot pay for you because you are an enemy of Jesus . ”
I thought he was joking .
Fortunately , the university picked up the tab .
This happened because of Sen. Dan Coates ( Indiana Republican ) , who was quite involved in The Family .
He ’s not the brightest bulb on the porch .
What was interesting about The Family is that I ’m still one of the chosen from their perspective .
I ’m a bad brother , but I ’m still a brother .
That allowed me access to things I might not have gotten otherwise .
So when I was spending time with Brownback , he knew what I had written , but he was certain that somehow I had been selected by God , and if I saw his work close up , I would be persuaded to come back and stay quiet about what was going on .
Hundreds gathered for the traditional ceremony
Large crowds of people attended the annual Tynwald Day ceremony on the Isle of Man .
Known as Midsummer 's Court , the historic day dates back to 1417 when the island 's parliament was first codified on Tynwald Hill .
Joined by the Deemsters , judges on the Isle of Man , the island 's leaders listened to the new laws they have made in the past year .
The day is also a chance for people to air their grievances to politicians .
During the ceremony the lieutenant governor was preceded by the sword - bearer , who wears a scarlet uniform and bears the Sword of State .
Blunt sword
The Sword of State probably dates to the 15th Century and may have been made for Sir John Stanley .
The sword , which is blunt for safety reasons , includes the Manx triskelion - the traditional " three legs " symbol - which also appears on the Manx flag .
Members of the House of Keys and of the Legislative Council were also in attendance , with the speaker of the House of Keys wearing a wig and black robes with gold decorations .
Similarly , the President of Tynwald wears a wig and blue robes with silver decorations and his robes also display the three legs symbol .

Officers who used pepper spray and a Taser to remove a man from a store bathroom found out only later he was deaf and mentally disabled and did n't understand they wanted him to open the door , police said today .
A spokesman for the Mobile , Alabama police department said the officers ' actions were justified because the man was armed with a potential weapon : an umbrella .
But relatives of Antonio Love , 37 , have asked for a formal investigation and said they plan to sue both the police and the store .
" I want justice , " Love 's mother , Phyllis Love , said today .
The woman said her son hears only faintly , has the mental capacity of a 10 - year - old and did n't realise that it was the police who were trying enter the bathroom .
" He thought the devil was out there trying to get in to get him , " she said .
Antonio Love , in a written statement and in a television interview given in sign language about the confrontation , said he had a badly upset stomach on Friday and went into a Dollar General store to use the restroom .
Police spokesman Christopher Levy said today store workers called police complaining that a man had been in the bathroom for more than an hour with the door locked .
Officers knocked on the door and identified themselves , but the person did n't respond .
Officers used a tire iron to open the door , but the man pushed back to keep it shut .
Officers sprayed pepper spray through a crack trying to subdue the man , Levy said .
They shot the man with a Taser when they finally got inside , he said .
Officers did n't realide Love was deaf or had learning disabilities until he showed them a card he carries in his wallet , Levy said .
He was arrested on a charge of disorderly conduct , but officers released him and took him home after a magistrate refused to issue a warrant .
Levy said officers were justified in using force against Love since he had an umbrella .
" The officers really worked within the limits of our level - of - force policy , " he said .
" We had no information about who this guy was . "
Phyllis Love said her son , who has worked in the garden department at a Lowe 's home improvement store for several years , was scared when he realised someone was trying to get into the bathroom with him .
He put water on his face after being hit with pepper spray , she said .
" He did n't know it was a policeman until they busted the door in on him , " she said .
" He had a knot on his head from where it hit him . "
Levy said police wish the confrontation had never occurred .
The internal investigation will include a review of Love 's complaints that officers laughed at him after realising he was deaf , he said .
" We 'll make whatever efforts we can to resolve this situation , hopefully so this man will be able to trust police in the future so we can help him .
Obviously , it 's going to be a rough road , " he said .
The debate over what should happen to Bush administration lawyers who drafted the so - called " torture memos " has taken a new turn .
A federal judge in San Francisco ruled Friday a former Justice Department legal adviser can be held personally responsible for the indefinite military detention and alleged torture of an American citizen who was suspected of involvement with Al Qaeda .
The ruling clears the way for John
Yoo to stand trial in a civil lawsuit for his role in producing a series of legal memos authorizing harsh interrogation tactics that were later used against suspected enemy combatant Jose Padilla .
" Like any other government official , government lawyers are responsible for the foreseeable consequences of their conduct , " wrote US District Judge Jeffrey White in a 42 - page decision .
Judge
White 's decision reignites debate about whether government lawyers should be investigated and prosecuted for their involvement with the memos .
Some analysts say government lawyers should never face criminal charges for advice – even bad advice – if offered in a good faith belief it was legal .
Others say Bush administration lawyers appear to have acted more like mafia consiglieri , helping their bosses evade the law rather than comply with it .
The Justice Department lawyers who are defending Mr. Yoo argue that Mr. Padilla 's treatment did not violate any clearly established constitutional rights .
In addition , they say Yoo should enjoy qualified immunity from such lawsuits .
Judge
White rejected those arguments , saying that Padilla 's lawyers had alleged sufficient facts to satisfy the requirement that " Yoo set in motion a series of events that resulted in the deprivation of Padilla 's constitutional rights . "
The Padilla case is significant because it represents the only opportunity available for judicial examination of the constitutionality of Mr. Padilla 's treatment in military detention , according to the judge .
The US Supreme Court recently threw out a similar lawsuit filed by a former detainee in New York against former Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller .
The high court said the detainee failed to show enough personal involvement by the two senior officials in the alleged abusive treatment .
" Here , in contrast , Padilla alleges with specificity that Yoo was involved in the decision to detain him and created a legal construct designed to justify the use of interrogation methods that Padilla alleges were unlawful , " White wrote .
Specifically , the judge said Padilla 's incommunicado military detention without charge for nearly two years is sufficient to state a claim for a violation of Padilla 's constitutional right to access to the courts .
He also ruled that Yoo could face trial for allegedly violating Padilla 's right to practice his religion as guaranteed by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act .
Padilla is currently serving a 17 - year prison sentence following his conviction in Miami for conspiring to provide material support to Al Qaeda .
The Supreme Court had been set to consider his case in early 2006 , until the Bush administration transferred Padilla from military detention to the criminal - justice system , short - circuiting that review .
A Justice Department spokesperson said lawyers in the case are continuing to study Friday 's decision and have not yet decided whether to appeal .

Pokémon Red is blatantly better than Pokémon Blue and if you disagree with me you are a spastic .
Some of you may feel that one can't successfully draw discrepancies between two games that are essentially the same , but those people are obviously stupid .
I am a hardcore gamer , and that means I can draw huge lines between anything and say that one thing is better if I own that thing .
Following is a list of reasons that I have written thanks to my brain that will prove why Pokémon Red is better than Pokémon Blue , and why anybody who even remotely likes anything to do with Pokémon Blue should be considered a social Pariah and made to wash their dirty little mouths out with soap for saying they like playing such a rubbish game .
Read on and bask in the warm waters of the Fact Sea .
1. Pokémon Red has better Pokémon in it :
Pokémon Red and Blue have their own unique sets of pocket monsters that can be captured and battled and traded all up , and naturally it 's Pokémon Red that gets the lion 's share of all the good ones , while Blue is stuck with crap nonsense like Magmar .
Magmar is basically a duck that is on fire and has an arse on its head , which is absolutely stupid and is nowhere near as good as Arbok , which is a big scary snake .
A snake would kick the shit out of a duck in real life , especially a duck that 's on fire and has a bum on its face and looks a bit like a Downey Syndrome .
Also , Blue got Bellsprout , and Bellsprout is fucking shit .
If I wanted a game with a yellow flower that has a vagina for a mouth , I 'd ask for it , thanks .
Gloom is much better because it turns into Vileplume which is fun to say , and it also had an English accent in the cartoon which makes it awesome .
Arbok is Cobra spelled backwards and with a K .
That is pretty radical when you think about it without thinking too hard .
2. Charizard is blatantly better than Blastoise :
Red has Charizard on the box , while Blue has Blastoise on it .
Tell me what 's better -- a firebreathing dragon that is all massive and brilliant , or a stupid fat Bowser thing with two Super Soakers on its back .
Obviously it is Charizard that is the one that is better you idiot !
Stupid Blue fanboys will try to argue that Blastoise is better but it obviously is n't because I said it is n't and that means it is n't .
Blastoise looks like the fat one out of Keenan & Kel , you know that show about two sisters who never knew how much they missed ya .
I think I 'll stick with the dragon , thank you very much , which also gets bonus points for constantly setting fire to that annoying fucking cunt from the cartoon who sounds like the Karate Kid but is n't .
3 . Red is a better color than Blue :
Think of all the awesome things that are red : The Red Arrows , Red Dead Revolver , Red XIII , Omega Red , The Hunt For Red October , Robin Red Riding Hood , Red or Dead , Red Red Wine , Red Light District , The Red Skull , Red Faction , Pokemon Red , Red Mages , Navik the Red , Red Octane , The Red Baron , The Red Army , Red Faction ( the other one ) , Red Dwarf , Red Rooms , Simply Red , Night of the Living Red , Red Sky at Night , Shepherd 's Delight .
These are just a few of the amazing red things , all of which share a color with the best Pokémon game ever made .
Now let 's look at all the things that are blue : Blue 's Clues .
That 's it .
The only thing that Pokémon Blue has anything in common with is a stupid kid's TV show that features a lonely man who imagines that he 's talking to children and a cartoon dog which is pretty fucking weird and not really appropriate viewing for five - year - olds .
Blue is a shit color , as evidenced by this crap TV show .
Oh , and that Blue Dabba Dee Scooby Doo song .
Screw that noise .
4 . Red got a remake , Blue did not :
Nintendo was so proud of Pokémon Red that the game was subject to its very own remake on the Game Boy Advance , which fans will know as FireRed .
Nintendo was so ashamed of Pokémon Blue that a remake was omitted , and a brand new game that had nothing to do with Blue , called LeafGreen , was created .
Nintendo hoped nobody would notice , and nobody really did , because everyone agreed that Blue was crap and that LeafGreen was a much better idea .
Besides which , what was Nintendo going to call it ?
WaterBlue ?
Do n't be bloody ridiculous .
The whole game was doomed from the start .
5. Pokémon Red is on the Wikipedia page :
Nothing is more validating and important than Wikipedia , apart from maybe NeoGAF ( who'll probably do all moaning about our articles again ) and so it will come as no surprise to gamers around the world that Pokémon Red is the videogame chosen to represent both the Red and Blue titles on the Wiki entry for the seminal Game Boy title .
If you 're not on Wikipedia , you are officially not worthy of note , as decided by a bunch of nerds with too much free time on their hands and who get some sort of sick power trip from deciding what is and what is n't important enough to be on the Internet , even though Jeff Dunham has a page .
Those people know what they 're talking about , and that 's why Pokémon Red 's box art is on Wikipedia and Pokémon Blue is not .
ALSO I HAVE SCREENCAPPED IT SO IF YOU TRY AND EDIT POKEMON BLUE IN THERE I WILL KNOW ABOUT IT ACTUALLY YOU STUPID POKEMON BLUE FANBOYS BY THE WAY !
6. Pokémon Red has a better framerate :
Let 's face it , the framerate for Pokémon Blue is absolutely abysmal , and framerate is incredibly important even though most of us can't tell the difference when we 're making stupid comparison videos between Xbox 360 and PS3 games .
The framerate for Blue is so bad that characters do n't even look like they 're moving .
They just seem to be still images that sometimes slide on and off the screen with poorly rendered sound effects .
Not exactly the kind of hi-def graphics one expects from the Game Boy .
When I had Pokémon Red , I used to shake the Game Boy around a lot , which made everything look like it was moving so that means Pokémon Red has a better framerate .
Do n't fight me on this , because you will lose .
7 . My brother had Pokémon Blue :
While I had Pokémon Red , my brother picked up Pokémon Blue .
My brother also happened to be a lameazoid , a geekatron and , if I 'm not mistaken , a dorkus malorkus .
If you do n't want to be a dillweed chickenbaby like my brother , then you 'll agree that Pokêmon Red is the better game .
Otherwise , me and all the cool kids will call you a spasmo or a mong and will push you around until you cry .
Also , we smoke because we 're so hard and tough and hip , so you better start doing that too !
8. Red has Vaporeon in it :
When I played Pokémon Red I got this awesome watery dog called Vaporeon that looked really cool because it had eyes like the Aliens had on those posters about " freeing the weed " that were really popular in the nineties .
Only Red had Vaporeon in it because I had Red and there were some other piece - of - shit dogs in the other one that I saw when my idiotic brother was playing it , which proves that only Red had Vaporeon in it , so there .
Seriously , one of the other dogs was all electric .
That does n't even make sense !
Vaporeon is great because it is an amphibious dog , and that 's an amazing concept .
There was a dog fish thing in the obscure cartoon show The Dream Stone , which most people wo n't remember , even though it 's a fantastic cultural reference that maybe three people will get .
Vaporeon is also blue , which I 've always felt is an incredibly beautiful color .
9. Pokémon Red has a better score on Metacritic :
Metacritic scores are the ultimate seal of quality , because everybody knows that you can't get more justified than a score of 100 from a bunch of European gaming sites that you 've never heard of before .
Obviously , the original games themselves do n't have Metacritic scores , because they were released before Halo invented the Internet .
However , Pokémon FireRed has a Metacritic score of 81 , and as we explained earlier , there is no Pokémon WaterBlue .
So , that technically means that Pokémon Red has a score of 81 , and Pokémon Blue has a score of 0 .
Metacritic never lies .
It 's fairly obvious to me who has come out on top in the battle of the review scores .
A zero on Metacritic is fucking pathetic , and ultimate proof that anybody who bought Blue is a gay , probably .
10 .
Anyway shut up because it 's better alright ? :
Just shut the fuck up you Pokémon Blue fanboys okay ?
I am sick to death of having to deal with you people and justify myself to you and your bias .
Pokemon Red is to Pokémon Blue what nightsticks were to Rodney King and that 's all there is to it !
I am just so tired of imagining what it is Pokémon Blue fanboys would probably say about Pokémon Red and then having to argue why they'd be wrong if I ever actually saw them saying it even though I 've not seen anybody say anything yet .
I have pretty much conclusively proven with words made out of evidence that Pokémon Red is blatantly better than Pokémon Blue .
Hopefully , if you happened to like Blue and read this piece of journalism , you will swiftly commit the honorable act of Santorum or whatever it is those foreign people used to do when they realized they 'd been massive idiots and were totally wrong about videogames .
Now does somebody have a fucking Magmar so I can complete my Pokédex please !?
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke kicks off his reappointment tour with a town hall meeting today in Kansas City , Mo. Jim Lehrer will host .
From Don Lee at the LA Times : Chairman Ben Bernanke confronts challenges to Federal Reserve 's record
With his term expiring Jan. 31 and his reappointment a question mark , Bernanke makes a rare public appearance today in a nationally televised forum that has all the earmarks of a reelection campaign .
At a town hall meeting in Kansas City , Mo. , the soft - spoken , longtime economics professor can be expected to defend the Fed 's record , explaining why the controversial bailouts and other efforts to revive moribund credit markets were necessary .
...
He will take questions from news host Jim Lehrer and an invited audience ...
" This is an extraordinary time , " he told The Times .
" It 's important for me to hear from people outside of Washington .
And I want to answer the questions that I know people have about the economy , the Fed and the Fed 's actions during this crisis . "
...
[ Laurence Meyer , a Washington economist and former Fed governor ] and many others ... say odds favor Bernanke to be reappointed by Obama .
Bernanke has strong backing from economists and is well regarded in the White House ...
Ben Bernanke ... deserves to be reappointed .
Both the conventional and unconventional decisions made by this scholar of the Great Depression prevented the Great Recession of 2008 - 2009 from turning into the Great Depression 2.0 .
...
[ A ]n endorsement of Mr. Bernanke ’s reappointment comes with many caveats .
Mr. Bernanke , a Fed governor in the early part of this decade , supported flawed policies when Alan Greenspan pushed the federal funds rate ( the policy rate set by the Fed as its main tool of monetary policy ) too low for too long and failed to monitor mortgage lending properly , thus creating the housing and credit and mortgage bubbles .
...
Still , when a liquidity and credit crunch emerged in the summer of 2007 , Mr. Bernanke engineered a U - turn in Fed policy that prevented the crisis from turning into a near depression .
As Federal Reserve chairman , Ben Bernanke has committed serious sins of commission and omission — and for those many sins , he does not deserve reappointment .
Here 's how I see it .
It 's true that [ Bernanke ] failed to notice that the patient was getting sick .
The signs of disease were there , but [ Bernanke ] either did n't see the signs or they were misdiagnosed .
In fact , there 's a case to be made that [ Bernanke ] saw some of the changes in the patient as signs of improving health .
Had [ Bernanke ] made the correct diagnosis early enough , maybe we could have prevented the patient from getting sick ...
And once the patient showed up in the office and was clearly sick , [ Bernanke ] did n't get it right initially either .
[ Bernanke ] thought the patient needed fluids - liquidity as they say - and the patient did need some of that , but [ Bernanke ] did n't immediately see that there were also some key nutrient deficiencies and chemical imbalances that were threatening to cause further problems .
But [ Bernanke ] kept at it with tests and other diagnostics , and eventually got a handle on the problem .
...
The patient will get better , the deterioration was rapid and turning it around will be difficult - it wo n't happen fast enough to suit any of us - but what has been done prevented a complete collapse , and is helping to move the patient towards recovery .
So I 'm with Nouriel , Bernanke should be reappointed .
Given all the recent attacks , I 'd be remiss if I did n't write something about Bernanke ...
I 've been a regular critic of Ben Bernanke .
I thought he missed the housing and credit bubble when he was a member of the Fed Board of Governors from 2002 to 2005 .
And I frequently ridiculed his comments when he was Chairman of the President Bush 's Council of Economic Advisers from June 2005 to January 2006 .
... once Bernanke started to understand the problem , he was very effective at providing liquidity for the markets .
The financial system faced both a liquidity and a solvency crisis , and it is the Fed 's role to provide appropriate liquidity .
Roubini says Bernanke should be reappointed : The Great Preventer Anna Schwartz say no : Man Without a Plan Mark Thoma at Economist 's View agrees with Roubini : Should Bernanke Be Reappointed ?
Here is what I wrote about Bernanke last month ( when he was being heavily criticized ) : I believe the attacks on Bernanke 's personal integrity were unfair and unjustified .
But I 'm not sure he should be reappointed .
Professor Thoma 's analogy to a doctor who kept getting it wrong - but never gave up trying new possible cures - is pretty good .
Is that the kind of doctor I 'd want ?
I 'd like a doctor who never gave up trying for a cure , but I 'd prefer someone with better diagnostic skills .
I do n't oppose Bernanke for a second term , but I think there are better choices .
( San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen , as an example , recognized what was happening much earlier than Bernanke ) .
( CNN ) --
Four boys ages 9 to 14 have been charged with sexually assaulting an 8 - year old girl , police in Phoenix , Arizona , said Wednesday .
The girl was lured into a vacant storage shed by the suspects , who offered her chewing gum , police said at a news conference .
The girl was restrained while the boys -- ages 9 , 10 , 13 and 14 -- sexually assaulted her , police said of the July 16 incident .
All the suspects except for the 14 - year - old live in the same apartment complex , according to Phoenix police Sgt. Andy Hill .
The 14 - year - old has been charged as an adult , Hill said .
Detectives said the girl was placed in the custody of Phoenix child protective services after the attack because of her parents ' attitude toward her .
The girl and the boys charged are all from families that have come to the United States from the West African nation of Liberia , police said .

10 . Radiant City
Radiant City first appeared in 80s ’ comic Mister X. Published by Vortex Comics , it ’s quirky storyline and new - wave , post - atomic style graphics made it something of a cult hit – British style mag The Face loved it .
Mr X became a very cool secret for nerds and hipsters only .
Here ’s Canadian Dean Motter on his creation .
‘ It is a noir tale set in the futuristic present as envisioned in 1939 .
It concerns a city – Radiant City - designed to be a utopia , but its subliminal design flaws are driving its citizenry insane .
Mister X is one of the creators of the city , who has returned from exile to repair it and in doing so goes up against a corrupt government , the mob and other antagonists .
He is cursed with an addiction to a drug which keeps him awake 24 hours a day .
All the while his ex-girlfriend struggles with her feelings for him . ’
One other thing .
Mister X looks like Le Corbusier on crack .
What more do you need to know ?
You ’ve tried the Atkins diet , the South Beach diet , and the diet - of - the - week on cable TV .
Nothing seems to work .
What if you could lose that excess fat by simply inhaling and then exhaling your fat in the form of carbon dioxide ?
In a study published in Cell Metabolism , chemical and biomolecular engineering professor James Liao , associate professor of human genetics and pediatrics Katrina Dipple , and their research team at UCLA showed that genetic alterations enable mice to convert fat into carbon dioxide and remain lean while eating the equivalent of a fast - food diet .
Oh sure , those TV ads do n’t make it any easier .
Most of us non-vegans see a juicy burger and fries during a commercial break and we ’re ready to jump in the car and head to the nearest Burger King or McDonald ’s .
Even President Obama manages to sneak out — if you can call a trip to the local burger joint with full Secret Service entourage “ sneaking ” — for the occasional cheeseburger with jalapeño , lettuce , mustard and tomato .
For fast food junkies and the poor , eating burgers and fries every day can mean an ever - expanding waistline and associated health problems such as diabetes .
Morgan Spurlock ’s hard - hitting 2004 documentary , Super Size Me , describes the effects of a 30 - day McDonald ’s - only diet — a fit then - 32 - year - old Spurlock gained 24 ½ lbs and experienced sexual dysfunction and liver damage .
Rather than another diet - of - the - week or guilt - laden trip to your favorite fast - food joint for a burger and fries , the new UCLA study provides a completely new way to approach the problem .
It represents the work of the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science , in collaboration with the David Geffen School of Medicine .
“ We came up with an unconventional idea which we borrowed from plants and bacteria , ” said Jason Dean , a graduate student on professor Liao ’s team and an author of the study .
“ We know plants and bacteria digest fats differently from humans , from mammals .
Plant seeds usually store a lot of fat .
When they germinate , they convert the fat to sugar to grow .
The reason they can digest fat this way is because they have a set of enzymes that ’s uniquely present in plants and bacteria .
These enzymes are called the ‘ glyoxylate shunt ’ and are missing in mammals . ”
The glyoxylate shunt is composed of two enzymes .
MIT Technology Review reports that the researchers introduced genes for these enzymes from E. coli bacteria into cultured human cells and found that they increased the metabolism of fats in the cells .
Rather than converting the fat into sugar as bacteria do , the cells converted the fat completely into carbon dioxide .
Rather than another diet - of - the - week , the new UCLA study provides a completely new way to approach the problem .
Professor Liao ’s team analyzed gene expression in the cells and found that the new biochemical pathway promoted cellular responses that led the cells to metabolize fats rather than sugar .
The research team then introduced the genes into the livers of mice .
While normal mice gain weight when put on a high - fat diet , professor Liao says that the engineered mice “ remained skinny despite the fact that they ate about the same and produced the same waste ” and were as active as their normal counterparts .
They also had lower fat levels in the liver and lower cholesterol levels .
As with the cultured human cells , the engineered mice did not convert the fat into sugar , which could have the dangerous side effect of promoting high blood sugar and diabetes .
Instead , the researchers found a measured increase in carbon dioxide output — the excess fat was literally released into thin air .
The mice exhibited no visible side effects , although more detailed studies are necessary to verify that .
“ One exciting aspect of this study is that it provides a proof - of - principle for how engineering a specific metabolic pathway in the liver can affect the whole body adiposity and response to a high - fat diet , ” says Karen Reue , a UCLA professor of human genetics and a contributor to the study .
“ This could have relevance in understanding , and potentially treating , human obesity and associated diseases , such as diabetes and heart disease . ”
Here ’s an important caveat : there ’s no substitute for eating well - balanced meals and exercising every day if you want to try to stick around for the Singularity .
Ray Kurzweil recommends taking vitamins and eating a diet that is low in carbohydrates , fat and dairy products and high in vegetables for encouraging longevity .
I would n’t expect to see an “ Inhale - Exhale diet ” soon on cable TV , or featured on the website of Dr. Andrew Weil , MD .
However , genetic alteration using the glyoxylate shunt may one day offer a solution to the major medical problems , early death , and rising health care costs associated with obesity .
