CARACAS , Venezuela 
The Bolivian president , Evo Morales , ordered the American ambassador , Philip S. Goldberg , on Wednesday to leave the country , accusing him of supporting rebellious groups in eastern regions that have been rocked by intensifying protests this week .
The expulsion order signals a low point between Bolivia and the United States .
Their dealings of late have reflected a heightening tension over American antinarcotics policies and the granting of asylum in the United States to Bolivian officials who fled the country earlier in this decade .
“ We do not want people here who conspire against democracy , ” Mr. Morales said in Bolivia ’s capital , La Paz , announcing the decision to expel Mr. Goldberg .
Mr. Morales , a leftist whose top ally is President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela , repeated contentions that Mr. Goldberg was helping groups seeking greater political autonomy in eastern Bolivia .
Officials at the American Embassy in Bolivia , which has repeatedly denied Mr. Morales ’s assertions , did not return calls seeking comment .
But the State Department said Wednesday evening that it had received no official notification of Mr. Morales ’s order expelling Mr. Goldberg , who served as chief of mission to Kosovo before his nomination as ambassador to Bolivia in 2006 .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Gasoline prices rose for the first time in 10 days as Hurricane Ike bears down on the Texas coast , according to a nationwide survey of gas station credit card swipes .
The average price of regular unleaded gasoline rose 1.6 cents to $ 3.668 a gallon from $ 3.652 a day earlier , motorist group AAA said Wednesday .
The last time gas prices rose was Aug. 31 as Hurricane Gustav forced workers to abandon offshore oil rigs ahead of that storm .
Forecasters are currently predicting Ike will hit Texas late Friday or early Saturday as a major Category 3 hurricane but the storm remains unpredictable .
Gas prices jumped 1.7 cents to $ 3.532 a gallon in Texas .
Prices also popped higher in Alabama , Mississippi , Georgia , Louisiana , Florida and the Carolinas .
Nationwide , Alaska and Hawaii remained the two states with gas prices still tracking above $ 4 a gallon .
The cheapest gas continues to be found in New Jersey , where prices averaged $ 3.421 a gallon .
Crude prices have trended lower amid heightened concern about weakening demand and in reaction to the slew of storms and hurricanes .
Oil prices continue to hover around their lowest level in five months .
On Tuesday , crude futures for October delivery tumbled more than $ 3 a barrel to $ 103.26 -- their lowest close since April 1 .
Early Wednesday , prices were little changed at $ 103.30 as nervous investors awaited the government 's latest reading on oil and gas supplies and following OPEC 's announced production cuts .
Meanwhile , gas remains about 11 % , or 44 cents , below the record high average of $ 4.114 that AAA reported on July 17 , but they are still 85 cents above this time last year .

The plot reads like a novel .
The scene is Corfu .
A multimillionaire and a Russian oligarch entertain a number of British political movers and shakers on a 238ft yacht in the crystal - clear waters of a Greek island .
Within weeks of the encounter one of the players - a former cabinet minister twice forced to resign from the government - is unexpectedly catapulted back into the political limelight .
The British prime minister , down on his luck , takes a gamble and tries to revive his own fortunes by bestowing a peerage on an old foe , Peter Mandelson , and offers him a seat in his cabinet .
Two days later , intriguing details of his summer pursuits begin to emerge .
Mandelson , it is claimed , was " dripping pure poison " about Gordon Brown just weeks before being invited back to the fold , according to a column by Martin Ivens in the Sunday Times .
Over drinks with George Osborne at a small family - run taverna on Corfu 's north - east coast , Mandelson , poised to step down as European trade commissioner before being pushed by Brown , is alleged to have provided the shadow chancellor with some ammunition against the prime minister , for years his sworn enemy .
When news of the meeting is made public , Mandelson retaliates with a thinly veiled threat to disclose details of what Osborne had allegedly told him about the Conservatives .
A week passes and the Sunday Times publishes claims that Mandelson gave trade concessions worth up to £ 50 m a year to Russia 's richest man after being entertained on his " superyacht " .
The allegations prompt questions about potential conflicts of interests and threaten to bring fresh embarrassment on the British government .
A spokesman for Mandelson said : " They had been on holiday in the same area and it was purely a social occasion . "
Friends of Mandelson continue to hint that Osborne may come to regret what happened in Greece .
Benjamin Wegg - Prosser , Mandelson 's former aide , wrote on his blog last week : " I suspect the last thing that either Peter Mandelson or Oleg Deripaska [ the Russian oligarch ] needed this week was a media feeding frenzy about what they did last summer . "
The rendezvous between Osborne and Mandelson - two high - fliers from opposite ends of the political spectrum - was precipitated by the fact they have a mutual friend : multimillionaire Nathaniel Rothschild .
The hedge fund manager and son of Lord and Lady Rothschild , is close pals with Mandelson but also went to Oxford with Osborne .
It seems his parents ' luxury villa on the only road between Agios Stefanos and Kerasia is not big enough to accommodate a private gathering of all of his friends , so Mandelson and other guests were " billeted " aboard Deripaska 's £ 80 m yacht .
Known as the " king of aluminium " , Deripaska is thought to be Russia 's richest man .
His company Rusal is one of the world 's largest producers of aluminium .
The Sunday Times claimed that in the past three years Mandelson has twice acted to cut European aluminium import duties and that Rusal would have been one of the main beneficiaries .
It is also claimed that at the time of Mandelson 's Corfu holiday his trade department was a few weeks into a fresh investigation into aluminium foil tariffs , which could have hit one of Deripaska 's companies .
As noted above , Mandelson 's spokesman says they met for purely social reasons .
But in a sensational new twist to the tale on the day of Mandelson 's 55th birthday Rothschild today spoke out to defend the Labour peer and suggested that it was Osborne 's behaviour on the Mediterranean that should be held up for scrutiny .
Rothschild accused the shadow chancellor and Andrew Feldman , a Tory fundraiser also holidaying in Corfu , of soliciting a political donation from the Russian - in breech of party funding rules .
He also claims Feldman suggested – at a later date – that the donation be " channelled " through one of Deripaska 's British companies to make it legal .
The Tories categorically deny the claim , saying : " The Conservative party has neither sought or received any donations from Mr Deripaska nor any of his companies . "
Wegg - Prosser says of Osborne on his blog today : " George loves to play the game , and on recent form he is good at it , rising to the heights of shadow chancellor with relative ease .
Everything for him is a game of political chess : a tactical policy move here , a strategic friendship there , a word in this columnist 's ear and a lunch with that captain of industry .
" Always trading on insights , gossip , wit and considerable intelligence .
Yet , might the same skills which have enabled him to climb the greasy pole be the same attributes that bring him down ? "
The plot is still thickening .
Bucket lists are a blight on modern culture .
About a year ago I got so fed up with all those Channel 4 shows , Sunday supplement articles , self - help books and websites telling me the books I had to read , places I had to go and activities I had to undertake , that I decided to respond in kind with my own anti-list .
The result was a book : Sod That !
103 Things Not to Do Before You Die .
Writing Sod That !
was a lot of fun , but it did n't provide the catharsis I expected .
Spending time finding out about all the things I did n't want to be doing actually proved an uncomfortable reminder of my own mortality .
I 'd just turned 30 , just started a family and just spotted my first white hairs .
I was aware that I probably would n't be able to complete all those lists even if I wanted to and began to worry that maybe I was wrong .
This realisation was made all the more poignant by the recent death of Dave Freeman , the co-author of 100 Things to Do Before You Die , the seminal bucket - list book .
He was just 47 and had only completed half the recommendations in his genre - inspiring tome ; a sad irony that made me reconsider my own stance .
Maybe I was missing something vital .
Something that might change my life – or at least give me a new perspective .

There was only one way to find out .
I decided to experience a few of the suggestions that most frequently appear on to - do lists to see if they were as dumb as I 'd imagined .
That 's why , far too early on a Sunday morning , I found myself staring over the edge of an unpleasantly steep slope in rural Gloucestershire contemplating my descent down it in a giant water - filled plastic football .
Zorbing or ( more accurately when water is involved ) aqua - sphering , is the counter - evolutionary and singularly useless practice of rolling down hills inside oversized orbs .
It was invented in New Zealand in the 1990s and has been topping must - do lists ever since .
My photographer friend Jon , having read so much positive propaganda , was eager to join in – until he saw the size of the hill .
On the edge of the slope , the inner pod of the sphere towering over me had just been filled with extremely cold water and I was expected to dive into it .
It was a nasty shock but it had nothing on the next stage of the process .
As soon as I was sitting uncomfortably , five men shoved the ball – hard – and I was careering downhill at a horrifying speed .
I vainly tried to keep myself upright , frantically paddling with my feet against the front of the ball as my head was banged repeatedly against the back , while great waves of foaming water crashed into my face .
The result was complete disorientation and the feeling that if this thing did n't stop soon , I was going to drown .
Mercifully , it stopped .
It had been one of the longest 10 seconds of my life .
I got out , shaken , stirred and yet curiously elated .
I now understood why adrenalin junky list - makers rated Zorbing so highly .
My heart thumping , hands shaking and almost completely unable to speak , I eventually managed to tell Jon that it was " quite nice when it ended " .
I could feel a headache coming on .
Time for a coffee break .
Kopi Luwak is allegedly the finest – and at £ 15 for 50g certainly the most expensive – coffee known to humanity .
It 's made from beans that have been eaten by and passed through the digestive tract of the Asian palm civet ( a racoon - like mammal ) and hand - collected from the rainforest floor on islands in the Indonesian archipelago .
Connoisseurs claim it is unusually smooth with a unique musty flavour .
There 's also a certain James Bond appeal to its exclusivity that helps ensure it maintains a high place on lists of things to buy before you die .
This claim to exclusivity was somewhat undermined by the fact that Google helped me source some in less than five minutes .
Disappointingly , it was delicious .
It was as smooth as predicted , with a clean lingering , almost citrusy aftertaste .
In fact , my pleasure was marred only by the thought that some Indonesian had had to scrabble around on the jungle floor picking up turds just so that I could enjoy my coffee .
Next on the list ?
My barnet – which had passed over the fine line from tousled to scruffy and was now entering the long and straggly zone .
I was ready to believe the must - do list line that hacking it all off would prove a " liberation " , and looking forward to never having to comb it .
In the event I discovered , first , amusement – as I gave myself a pastiche of a combover – then a dreadful Samson - style regret as I saw my locks drop around my feet .
Plus , I now looked like a safety match and had an itchy scalp on top of my post - Zorbing headache ; I was also rapidly developing post - caffeine jitters .
Just what I did n't need on the long drive to Portsmouth and Eastney nudist beach .
Public nudity , like head - shaving , is generally sold by list - compilers as " liberating " .
They also tend to claim it's " challenging " and " awareness - raising " , as if such things are 1 ) appealing and 2 ) likely to be achieved by showing people your bottom .
As far as I was concerned , this would be a situation that would present one of two problems .
Either the beach would be full of naked people I found attractive and I 'd feel like a perv , or it would be full of naked people I found disgusting and I 'd be unable to eat meat - based products for the rest of my life .
In the event , I encountered a third and definitely worst - case scenario .
Namely that everyone else was fully clothed and I alone was going to get naked .
The fact that it was now late on a cloudy overcast afternoon provided a partial explanation for this lack of flesh , but it was still disconcerting to walk past what seemed to be a Muslim youth group outing complete with veiled women , gathered around a lamb barbecue .
Was I really going to get my babymaker out in front of these people ?
The answer , of course , was yes – I had n't driven all this way to feel like a chicken .
So I walked to the water 's edge , as far as possible from innocent eyes , and dropped everything .
For a brief , golden moment it was – yes – liberating .
There I was , the breeze gently playing around my buttocks , with absolutely nothing between myself and the Isle of Man in the hazy distance .
I wanted to shout at the exhilaration .
Then a rusting old hulk of a ship hove into view ( this was Portsmouth after all ) , the grey water at my feet started fizzing in a polluted manner and the moment passed .
I decided to go home .
But the day still had one more experience in store .
On the motorway back to Oxford , a Vauxhall Corsa strayed into my lane .
Only a sharp swerve and the fast braking of the car behind saved me .
As I grappled with the steering wheel , my heart pounded in my chest .
I was shaking .
In short , it reminded me of Zorbing .
But this all - too - real near - death experience put such adrenalin chasing into grim perspective .
It also occurred to me that if I had been squashed then , pretty much my last act on earth would have been getting my bum out on a beach in Portsmouth .
There are , I realised , thousands of other things I 'd rather do before death catches up with me .
And I 'm glad I 've still got the chance to do them .

Ted Stevens : Prosecutors out to smear my name Associated Press
Published : Monday August 25 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- Sen .
Ted Stevens accused the Justice Department of trying to smear his character Monday as he prepared to defend his seat in a crowded Republican primary election .
Stevens , the Senate 's longest - serving Republican , is scheduled to stand trial next month for lying on Senate records about hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts and home renovations he received from VECO Corp .
Prosecutors also want to present somewhat unrelated evidence that they believe shows the Alaska senator got a sweetheart condominium deal , his daughter got a discounted car and his son got a job from VECO .
In court documents filed Monday , Stevens suggested the Justice Department was making accusations haphazardly , hoping to damage his reputation at trial .
Those accusations have nothing to do with the crime he 's charged with , attorneys said .
" They are an obvious attempt to smear the Senator 's character , " defense attorneys wrote , adding later that the Justice Department was " continuing its assault on the senator 's family . "
Alaska 's political patriarch , Stevens faces six challengers Tuesday in Alaska 's primary .
Despite the indictment , he has drawn crowds at campaign events and is expected to make it through the primary .
In a letter to the Anchorage Daily News , one supporter said Stevens has done more for the state than anyone in history .
Concerning Stevens ' home remodeling , " shame on all of us for not helping with the project , " wrote Richard Rhyner , who has lived in Anchorage for 50 years .
" After all he has done for us , every man , woman and child should have chipped in to build our greatest Alaskan ever a home the size of the White House . "
The Justice Department filed court documents of its own Monday , outlining its suspected motive for why Stevens would have kept home repairs and other freebies off his Senate financial records :
Doing so would have touched off ethics investigations and news stories that could have jeopardized Stevens ' political future .
Reporters , ethics officials and watchdog groups would have discovered that when VECO needed help , company founder Bill Allen had a direct line into the office of one of Capitol Hill 's most powerful lawmakers , prosecutors said .
" Most importantly , however , disclosure of the things of value and the negative repercussions flowing from that disclosure would have threatened the defendant 's future stream of things of value from VECO , Bill Allen and others , " prosecutors said .
Stevens ' attorneys scoffed at that suggestion , saying the Justice Department was trying to hint at corruption in a case that 's really about paperwork .
" The government wishes to smuggle in suggestions of bribery and corruption that it has not charged and cannot prove , " Stevens ' attorneys wrote .
If he makes it through Tuesday 's primary , the November election likely wo n't be so easy .
The Republican nominee likely will face popular Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich , who has shown strong fundraising numbers .
While Begich is able to campaign across the state , Stevens will be tethered to a Washington courtroom during the height of campaign season .

Olbermann : McCain would ' rather win than catch bin Laden ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday September 11 , 2008
Print This Email This
In a Special Comment on the eve of September 11th , MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann blasted the Republican Party for its reduction of 9/11 to " a Republican campaign slogan " and Senator John McCain in particular for using terrorism to " blackmail " the American people .
" This is supposed to be a day of remembrance , " Olbermann began .
" Instead , 9/11 has become a brand name -- a Republican campaign slogan , propaganda of the lowest form .
9/11 has became a trademark logo . "
" 911 ( TM ) has made possible the greatest slight - of - hand in our nation 's history , " he continued .
" The political party in office at the time of the attacks ... and the presidential administration already through 20 % of its first term ... have thus far not only escaped any blame for the malfeasance and criminal neglect which allowed the attacks to occur , but ... have managed to make it seem as if the other political party would be solely and irredeemably responsible for any similar catastrophe in the future . "
Olbermann particularly blasted the so - called 9/11 tribute shown at the Republican convention , saying , " What we got was not a tribute to the dead of 9/11 , or even a tribute to the responders , or the singularity of purpose we all felt .
The Republicans instead gave us sociological pornography , a virtual snuff film . "
" Years ago , " Olbermann continued , " responsible television networks .... voluntarily stopped showing the most graphic of the images of the World Trade Center , except with the strongest of warnings .
And yet the Republicans at their convention , having virtually seized control of the cable news operations , showed the worst of it . "
" It was terrifying , " Olbermann commented .
" After all , its object was to terrify .
Not to commemorate , not to call for unity , not to remember the dead , but to terrify .
To open again the horrible wounds .
To brand the skin of this nation with the message , as hateful as the terrorists ' own , that you must vote Republican or this will happen again and you will die . "
It should be noted , however , that MSNBC re-ran its entire coverage from the morning of 9/11 on last year 's anniversary of the events .
Olbermann then turned his attention to John McCain , saying , " That manipulative videotape from your convention should tar you always in the minds of decent Americans .
... but the senator has done worse with 9/11 and the evil behind it . "
He quoted a statement by McCain -- one of many similar claims -- that " I know how to improve our capabilities so that we will capture Osama Bin Laden ... I know how to do it . "
" Senator McCain seems to be quite serious that he and he alone ... can capture Bin Laden , " suggested Olbermann .
" Thus we must take him at his word that this is no mere ludicrous campaign boast .
We must assume Senator McCain truly believes he is capable of doing this and has been capable of doing this .
" Well , then Senator , " Olbermann continued , " you 'd better go and do it , had n't you ?
If you have had a means of capturing Osama Bin Laden and you do not immediately inform some responsible authority of the full scope of that plan , you are ... aiding and abetting Osama Bin Laden . "
Olbermann went on to charge that , " You , sir , are blackmailing some portion of the American electorate into voting for your party by promising to help in the capture of Bin Laden only if you are made president .
... ' I 'd rather win an election than catch Bin Laden . '
No more cynical calculation has ever been made in this nation 's history . "
" You have shown that it is John McCain first and the country last , " concluded Olbermann .
" Terrorists are not what you , John McCain , fight .
Terrorists are what you , John McCain use . "
One blogger who describes himself as an Olbermann fan , however , felt that Olbermann had overreached in his twisting of McCain 's words .
" How is this different than any other campaign boast ? " wrote Hank Kalet , managing editor of the South Brunswick Post .
" He 's not saying he has a secret plan , but that he has the know - how , the temperment and the commitment to find and capture the elusive Bin Laden .
I think he 's full of you know what , but that 's not the point .
Olbermann in tonight 's special comment unfortunately crashes on the shoals of logic and partisanism , playing loose with McCain 's words in nearly the same way as he accuses -- rightly -- Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity of doing . "

KUWAIT , Sept 22 ( Reuters ) - Kuwait has ordered local Internet service providers to block online video - sharing website YouTube over clips that could offend Muslims .
“ Since the website displays the Koran in the form of songs sung with the oud ( stringed instrument ) ... and displays disrespectful pictures of the Prophet Mohammad ... please proceed with immediate effect in blocking the website www.youtube.com,” read a copy of a memo obtained by Reuters .
The Ministry of Communications was not immediately available for a comment .
The website could still be accessed in Kuwait on Monday .

Woman ’s Paper Skin a Walking Notepad
For this Chinese woman who suffers from a condition called artificial urticaria , her skin has served as a notebook for all the years of her life .
This strange medical anomaly has no ill effects , but most agree that it is very weird .
Huang Xiangji is a 50 - year - old woman from Chengdu who uses her skin like writing paper .
Huang claims that when she writes a word on her skin by using her fingernail , the letters protrude from her skin a moment later .
“ I used my body as a notebook for years , ”  says Huang .
Even as a child , she was able to do this and she would often create shopping lists on her arm before going out to the stores .
( That ’s one list you ca n’t misplace ! )

Nearly a month after a published study on increasing U.S. prison population revealed more than 1 in 100 American adults are behind bars , two University of Michigan professors are aiming to elevate the public debate on prison reform .
The timing , they say , should coincide with the intensely debated presidential campaign , where the growing prison population topic should be considered along with the economy and Iraq War .
" This is an invisible subject , " said U - M professor Buzz Alexander .
" It 's a crisis and no one is really talking about it . "
In late February , the Pew Center on the States reported that about 2.3 million people are incarcerated in state and federal prisons , and local jails .
Last year , population grew by 25,000 .
After three decades of growth , prison population has tripled .
The results , according to Alexander and U - M professor Jeffrey Morenoff , show an alarming and widening gap between the advantaged and disadvantaged .
" The current system is destroying the life - course of those incarcerated , and not providing them with ways to become part of the American economic and cultural fabric , " said Alexander , professor of English and founder of the Prison Creative Arts Project , which inspires inmates to express themselves through the arts .
" We are not making active efforts to rehabilitate people in prison , " Morenoff said .
" The rehabilitation ideal died in the 1970s and 1980s .
But there are examples of rehab programs in and outside prison that are successful and lower rates of recidivism .
The criminal justice system has n't caught up with the social science . "
Each U - M professor has his own way of drawing attention to what they both consider as a national crisis that goes unnoticed and hardly discussed .
For Alexander , it 's through engaging prisoners to create and participate in the arts ; for Morenoff , it 's through extensive research into the causes of recidivism rates .
Since 1990 , Alexander has worked with state prisoners , offering workshops on visual and performing arts .
The 13th annual Exhibition of Art by Michigan Prisoners runs through April 9 .
The exhibit is held at the Duderstadt Studio Gallery on U - M's North Campus .
Based on his first - hand experience working with prisoners , Alexander said the sentencing is often arbitrary , perfunctory , inhumane and singles outs ethnic and racial groups .
For instance , one in 36 adult Hispanic men , one in 15 black adult men ; and one in nine black men ages 20 to 34 are behind bars .
While rates of violent crimes has fallen by 25 percent over the last 20 years , prison population has tripled .
Overall , the U.S. imprisons more people than any other nation .
Second is China , with 1.5 million people in behind bars .
While there appears a public need to make sure people are punished for crimes , the financial cost to incarcerate are staggering .
Morenoff estimates that it costs $ 25,000 - $ 30,000 per year ( in public money ) to incarcerate each prisoner .
That cost increases significantly with older prisoners and those who need medical care .
" Right now , we have punishment for the sake of deterrence , and making examples of people , " Morenoff said .
" But the deep - seated reason is that people feel that justice is being served .
" You would think that sending more people to prison would lower crime rates , but there is some evidence , albeit controversial , that communities which send more people to prison have higher crimes rates , " he said .
" Incarceration can deplete communities of their assets and disrupt their social fabric , which can actually increase crimes rates .
" It 's still an open question . "

The Art of Exploiting a Tragedy
Forgive me for bringing up the TV show Mad Men again but — well , I do love it .
I blogged recently about a book of Frank O’Hara ‘s poetry that appeared on the show and then had an Amazon sales spike .
In this week ’s episode , there ’s a terrible crash of an American Airlines plane and one of the ad agency ’s top guys wants to go after the American account since he knows they ’ll be looking to make a fresh start .
As it turns out , one of the people who died on the plane was the father of one of the younger execs at the agency .
So the top guy gets the younger guy to go with him to pitch American , using the father ’s death as a selling point to persuade American that this is indeed the agency for them , since they have such a deep , personal , tragic connection to the crash .
I was reminded of this scene , just a bit , when I received the following mass e-mail :

The US Credit Crunch ' The Economic Crisis Has Probably Doomed McCain 's Campaign '
Republicans now appear ready to back the plan , but the bailout remains deeply unpopular with many conservatives and large numbers of voters .
In a SPIEGEL ONLINE interview , conservative commentator Fred Barnes argues the financial crisis could stall John McCain 's presidential bid .
HOUSTON — With less than a week to go before the scheduled execution of a man who contends his murder trial was tainted by a love affair between the judge and the prosecutor , a state judge on Thursday ordered a hearing into the accusation and the Texas attorney general called for a review of the fairness of the trial .
The judge ’s order and the attorney general ’s request are the latest twists in a complicated legal drama that has prompted criticism from prosecutors , judges and experts on legal ethics across the nation .
They argue that if the love affair occurred , the condemned man did not receive a fair trial .
On Wednesday , 22 prominent former judges and prosecutors — among them the former F.B.I. director William S. Sessions — urged Gov. Rick Perry to put off the execution to allow more time for a hearing to determine if the claim of an affair is true .
“ It is an irrevocable wrong to send a man to his death without ever hearing this critical evidence , ” the group said in a letter to Governor Perry , a Republican .
A lot of questions about how to have sex , how to masturbate , and worries about all of what 's all going on down below can be easily solved by simply getting to know what genitals and other reproductive organs are all about .
Many things some people presume are problems with some kinds of sex or genital function or appearance are just realities of anatomy they did n't know .
Here 's the scoop for most people whose bodies have a vulva , vagina , labia , clitoris and / or uterus and other structures .
Let 's get started !
It can help to get yourself a mirror , make sure you have some real privacy ( or at least a door that locks ) and some quality time to get to know your body and yourself .
We 'll just look at what you can see and feel , to get you started .
Sit with your knickers off and your legs open , and get ready to take a tour .
Vulva , not vagina
The proper name for the outer genitals is the vulva ( vuhl-vah ) .
The vagina is only one part of these organs , and not the whole of them , and many people mistakenly call the vulva the vagina .
Where your pubic hair is , below your belly button , is a fatty area of tissue ( skin ) called the mons ( mahns ) .
Your pubic hair will move downward , as will that fatty tissue , around your labia majora ( lay - bee - ah ) or " lips . "
If you pull your outer labia open , you will see your labia minora , or lips , which are not covered with hair , and look a bit like flower petals or small tongues .
The size , length and color of the inner labia and other parts of the vulva will differ from person to person .
The labia may be long and thick , or barely visible , and may look purple , red , pink , blackish or brown , depending on your own coloring .
All of these variations are absolutely normal , as are the labia being two different sizes or shapes .
The purpose of your inner labia is pretty important ; they have sensory nerve endings which contribute to sexual pleasure and also keep icky bacteria away from what is called the vestibule .

Or , if you want some other views of the vulva , you can take a look at Betty Dodson 's illustrations on - site Some people have a lot of worries about their labia and the appearance of their vulva .

The Infamous Clitoris
Looking at the vestibule , between those inner labia from the top down ( right below your mons ) , you 'll first see the top of the inner labia , which create a little skin fold called the clitoral hood .
That hood connects to the glans , which is the tip -- and only the tip -- of the clitoris ( klit - or - iss ) .
If you pull up the hood with your fingers , you can get a closer look .
The clitoris -- which in full , internal and external , is nearly of the same size as the penis -- is usually the most sensitive spot on , and involved in the most sensitive areas of , the vulva .
It 's got twice the number of sensory nerve endings the penis does , and it also interacts with over 15,000 nerve endings throughout the whole pelvic area .
It is created of the same sort of erectile tissue that the head of a penis has .
Before we all were born , until about the sixth week of our lives as an embryo , our sexual organs were slightly developed , but completely the same no matter our sex or gender .
If you feel the clitoris with your fingers , you 'll probably feel a tingle or a tickle .
Rubbing it a bit , you can feel a hardish portion that is the shaft of the clitoris .
The clitoris ( sometimes called the " clit " or the " spot " ) is the primary source of most genital sensation .
When you masturbate , it is what you will most likely ( but not always ) touch and manipulate to pleasure yourself .
The clitoris is , in fact , the only organ on the entire body that is solely for sexual arousal , and is attached to ligaments , muscles and veins that become filled with blood during arousal ( when you get sexually excited ) and contract during orgasm .
The clitoris is what most like to have stimulated in some way during oral or digital ( with hands and fingers ) sex , during masturbation , and during intercourse , and not just the tip or shaft .
The clitoris is internal as well as external -- and the whole thing is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside -- with legs , called crura , that are within the outer labia , as well as the clitoral ( or vestibular ) bulbs , which surround part of the lower portion of the vaginal canal .
People are different in how and where we like our clitorises touched ( or if we do at all ) .
For some , rubbing too fast or hard , or right on the tip or shaft may be uncomfortable , but for others , it 's just the thing .
Like near anything else in sex , the best way to find out is usually to experiment by masturbating .
For more on every body 's anatomy from the standpoint of pleasure , check out : With Pleasure : A View of Whole Sexual Anatomy for Every Body .
Looking lower , you may be able to see another hood - like shape .
Right below that shape is a teeny , tiny , barely visible little dot or slit , which is your urethra or urinary opening , where you urinate ( or pee ) from .
Below that is the vaginal opening ( sometimes people call it a " slit " or " hole " ) .
You might notice how close the urinary opening is to the vaginal opening .
Because of this , sometimes sexual activity can bring bacteria which infect the urinary opening , so it 's important during sexual activity to both empty your bladder before and after , and to be sure your or your partners hands , mouth or other organs are clean .
Confused about any of this ?
Have questions , concerns or just want to geek out ?
You can come talk anonymously and directly with our staff and volunteers or other community members on our moderated forums anytime .
Just barely inside the vaginal opening , you may see the vaginal corona , or hymen .
Your corona may or may not be easily distinguishable from the rest of your vaginal opening , and that is n't always because of sex .
Long ago ( and still sometimes today ) it was thought that the corona / hymen was " evidence " of whether or not a woman had had sexual intercourse , but that is not the case at all .
Not even all people with vulvas are born with intact or easily identifiable vaginal coronas !
When someone is talking about " popping a cherry , " this is what they are referring to , though it 's a misnomer .
Your corona is usually membranes that erode somewhat over time , primarily due to hormones and vaginal discharges , but later can also wear away more due to vaginal sex if a person engages in that .
When it is more intact , it rarely covers that opening completely , but has little holes and perforations in it .
Even after it has been worn away or stretched , small folds of tissue remain .
During the first few times someone has intercourse or other vaginal entry , pain or bleeding can happen ( though it more often does not ) due to the wearing away of the corona .
However , that pain or bleeding is more commonly because you had sex without being aroused enough to be properly lubricated , or did not use extra lubricant if needed .
On the other hand , there are some whose vaginal coronas simply are so thick , or have such a small opening , that it is indeed painful to have intercourse or enter the vagina otherwise , and sometimes a medical procedure needs to be done to remedy that .
All in all , there are many causes for or sources of sexual pain , and the corona is only one of many .
Now , if you can slide your finger into your vaginal opening , and squeeze your vaginal walls ( engaging what are commonly called PC -- pubococcygeus -- or Kegel muscles ) , just like you were trying to hold it in when you have to urinate , or when you 're trying to stop the flow of your urine .
You can feel a lot of folds of skin and different textures , and see how the vagina ( which is the passage between the vaginal opening and the cervix ) can hold your fingers .
That is the same way it holds a tampon , a penis or toy , or a child during labor .
Your vagina may be wetter or dryer right now depending on your menstrual cycle .
If you 're someone who menstruates and ovulates , then right after you 've had your period , or when you are n't aroused you 'll generally be dryer , and about two weeks into your cycle , or when you are aroused , you 'll usually be a bit wetter .
The mucus , or " discharge " from your vagina , which you 'll sometimes see on your underpants , may vary in texture , scent and color greatly .
Some people are freaked out by this , but there is no need to be , and trying to get rid of that mucus with douching or other methods is not healthy , as that mucus keeps your vagina clean of bacteria and maintains a careful acid balance vital to your health .
If you 're ever in doubt about vaginal discharge , the best thing to do is to call your doctor .
In general , however , unless the mucus is spotted with blood and you are n't on your period , makes you itch at all , or is greenish in hue , it 's probably healthy , normal discharge .
Life on the Inside
If you can put your finger inside your vagina , towards your belly , not your back , you may or may not feel a spongy area that is a bit like the roof of your mouth in texture ( if you have short fingers , you may not be able to ) .
That area is what many people call the G - spot , or Grafenburg Spot , another potential source of , or contributor to , sexual pleasure or orgasm ( and is probably another portion of the internal clitoris or urinary system ) .
The vagina itself , especially past the first , front 1 / 3rd of it , has hardly any sensory nerve endings at all .
The sensations people feel inside the vagina are often more about the external and internal clitoris , than the vagina itself .
Understand , however , that not all find that area being touched or stimulated to be pleasurable ( or even to feel like anythign at all ! ) , and it does n't lead to orgasm magically in everybody .
It is n't a magic button , or any kind of button at all , it is simply a potential area of your genital anatomy that may be responsive to stimulation and give you pleasure .
If you poke your finger deeply into your vagina , you may feel something deep inside that feels like a nose or a dimpled chin .
This is your cervix , which is the base of the uterus , where , if you were pregnant , a baby would grow .
The cervix is the passage through which sperm travel to meet an egg in the fallopian tubes , but do n't worry -- nothing but sperm can usually fit in there .
In other words , you can't " lose " a tampon or a toy or anything else in your vagina , because it ends with your cervix .
If you appreciate and value what we do here at Scarleteen , you can make a difference by helping to sustain us .
Because we are an entirely independent organization , working in an incredibly controversial arena ( and all the more so because we 're fully inclusive and progressive ) , staying afloat is often a real challenge for us .
You can help keep Scarleteen thriving by making a personal donation , buying copies of our book for yourself or to donate to public / school libraries , health centers or other venues , purchasing books and products from Amazon through links here , buying advertising at Scarleteen , volunteering some of your time and just getting the word out to others about what we do here and how valuable it is .
Once you take your fingers out of your vagina , follow the trail of your genitals a bit lower .
Right under your vaginal opening is a flat length of skin called the perineum ( pair - ee - nay - uhm ) .
Below the perineum is your anus .
The anus is the opening to your rectum , through which your bowel movements pass through from your bowel .
Some people enjoy touching or rubbing their anus , as well as having it licked , or for having anal intercourse .
Some people do not .
Again , people vary in what we do and do n't like when it comes to sex .
The important thing to recognize is that , first , if you shower or bathe regularly , your anus is not dirty , because feces ( bowel movements ) are not stored there or in your rectum .
Only trace amounts of feces may remain there .
However , anal sex of any sort is no more safe than vaginal sex for several reasons and can also present some additional risks vaginal sex does not .
First , the anus does not have any natural lubrication of its own , and the anal tissues are far more delicate and susceptible to tearing than the vaginal tissues .
That makes anal sex potentially more painful if not done with care , as well as more risky as far as the spread of STIs .
If you want to explore your anus either alone or with a partner ( or find out more about safer sex as a whole ) , check out these links on how to do so safely :
Take a look at your vulva a few times , and you can experiment touching it to find out how you really work down there .
Though our anatomy has the same components , every person is different in both the appearance and the experience of our genitals .
There are no " magic " buttons that please us all the same , and the only way to find out what you like , and what you 're comfortable with , is to get to know yourself and your body on your own .
Above all else , understand that your genitals are really no different from any other part of your anatomy : parts is parts .
They are n't something to be ashamed of or embarrassed about , and in many cultures our genitals are thought of as sacred , and indeed , they are .
Treat them with honor and care , and let them bring you joy .

NASA ’s Cassini mission has detected liquid hydrocarbons on Saturn ’s moon Titan , in a large , glassy lake near the moon ’s south pole .
Before the Cassini mission began , scientists thought Titan would have global oceans of methane , ethane and other light hydrocarbons .
But after more than 40 close flybys of Titan by Cassini , data showed no global oceans exist .
However hundreds of dark , lake - like features are present .
Until now , it was not known whether these features were liquid or simply dark , solid material .
Using Cassini ’s Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer ( VIMS ) , which identifies the chemical composition of objects by the way matter reflects light , a liquid ethane lake 235 kilometers ( 150 miles ) long was detected .
This makes
Titan the only body in our solar system beyond Earth known to have liquid on its surface .
“ This is the first observation that really pins down that Titan has a surface lake filled with liquid , ” said Bob Brown of the University of Arizona , Tucson , leader of the VIMS instrument .
Scientists had deduced through earlier observations that there was likely liquid on Titan , but this is the first incontrovertible evidence .
( Emily Lakdawalla at the Planetary Society explains this excellently . )
“ Detection of liquid ethane confirms a long - held idea that lakes and seas filled with methane and ethane exist on Titan , ” said Larry Soderblom , a Cassini interdisciplinary scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey .
“ The fact we could detect the ethane spectral signatures of the lake even when it was so dimly illuminated , and at a slanted viewing path through Titan ’s atmosphere , raises expectations for exciting future lake discoveries by our instrument . ”
Titan ’s hazy , nitrogen and methane atmosphere makes it difficult to study the moon ’s surface .
The liquid ethane was identified using a technique that removed the interference from the atmospheric hydrocarbons .
The VIMS instrument observed a lake , called Ontario Lacus , in Titanâ€™s south polar region during a close Cassini flyby in December 2007 .
The lake is roughly 20,000 square miles ( 7,800 square miles ) in area , slightly larger than North America ’s Lake Ontario .
The ethane is in a liquid solution with methane , other hydrocarbons and nitrogen .
At Titanâ€™s surface temperatures , approximately 300 degrees Fahrenheit below zero , these substances can exist as both liquid and gas .
Titan shows overwhelming evidence of evaporation , rain , and fluid - carved channels draining into what , in this case , is a liquid hydrocarbon lake .
Earth has a hydrological cycle based on water and Titan has a cycle based on methane .
Scientists ruled out the presence of water ice , ammonia , ammonia hydrate and carbon dioxide in Ontario Lacus .
The observations also suggest the lake is evaporating .
It is ringed by a dark beach , where the black lake merges with the bright shoreline .
Cassini also observed a shelf and beach being exposed as the lake evaporates .
“ During the next few years , the vast array of lakes and seas on Titan ’s north pole mapped with Cassini ’s radar instrument will emerge from polar darkness into sunlight , giving the infrared instrument rich opportunities to watch for seasonal changes of Titan ’s lakes , ” Soderblom said .
More information is available at NASA ’s Cassini site , JPL ’s Cassini site , and the Univeristy of Arizona ’s VIMS site .

Rep : Learn The DD Command Revised
How To Encrypt an 8.0 GB SDHC MicroSD Card was on 06-19-2011 .
First Time visitors please reply .
How To Encrypt an 8.0 GB SDHC MicroSD Card
Put the card into an USB adapter .
Such devices are not perfect .
One might have to push the MicroSD card into the reader as far as it will go , and others might have to pull it back a millimeter or two .
If the kernel does not detect a partition on a new card , it 's detecting the USB adapter only .
Adjust the card slighty , and replace the adapter if necessary .
Should show some new device(s ) : Code : ls /dev/sd * /dev/sdb /dev/sdb1 Code : dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdb bs=4k Code : apt - get install cryptsetup Code : parted Deep inside , she knows she cannot attain masculinity , but she can attain masculinity deep inside !
Code : cryptsetup -- verbose --verify - passphrase luksFormat / dev/sdb1 Code : cryptsetup luksOpen / dev/sdb1 vol_1 Code : mkfs.xfs - imaxpct=3 /dev/mapper/vol_1
Code : mkdir /AES_Drive && mount / dev/ mapper/ vol_1 /AES_Drive Code : umount /AES_Drive && cryptsetup luksClose / dev/ mapper/vol_1
Linux DD
The basic command structure is as follows :
Code : dd if = < source > of= < target > bs=< byte size > ( " USUALLY " some power of 2 , and usually not less than 512 bytes ( ie , 512 , 1024 , 2048 , 4096 , 8192 , 16384 , but can be any reasonable whole integer value . ) skip= seek= conv= < conversion >
Warning !!
If you reverse the source and target , you can wipe out a lot of data .
This feature has inspired the nickname " dd " Data Destroyer .
Warning !!
Caution should be observed when using dd to duplicate encrypted partitions .
Examples : duplicate one hard disk partition to another hard disk partition : Sda2 and sdb2 are partitions .
You want to duplicate sda2 to sdb2 .
Code : dd if=/dev/sda2 of=/dev/sdb2 bs=4096 conv=notrunc , noerror
Be careful with order of if and of .
You can write a blank disk to a good disk if you get confused .
If you duplicate a smaller partition to a larger one , using dd , the larger one will now be formatted the same as the smaller one .
And there will be no space left on the drive .
The way around this is to use Code : rsync
To make an iso image of a CD :
This duplicates sector for sector .
MyCD.iso will be a hard disk image file of the CD .
Code : dd if=/ dev/hdc of=/home/sam/myCD.iso bs=2048 conv=sync , notrunc
Code : mkdir /mnt/myCD mount -o loop / home / sam/ myCD.iso /mnt/myCD
Code : cd /mnt/myCD
Code : dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/home/sam/floppy.image
Code : #!/ bin/bash for n in `seq 7` ; do dd if= / dev/ urandom of= / dev/sda bs=8b conv=notrunc ; done anti_scqid .
Code : chmod +x anti_swqid
Best Laptop Backup : Purchase a laptop drive and an USB 2.0 drive enclosure ( Total cost $ 100.00USD ) .
Assemble the lappy drive into the external enclosure .
Plug the external drive into the lappy USB port , and boot with The Knoppix live CD .
Launch a terminal .
This command will backup the existing drive : Code : dd if=/ dev/hda of=/dev/sda bs=64 k conv=notrunc , noerror Code : dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/hda bs=64k conv=notrunc, noerror
This series will make a DVD backup of hard drive partition : Code : dd if=/ dev/hda3 of=/home/sam/backup_set_1.img bs=1M count=4430 dd if=/dev/hda3 skip=4430 of=/home/sam/backup_set_2.img bs=1M count=4430 dd if=/dev/hda3 skip=8860 of=/home/sam/backup_set_3.img bs=1M count=4430 Code : wodim - dev=/dev/hdc --driveropts=burnfree /home/sam/backup_set_1.img
Code : dd if=/media/dvd/backup_set_1.img of=/dev/hda3 bs=1 M conv=sync , noerror Code : dd if=/media/dvd/backup_set_2.img of=/dev/hda3 seek=4430 bs=1 M conv=sync , noerror
Code : dd if=/media/dvd/backup_set_3.img of=/dev/hda3 seek=8860 bs=1 M conv=sync , noerror
If you wrote chat messages and emails to another girl , on your girlfriend 's computer , you can't be sure the files you deleted are unrecoverable .
But you can make sure if anyone were to recover them , that you would n't get busted .
Code : dd if= / dev/sda | sed 's / Wendy / Janet/g ' | dd of=/ dev/sda
This command will overwrite the drive with zeroes Code : dd if=/ dev/zero of= / dev/sda bs=4 k conv=notrunc
I just want to make sure my drive is really zeroed out !!
Code : dd if=/ dev/sda | hexdump - C | grep [ ^00 ]
The following method of ouputting statistics applies to any dd command invocation .
This is an example dd command so you can try it .
Code : / bin/dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null count=100 MB
Code : ps aux | awk '/ bin\/dd / && !/ awk/ { print $ 2} ' | xargs kill -s USR1 $ 1 Code : 33706002+0 records in 33706002+0 records out 17257473024 bytes ( 17 GB ) copied , 34.791 s , 496 MB/s Code : 58596452+0 records in 58596452+0 records out 30001383424 bytes ( 30 GB ) copied , 60.664 s , 495 MB/s
Code : 74473760+0 records in 74473760+0 records out 38130565120 bytes ( 38 GB ) copied , 77.3053 s , 493 MB/s Code : 100000000+0 records in 100000000+0 records out 51200000000 bytes ( 51 GB ) copied , 104.193 s , 491 MB/s Code : dd if=/home/sam/file.file | clamscan - Windows users will find help in the second post , way at the bottom
FYI : duplicating smaller partition or drive to larger partition or drive ; or vice versa :
Code : rsync -avH -- exclude=/other_mount_point/ /mount_point/* /other_mount_point /
Code : rsync -avH -- exclude=/mnt/destination_drive/ /* /mnt/destination_drive/
Code : grub - install update - grub
Making a NTFS partition , is not easy without using Windows based tools .
I was formatting an external drive for my brother , who uses MS Windows XP .
I was n't going to admit Linux could n't make a NTFS partition .
Make an ext3 partition on the drive .
Open a hex editor and make a file containing Code : 07 ext3 partition to NTFS : Code : dd if=/home/sam/file.bin of=/dev/sdb bs=1 seek=450 count=1 Code : 0x1c2 Code : 0x83 Code : 0x07
The four primary partition type byte offsets are :
Code : 0x1c2=450 0x1d2=466 0x1e2=482 0x1f2=498 seek= parameter is changed from 450 to a one of the other values , it will change partition ( hd0,1 ) , ( hd0,2 ) , or ( hd0,3 ) to NTFS type , rather than partition ( hd0,0 ) .
To be revised at a later date :
To make a bootable flash drive : Download 50 MB Debian based distro here :
http://sourceforge.net/projects/insert/
Plug in the thumb drive into a USB port .
Do :
Code : dmesg | tail
Code : dd if=/home/sam/insert.iso of=/dev/sdb ibs=4b obs=1b conv=notrunc, noerror
End to be revised
This command will duplicate the MBR and boot sector of a floppy disk to hard drive image :
Code : dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/home/sam/MBRboot.image bs=512 count=2
Code : dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=4096 conv=notrunc , noerror
Do not reverse the intended source and target .
It happens once in a while , especially to the inexperienced user .
Notrunc means ' do not truncate the output file ' .
Noerror means to keep going if there is an error .
Dd normally terminates on any I /O error .
Duplicate MBR , but not partition table .
This will duplicate the first 446 bytes of the hard drive to a file :
Code : dd if=/dev/sda of=/home/sam/MBR.image bs=446 count=1 if and of , on the dd command line , reverses the direction of the write .
To wipe a hard drive : ( Boot from a live CD distro to do this . )
Code : dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda conv=notrunc
To overwrite all the free disk space on a partition ( deleted files you do n't want recovered ) : Code : dd if=/dev/urandom of=/home/sam/bigfile.file
Code : no room left on device Code : rm bigfile.
file
Sometimes one wants to look inside a binary file , looking only for clues .
The output of the command line : Code : less / home / sam / file.bin Code : dd if=/home/sam/file.bin | hexdump - C | less Code : dd if=/home/sam/file.file | strings -n 8 -t d | less Code : dd if=/home/sam/JPEG.jpg bs=1w count=2 | hexdump - C Code : dd if =JPEG.jpg | hexdump - C Code : dd if=/ dev/sda3 | hexdump - C | " grep 'ff d8 ff e0 ' | 'ff d9 ' " Code : grep Code : 0xba0002f Code : 0 xbaff02a 195 035 183 and 196 079 658 . ( 196 079 658 ) - ( 195 035 183 ) = rough idea of proper bs= and count= parameters .
To find the proper count= figure : ( < decinal offset of footer bytes > - < decimal offset of header bytes > ) / < block size > = < number of blocks in the deleted JPEG file >.
( 195 035 183  196 079 658 ) = ( 1 044 475 ) / ( bs=4096 ) = ( 254.998 ) .
That 's really close to 255 .
If we could land exactly at the header bytes using bs=4096 , we could use count=255 .
But I 'm going to use count=257 , because random chance dictates the probability of landing dead on the header bytes , using 2^x block size is remote .
So we start reading before the header bytes .
We need to use skip= parameter to skip to our start point : 195 035 183 / bs=4096 = 47 616.011 .
We always round down , so dd will start reading before the beginning of the file .
In this case we round down to skip=47615 .
The following writes a file containing the JPEG with some unwanted bytes before and after .
Code : dd if=/dev/sda3 skip=47615 of=/home/sam/work_file.bin count=257 bs=4096 Code : hexdump - C work_file.bin | " grep 'ff d8 ff e0 ' | ' ff d9 ' " dd if=work_file.bin skip=<offset_of_first_header_byte_in_decimal_format > count=<offset_of_last_footer_byte_in_decimal_format +1 > - < offset_of_first_header_byte_in_decimal_format > bs=1c of=JPG.jpg foremost .
The principle of file carving negates the need for Linux undelete programs .
So if your from a MS Windows world , do n't google for linux undelete , but rather , foremost NEXT ...
I put two identical drives in every one of my machines .
Before I do anything that most probably spells disaster , like an untested command line in a root shell , that contains Code : find / - regex ?*.???* - type f | xargs rm -f " $ 1 " Code : dcfldd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=4096 conv=notrunc , noerror
Code : dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sda bs=4096 conv=notrunc, noerror
Code : dd if=/dev/sda2 ( root ) of=/home/sam/root.img bs=4096 conv=notrunc, noerror
Code : dd if /home / sam/ root.img of=/dev/sda2 ( root ) bs=4096 conv=notrunc , noerror
How to make a swap file , or another swapfile on a running system :
Code : dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapspace bs=4k count=250000 mkswap / swapspace swapon / swapspace
How to pick proper block size :
Code : dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1000000 of=/home/sam/1Gb.file dd if=/dev/zero bs=2048 count=500000 of=/home/sam/1Gb.file dd if=/dev/zero bs=4096 count=250000 of=/home/sam/1Gb.file dd if=/dev/zero bs=8192 count=125000 of=/home/sam/1Gb.file
Read :
Code : dd if=/home/sam/1Gb.file bs=64 k | dd of=/dev/null
Code : dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1000000 of=/home/sam/1Gb.file
Play with ' bs= ' and ' count= ' , always having them multiply out to the same toal size .
You can calculate bytes / second like this : 1 Gb / total seconds = Gb /s .
You can get more realistic results using a 3 Gb file .
Rejuvenate a hard drive
To cure input / output errors experienced when using dd .
Over time the data on a drive , especially a drive that has n't been used for a year or two , grows into larger magnetic flux points than were originally recorded .
It becomes more difficult for the drive heads to decipher these magnetic flux points .
This results in I /O errors .
Sometimes sector 1 goes bad , resulting in a useless drive .
Try :
Code : dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sda
Make a file of 100 random bytes :
Code : dd if=/dev/urandom of=/home/sam/myrandom bs=100 count=1
Randomize data over a file before deleting it :
Code : ls -l
In this case it is 3769 Code : ls -l afile -rw------- ... 3769 Nov 2 13:41 < filename > Code : dd if=/dev/urandom of=afile bs=3769 count=1 conv=notrunc
Warning !!
Do not write a partition image file to the same partition .
Code : dd if=/dev/sdb2 of=/home/sam/partition.image bs=4096 conv=notrunc, noerror
Code : dd if=/dev/sdb2 ibs=4096 | gzip > partition.image.gz conv=noerror Code : dd if=partition.image.gz | gunzip | dd of= / dev/sdb2 Code : < filename >.bz2
Code : dd if=/home/sam/partition.image of=/dev/sdb2 bs=4096 conv=notrunc, noerror
Code : dd if=filename of =filename conv=ucase
The Linux kernel makes a number a ramdisks you can make into ramdrives .
You have to populate the drive with zeroes like so :
Code : dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ram7 bs=1k count=16384
Code : mke2fs -m0 / dev/ram7 4096
Code : debian:/home/sam # hdparm -t / dev/ram7 / dev/ram7 : Timing buffered disk reads : 16 MB in 0.02 seconds = 913.92 MB/sec
Code : mkdir /mnt/mem mount / dev/ram7 / mnt/mem
Duplicate ram memory to a file :
Code : dd if=/dev/mem of=/home/sam/mem.bin bs=1024 Code : /dev/mem
Dd will print to the terminal window if you omit the Code : of= / dev/output
Code : dd if=/home/sam/myfile
To search the system memory :
Code : dd if=/dev/mem | strings | grep ' some- string-of-words-in-the- file-you - forgot- to - save - before - the - power - failed '
Code : mkdir / mnt/ mem mount -t ramfs / dev/mem / mnt/ mem dd if=/dev/zero >
/mnt/mem/bigfile.file
You can get arrested in 17 states for doing this next thing .
Make an AES encrypted loop device :
Code : dd if=/dev/urandom of=/home/sam/aes-drv bs =16065b count=100 modprobe loop modprobe cryptoloop modprobe aes losetup -e aes / dev/ loop1 ./ aes - drv password : mkreiserfs / dev/ loop1 mkdir / aes mount -o loop , encryption=aes , acl ./aes- drv /aes password : mv /home / sam / porno /aes
Code : umount / aes losetup -d / dev/loop1 rmmod aes rmmod cryptoloop rmmod loop
If you are curious about what might be on you disk drive , or what an MBR looks like , or maybe what is at the very end of your disk :
Code : dd if=/dev/sda count=1 | hexdump -C
To see the end of the disk you have to know the total number of sectors , and the MAS must be set equal to the MNA .
The helix CD has a utility to set this correctly .
In the dd command , your skip value will be one less than MNA of the disk .
For a 120 GB Seagate SATA drives
Code : dd if=/dev/sda of=home/sam/myfile skip=234441646 bs=512
So this reads sector for sector , and writes the last sector to myfile .
Even with LBA addressing , disks still secretly are read in sectors , cylinders , and heads .
There are 63 sectors per track , and 255 heads per cylinder .
There is a total cylinder count .
512_bytes/sector*63_sectors/track*255heads=16065*512bytes/cylinder=8,225,280_bytes/cylinder .
63_sectors/track*255_heads=sectors /cylinder .
With 234441647 total sectors , and 16065 sectors per cylinder , you get some trailing sectors which do not make up an entire cylinder : 14593.317584812_cylinders / drive .
This leaves 5102 sectors which cannot be partitioned , because to be in a partition you have to be a whole cylinder .
It 's like having part of a person .
That does n't really count as a person .
These become surplus sectors after the last partition .
You can't ordinarily read past the last partition .
But dd can .
It 's a good idea to check for anything writing to surplus sectors .
For our Seagate 120 GB drive , 234,441,647_sectors / drive - 5102_surplus_sectors = 234,436,545 partitionable sectors .
Code : dd if=/dev/sda of=/home/sam/myfile skip=234436545
Code : dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda bs=512 seek=234436545
Block size :
One cylinder in LBA mode = 255 _heads*63_sectors/track=16065_sectors=16065*512_bytes=8,225,280_bytes .
The b means '* 512 ' .
32130b represents a two cylinder block size .
Cylinder block size always works to cover every sector in a partition , because partitions are made of a whole number of cylinders .
One cylinder is 8,225,280 bytes .
If you want to check out some random area of the disk : Code : dd if=/dev/sda of=/home/sam/myfile bs=4096 skip=2000 count=1000
Code : dd if=/home/sam/myfile of=/dev/sda bs=4096 seek=2000 count=1000
On source machine :
Code : dd if=/dev/hda bs =16065 b | netcat < targethost - IP > 1234
Code : netcat -l -p 1234 | dd of=/ dev/hdc bs =16065b
Code : netcat -l -p 1234 | bzip2 > partition.img
Code : netcat -l -p 1234 | gzip > partition.img
Alert !!
Do n't hit enter yet .
Hit enter on the target machine .
THEN hit enter on the source machine .
Netcat is a program , available by default , on most linux installations .
It 's a networking swiss army knife .
In the preceding example , netcat and dd are piped to one another .
One of the functions of the linux kernel is to make pipes .
The pipe character looks like two little lines on top of one another , both vertical .
Here is how this command behaves :
This byte size is a cylinder .
bs =16065b equals one cylinder on an LBA drive .
The dd command is piped to netcat , which takes as its arguments the IP address of the target ( like 192.168.0.1 , or any IP address with an open port ) and what port you want to use ( 1234 ) .
You can also use ssh .
Code : dd if=/dev/sdb2 | ssh sam@192.168.0.121 " sudo dd of=/home/sam/sdb2.img "

This post contains comprehensive documentation with examples for one of the most useful Linux / UNIX / Windows commands : dd .
Dd is a bit - stream duplicator .
If you have questions , post them .
The latest addition , was on 06-19 -2011 .
Put the card into an USB adapter .
Such devices are not perfect .
One might have to push the MicroSD card into the reader as far as it will go , and others might have to pull it back a millimeter or two .
If the kernel does not detect a partition on a new card , it 's detecting the USB adapter only .
Adjust the card slighty , and replace the adapter if necessary .
Should show some new device (s ) : Write random data to the drive : / dev/sdb is only an example .
Learn to use parted , or I quit !
Partition the card : Encrypt the partition with a good passphrase , one that 's easy to remember , but hard to guess .
DO NOT use the standard example , because everyone knows it :
Open the encrypted device : Create a filesystem : Mount : Umount : Just a footnote , Laptops that went to sleep with the encrypted volume open , may wake up with it open !
The basic command structure is as follows : Source is the data being read .
Target is where the data gets written .
Examples : duplicate one hard disk partition to another hard disk partition : Sda2 and sdb2 are partitions .
You want to duplicate sda2 to sdb2 .
If sdb2 does n't exist , dd will start at the beginning of the disk , and create it .
If you duplicate a smaller partition to a larger one , using dd , the larger one will now be formatted the same as the smaller one .
And there will be no space left on the drive .
The way around this is to use , as described below .
To make an iso image of a CD :
This duplicates sector for sector .
MyCD.iso will be a hard disk image file of the CD .
You can mount the image like this :
This will make the CD root directory the working directory , and display the CD root directory .
This will duplicate a floppy disk to hard drive image file :
If you 're concerned about spies taking the platters out of your hard drive , and scanning them using superconducting quantum - interference detectors , you can always add a " for " loop for US Government DoD approved secure hard disk erasure .
Copy and paste the following two lines into a text editor .
Save the file as Do n't run the program until you want to wipe the drive .
Best Laptop Backup : Purchase a laptop drive and an USB 2.0 drive enclosure ( Total cost $ 100.00USD ) .
Assemble the lappy drive into the external enclosure .
Plug the external drive into the lappy USB port , and boot with The Knoppix live CD .
Launch a terminal .
This command will backup the existing drive :
This command will restore from the USB drive to the existing drive :
If the existing disk fails , you can boot from the external drive backup and have your system back instantaneously .
This series will make a DVD backup of hard drive partition :
And so on .
This series will burn the images to DVD +/-R/ RW : and so forth .
To restore the from the backup , load the DVDs in order , and use commands like these : Load another DVDLoad another DVDand so forth .
If you wrote chat messages and emails to another girl , on your girlfriend 's computer , you can't be sure the files you deleted are unrecoverable .
But you can make sure if anyone were to recover them , that you would n't get busted .
Where every instance of Wendy is replaced by Janet , over every millimeter of disk .
I picked names with the same number of characters , but you can pad a smaller name with blanks .
This command will overwrite the drive with zeroes ... will return output of every nonzero byte on the drive .
Play around with it .
Sometimes drives do n't completely zero out on the first try .
The following method of ouputting statistics applies to any dd command invocation .
This is an example dd command so you can try it .
When you want to know how far dd has gotten throwing 100MB of 512 byte blocks of zeroes into digital hell , open another terminal and do :
In the terminal running the dd command you will find something like this :
If you enter the command again , you see more statistics : Againand so on ...
Until the command completesHow To Scan a dd Bitstream for Viruses and Malware : You want to duplicate the root directory tree to another drive , but the other drive is larger .
If you use dd , you will get a file system that is smaller then the larger destination drive .
To duplicate files , not the file system : Format and mount the destination drive .
Rsync will duplicate the files as files :
You need to run : from a the rescue menu of an installation CD / DVD for the target to become bootable .
If target was previously bootable , it remains bootable .
Making a NTFS partition , is not easy without using Windows based tools .
I was formatting an external drive for my brother , who uses MS Windows XP .
I was n't going to admit Linux could n't make a NTFS partition .
Make anpartition on the drive .
Open a hex editor and make a file containingSave the file as file .
bin .
Change thepartition toWill change the partition type byte at offsetfrom Linux type : , to NTFS type : Please use a drive without important data on it .
And ,
If you use a text editor to make the binary 07 file , you will ruin the existing partition table , because ascii 07 is two hexadecimal bytes ( 0x3037 ) .
The four primary partitionoffsets are :
If the ddparameter is changed from 450 to a one of the other values , it will change partition ( hd0,1 ) , ( hd0,2 ) , or ( hd0,3 ) to NTFS type , rather than partition ( hd0,0 ) .
To make a bootable flash drive : Download 50 MB Debian based distro here : Plug in the thumb drive into a USB port .
Do : Look where the new drive is , sdb1 , or something similar .
Do :
Set the BIOS to USB boot , and boot .
This command will duplicate the MBR and boot sector of a floppy disk to hard drive image :
To clone an entire hard disk .
/ dev/sda is the source .
/ dev/sdb is the target :
It happens once in a while , especially to the inexperienced user .
Notrunc means ' do not truncate the output file ' .
Noerror means to keep going if there is an error .
Dd normally terminates on any I /O error .
Duplicate MBR , but not partition table .
This will duplicate the first 446 bytes of the hard drive to a file :
If you have n't already guessed , reversing the objects ofand , on the dd command line , reverses the direction of the write .
To wipe a hard drive : ( Boot from a live CD distro to do this . )
This is useful for making the drive like new .
Most drives have 0x00h written to every byte , from the factory .
To overwrite all the free disk space on a partition ( deleted files you do n't want recovered ) :
When dd ouputsall the free space has been overwritten with random characters .
Delete the big file withSometimes one wants to look inside a binary file , looking only for clues .
The output of the command line : is cryptic , because it 's binary .
For human readable output :
You may also use : Recover deleted JPEG files .
Look at the header bytes of any JPEG .
The last two bytes are the footer .
Using the JPEG header and footer bytes , search the drive .
Command returns the offsets of the beginning and end of each deleted JPEG .
Ifreturned JPEG header bytes at offset : and footer bytes at offset : Convert the hex offsets to decimal offsets , using one of the many logic capable calculators for Linux .
Decimal offsets corresponding to the beginning and end of the JPEG areand .
( 196 079 658 ) - ( 195 035 183 ) = rough idea of proper bs= and count= parameters .
To find the properfigure : ( - ) / = . ( 195 035 183  196 079 658 ) = ( 1 044 475 ) / ( bs=4096 ) = ( 254.998 ) .
That 's really close to 255 .
If we could land exactly at the header bytes using bs=4096 , we could use count=255 .
But I 'm going to use count=257 , because random chance dictates the probability of landing dead on the header bytes , using 2^x block size is remote .
So we start reading before the header bytes .
We need to useparameter to skip to our start point : 195 035 183 / bs=4096 = 47 616.011 .
We always round down , so dd will start reading before the beginning of the file .
In this case we round down to skip=47615 .
The following writes a file containing the JPEG with some unwanted bytes before and after .
This sequence yields the desired JPEG .
That 's the way to get your hands dirty deep in digital data .
But this process it automated in the file carving program , The principle of file carving negates the need for Linux undelete programs .
So if your from a MS Windows world , do n't google for , but rather , NEXT ... I put two identical drives in every one of my machines .
Before I do anything that most probably spells disaster , like an untested command line in a root shell , that contains , I do : and duplicate my present working / dev/sda drive system to the / dev/sdb drive .
If I wreck the installation on sda , I boot from a live CD distro , and do :
And I get everything back exactly the same it was before whatever daring maneuver I was trying did n't work .
You can really , really learn Linux this way , because you can't wreck what you have an exact duplicate of .
You also might consider making the root partition separate from / home , and make / home big enough to hold the root partition , plus more .
Then ,
To make a backup of root : To write the image of root back to the root partition , if you messed up and can't launch the X server , or edited / etc / fstab , and can't figure out what you did wrong .
It only takes a few minutes to restore a 15 GB root partition from an image file :
How to make a swap file , or another swapfile on a running system :
This can solve out of memory issues due to memory leaks on servers that cannot easily be rebooted .
How to pick proper block size :
This method can also be used as a drive benchmark , to find strengths and weaknesses in hard drives : Read : Write :
When dd finishes it outputs ( total size ) / ( total time ) .
You get the idea .
Play with ' bs= ' and ' count= ' , always having them multiply out to the same toal size .
You can calculate bytes / second like this : 1 Gb / total seconds = Gb /s .
You can get more realistic results using a 3 Gb file .
Rejuvenate a hard driveTo cure input / output errors experienced when using dd .
Over time the data on a drive , especially a drive that has n't been used for a year or two , grows into larger magnetic flux points than were originally recorded .
It becomes more difficult for the drive heads to decipher these magnetic flux points .
This results in I /O errors .
Sometimes sector 1 goes bad , resulting in a useless drive .
Try : to rejuvenate the drive .
Rewrites all the data on the drive in nice tight magnetic patterns that can then be read properly .
The procedure is safe and economical .
Make a file of 100 random bytes :/ dev/random produces only as many random bits as the entropy pool contains .
This yields quality randomness for cryptographic keys .
If more random bytes are required , the process stops until the entropy pool is refilled ( waggling your mouse helps ) .
/ dev/urandom does not have this restriction .
If the user demands more bits than are currently in the entropy pool , it produces them using a pseudo random number generator .
Here , / dev/urandom is the Linux random byte device .
Myrandom is a file .
Randomize data over a file before deleting it : to find filesize .
In this case it is 3769 duplicate a disk partition to a file on a different partition .
This will make a file that is an exact duplicate of the sdb2 partition .
You can substitue hdb , sda , hda , etc ... ORMakes a gzipped archive of the entire partition .
To restore use : For bzip2 ( slower , smaller ) , substitute bzip2 and bunzip2 , and name the file .
Restore a disk partition from an image file .
Convert a file to uppercase :
Make a ramdrive : The Linux kernel makes a number a ramdisks you can make into ramdrives .
You have to populate the drive with zeroes like so : Populates a 16 MB ramdisk .
puts a file system on the ramdisk , turning it into a ramdrive .
Watch this puppy smoke .
You only need to do the timing once , because it 's cool .
Make the drive again , because hdparm is a little hard on ramdrives .
You can mount the ramdrive with :
Now you can use the drive like a hard drive .
This is particularly superb for working on large documents or programming .
You can duplicate the large file or programming project to the ramdrive , which on my machine is at least 27 times as fast as / dev/sda , and every time you save the huge document , or need to do a compile , it 's like your machine is running on nitromethane .
The only drawback is data security .
The ramdrive is volatile .
If you lose power , or lock up , the data on the ramdrive is lost .
Use a reliable machine during clear skies if you use a ramdrive .
Duplicate ram memory to a file :
The deviceis your system memory .
You can actually duplicate any block or character device to a file using dd .
Memory capture on a fast system , with bs =1024 takes about 60 seconds , a 120 GB HDD about an hour , a CD to hard drive about 10 minutes , a floppy to a hard drive about 2 minutes .
With dd , your floppy drive images will not change .
If you have a bootable DOS diskette , and you save it to your HDD as an image file , when you restore that image to another floppy it will be bootable .
Dd will print to the terminal window if you omit thepart .
will print the file myfile to the terminal window .
To search the system memory :
If you need to cover your tracks quickly , put the following commands in a script to overwrite system ram with zeroes .
Do n't try this for fun .
This will overwrite all unprotected memory structures with zeroes , and freeze the machine so you have to reboot ( Caution , this also prevents committment of the file system journal , and could trash the file system ) .
You can get arrested in 17 states for doing this next thing .
Make an AES encrypted loop device : to get the porno on the aes drive image .
to make ' aes - drv ' look like a 400 MB file of random bytes .
Every time the lo interface is configured using losetup , according to the above , and the file ' aes - drv ' is mounted , as above , the porno stash will be accessible in / aes / porno .
You do n't need to repeat the dd command , OR , the format with reiserfs , OR , the mv command .
You only do those steps once .
If you forget the password , there is no way to recover it besides guessing .
Once the password is set , it can't be changed .
To change the password , make a new file with the desired password , and move everything from the old file to the new file .
Acl is a good mount option , because it allows use of acls .
Otherwise your stuck with u , g , o and rwx .
If you are curious about what might be on you disk drive , or what an MBR looks like , or maybe what is at the very end of your disk :
Will show you sector 1 , or the MBR .
The bootstrap code and partition table are in the MBR .
To see the end of the disk you have to know the total number of sectors , and the MAS must be set equal to the MNA .
The helix CD has a utility to set this correctly .
In the dd command , your skip value will be one less than MNA of the disk .
For a 120 GB Seagate SATA drivesSo this reads sector for sector , and writes the last sector to myfile .
Even with LBA addressing , disks still secretly are read in sectors , cylinders , and heads .
There are 63 sectors per track , and 255 heads per cylinder .
There is a total cylinder count .
512_bytes/sector*63_sectors/track*255heads=16065*512bytes/cylinder=8,225,280_bytes/cylinder .
63_sectors/track*255_heads=sectors /cylinder .
With 234441647 total sectors , and 16065 sectors per cylinder , you get some trailing sectors which do not make up an entire cylinder : 14593.317584812_cylinders / drive .
This leaves 5102 sectors which cannot be partitioned , because to be in a partition you have to be a whole cylinder .
It 's like having part of a person .
That does n't really count as a person .
These become surplus sectors after the last partition .
You can't ordinarily read past the last partition .
But dd can .
It 's a good idea to check for anything writing to surplus sectors .
For our Seagate 120 GB drive , 234,441,647_sectors / drive - 5102_surplus_sectors = 234,436,545 partitionable sectors .writes the last 5102 sectors to myfile .
Launch midnight commander ( mc ) to view the file .
If there is something in there , you do not need it for anything .
In this case you would write over it with random characters :
Will overwrite the 5102 surplus sectors on our 120 GB Seagate drive .
Block size :
One cylinder in LBA mode = 255 _heads*63_sectors/track=16065_sectors=16065*512_bytes=8,225,280_bytes .
The b means '* 512 ' .
32130b represents a two cylinder block size .
Cylinder block size always works to cover every sector in a partition , because partitions are made of a whole number of cylinders .
One cylinder is 8,225,280 bytes .
If you want to check out some random area of the disk :
Will give you 8,000 sectors in myfile , after the first 16,000 sectors .
You can open that file with a hex editor , edit some of it , and write the edited part back to disk : Image a partition to another machine :
On source machine :
On target machine : Variations on target machine : makes a compressed image file using bzip2 compression .
makes a compressed image file using gzip compression .
I back up a 100 GB lappy disk on a desktop drive , over a lan connection , and the 100 GB compresses to about 4.0 GB .
Most of the drive is empty , so it 's mostly zeroes .
Repetitive zeroes compress well .
Netcat is a program , available by default , on most linux installations .
It 's a networking swiss army knife .
In the preceding example , netcat and dd are piped to one another .
One of the functions of the linux kernel is to make pipes .
The pipe character looks like two little lines on top of one another , both vertical .
Here is how this command behaves :
This byte size is a cylinder .
equals one cylinder on an LBA drive .
The dd command is piped to netcat , which takes as its arguments the IP address of the target ( like 192.168.0.1 , or any IP address with an open port ) and what port you want to use ( 1234 ) .
You can also use ssh .
Dd is like Symantec Norton Ghost , Acronis True Image , Symantec Drive Image .
You can perform disk drive backup , restore , imaging , disk image , cloning , clone , drive cloning , transfer image , transfer data , clone to another drive or clone to another machine , move Windows XP to a new hard drive , clone Windows XP , clone Windows , transfer Windows , hard drive upgrade , duplicate a boot drive , duplicate a bootable drive , upgrade your operating system hard drive , Tired of reinstalling WinXP Windows XP ?

MS Windows Section
Use dd for drive cloning , backup , drive upgrading , and restore tasks .
Boot a Windows XP machine with a Knoppix Linux live CD .
Download Knoppix , burn the iso image file to a CD , boot with it , and clone drives .
Drives are described to the dd command using device files .
Boot into Knoppix , and open a root shell .
It 's in the penguin menu .
( 80 conductor grey ribbon cable ) = / dev/hda for master ; / dev/hdb for slave .
SATA are / dev/sda and / dev/sdb .
The partitions on the first drive :
Code : fdisk - l / dev/hda Code : man fdisk Code : man parted
Many games written for Windows are virtually impossible back - up .
This leaves only the original media .
If it gets damaged , the user SOL .
But there is a way to make back - ups using Linux .
Download Adrienne Knoppix , and choose the option to copy it to a flash drive .
Boot the flash - drive .
If there are two optical drives available , load the CD / DVD source disk in one drive , and the blank disk in the other .
Open a terminal from the menu , and get the root account by typing Code : su Code : ls / dev/hd * Code : ls / dev/sr * Code : wodim dev=/ dev/hdc fs=16 m speed=8 - raw96r driveropts=noburnfree , hidecdr - dummy - overburn - copy / dev/hdc /

How to make a bootable CD from a bootable floppy
Put the floppy in the floppy drive , and do n't mount it , YET !
Code : dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/home/sam/floppy.img
Code : mkdir /mnt/floppy.img mount -o loop / home / sam/ floppy.img /mnt/floppy.img
Code : cd /mnt/floppy.img / rm < files you do n't need > cp /home/sam/bios.bin
Code : df -h Code : cd .. umount / mnt / floppy.img
Code : mkisofs -o /home/sam/floppy.img.iso - b /home/sam/floppy.img /home/sam/floppy.img
Code : wodim dev=/ dev/hdc - sao driveropts =burnfree - dummy /home/sam/floppy.img.iso
You want to find out if your girlfriend is cheating on you , having cyber whoopie , or your a control freak .
Even if the computer is secured with a password , you can boot with the : Knoppix Live CD and search the entire drive partition for text strings : Code : dd if=/dev/sda2 bs =16065 | strings -n 10 -t d | grep - i - B 20 - A 20 ' luv U ' dd command , for the text string specified between the single quotes in the grep command .
Searching an entire disk partition several times can be time consuming .
You might gift her a day at the spa .
Females love that .
That would keep her occupied while you invade her privacy .
I highly recommend googling : " How can I tell if he 's married ? " .
This will produce a list of hits for sites females use to check whether or not their dates are married .
You must click the link , go to the site , get the name of the organization running the site , google " < name of organization > " , until you find the correct mailing address .
Send a letter by certified mail instructing the organization to hereafter refrain from using a certain name for profit , because it does n't belong to them , and they are n't entitled to profit by using it in a query or search result .
State the specific name without a middle initial , and send a copy to any judge , with a cover letter , of course , and the enclosure marked COPY .
This particular command string prints the search results , preceded by the decimal offset of its location on the drive , to the screen .
If the offfset is : 34,409,872 , we want manageable numbers , custom designed for speed and ease of use .
The decimal disk offset is roughly 34 million , so the data we want to view is 34 MB into the partition .
We divide 34,409,872 by some power of 2 .
Experience says 2^13 is about what we want , to get a quotient in the thousands .
34,409,872 /8192=~4200 .
The data we want is 8,192 4,200 byte blocks , OR , 4,200 8,192 byte blocks , into the partition .
We check : 4200*8192=34406400 ; 34,409,872 -34406400=3472 .
This means the following command line will start reading 3,472 bytes before the string location .
Code : dd if=/dev/sda2 bs=4200 skip=8192 count=2 | strings > file.txt
[ color = " red " ]
This next thing does not work anymore , because the Linux kernel wised up a bit .
I 'm working on an alternate method .[ color ]
You can search system memory with this method , by substituting Code : / dev/mem Code : /dev/sda2
Write system memory to a CD .
This is useful for documenting memory contents without contaminating the HDD .
I recommend using a CD - RW so you can practice a little .
This does n't involve dd , but it 's cool .
Code : wodim / dev=/dev/scd0 - raw driveropts =burnfree /dev/mem
Code : wodim -- devices Code : dd if=/ dev/hdd | hexdump - C | less Code : / dev/hdd Code : /dev/sda2
Code : dd if= / dev/hdd | strings -n 6 -t d | grep ' string '
list :
Code : '[ [ : alnum : ] ] ' any alphanumeric characters '[ [ : alpha : ] ] ' any alpha character ' [ [ : digit : ] ] ' any numeric character ' [ [ : blank : ] ] ' tabs and spaces ' [ [ : lower : ] ] ' any lower case alpha characters ' [ [ : upper : ] ] ' any uppercase alpha character ' [ [ : cntrl : ] ] '

' # $ % ' ( ) * + - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ { | } ~ ' [ [ : space : ] ] ' tab , newline , vertical tab , form feed , carriage return , and space ' [ [ : xdigit : ] ] ' any hex digit ranges ( ' [ a - d ] ' = any , or all abcd , ' [ 0 - 9 ] ' = any , or all 0123456789 )
Code : dd if= / dev/sda | hexdump - C | grep '[ : punct : ] ' | less Code : hexdump -C
Back up your MBR :
Code : dd if=/dev/sda of=mbr.bin count=1
Code : dd if=boot.img of=/dev/fd0
Code : dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/home/sam/floppies/backup.bin conv=notrunc
Code : dd if=/home/sam/floppies/backup.bin of=/dev/fd0 conv=notrunc
Code : dd if=/dev/mem bs=1 k skip=768 count=256 2>/ dev/ null | strings -n 8 dd will not duplicate or erase an HPA , OR , host protected area .
Dd will erase a disk completely , but not as well as using the hardware secure erase , security erase unit command
Dd need not be black boxed like other inexpensive forensic software :

How to rescue a CD or DVD , HDD , flash drive or photos : Ifwo n't mount , carve it : Your files will be in directory : Use dd for drive cloning , backup , drive upgrading , and restore tasks .
Boot a Windows XP machine with a Knoppix Linux live CD .
Download Knoppix , burn the iso image file to a CD , boot with it , and clone drives .
Drives are described to the dd command using device files .
Boot into Knoppix , and open a root shell .
It 's in the penguin menu .
( 80 conductor grey ribbon cable ) = / dev/hda for master ; / dev/hdb for slave .
SATA are / dev/sda and / dev/sdb .
The partitions on the first drive :
The manual page for fdisk : Use parted to make partitions :
If one has trouble , leave a reply .
Knoppix is slow , because it runs on a CD drive ( 1/1000 the speed of a HDD ) .
Many games written for Windows are virtually impossible back - up .
This leaves only the original media .
If it gets damaged , the user SOL .
But there is a way to make back - ups using Linux .
Download Adrienne Knoppix , and choose the option to copy it to a flash drive .
Boot the flash - drive .
If there are two optical drives available , load the CD / DVD source disk in one drive , and the blank disk in the other .
Open a terminal from the menu , and get the root account by typingNow typeIf / dev/hdb , / dev/hdc and possibly / dev/ hdd come up , these are your optical drives , unless you have ( 2 ) ide hard drives .
In that instance / dev/hdb would be a hard drive .
If nothing comes up , typeThe possibilities are / dev/sr0 and sr1 .
If nothing comes up , your optical drive are / dev/scd0 and scd1 .
After the disks are loaded , typeIf there are no errors , hit the up arrow , remove ' - dummy ' and run the command .
Feel free to read the entire posts .
Put the floppy in the floppy drive , and do n't mount it , YET !
Mount /home / sam / floppy.img :
Customize the image : or any other files you want on the CD .
But do n't exceed the 1.44 MB size of a floppy .
Check space left in the mounted imageUnmount the floppy imageMake the .iso CD image file : Burn the iso file to a CD : This is a dummy burn , with the drive laser off .
After you check the dummy run for errors , by looking at the program output , hit the up arrow , delete ' - dummy ' , Enter .
If you need a DOS boot floppy image file : [ URL ] http://www.freedos.org/[URL]You want to find out if your girlfriend is cheating on you , having cyber whoopie , or your a control freak .
Even if the computer is secured with a password , you can boot with the : and search the entire drive partition for text strings : will search the drive partition specified in thecommand , for the text string specified between the single quotes in thecommand .
Searching an entire disk partition several times can be time consuming .
You might gift her a day at the spa .
Females love that .
That would keep her occupied while you invade her privacy .
I highly recommend googling : " How can I tell if he 's married ? " .
This will produce a list of hits for sites females use to check whether or not their dates are married .
You must click the link , go to the site , get the name of the organization running the site , google " " , until you find the correct mailing address .
Send a letter by certified mail instructing the organization to hereafter refrain from using a certain name for profit , because it does n't belong to them , and they are n't entitled to profit by using it in a query or search result .
State the specific name without a middle initial , and send a copy to any judge , with a cover letter , of course , and the enclosure marked This particular command string prints the search results , preceded by the decimal offset of its location on the drive , to the screen .
If the offfset is : , we want manageable numbers , custom designed for speed and ease of use .
The decimal disk offset is roughly 34 million , so the data we want to view is 34 MB into the partition .
We divideby some power of 2 .
Experience says 2^13 is about what we want , to get a quotient in the thousands .
/8192=~4200 .
The data we want is 8,192 4,200 byte blocks , OR , 4,200 8,192 byte blocks , into the partition .
We check : 4200*8192=34406400;-34406400=3472 .
This means the following command line will start reading 3,472 bytes before the string location .... and finish reading approximately 4,200 bytes after the string .
This will net you 3.4 k of disk contents before the search string , and 4.2 k after .
That 's a 7.6 k chunk of disk , plenty for what we 're doing .
With this method you search all the deleted files , any chat activity , Internet temporary files , and emails .
It works regardless of what security has been deployed on the machine .
It works with NTFS , ext2 , ext3 , reiserfs , swap , UFS , iso9660 , and FAT partitions .
But , it is illegal to use this method on a computer you are n't authorized to search .
People can be sued , or imprisoned for performing unauthorized searches .[ color = " red " ]
This next thing does not work anymore , because the Linux kernel wised up a bit .
I 'm working on an alternate method .[ color ]

OPERANDS
The following operands are supported : Specifies the input path .
Standard input is the default .
Specifies the output path .
Standard output is the default .
Skip this many blocks in the output file .
Specifies the input block size in n bytes ( default is 512 ) .
Specifies the output block size in n bytes ( default is 512 ) .
If no conversion other thanis specified , each input block is copied to the output as a single block without aggregating short blocks .
Specifies the conversion block size for block and unblock in bytes by n ( default is 0 ) .
Ifis omitted or given a value of 0 , usingproduces unspecified results .
This option is used only if ASCII or EBCDIC conversion is specified .
operands , the input is handled as described for the unblock operand except that characters are converted to ASCII before the trailing SPACE characters are deleted .
operands , the input is handled as described for the block operand except that the characters are converted to EBCDIC or IBM EBCDIC after the trailing SPACE characters are added .
Copies and concatenates n input files before terminating ( makes sense only where input is a magnetic tape or similar device ) .
Skips n input blocks ( using the specified input block size ) before starting to copy .
On seekable files , the implementation reads the blocks or seeks past them .
On non -seekable files , the blocks are read and the data is discarded .
Seeks n blocks from beginning of input file before copying ( appropriate for disk files , where skip can be incredibly slow ) .
Seeks n blocks from beginning of output file before copying .
Skips n blocks ( using the specified output block size ) from beginning of output file before copying .
On non -seekable files , existing blocks are read and space from the current end - of - file to the specified offset , if any , is filled with null bytes .
On seekable files , the implementation seeks to the specified offset or reads the blocks as described for non-seekable files .
Copies only n input blocks . [ , value . . . ]
Where values are comma-separated symbols from the following list :
Do not truncate the output file .
Converts EBCDIC to ASCII .
Converts EBCDIC to ASCII using BSD - compatible character translations .
Converts ASCII to EBCDIC .
If converting fixed - length ASCII records without NEWLINEs , sets up a pipeline withbeforehand .
Converts ASCII to EBCDIC using BSD - compatible character translations .

Slightly different map of ASCII to EBCDIC using BSD - compatible character translations .
If converting fixed - length ASCII records without NEWLINEs , sets up a pipeline withbeforehand .
Thevalues are mutually exclusive .
block
Treats the input as a sequence of NEWLINE - terminated or EOF - terminated variable - length records independent of the input block boundaries .
Each record is converted to a record with a fixed length specified by the conversion block size .
Any NEWLINE character is removed from the input line .
SPACE characters are appended to lines that are shorter than their conversion block size to fill the block .
Lines that are longer than the conversion block size are truncated to the largest number of characters that will fit into that size .
The number of truncated lines is reported .
unblock Converts fixed - length records to variable length .
Reads a number of bytes equal to the conversion block size ( or the number of bytes remaining in the input , if less than the conversion block size ) , delete all trailing SPACE characters , and append a NEWLINE character .
The block and unblock values are mutually exclusive .
Maps upper - case characters specified by the LC_CTYPE keyword tolower to the corresponding lower - case character .
Characters for which no mapping is specified are not modified by this conversion .
Maps lower - case characters specified by the LC_CTYPE keyword toupper to the corresponding upper - case character .
Characters for which no mapping is specified are not modified by this conversion .
Thesymbols are mutually exclusive .
Swaps every pair of input bytes .
If the current input record is an odd number of bytes , the last byte in the input record is ignored .
Does not stop processing on an input error .
When an input error occurs , a diagnostic message is written on standard error , followed by the current input and output block counts in the same format as used at completion .
If theconversion is specified , the missing input is replaced with null bytes and processed normally .
Otherwise , the input block will be omitted from the output .
notrunc
Does not truncate the output file .
Preserves blocks in the output file not explicitly written by this invocation of dd .
( See also the precedingoperand . )
Pads every input block to the size of the ibs= buffer , appending null bytes .
( If either block or unblock is also specified , appends SPACE characters , rather than null bytes .
)
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLESThe following environment variables affect the messages and errors messages of dd : Provide a default value for the internationalisation variables that are unset or null .
Ifis unset or null , the corresponding value from the implementation - dependent default locale will be used .
If any of the internationalisation variables contains an invalid setting , the utility will behave as if none of the variables had been defined .
If set to a non-empty string value , override the values of all the other internationalisation variables .
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters ( for example , single - as opposed to multi - byte characters in arguments and input files ) , the classification of characters as upper - or lower - case , and the mapping of characters from one case to the other .
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error and informative messages written to standard output .
Determine the location of message catalogues for the processing of LC_MESSAGES .

Rep :
dd if=/dev/urandom bs=100 count=1
Is faster than
dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=100
With urandom it is possible to read a byte size of 100 .
With / dev/random you need to do bs =1 .
Urandom does not have this restriction .
conv=notrunc is to prevent the output file from being truncated .
If you just want to write 1024 bytes to the beginning of other_existing__file.
file , but leave the remainder of the file intact , this command will not work :
Code : dd if=/home/sam/existing_file.file bs=1k count=1 of=/home/sam/other_existing_file.file conv=notrunc tells dd to leave the remainder of the file in place .
it is acknowledged by the author that : dd if=/ dev/urandom bs =100 count=1

Best way to learn ....
InEeDhElPlInUx Linux - Newbie 5 10-11-2003 01:02 AM
All times are GMT - 5 .
The time now is 01:25 AM .
Minimalism is all the rage these days as we , as a society , are learning not to hoard materialistic possessions .
This is a great thing that will eventually repay our debt to mother earth .
Consumerism is a thorn in everyone ’s side , whether they know it or do n’t .
To live like a minimalist , you should know what is useful and what is n’t .
It ’s more about cutting out unnecessary things rather than torturing yourself by “ fasting ” .
I ’ll explain the philosophy of minimalism , and give you tips on how to maximize how minimalist you are .
Minimalism is rather simple ; do n’t buy stuff you do n’t need .
Consumerism is the polar opposite of minimalism , and it means you ’ll go to work doing a job that does n’t matter to fill your oversized house with things that do n’t matter .
Like the great book Fight Club said , “ Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes , working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we do n’t need . ”
A poor life for a poor sap that takes out a loan to buy a stupid car that costs half as much the moment it leaves the parking lot .
I ’ve been a minimalist for quite some time .
It ’s hard in the beginning , but it gets easier .
We ’ve been programmed by society to always yearn for more and to always work hard to buy stuff that enslaves us .
Read on and use these tips to simplify and enhance your life .
Extreme Minimalism Tips
1. Frugality , Wear It Out
Stop buying stupid stuff because you ’re bored .
Stop wasting money on new toys before you wear out your old ones .
You do n’t need 40 pairs of pants , t- shirts , socks and all the other stuff .
If your PC , smartphone and laptop still works , it ’s good enough .
Never buy an expensive car you can rent ; you ’ll be happy for a week with a new car , and in a deep financial hole .
Riding a motorcycle is cheaper and gives you a bigger thrill .
Wear the things you have out , wear your car out , and wear your computer out .
Fix and patch up your things and do your own car / bike maintenance .
2. Buy Quality
After you wear something out , buy the higher quality product .
A leather backpack lasts 50 years , and can be repaired over and over , and wool socks are much better than the 50 cent cotton ones that get worn out in a month .
Minimalism means that you buy things that last too , and that you ’re not going through a lot of things .
Future - proof yourself if you can , buy quality hiking gear if you ’re a hiker and a good camera if you ’re a photographer .
There ’s an old saying that $ 50 baseball gloves cost $ 400 in the end ; because the cheap glove falls apart and you have to buy the $ 350 one anyway .
Could ’ve saved you 12.5 % of your money if you were smart .
Do n’t overdo it ; you do n’t really need that fancy leather backpack that costs like 10 good backpacks or a 100 cheapo garbage ones .
Buy mid -high quality items and pay attention not to waste money .
3. Find Alternative Products That Cost Less
We ’ve covered why it ’s important to buy mid-high tier things in life .
And now let ’s focus on branding and overpriced consumables .
You can get generic brand stuff like toilet paper , bottle water , groceries and medicine .
You ’ll save up to % 50 of your monthly grocery bill , and that adds up in the big picture .
Instead of having enough money to buy groceries for 6 months in your stash , you now have a whole year of groceries .
Buy in bulk , use coupons , and always keep an eye out on how you can save money .
You have no idea how all those small purchases nibble at your income , and how much money you ’ll save .
4. Downsize Your Life
Minimalism means knowing what really matters to you and optimizing your life around that .
If you ’re a hiker , sell your book collection , and if you ’re a hunter , sell your fishing gear .
Having multiple hobbies means you have multiple costs in upkeep and gear you ’re going to buy , but there ’s only one of you .
If you ’re someone that ’s into guns , you do n’t need more than 5 quality guns ; leave the collection of rare , expensive firearms to museums and the collection of bad , low - quality guns ( looking at you Taurus and HiPoint ) to newbies and people with very poor impulse control .
Same rules go for any other hobby ; you do n’t need to have 3 cars or 7 motorbikes unless you ’re a Saudi prince .
Sell off your stuff that you no longer use , sell your clothes that you no longer use ( or donate them ) , and declutter your life .
It ’s okay to drop a hobby or two and focus on what ’s really important to you and optimize your life and your time around that one hobby .
5. Borrow or Rent Toys
A life lived without any luxury is frankly , a miserable one , no matter how much you want to save money .
We ’re human , and we ’re dazzled by novelty .
The siren ’s call of new toys is very strong , and you ’ve probably ran out and bought them in the past .
If you wanna save and hoard money , this is obviously a bad choice .
There ’s an in - between solution that should keep you in the game , and that ’s being social in your hobby groups , and renting the new toys .
Driving your dream car feels amazing , but having to pay the repair bill for your dream car can really set your finances back .
The same deal goes with anything like guns , laptops , new boots , new power - tools , new motorbikes or electric skateboards , etc .
Be prepared to buy something and return it to the store if you did n’t like it ; always be prepared to do this even if you think it ’s awkward .
You ’re saving money in the long run , and buying toys can seriously put your retirement in question .
A $ 1000 today could be worth $ 40,000 in the future , but you went and spent it on restaurants , expensive food and toys .
6. Cost -Benefit Analysis
The Cost - Benefit Analysis is your most powerful tool .
Always be analyzing and checking if something is worth it , and note when you buy things that are n’t worth it .
When you ’re young and you do n’t have much money , saving seems like a stupid choice when you can finally buy all the toys your parents did n’t let you have .
We ’ve all been there and made stupid choices ( hopefully small choices like getting the new Xbox ) .
Do n’t go all in when you ’re trying a new hobby out ; there are so many airsoft players that show up in $ 2000 worth of gear , play two games , and quit the hobby entirely .
Do n’t be that guy .
7. Improve Your Income
Always strive to improve your income as much as you can , as long as you do n’t catch any golden handcuffs along the way .
Get a better job , work on your education and certifications , start side hustles .
The more money you make , the easier it is to be frugal .
Yeah , I know it ’s paradoxical , but if you have the money you can buy in bulk and save a lot of money on stuff .
If you get overdraft fees on your credit card or a ticket , you can pay them off immediately and not get stuck down the endless hole of debt .
8 . Move to a low - cost area
If you can , move to a lower cost area .
A lower - cost area could get you less bills and more bang for your buck .
Move to a state that does n’t have an income tax , like Texas or Wyoming .
Texas and Wyoming are a lot cheaper than most other states in the USA .
When your base expenses like rent and groceries get lower , you can save a lot of money , and you can start working on the best goal you can get in your life .
9. Retire Early
FIRE ( Financial Independence , Retire Early ) should be your goal in life .
The more money you have stashed away in banks , bonds , investments and other resources like ammo , silver , gold and cryptocurrencies , the less you have to work .
The lower your expenses are , the longer you can live on your wealth alone .
Once your wealth starts to make you more wealthy , you can coast until you grow old and die .
That ’s retiring early .
FIRE is not for everyone ; even if you ’re “ retired ” , you ’re still young and can pursue other goals and side hustles that can make you even more wealthy .
You can travel the world with a backpack and a laptop , visit all your friends whenever you want and relax whenever you want .
It ’s a great goal that more and more people can reach these days because the Internet opened up an entire global market to everyone .
Schoolboys punished with detention for refusing to kneel in class and pray to Allah
Two schoolboys were given detention after refusing to kneel down and ' pray to Allah ' during a religious education lesson .
Parents were outraged that the two boys from year seven ( 11 to 12 - year - olds ) were punished for not wanting to take part in the practical demonstration of how Allah is worshipped .
They said forcing their children to take part in the exercise at Alsager High School , near Stoke - on - Trent - which included wearing Muslim headgear - was a breach of their human rights .
Alsager School , near Stoke , has received furious complaints from parents after two Year 7 boys were punished for refusing to kneel to Allah during a religious studies class
One parent , Sharon Luinen , said : " This is n't right , it 's taking things too far .
" I understand that they have to learn about other religions .
I can live with that but it is taking it a step too far to be punished because they would n't join in Muslim prayer .
" Making them pray to Allah , who is n't who they worship , is wrong and what got me is that they were told they were being disrespectful .
" I do n't want this to look as if I have a problem with the school because I am generally very happy with it . "
Another parent Karen Williams said : " I am absolutely furious my daughter was made to take part in it and I do n't find it acceptable .
" I have n't got a problem with them teaching my child other religions and a small amount of information does n't do any harm .
" But not only did they have to pray , the teacher had gone into the class and made them watch a short film and then said ' we are now going out to pray to Allah ' .
" Then two boys got detention and all the other children missed their refreshment break because of the teacher .
" Not only was it forced upon them , my daughter was told off for not doing it right .
" They 'd never done it before and they were supposed to do it in another language . "
" My child has been forced to pray to Allah in a school lesson . "
The grandfather of one of the pupils in the class said : " It 's absolutely disgusting , there 's no other way of putting it .
" My daughter and a lot of other mothers are furious about their children being made to kneel on the floor and pray to Islam .
If they did n't do it they were given detention .
" I am not racist , I 've been friendly with an Indian for 30 years .
I 've also been to a Muslim wedding where it was explained to me that alcohol would not be served and I respected that .
" But if Muslims were asked to go to church on Sunday and take Holy Communion there would be war . "
Parents said that their children were made to bend down on their knees on prayer mats which the RE teacher had got out of her cupboard and they were also told to wear Islamic headgear during the lesson on Tuesday afternoon .
Deputy headmaster Keith Plant said : " It 's difficult to know at the moment whether this was part of the curriculum or not .
I am not an RE teacher , I am an English teacher .
" At the moment it is our enterprise week and many of our members of staff are away .
" The particular member of staff you need to speak to is n't around .
I think that it is a shame that so many parents have got in touch with the Press before coming to me .
" I have spoken to the teacher and she has articulately given me her version of events , but that is all I can give you at the moment . "
A statement from Cheshire County Council on behalf of the school read : " The headteacher David Black contacted this authority immediately complaints were received .
" Enquiries are being made into the circumstances as a matter of urgency and all parents will be informed accordingly .
" Educating children in the beliefs of different faith is part of the diversity curriculum on the basis that knowledge is essential to understanding .
" We accept that such teaching is to be conducted with some sense of sensitivity . "

Update
The bug described in this post was fixed in the iPhone 2.1 software update .
In an earlier post I said that I did n’t like the way the iPhone scientific calculator handles the scientific notation ( EE ) key .
That bug seemed to be mainly a stylistic matter — the calculator display treats the mantissa and the exponent as separate numbers rather than as two parts of the same number .
Yesterday I found a more serious bug in the way the π ( pi ) key is handled .
Turn your calculator sideways to put it in scientific mode and tap this out :
π × 2 + 5 =
You ’ll get the correct answer of 11.283 …
Now try the same thing , but with the 2 and π reversed :
2 × π + 5 =
You ’ll get 7 !
The π gets lost when you push the + key .
If you do
2 × π = + 5 =
you ’ll get the right answer , but there ’s no reason you should have to hit the = key in mid-equation .
Watching the display as I step through the equation that gives the wrong answer , I see that after touching the × button , it is outlined in white , indicating that the calculator is waiting for the second argument .
The white outline remains after touching the π button , which I think means that the calculator does n’t believe that the second argument has been entered .
If I do
2 × 5
the white outline disappears from the × button after I touch the 5 , which is the correct behavior .
I ’m shooting off a bug report to Apple in hopes that they fix this soon .
In the meantime , if you use the iPhone ’s scientific calculator , beware of this bug in formulas that use π.
I ’m not sure of a foolproof way of avoiding it .
I ’ve tried putting the π first in all terms that have it , but
5 + π x 2 =
gives an answer of 10 .
I ’ve tried parenthesizing the π terms , but
5 + ( π × 2 ) =
also gives 101 .
It ’s stunning that
Apple could n’t get a simple calculator program to work right , and No one in QA found this bug before it shipped .

Science has a very important paper in the current issue about the evolution of a gene enhancer in hominids , expressed in forelimb development and concentrated toward the first digit .
The enhancer is a conserved sequence named HACNS1 , it exhibits a stronger signature of recurrent selection on the human lineage than any other conserved enhancer sequence .
In transgenic mice , the human version of this enhancer triggers gene expression in the forelimb , concentrated toward the thumb side , and some other parts of the body , notably the pharyngeal arches ( which give rise to elements of mouth , throat and larynx ) , eye and ear .
The research is by Shyam Prabhakar and others at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab , and involves Edward Rubin and James Noonan , otherwise prominent in the Neandertal genome sequencing .
I think this is an extraordinarily important result .
You do n’t see me write those words very often .
This is a paper that every biological anthropologist should read .
It gives an extremely good example of the importance of developmental regulation to human evolution .
We will see many more papers like this one in the coming years .
This is one of the genes that makes us human .
Ed Yong of Not Exactly Rocket Science has written a nice online review of the research , and Science has accompanied it with a perspective piece by Gregory Wray and Courtney Babbitt .
Here ’s a quote from that article :
To test the function of this region , they genetically engineered mouse embryos to express a construct composed of human HACNS1 , the promoter element of a heat shock gene , and a reporter gene .
Their results show that human HACNS1 drives expression in the mesenchyme of the early developing forelimb , and later developing hindlimb , in these mouse embryos .
A comparison of expression patterns driven by macaque , chimpanzee , and human orthologs of HACNS1 revealed that consistently strong forelimb expression is a unique property of the human version .
By testing various combinations of human and chimpanzee HACNS1 sequences , the authors narrowed down the relevant functional mutations to an 81 - base pair region containing 13 substitutions that arose during human evolution .
This concentration of substitutions is highly unusual relative to the genome as a whole , implying positive selection on this region during human origins .
The press are going with the story that the evolution of this gene may underlie the unique evolution of human manual dexterity .
It ’s a good hypothesis , but I think there is a more accurate way of putting the situation .
We see that the enhancer has effects in different areas of the developing embryo .
Its action is therefore pleiotropic : changing its function in one area might well screw up its action somewhere else .
So at the very least , this is an enhancer that must satisfy multiple constraints .
Strong evolutionary change in its sequence may reflect changes in one of those functions , or more than one .
But at the very least , it implies that the hominid developmental program not only satisfies different fitness constraints than in the human - chimpanzee common ancestor , but that these changes required repeated changes .
We do n’t know how long it would have taken all these nucleotide substitutions to happen .
But we might find signs in the fossil record of such a sequence of events , if we had enough bones , and if we had more information about the effects of different forms of the gene on the adult phenotype .
For example , the relatively long thumbs of the Hadar hominids ( compared to chimpanzees and gorillas ) suggest that the sequence of changes started early in hominid evolution .
There ’s a hypothesis .
But like I said , I would n’t rule out other possible functions of the enhancer as targets for selection .
It is plausible ( as a hypothesis ) that the enhancer with the most selected substitutions on the human lineage might be more likely than others to have been selected for multiple functions .
And we have plenty of reasons to suspect selection on its other targets , particularly the developing mouth , throat and ear .
It may even be that the evolution of human thumbs was a side effect of evolution in the throat , or vice versa .
That ’s the kind of weird world evo-devo makes for us !

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Major U.S. stock indexes dropped the most in two decades on Monday after U.S. lawmakers rejected a $ 700 billion bailout plan and major U.S. and European banks made emergency deals to survive , making investors flee to gold , government debt and the low - risk yen .
The Dow fell more than 770 points , its biggest single - day decline on record .
Spot gold prices jumped more than 4 percent and crude oil prices fell almost 10 percent after the U.S. House of Representatives voted down the bailout bill .
The broad Standard & Poor 's 500 Index .SPX fell 8.77 percent , its biggest one - day decline in percentage terms since Black Monday in October 1987 when it plummeted 22 percent .
World stocks , as measured by MSCI ’s all country world index , lost about $ 1.7 trillion for the day .
The failed proposal would have authorized the U.S. Treasury to spend up to $ 700 billion to buy illiquid assets from banks .
The bill was defeated by skeptics from both parties who questioned the need for it and whether it would work to jump - start stalled capital markets around the world .
“ What should have been a day of hope turned into a day of desperation , ” said Marco Annunziato , chief economist at UniCredit in London .
“ We are facing a systemic crisis of confidence in the global financial system that is pushing us increasingly close to a complete meltdown . ”
President George W. Bush and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the administration would work to develop a strategy to rescue the financial system .
The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed down 777.68 points , or 6.98 percent , at 10,365.45 .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 Index .SPX shed 106.59 points , or 8.79 percent , to 1,106.42 .

The congressional vote , designed to stabilize skittish financial markets around the world , stunned investors who wondered what would come next .
“ We are in a situation where the market is looking around and saying what else can the government throw at us , and it is not much else right now , ” said Rudy Narvas , senior analyst at 4cast Ltd in New York .
Before the vote , the euro and British pound tumbled against the dollar and crude oil prices dropped nearly 8 percent to below $ 99 a barrel on signs the crisis was spreading beyond the United States to Europe and cut energy demand worldwide .
U.S. and euro - zone government debt soared in one of the biggest rallies for fixed - income securities this year as fears of spreading bank failures overshadowed moves by central banks to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into frozen markets .
Aversion to risk boosted the low - yielding Japanese yen as investors flocked to safe - havens .
In Europe , the leading index of European shares fell more than 5 percent to a three - and - a - half year closing low , while many indexes elsewhere , especially in emerging markets , tumbled harder .
“ Investors are fearful , frenetic , especially when it comes to banking shares .
They want to get out now and see the after - effects from afar , ” said Frank Geilfuss , head analyst at Bankhaus Loebbecke .
European authorities were forced over the weekend to rescue a slew of European banks , while U.S. regional bank Wachovia Corp WB.N sold most of its assets to Citigroup C.N in a deal brokered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
Global money markets remained frozen even as central banks , including the Federal Reserve , continued to pump liquidity into world markets .
Major central banks also announced a $ 330 billion increase in an arrangement among themselves to make more dollars available to the markets .
“ We started Monday with more fear than when we left on Friday , ” said Eric Kuby , chief investment officer of North Star Investment Management Corp in Chicago .
Signs of the potential impact of the financial crisis could be seen in the stock of Apple Inc AAPL.O , whose shares closed down almost 18 percent on concerns the maker of the iPod and iPhone will suffer as economic growth slows .

Piracy is a new type of business model , says journalist and best - selling author Matt Mason .
An expert in cheating the system , Mason advocates piracy as a way to force old laws to catch up with the new ways information is being used .
Mason was a former pirate radio DJ and founding editor of the British counter - culture magazine site RWD , which was launched to bridge the gap between music pirates and the mainstream market .
He admits to downloading all sorts of pirated material and describes BitTorrent as one of the easiest ways to get music .
But his biggest critics are n’t the music industry or Hollywood .
“ I ’m seen by some people in the downloading community as the bad guy , ” he said , adding that he ’s different from those who think of piracy as a “ smash - the - system , anarchic movement ” where everything is free .
Mason will be presenting his ideas this week in Camden , Maine , at the annual PopTech conference that explores the impact of technology on people .
In his book released last year , The Pirate 's Dilemma : How Youth
Culture Is Reinventing Capitalism , Mason discusses ways in which businesses can actually learn from pirates ' ways .
“ The whole point of the book is that piracy is often highlighting some kind of market failure .
When the market ’s not doing something that most people want to see happening , that ’s when you see piracy on a massive scale , ” he said .
For example , he thinks record labels need to work on a free market , collective license solution , and that e-books will soon pose a similar threat to the publishing world .
“ I ’m convinced that Steve Jobs is currently working on a double - sided touchscreen laptop , which has a great screen density so you can hold it on its side and you can touch it and turn pages .
When something like that comes along , then the e-book ’s going to be a real threat .
And I think the publishing industry is going to collectively crap its pants . ”
His ideas are also seeping into Hollywood .
He says he is currently working with Heroes executive producer Jesse Alexander on a TV version of the book called Pirate TV .
Each episode of the show will focus on piracy in various industries around the world , many of which are not often associated with the term
— like fashion , nuclear technology and automobile parts .
“ It ’s going to be two parts Anthony Bourdain , one part Mythbusters , ” he says .
He ’s already planned out one season , but says there are enough different cases to fill five or six .
And Mason is n’t hypocritical by any means , as his own book is also up for grabs on his website , following the Radiohead , tip - jar business model of pay what you want .
But he says around 15 percent of people actually pay for it , and that downloads not only do n’t cannibalize print sales , they have opened up the door to speaking events all over the world where it is n’t being sold and people are reading it online .
At PopTech , he ’ll be reinforcing his message of if you ca n’t beat ‘ em , join ‘em .
“ A lot of the time it ’s because the pirates are actually doing something better , and that does n’t mean it ’s always right or its morally good in any way at all , ” he says .
Bowing to pressure from privacy watchdogs and regulators , Google said late tonight that it would shorten how long it retains consumer data , making those records anonymous after nine months rather than 18 .
Google used to keep logs of all search queries connected to individual IP ( Internet protocol ) addresses indefinitely .
In March 2007 , the company began making those queries anonymous after 18 months .
But the move was n't aggressive enough to appease privacy groups or European regulators increasingly nervous about Google 's growing dominance on the Internet .
In a post on its official blog , Google said it has tried to strike the right balance between improving its search engine and shielding consumers ' privacy .
Collecting that information helps
Google fight fraud and reduce spam , the company said .
Most important , " the routine server log data we collect has always been a critical ingredient of innovation , " Google said .
Restricting how long it keeps consumer data " meant sacrifices in future innovations in all of those areas . "
Google says it has had " literally hundreds of discussions with data protection officials , government leaders and privacy advocates around the world " to explain Google 's privacy practices and to improve privacy .
Its engineers also spent months developing methods to find ways to make consumer information anonymous faster , the company said .

Moral And Practical Depravity of “ Conservative ” Political Philosophy September 19 , 2008
What ’s very , very , very important is for everyone to be extremely clear that this financial clusterfuck is a direct consequence of the complete utter moral and pragmatic depravity of so - called “ conservative ” political philosophy as implemented by the deranged sick - fuck Republican Party .
Every decent citizen of the United States needs to know in no uncertain terms that the Republican Party caused this to happen through their intentional policy of privatizing gains by their greedfuck cronies while socializing their losses , and that a vote for McCain - Palin is a vote to continue destroying everything that normal decent people hold dear .
A garden hose , a tin can , duct tape , metal piping , kitchencleaner , and gasoline :
That is all television icon MacGyver needed to make aflame - thrower to ward off a swarm of killer ants .
In the real world , technologies that are affordable and practical are not so simple to create , butthey can make a huge impact on people 's lives .
Instead of calling on complex solutions ( reliant on engines andimported resources ) for low - tech problems ( such ascooking and lighting ) , some researchers are now developing what they call " confluent " technologies — ones that are effective , affordable , and sustainable for use inthe developing world .
Here 's a look at the latest breakthroughs :
1 Energy in a Bucket of DirtWho needs nickel cadmium batteries or coal plantsfor electricity when you have soil ?
A Harvard team of faculty and Africanstudents have tapped into soil - dwelling microbes in order to provideelectricity for families in Tanzania .
When the microbes found in the soildigest organic materials , they naturally produce a small current , which can beharnessed with a simple device consisting of two electrodes and a small circuitboard .
One trash - barrel - sized unit filled with soil can produce enoughelectricity to light two bedrooms for a decade or more , says Harvard biologyprofessor Peter Girguis .
While each unit currently costs about $ 50 , the team is testing new materialsthat would drive the price down to $ 7 .

2 Micro-Hydroelectric Power Hilly land streaked with small streams makes anideal spot for micro- hydroelectric power generators , each of which requires a meager water flow of just three gallons per second to turn .
( To put this in perspective , the Mississippi 's average flow at New Orleans is about 4.4 million gallons per second . )
The Appropriate Infrastructure Development Group ( AIDG ) has helped to build three systems in Guatemala , and more communities are now saving up money for local installations .
3 Biodigesters
At the end of Back to the Future , a little bit of garbage is all Doc Brown needs to fuel his DeLorean time machine .
Biodigesters wo n’t quite generate " 1.21 jigawatts " of power ( as Doc 's Mr. Fusion device seemed to ) , but they can create fuel for heating , cooking , and electricity while reducing waste and water contamination .
In the salchicha - type biodigester ( salchicha means " sausage " in Spanish ) , bacteria break down waste in a 15 - to - 30 - foot - long polyethylene tube and release methane , which is captured and piped to a stove .
The digested waste can then be used as a fertilizer .
Biodigesters have been around since the 1870s , but current efforts focus on producing them on a larger scale .
An award - winning system installed in Rwandan prisons reduced the need for firewood by half .
4 WindPower on $ 2 a Day Who said wind turbines have to spin ?
Shawn Frayne , founder of Humdinger Wind Energy , developed a turbine - less generator that harnesses energy from the rapid wind - induced vibration ( 50 cycles per second ) of a seven - to - ten - foot flap of taffeta fabric .
This is the same phenomenon — aeroelastic flutter — that civil engineers try to eliminate so bridges do n’t sway in the wind , and on a small scale , it greatly increases the efficiency of capturing power from wind for a very small cost , says Frayne .
" For people making a dollar or two a day , it could be in the realm of possibility to have electricity , " says Peter Haas of AIDG , who is helping Frayne test the generators in Guatemala .
Depending on wind conditions , the generators can be positioned to power efficient lights in a few rooms on small electrical grids .
Frayne hopes to make the product available within a few years .
5 Sunlight Stored in LEDs
In rural Indian homes , kerosene lamps are ubiquitous , posing health concerns from fumes as well as a fire risk .
Solar - charged lights designed by Patrick Walsh , founder of Greenlight Planet , are one solution to this problem .
The lights run for four hours on their brightest setting after charging in the sun all day .
The lights also reduce fuel costs for families and pay for themselves in just one year .
After testing the market with 20 lamps , Walsh is now scaling up production .
6 Solar Water Heater Solar water heaters are generally expensive ( they can cost $ 400 – $ 1,000 ) , barring easy access to hot water for many who are far from an electric grid .
But engineer Ashok Gadgil at the University of California , Berkeley , working with AIDG , cut back on materials and came up with a solar heater that costs $ 100 .
It can produce 26 gallons of water warmed to 104 degrees Fahrenheit by 4 p.m. each day — enough for four showers .
Tests are ongoing in Guatemala , after which the team plans to fine - tune the design and begin distribution .
7 Pedal - Powered Grid People who live off the grid in rural corners of the world may soon have a new source of energy : 12 - volt batteries charged by pedaling .
Using a simple alternator , six hours of pedaling can create and store enough electrical energy in batteries to light about six homes for 30 days ( in areas where people use less electricity than in the U.S. ) .
Dissigno , the San Francisco–based company that distributes the devices , has one prototype up and running in Haiti and next hopes to install a " grid " in Tanzania connected by a network of pedalers instead of power lines .

8 Sugarcane Charcoal
In Haiti , most people cook using charcoal made from wood , but the country is now 98 percent deforested due largely to mismanagement of resources .
MIT students and lecturer Amy Smith turned to widely available bagasse , the stalks of sugarcane plants left after squeezing the sugar out , and created a charcoal replacement by burning , compressing , and mixing the material with a binding agent .
The team is currently looking to train prospective entrepreneurs interested in producing and distributing the product .
9 Irrigation by Foot Most African farmers rely on seasonal rainfall , having no other means of irrigation for crops .
So Martin Fisher , the CEO of KickStart International , came up with a device you can pump with your feet that pulls water from 30 feet underground with enough pressure to irrigate up to two acres of land .
This enables more frequent harvests of high - value crops like vegetables rather than grains .
In Africa , more than 65,000 such pumps are currently in use .
Fisher won the 2008 Lemelson - MITAward for Sustainability for the invention .
10 Chlorine from Salt
For the roughly 1.2 billion people lacking clean water , a bit of chlorine could go along way toward providing it .
Using two ounces of salt water and some muscle , University of Iowa engineering professor Craig Just can make enough bleach to kill the disease - causing microorganisms in five gallons of water .
His trick : a hand - cranked device that generates electricity to zap water molecules , splitting them and joining them with chlorine atoms from salt .
Just and his students plan to test a prototype in Ghana and Honduras next year .
Supporting what many of us who are not musically talented have often felt , new research reveals that trained musicians really do think differently than the rest of us .
Vanderbilt University psychologists have found that professionally trained musicians more effectively use a creative technique called divergent thinking , and also use both the left and the right sides of their frontal cortex more heavily than the average person .
The research by Crystal Gibson , Bradley Folley and Sohee Park is currently in press at the journal Brain and Cognition .
" We were interested in how individuals who are naturally creative look at problems that are best solved by thinking ' out of the box ' , " Folley said .
" We studied musicians because creative thinking is part of their daily experience , and we found that there were qualitative differences in the types of answers they gave to problems and in their associated brain activity . "
One possible explanation the researchers offer for the musicians ' elevated use of both brain hemispheres is that many musicians must be able to use both hands independently to play their instruments .
" Musicians may be particularly good at efficiently accessing and integrating competing information from both hemispheres , " Folley said .
" Instrumental musicians often integrate different melodic lines with both hands into a single musical piece , and they have to be very good at simultaneously reading the musical symbols , which are like left - hemisphere - based language , and integrating the written music with their own interpretation , which has been linked to the right hemisphere . "
Previous studies of creativity have focused on divergent thinking , which is the ability to come up with new solutions to open - ended , multifaceted problems .
Highly creative individuals often display more divergent thinking than their less creative counterparts .

To conduct the study , the researchers recruited 20 classical music students from the Vanderbilt Blair School of Music and 20 non-musicians from a Vanderbilt introductory psychology course .
The musicians each had at least eight years of training .
The instruments they played included the piano , woodwind , string and percussion instruments .
The groups were matched based on age , gender , education , sex , high school grades and SAT scores .
The researchers conducted two experiments to compare the creative thinking processes of the musicians and the control subjects .
In the first experiment , the researchers showed the research subjects a variety of household objects and asked them to make up new functions for them , and also gave them a written word association test .
The musicians gave more correct responses than non-musicians on the word association test , which the researchers believe may be attributed to enhanced verbal ability among musicians .
The musicians also suggested more novel uses for the household objects than their non-musical counterparts .
In the second experiment , the two groups again were asked to identify new uses for everyday objects as well as to perform a basic control task while the activity in their prefrontal lobes was monitored using a brain scanning technique called near - infrared spectroscopy , or NIRS .
NIRS measures changes in blood oxygenation in the cortex while an individual is performing a cognitive task .
" When we measured subjects ' prefrontal cortical activity while completing the alternate uses task , we found that trained musicians had greater activity in both sides of their frontal lobes .
Because we equated musicians and non-musicians in terms of their performance , this finding was not simply due to the musicians inventing more uses ; there seems to be a qualitative difference in how they think about this information , " Folley said .
The researchers also found that , overall , the musicians had higher IQ scores than the non-musicians , supporting recent studies that intensive musical training is associated with an elevated IQ score .
The research was partially supported by a Vanderbilt University Discovery Grant .
Folley is a postdoctoral fellow .
Park is a professor of psychology and psychiatry and a member of the Center for Integrative and Cognitive Neuroscience .
Gibson was an undergraduate student and research assistant in the psychology department at Vanderbilt when this work was conducted and is now a Peace Corps volunteer based in Namibia .
Park and Folley are Vanderbilt Kennedy Center for Research on Human Development investigators .

Ever since Barack Obama beat her to become the Democratic nominee , Clinton said she will do what it takes to help him win in November .
I do n’t think for a second Hillary is going to allow Sarah Palin to become the first female Vice - President .
Vanquished primary candidates usually go home to rest and ponder the high points and lows of their failed effort .
Clinton , in contrast , raised more than $ 4 million for the Obama campaign and repeatedly urged her supporters to campaign for Obama and contribute to his cause .
She hosted a reception in Denver for 250 of her donors and is scheduled to be in Chicago tonight for another fund - raising event .
She has another fund - raising event scheduled for Sept. 22 in New York City , with the goal of raising $ 500,000 .
In fact , Hillary ’s advisors told the New York Times she would do everything she can to contribute .
Mrs. Clinton ’s friends said she was galled that Ms. Palin might try to capitalize on a movement that Mrs. Clinton built among women in the primaries .
Guy Cecil , the former political director of Mrs. Clinton ’s campaign , said it was “ insulting ” for Republicans to compare Ms. Palin to Mrs. Clinton .
He was very outspoken about Sarah Palin ’s inexperience for Vice - President .
Mr. Cecil said he believed that the McCain - Palin ticket might initially intrigue some Clinton supporters , but that they would ultimately choose Mr. Obama .
“ It is insulting to compare Hillary ’s lifetime of service and her commitment to progressive causes with that of a novice , right - wing governor , ” Mr. Cecil said .
Hillary Clinton is going to fulfill her role , by holding rallies in the major battleground states of Ohio , Florida and New Hampshire .
She is going to let her supporters know in her “ unique personal way ” that the McCain - Palin ticket is wrong for them .
As she said in Denver , “ I have n’t spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children , campaigning for universal healthcare , helping parents balance work and family and fighting for women ’s rights at home and around the world , to see another Republican in the White House squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people . ”
This presidential campaign is n’t about the “ Mommy Wars . ”
It ’s about preemptive war .
If Palin needs a refresher course on the “ Bush Doctrine ” and its consequences in Iraq and elsewhere around the world , Clinton has the benefit of hindsight to make it , woman - to - woman .
They need Hillary to point out that Palin is the wrong woman with the wrong agenda .
She will not further the cause on the issues that the Hillary supporters want ; Palin will undo all the progress we have made on social issues in this country .
I ’m really proud of Hillary going out there and letting them know that Obama ’s policies are the change this country needs to move forward .
Obama also needs her to repeat often what she said to her supporters in Denver : “ I want you to ask yourselves :
Were you in this campaign just for me ? ”
Defence chiefs and ministers face fresh pressure over the treatment of civilians at the hands of British forces in Iraq today , as a new report revives fears that " torture " techniques have been used 30 years after they were banned .
A scathing report from the Joint Human Rights Committee ( JHRC ) warns that the use of " coercive interrogation techniques " may have been officially sanctioned , despite assurances that troops knew they were outlawed .
The former armed forces minister Adam Ingram and Lieutenant - General Robin Brims , former Commander Field Army , told an earlier committee inquiry that British forces knew they could not use five " conditioning " techniques – wall standing , hooding , subjection to noise , and deprivation of sleep , food and drink – during interrogation .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But the committee has now ruled that their evidence conflicts with the findings of a subsequent court - martial hearing , and an internal Ministry of Defence review into the death of an Iraqi hotel worker , Baha Mousa , at the hands of British soldiers in September 2003 .
The JHRC report also found that the use of hooding and stress positioning by 1 Queen 's Lancashire Regiment in 2003 was based on legal advice received from brigade headquarters .
It claims that , at least until the Baha Mousa case came to light , the prohibition on the use of conditioning techniques " was not as clearly articulated to troops in Iraq as it might , and indeed should , have been " .
The committee 's chairman , Andrew Dismore , said : " We have yet to receive an explanation from the Ministry of Defence for the discrepancies in evidence given ... by Mr Ingram in 2004 and Lieutenant - General Brims in 2006 on the use of these illegal ... techniques . "
Phil Shiner of Public Interest Lawyers , who has represented Iraqis who claim abuse at the hands of British troops , said : " We are meant to believe that it is just ... a few bad apples , but the evidence from courts martial and other cases shows that nothing could be further from the truth .
These methods are about breaking people down .
They were meant to have been banned , but somehow they came back and they became written and verbal policy . "
Robert Higgs helps us all understand in this great interview by Scott Horton at Antiwar Radio .
They discuss
the relationship between the inflation of World War One , the roaring ‘ 20 ’s and the Great Depression , Fed chief Ben Strong ’s deal with the Bank of England ’s Montague Norman to inflate in the 1920s in order to help England and how this created the stock market bubble ( and others ) in the 20s , some of the ways that the near - totalitarian New Deal interventions of Wilsonian Republican Herbert Hoover and Wilsonian Democrat Franklin Roosevelt compounded and prolonged the depression , the myth that World War II ended the Great Depression , the Korean War and switch from World War to Cold War , the state ’s scare tactics to strong - arm government growth , chaotic interventionism in the market and the status of the dollar as the world ’s reserve currency .
This is incredibly timely , as every interventionist pundit today compares our situation to the Depression , while drawing the precisely wrong lessons .
As Higgs points out , “ virtually everything that was done ” by Hoover and then FDR only prolonged and deepened the Depression .
Sarah Palin has absolutely no national security experience , and in an interview with ABC ’s Charles Gibson , she pretty much did everything she could to tiptoe around that fact .
GIBSON : But this is not just reforming a government .
This is also running a government on the huge international stage in a very dangerous world .
When I asked John McCain about your national security credentials , he cited the fact that you have commanded the Alaskan National Guard and that Alaska is close to Russia .
Are those sufficient credentials ?
PALIN : But it is about reform of government and it ’s about putting government back on the side of the people , and that has much to do with foreign policy and national security issues
Let me speak specifically about a credential that I do bring to this table , Charlie , and that ’s with the energy independence that I ’ve been working on for these years as the governor of this state that produces nearly 20 percent of the U.S. domestic supply of energy , that I worked on as chairman of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission , overseeing the oil and gas development in our state to produce more for the United States .
GIBSON : I know .
I ’m just saying that national security is a whole lot more than energy .
I do n’t know what is stranger about this transcript : the fact that Charles Gibson asked a hard - hitting question , or the fact that Sarah Palin thinks energy experience is the same thing as national security experience .
It seems more likely that she was just trying to steer away from the issue of national security , because she recognizes that she knows nothing about it .
The fact is , energy experience is perhaps the only credential that Palin brings to the ticket that John McCain could not already claim for himself .
While Barack Obama added experience and a strong presense to his ticket by picking Joe Biden , John McCain opted to just pick a pretty face with little political experience to speak of .
Mad Money host and giant red cranium owner Jim Cramer announced today that he will be selling off what ’s left of his reputation and dignity at an open auction at “ Bubba ’s Repo- Auction house ” in Sprott Alabama .
“ Makes perfect sense to me !
Bubba ’s has a fine reputation as one of the premiere auction houses in Sprott ! ” screamed Cramer to no one in particular from a small dark closet at CNBC headquarters adding , “ Buy Bear Sterns ! ” before smashing a red button with his forehead , putting on boxing gloves for no reason and passing out from oxygen depravation .
The auction has generated quite a bit of buzz in the financial world drawing potential buyers from as far away as Wetumpka .
“ I was headed over to Sprott to look for some parts for my 1977 Pinto and the wife asked if I could put a few dollars aside for the Cramer guy ’s crap .
She said she figured she could use it get a show on Fox business since no one watches it anyway ” says local farmer and entrepreneur Armstead “ Tater ” Arnold .
Mr. Bubba Brannon of Bubba ’s auction house echoed the excitement generated by the announcement “ Yeah , I never heard of this dick , but I figured that I ’d give him a good spot in the auction line - up . ”
Currently , it is rumored that the sale of Cramer ’s dignity and reputation will be sandwiched between the only two items at the auction that have generated more buzz than Cramer , a tractor engine with less than 150,000 miles on it and a stolen 1992 Camaro IROC-Z with a smashed steering column .
When reached for comment Cramer ’s former cohost Larry Kudlow said “ Cramer ’s reputation is n’t worth shit and it ’ll be fun to watch him go down in flaming ball of cow piss right there in the armpit of North America !
What am I doing these days ?
I got a line on some vacation property in Destin Florida if you ’re inetersted .
Hey !..
Where you going ?! ”

Kazuyoshi Miura Hanged in LA Police Custody ( Photos )
returned to Los Angeles yesterday from the U.S. territory of Saipan to stand trial for the 1981 murder of his wife .
He hanged himself in his police cell less than 24 hours later and was discovered early Saturday morning , according to his high profile lawyer
Miura has been held in a Saipan jail since February and had arrived in L.A. for arraignment in the 1981 murder of his then 28 year old wife Kazumi Miura .
The couple were shot by an unknown gunman while they were visiting downtown Los Angeles .
Miura received a superficial leg wound but his wife was gravely injured .
He took her back to Japan , where she died a year later .
Miura was convicted in Japan of her murder in 1994 but the verdict was overturned four years later .
Police have watched Miura 's blogsite for years .
In early 2008 he shared with his readers that he would be traveling to Saipan , a U.S. commonwealth .
They arrested him as he came through the airport in Saipan , where he has been held since February .
Miura was scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Los Angeles on a charge of conspiracy to commit murder .
Evidence accumulated and held for 27 years strongly supported the state 's claim that he had his wife killed in order to collect $ 750,000 on her life insurance policy .
Miura , who has fought extradition since 1988 , agreed to return to the U.S. after learning that his L.A. murder charge had been dismissed .
A new 25 page motion seeking reinstatement of the charges was filed earlier this week based on a 2004 state law that does not recognize convictions and acquittals outside the U.S .
That knowledge may have caused the incarcerated Miura to take his own life .
According to his lawyer , he spent 12 hours on Friday with a legal colleague who reported that the inmate was in good spirits .
He was expecting his second wife to join him on Wednesday .
Geragos has notified her of his death .

A few days ago , a senior officer at the Pentagon called his intelligence officer into his office .
The boss had heard a news report about China while driving to his office and wanted some answers .
It was n't a tough assignment , given the news coverage , but there was a hitch .
" There was plenty of information in the public domain about the topic , " recalls the intelligence officer , a 10 - year veteran .
" And yet , if there was n't some classified information cited in my report , the boss would never believe it was accurate . "
The officer calls it " the seduction of the ' top - secret ' stamp . "
That 's a common refrain in the intelligence community when the subject of so - called open - source information comes up .
It 's the kind of anecdote recounted over and over again this week at the intelligence community 's second annual conference on the use of open - source information .
Another anecdote involves public information — commonly newspaper reports — that is paraphrased or quoted verbatim and then stamped " classified " to make the report more appealing to superiors .
Yet it 's a practice that might be changing .
The use of nonclassified information , whether news accounts or other publicly retrievable information , is gaining credibility within the intelligence community .
And officials say there can be good reasons for putting some of that open - source information under the secrecy umbrella .
" The information might be unclassified but our interest in it is not , " Gen. Michael Hayden , head of the CIA , told the conference .
More than 15,000 people in the intelligence community now use the limited - access opensource.gov portal for information .
" By using open - source information , we can distribute it more widely among our customers in the State Department than we could if it was classified .
Not everyone who works with the State Department has top - secret clearance , " says James Bell , acting director of the Office of Research at the State Department 's Bureau of Intelligence and Research .
In addition , open - source information is sometimes simply easier to access .
Soldiers in Iraq , for instance , occasionally lacking maps of their area of operations in Baghdad , regularly used satellite imagery from Google Earth to plan operations last spring .
Also on the intelligence community 's radar : the new version of Picasa , a Google - owned application for digital photographs that allows users to use facial recognition software .
Indeed , the Open Source Center , an office overseen by the director of national intelligence , now has more requests for information than it can handle , according to officials .
Says Kim Robinson , a senior executive at from the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency , " Open source is starting to be institutionalized . "
Open - source information is both a curse and a blessing to intelligence professionals .
On the one hand , it makes information far more accessible , sometimes more timely , and easier to disseminate .
That means that more people can be more informed in a shorter amount of time , even despite concerns about the reliability of some of the information — Wikipedia , for instance .
On the other hand , it means a loss of power for those very intelligence agencies .
" The intelligence professional is no longer the most , or the only , authoritative source of information , " says Don Burke of the CIA 's Directorate of Science and Technology .

Sleep is something we all do – mostly every day ( except on all nighters reading Listverse or studying ) and for most people it is one of the great pleasures in life .
But sadly , for many people , with sleep comes problems – some of which can be extremely serious .
This is a list of the 10 weirdest sleep disorders .
10 Rapid eye movement behavior disorder
In this disorder , a person loses paralysis which is normal for the Rapid Eye Movement period , causing their body to freely act out their dreams .
These behaviours can be violent in nature and in some cases will result in injury to either the patient or their bed partner .
RBD is a treatable condition .
The standard therapy is the anti-convulsant drug clonazepam , and this is generally received very well .
The reason for its effectiveness is unknown , but it restores the natural paralyzed state of a person in the REM stage of sleep .
9 Night Terrors
A night terror is a parasomnia sleep disorder characterized by extreme terror and a temporary inability to regain full consciousness .
The subject wakes abruptly from slow - wave sleep , with waking usually accompanied by gasping , moaning , or screaming .
It is often impossible to fully awaken the person , and after the episode the subject normally settles back to sleep without waking .
A night terror can rarely be recalled by the subject .
Night terrors are distinct from nightmares in several key ways .
First , the subject is not fully awake when roused , and even when efforts are made to awaken the sleeper , he / she may continue to experience the night terror for ten to twenty minutes .
Often times it ’s extremely dangerous for the person , for it can cause trauma , and even hurting someone ( e.g. trying to kill “ the murderer ” and in fact injuring someone else ) .
8 Bruxism
Bruxism is the disorder in which a person grinds or clenches their jaw during sleep .
It is one of the most common sleep disorders with up to 40 million Americans suffering from it .
This disorder can result in serious damage to the teeth so treatment is well advised .
It can lead to facial pain and headaches , and in severe , chronic cases , it can lead to arthritis of the temporomandibular joints .
Most bruxers are not aware of their bruxism and only 5 - 10 % go on to develop symptoms such as jaw pain and headache .
While there is no cure for this disorder , doctors either recommend mouthguards or botox injections .
7 Restless Legs Syndrome
While this disorder can effect a person who is awake , it is at its worst during sleep or periods of non-movemement .
Restless Legs Syndrome is a condition that is characterized by an irresistible urge to move one ’s body to stop uncomfortable or odd sensations .
It most commonly affects the legs , but can also be in the arms and torso .
Moving the affected body part modulates the sensations , providing temporary relief .
For relief of this disorder , some doctors prescribe anticonvulsants , opioids ( such as methadone ) , or Benzodiazepines .
Medicating a person with Restless Legs Syndrome is currently a controversial practice .
6 Non -24 - hour sleep - wake syndrome
This odd ( and extremely rare ) disorder consists of a person ’s body not recognizing the 24 hour sleep cycle .
Consequently , the body will not allow itself to sleep in a regular day / night pattern .
Left untreated , non - 24 - hour sleep - wake syndrome causes a person ’s sleep - wake cycle to change every day , the degree determined by how much over 24 hours the cycle lasts .
The cycle may go around the clock , eventually returning to “ normal ” for one or two days before going “ off ” again .
In many cases it can take up to a week for the body to complete one cycle of its disturbed pattern .
To add even further weirdness , this disorder takes place almost exclusively in blind people ( though there have been one or two accounts of a sighted person suffering from it ) .
5 Sleep Apnea
Sleep apnea is characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep .
Each episode lasts long enough so that one or more breaths are missed , and occurs repeatedly throughout sleep .
Clinically significant levels of sleep apnea are defined as five or more episodes per hour .
Individuals suffering from this sleep disorder are rarely aware of having difficulty breathing , even upon awakening .
It is usually recognized as a problem by others witnessing the individual during episodes or is suspected because of its effects on the body .
Symptoms may be present for years , even decades without identification , during which time the sufferer may become conditioned to the daytime sleepiness and fatigue associated with significant levels of sleep disturbance .
The most common treatment treatment for sleep apnea is the use of a positive airway pressure ( PAP ) device .
The PAP ‘ splints ’ the patient ’s airway open during sleep by means of a flow of pressurized air into the throat .
Other treatments such as surgery and medication also exist .
4 Kleine - Levin syndrome
Kleine - Levin syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by the need for excessive amounts of sleep , sometimes for up to 20 hours a day , and is normally accompanied with excessive food intake ( compulsive hyperphagia ) and an abnormally uninhibited sexual drive ( hypersexuality ) .
While some researchers speculate that Kleine - Levin syndrome is the cause of a hereditary predisposition , others believe the condition may be the result of an autoimmune disorder .
There is no definitive treatment for Kleine - Levin syndrome .
Stimulants , including amphetamines , methylphenidate , imipramine and modafinil , administered orally , are used to treat sleepiness .
Because of similarities between Kleine - Levin syndrome and certain mood disorders , lithium and carbamazepine may be prescribed .
Responses to treatment have often been limited .
3 Somniloquy ( Sleep Talking )
Somiloquy refers to talking aloud in one ’s sleep .
It can be quite loud , ranging from simple sounds to long speeches , and can occur many times during sleep .
Listeners may or may not be able to understand what the person is saying .
Sleep - talking usually occurs during transitory arousals from non-REM sleep , which is when the body does not move smoothly from one stage in non-REM sleep to another , and they become partially aroused from sleep .
Further it can also occur during REM sleep at which time it represents a motor breakthrough of dream speech , when words spoken in a dream are spoken out loud .
There are no medical treatments for this , but in order to prevent sleep - talking a mouthguard may be worn .
2 Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy is a neurological sleep disorder that is commonly associated with falling asleep at random times .
Narcoleptics tend to fall directly into REM sleep , when most dreaming occurs , and less commonly enter deeper and more restful stages of non-REM sleep .
As a result , they are unable to stay awake for extended periods of time , and upon falling back asleep , they still are unable experience sleep ’s more restorative stages – – causing a vicious cycle of extreme sleepiness and inability to stay awake after having slept .
Another symptom can include cataplexy , the sudden collapse of an individual into REM sleep upon experiencing strong emotions .
Sleep paralysis and hypnogogic hallucinations ( hallucinations which accompany sleep paralysis ) are also known to be symptoms .
The cause of narcolepsy has not been determined .
It is widely believed to be an autoimmune disorder , but it may also be genetic .
Treatments include stimulants , anti-depressants , or hypnotic medications such as Xyrem .
1 Sexsomnia or Sleep Sex
Sexsomnia is a sleep disorder which causes people to commit sexual acts while they are asleep .
It is considered to be a distinct variant of sleepwalking .
In some cases , sufferers are aware of their behavior for a long time before they seek help , often because they lack information that it is a medical disorder or for fear that others will judge it as willful behavior rather than a medical condition .
However , the reality of sexsomnia has been confirmed by sleep disorder researchers who have made polygraphic and video recordings of patients with the condition while they are asleep and observed unusual brain wave activity during the episodes .
Treatments are similar to those of other non-REM parasomnias such as sleep walking , which may involve specific interventions .
By avoiding precipitating factors and ensuring for the safe environment , the condition could be brought to high level of control with a minimal effort .
Sexsomnia is not always problematic or extreme for those who experience it or for their partners .
There is a great variety in both the frequency and levels to which people are affected by this disorder .

Trained police negotiators spent three hours talking to Shaun Dykes Bystanders who urged a teenager to jump to his death from a car park have been branded " ghoulish " by Derbyshire 's Chief Constable Mick Creedon .
Shaun Dykes , 17 , from Kilburn , fell to his death from the top of the Westfield Centre multi-storey in Derby on 27 September , as onlookers shouted " jump " .
Mr Creedon said : " It disgusts me to think of their motivation and their lack of compassion . "
The chief constable also defended his officers for not making any arrests .
Police had spent three hours trying to coax the teenager down .
Some onlookers even used phones to film the event .
Mr Creedon said : " While we are very used to dealing with incidents like this , this was unusual with members of the public videoing , taking photographs and even shouting for Shaun to jump .
It disgusts me to think of their motivation and their lack of compassion towards a fellow human being obviously in distress
Derbyshire Chief Constable Mick Creedon
" All my experience and belief in the good in people tells me that the vast majority of the crowd who watched the events unfold were wishing for the best result , hoping that Shaun remained safe and well .
" However , all of us associated with the force see the actions of that small minority who were encouraging Shaun to take his own life as totally abhorrent .
" It disgusts me to think of their motivation and their lack of compassion towards a fellow human being obviously in distress . "
Mr Creedon explained that there had not been enough police officers available to arrest those onlookers urging the teenager to jump .
" I know people are asking why these irresponsible idiots were n't arrested at the time , but I ask the public to understand that the few available officers at the scene were doing their best to manage a difficult situation , " he said .
" They should not have to deal with the extra distraction of the deviant and ghoulish behaviour of a few , and if arrests had been made this would have necessitated perhaps two officers leaving the scene for every person arrested . "
Mr Creedon added that officers involved in trying to talk to Shaun had been affected by his death .
He said : " The fact they were unsuccessful in negotiating Shaun to safety will have been very painful for them , particularly for the two officers who spent two hours talking directly to him , " he said .
Shaun was a student at Heanor Gate Science College .
An inquest into the his death has been opened and adjourned .

Henry Paulson called for the plan 's swift implementation , but said the financial crisis would not end soon .
Seven central banks on Wednesday cut interest rates in an effort to steady the faltering global economy .
The co-ordinated effort was carried out by banks including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank .
More work to do The IMF 's chief economist , Oliveri Blanchard , said the orchestrated rate - cuts could not solve the world 's financial crisis on their own but " were clearly a step in the right direction " .
The fact that the central banks have had to take such extreme measures underlines how bad market conditions have become

But he warned " there will be tough economic times ahead " .
Chief international economist at Capital Economics , Julian Jessop , said the rate cut would provide a " temporary boost to confidence " , but warned there was still a lot more work to do .
" The fact that the central banks have had to take such extreme measures underlines how bad market conditions have become , " said Mr Jessop .
On Wednesday , the UK government unveiled a package of measures aimed at rescuing the banking system which could add up to £ 400 bn .
Italy also unveiled details of a banking rescue plan that could involve the government taking stakes in failing banks .
The US Federal Reserve , meanwhile , agreed to provide insurance giant American International Group with a $ 37.8 bn loan on top of the $ 85 bn loan given to the troubled firm last month .

You 're an undercover cop assigned to get the goods on an alleged prostitution ring .
You get approval to have sex in the course of your investigation , approval from your supervisor and your wife , for crying out loud .
You do what you 're told .
You get blow jobs .
You go all the way , once .
Maybe .
Then you get fired .
Info police sex stings
That 's what happened to Beaumont police officer Keith Breiner .
He was suspended from the force July 21 after an assistant police chief found out about the activity .
Beaumont PD is n't talking , but Breiner 's attorney , Larry Watts , is .
There 's a hearing scheduled August 12 on an injunction seeking his client 's job back .
" My son , who 's an attorney , said , ' Dad , I thought you usually represented people who got fired for not doing their jobs , ' " Watts tells Hair Balls .
" This is the first time I 've represented someone fired for doing theirs . "
It was tough work , but Breiner was up to it .
After he checked with his wife of 12 years .
" The wife understood it was not an act he was engaging in for any other reason than his employment and for the public safety , " Watts says .
Since the investigation was intended to lead to felony charges , she thought it was worth it .
( And that 's all we 'll say about that , being married and all . )
Eventually , the investigation was cut short , after a half - dozen or so blowjobs ( " there may have been one ' active coitus , ' " Watts says ) .
We 're sure Breiner was eager to continue the case .
Two women were arrested , made bond and disappeared .
The pimps were never charged .
" Same old story — the guys get off and the women go down , " Watts says .
In a statement with many layers .
Old and In ( and Out ) of TDCJ
The Texas Department of Criminal Justice has released its annual report ; as always , it 's a cornucopia of miscellaneous details describing just how our state is doing in putting people behind bars .
The great criminal - justice blog Grits for Breakfast will no doubt have the best analysis of the 152,661 guests of the state ; the blog notes that " TDCJ received 73,525 new prisoners in FY 2007 and released 72,032 , representing significant growth but a much slower rate than in recent years . "
We like to look for other details .
Who 's the oldest person to get sent to TDCJ in the last fiscal year ?
Corban Henry Wyatt , 88 years old , from Taylor County , is our winner .
Convicted of sexual assault against a child , for crying out loud , he received a life sentence .
( No shit . )
Oldest woman ?
Seventy - four - year - old Betty Lou Fennell , who got six months for drug possession .
Seventy - four and you 're going away for six months ?
For possession , not dealing ?
Where 's house arrest when you need it ?
As for the newly freed , we have James Terry Bray of Midland .
After serving five years for possession , he 's a free man .
At 87 years old , we hope he enjoys himself .
Nina Faye Andrews of Grayson County also is out after five years for possession .
At 79 , she might have a little more time than Bray .
IF SHE PUTS AWAY THE PIPE .
Come on , grandma .
The Mayor 's Right ; Houston Is Never , Never Trendy
Mayor Bill
White got some publicity recently when he told The New York Times the reason Houston really , really sucks at recycling is because Houstonians are skeptical of anything that appears to be oversold or exaggerated .
Or things that are trendy or hyped-up .
Some Houstonians , it turns out , are skeptical of obviously lame excuses .
At any rate , we were intrigued by White 's analysis that Houston refuses to do stuff just because other places are doing it , even if it might be all hype .
The record truly supports his theory , if by supports you mean does n't support .
Let 's look at the trendy , overhyped , oversold or exaggerated things Houston as a city has stoically refused to get involved in .
Okay , I do call myself " the master " or " the chosen one " , and also " elektito " but I 'm not really that arrogant .
The chosen one is just the translation of my name in English , and so is Elektito in Esperanto .
The master is a reference to Jamalzadeh 's excellent short story , The Roast Goose , in which a character by my name nicknames himself " the master " .
In the space of a few short years , Comedy Central has managed to win the hearts and minds of a generation of young voters with a pair of topical comedy shows that speak truth to power in an age when the mainstream media too often abdicates that role .
I am , of course , referring to The Daily Show and the The Colbert Report .
The latter of these is a spinoff of The Daily Show , where host Steven Colbert satirizes the right wing polemic style of Bill O'Reilly , Sean Hannity and others .
Since the 2006 midterm elections , Colbert has often made reference to the " Colbert Bump , " whereby a politician gets a popularity surge following an appearance on The Colbert Report .
As it turns out , there is an actual , verifiable Colbert Bump — but with a twist .
The finding is the result of work by University of California - San Diego political science professor James Fowler .
Dr. Fowler has authored an article in Political Science and Politics that analyzes the performance of politicians pre- and post -Colbert and compares them to matched controls who did not appear on the show .
Previous attempts to quantify the Colbert Bump have been attempted , but Dr. Fowler dismisses them as unscientific , since they did not attempt to control for variables , which any scientist will tell you is a sine qua non for research .
Fowler obtained the FEC 's data on individual contributions to candidates from January 2005 to October 2007 and identified the politicians who appeared on the Colbert Report 's " Better Know a District " segment .
These are compared to control politicians of the same party in similar districts who did not appear on the show .
Interestingly , Democrats raised significantly more money for up to 42 days after appearing on the show compared to those Democrats who did n't , and they raised on average 40 percent more .
The picture is not nearly as rosy for Republicans .
Far fewer have appeared on the " Better Know a District " segment , making analysis more difficult , but none of the ones that did showed any improvement in fundraising post -Colbert .
In fact , the Republicans that did appear had previously been doing quite well , only to slump following their appearance .
Dr Fowler suggests three possible reasons for this effect : that the Colbert Report selects the Republicans because they 've been doing well ; that the only Republicans who accept the invitation are ones that have been doing well ; or that a peculiar rift in the space - time continuum means that Republicans see their Colbert Bump in the weeks preceding their show .
Dr. Fowler points out that these results might not be welcome to the " legions " of Ron Paul supporters , and it seems to refute Mike Huckabee 's claim of having received a Colbert Bump , but then he did lose the Republican primary to Sen. McCain .
Dr. Fowler also cautions the reader not to put too much stock in his findings , since the audience for The Colbert Report is rather narrowly focused on a particular demographic .
But then as we know from the venerable Colbert himself , " reality has a well - known liberal bias . "

Barack Obama responds to McCain 's call for deregulation of the health care industry just as he dd for the banks .
Can you imagine if that happens ?
Obama :
He calls himself " fundamentally a deregulator , " when reckless deregulation and lack of oversight is a big part of the problem .
And here 's the really scary part .
Now this " Great Deregulator " wants to turn his attention to health care .
He wrote in the current issue of a magazine - the current issue - that we need to open up health care to - quote - " more vigorous nationwide competition , as we have done over the last decade in banking . "
That 's right , John McCain says he wants to do for health care what Washington has done for r banking .
Think about what that means .

Obama :
The news of the day is n't good .
The era of greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street and in Washington has led us to a perilous moment .
They said they wanted to let the market run free but instead they let it run wild .
And now we are facing a financial crisis as profound as any we have faced since the Great Depression .
But here 's the truth :
Regardless of how we got here , we 're here today .
And the circumstances we face require decisive action because your jobs , your savings , and your economic security are now at risk .
Over the years , states have come up with common sense rules to make sure that insurance companies are n't just looking out for their own profits , but for your health .
And we cannot toss those rules out the window .
Big Banger theory :
Why proper sausages are the cornerstone of any gastropub
... So it 's no wonder their perfect partners are full - bodied beers
Fine sausages and good beer .
As food - and - drink combinations go , this pairing is in the Premier League , up there with oysters and chilled Chablis , vodka and caviar , burger and Coke .
What more could a man want from a pub than a decent pint and a brace
of plump , sizzling bangers ?
They ’re the essence of a gastropub , too – the proper , unpretentious places that eschew ghastly foams , fads and flummeries for good ingredients , beautifully cooked .
I prefer to consume sausages alone and unembellished , with just a pot of freshly made English mustard for company
In fact , a gastropub without a sausage ( and by sausage , I mean pork or beef , not ostrich and avocado or some equally witless creation ) is n’t worthy of the name .
Personally , I prefer to consume sausages alone and unembellished , with just a pot of freshly made English mustard for company .
My only requirements are that the sausage casing is natural and it ’s filled with at least 80 per cent free - range porker .
But as to a serious matching of beer and sausage , I had no clue – just take a bite , swill down with pint and repeat until either sated or blind drunk .
It took the combined efforts of beer guru Rupert Ponsonby and the director of gastronomy at Hix Oyster & Chop House , Julian Biggs , to show me how little I really knew .
I ’m actually sitting down at a specially arranged pre-tasting , where Ponsonby and Biggs will figure out which sausage goes best with specially chosen beers .
The winners will go on to star in a lavish lunch at Brown ’s Hotel in a few weeks ’ time .
‘ A lot of these pairings are experimental , ’ explains Ponsonby , ‘ and I ’m just taking the main flavour of each sausage , and trying to find a suitable partner .
' Generally , as sausages can be fatty , you need big - tasting beers .
But the whole point of this is finding a good match , so that each beer brings out and accentuates the best part of the other , without obliterating the flavour of either . ’
The first sausage is a hearty wild - boar - and - fresh - thyme , from Franconian , and the first sip is of Ringwood Old Thumper , a big Hampshire ale , which is rounded with a slight sour kick .
On their own , both shine .
But mixed , some sort of beery alchemy occurs that allows you to revel in the gamey meat , and the herbal punch of the thyme , without losing any of the beer ’s complexity .
The same is true when the sausage is matched with Innis & Gunn Original , an oak - aged Scottish refresher with a whisper of wood and a citrus tang .
Again , both sausage and beer support each other , the liquid cutting through the fat but not obliterating any idiosyncrasies of flavour .
Ponsonby looks happy .
‘ Both worked well , so that sausage will have two beers .
Lucky them .’
And so we move on , first to a Londoner sausage , which is thick with sage , thyme and mace , matched with Fuller ’s London Porter , rich , dark and handsome , and full of coffee and chocolate notes .
The sausage smoothes the beer ’s soft , heavy edges , while the Fuller ’s accentuates the sweet pork .
Separately , they stroll across the tongue .
Together , they waltz across the palate .
Yet a Meantime Porter , less heavy than the Fuller ’s , does n’t quite manage to stand up against the snag , losing length , depth and body .
Both beers are the same style , but only the Fuller ’s actually works .
And so the afternoon continues in a flurry of pork and ale .
A fat Cumberland sausage is beautifully matched with a refreshing Jennings Cumberland Ale , the beer letting the sausage shine while at the same time cleansing the palate and emerging unscathed .
A Bacchus raspberry beer , on the other hand , is an abject failure , as the berry hit obliterates any hint of sausage .
The mighty Worthington ’s White Shield IPA , one of the world ’s great beers , glides across the tongue with a mighty beef - and - stout sausage , the honeyed and golden characteristics working in perfect harmony with the bovine concoction .
Both emerge better from their meeting .
But a Sam Smith ’s Extra Stout just can’t keep up , and all the subtle nuances of the beer are flattened .
The White Shield also works wonders with a fantastic double - smoked black pudding .
It cuts through the fat and smoke , but does n’t lose a modicum of its beauty .
It ’s the same story with the Innis & Gunn Cask Strength – they positively crackle together , like some frenzied tango couple .
By now , life seems a little merrier , although my belly is heavy with pig .
‘ Basically , straight beers need straight food , ’ says Ponsonby , ‘ while the complex beers , with all sorts of flavours and layers , need complex food . ’
I ’m still amazed at how the right beer can really make the sausage sing , and vice versa .
Just do n’t try matching a pint of cheap lager with a couple of slurry - filled economy bangers .
That ’s one marriage certain to end in divorce .

You think sex makes you groan ?
A fallow buck can groan once a second , even more after the act .
Those with the deepest voices seem to have more luck with the ladies , too .
This new finding might do Barry White proud — deeper voices can help male deer get it on .
Scientists investigated male fallow deer ( Dama dama ) , which regularly groan 60 mating calls per minute during breeding season to attract females — although they can groan up to 90 times per minute right after sex .
" They must be the most vocal deer species in the world , " said researcher Alan McElligott , a behavioral ecologist now at the University of Nottingham in England .
After tracking a herd of the deer from dawn until dusk for a month in Ireland , sometimes in heavy rain , the researchers discovered the males with the deepest groans were typically luckiest at love .
These bucks were not just the best lovers — they also were the best fighters in contests for dominance among the males ( though they were not the always biggest in terms of body size ) .
Calls also can signal dominance among primates — including humans .
For example , men with deep voices are typically seen as more masculine , and even have more kids .
" People tend to think of primates as special and better than anything else , and it 's important when we can see other animals do similar things as we do , " McElligott told LiveScience .
" It 's important to understand where speech came from in humans , and to do that we have to understand the evolutionary history of other animals as well , to see what we have in common and what 's different . "
The link between how dominant these bucks are and how deep their groans are might be hormones such as testosterone , suggested researcher Elisabetta Vannoni , a behavioral ecologist at the University of Zurich in Switzerland .
Vannoni and McElligott detailed their findings Sept. 3 in the journal PLoS ONE .
The study was funded by grants from the University of Zurich and the Swiss Academy of Sciences .
Details of a plan that could lead to a government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are expected to be announced Sunday .
The Treasury Department and the mortgage financing company 's regulator , the Federal Housing Finance Agency have called a press conference for 11 am New York time .
While details of the plan could not be confirmed , these people point out that Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson has in the past insisted that shareholders , including common and preferred shareholders , pay the ultimate price in absorbing losses .
That would suggest both classes of shareholders could be wiped out or severely diluted in a reorganization plan .
The plan will not preserve Fannie and Freddie in their current form as government officials believe that no amount of public funds would be sufficient to restore investor confidence .
It remained unclear how much the plan would cost taxpayers .
The two government sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) own or guarantee almost half of the country 's $ 12 trillion in outstanding home mortgage debt .
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Friday that the U.S. Treasury Department is close to finalizing a plan to restructure the two companies that includes changes to their
senior management .
U.S. Treasury spokeswoman Brookly McLaughlin declined to comment on the Journal report on Friday .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac spokesmen also declined to comment .
The Federal Reserve , which earlier this year gave both companies the right to borrow from its discount window if necessary , declined comment also .
The two firms would be placed in " conservatorship " , the Washington Post said , citing sources familiar with the discussions .
Shortly after the Journal report on Friday , Pimco 's Bill Gross told CNBC that he welcomed the potential for government intervention .
" To the extent that it does happen , it 's a needed step , " said Gross .
( See the entire interview with Gross in the accompanying video . )

What an enthusiastic , smart , and committed bunch of students we had this summer at the Mises University .
The faculty agrees .
This was an exceptional year .
What encouragement it is to see so many young people taking up the cause of the free economy .
We 've become used to receiving more qualified applications than we can accept .
But we were stunned by the flood this year .
Twice as many top young people could have been let in , if we 'd had room .
And never before has the quality of the students been this high .
They had done the reading in advance .
They came prepared to study and learn .
They paid careful attention to all lecturers in a tight schedule .
They left ready to dedicate their academic lives to excellence in every area , and even more committed to the ideals of freedom .
We are so grateful to all who helped make this , the most impressive and important of all our programs , possible .
There is no question that the Mises University has made a massive difference in the world of ideas .
These students leave inspired to pursue a full - time academic career .
That means that they are the college professors of the future , ready to teach their own students the value of economic liberty .
The philosophy of the Mises University goes way beyond merely introducing ideas on a variety of topics .
We set out to achieve what you hardly find anymore in college : a systematic , integrated program to instill a logical and coherent body of ideas from beginning to end .
It 's an ambitious agenda , but we 've honed the program over the years to get the best out of the time , and provide the best possible education .
These days , with the web and digital communication , there is no shortage of spotty commentaries from every perspective .
What students truly lack is a disciplined understanding that goes from the beginning to the end of a discipline — the way Mises 's own Human Action is structured .
We 've taken this structure and made it into a teaching program that would make Mises very proud .
As I look through the student evaluations , they confirm what all my conversations with students indicated : they were completely blown away by what we offered .
Altogether the program offered more than 60 sessions that permitted students to choose among a variety of research programs .
A tremendous amount of preparation time is necessary or else students could easily fall behind .
They can take rigorous oral examinations and face the prospect of failure , passing , honors , and even cash prizes .
All of this takes high intelligence , courage , and stamina .
They worked very hard , not only for the prizes but also for the other awards .
There was high drama !
But for those who are accepted and do the work , no experience is as intellectually rewarding .
Even after an exhausting dawn - to - dusk program , students and faculty were still discussing economic theory and policy in informal sessions at dinner and in social hours .
Economics is not the only subject covered .
The program also dealt with history , philosophy , and law , as a way of showing that economics cannot be considered in isolation from life and society .
All told , this is a powerful package , and it has to be , in order to displace the parade of fallacies that students are subjected to in today 's colleges and universities .
While it is true that only those accepted can attend , we never want to miss an opportunity to get the word out .
So we broadcast every lecture .
You could hear them all live from everywhere in the world .
With technology and dedication , what amazing things can be accomplished with the support of those who love freedom .
With thousands of graduates , the Austrian School now has a large and growing presence in the world of ideas .
The future is very bright indeed .
To know it , you would only have had to spend a few minutes with the students who have been with us this summer .
They know that with the Mises Institute , they have a structure of support that will be there throughout their lives .
Completing a PhD and entering academia requires that students set aside the normal advantages of a career , and pursue an ideal .
Their solace — and it is a great one — is in the truth they teach , and the good they do , now and for generations to come .
It is their calling , their vocation .
We must be there for them .
We do n't need government to assist us .
In fact , we do n't want its " help . "
We only want the freedom to do our work and the freedom for you to assist us in it with an investment in the future .
Please help us with next year 's Mises University .
We want to bring in many more good students , continue to broadcast all the proceedings around the world on video and audio , and teach everyone the values and ideas we share .
We want to strike an even more powerful blow against leviathan .
We want to train and motivate the leaders of the future .
This is how we can ensure the survival , and the eventual victory , of liberty .
Here are some student comments :
Donald Trump Bailed Ed McMahon
Out of Foreclosure ( Photos )
made headlines in early June when he went public with the disclosure that he was in default on the mortgage for his Beverly Hills home .
He had reportedly quit making payments against the $ 4.8 million mortgage balance after a neck injury kept him from working .
Just when things looked hopeless , Donald Trump stepped in and bought the property - essentially becoming ' Big Ed's landlord .
The New York real estate developer and money mogul reportedly bought the property and will let the 85 year old television personality continue to live at the residence .
According to Trump , he does n't know McMahon but grew up watching Johnny Carson 's sidekick along with the rest of us .
Trump literally stepped in during the 11th hour to save the home , which was within two weeks of foreclosure by Countrywide Financial Corporation .
Trump considered helping McMahon " an honor " .
He will purchase the home from the lender and lease it back to McMahon and his wife .
Said Trump : " When I was at the Wharton School of Business I 'd watch him every night .
How could this happen ? "
Actually it sounds like it was n't Trumps idea after all .
McMahon 's listing agent , Alex Davis of Hilton & Hyland in Beverly Hills , flew to New York to make a personal appeal to Trump .
He must have caught The Donald in a good mood because the gamble paid off .
The six bedroom , five bathroom house has been on the market for more than 2 years .
The asking price started at $ 7 million but had been lowered several times , bottoming at $ 4.8 - which is reportedly what Trump will pay for the property .
McMahon paid $ 2.6 million for the home some 18 years ago .

The news that the American Academy of Pediatrics is recommending cholesterol - lowering drugs for children as young as 8 years old has brought scorn against the medical establishment and the pill - popping American culture .
Newspapers and myriad websites across the globe ridiculed the AAP recommendation , announced on July 7 , and questioned the connection between academia and the pharmaceutical industry .
Hanna - Barbera , with perhaps cards close to chest , has been quiet about licensing Flintstone characters for chewable pills .
The recommendation does sound horrible .
The only trouble is , this is not what the AAP or any doctor has recommended .
Newspaper columnists and bloggers were simply reporting on what other media outlets said and not the actual report .
The AAP merely issued a set of guidelines on cholesterol in children , replacing a 1998 policy statement .
These are published in the July issue of the journal Pediatrics .
In the summary of this report , in the seventh of seven statements — after practical recommendations along the lines that obese kids should get a cholesterol blood test , that high cholesterol should be treated with diet and exercise , and that if diet and exercise are n't working , a nutritional counselor should be brought in to make it work — the AAP suggests that for children with sky - high cholesterol levels or with a strong genetic disposition to high cholesterol and early death from heart disease , doctors can consider prescribing adult cholesterol medication .
Blame the parents
The AAP report comes in the midst of an emerging epidemic of childhood obesity and early - stage diabetes , cardiovascular disease and hypertension — medical conditions once seen exclusively in adults .
Childhood obesity , a rarity a generation ago , is nearly entirely the result of poor diet and physical inactivity .
Many news outlets ran editorials and commentary berating parents for not taking better care of their children .
There 's some truth to that .
But the AAP report is n't saying to give up and just take a pill .
At issue are two new medical findings : People who die young of heart disease begin to develop symptoms of the disease — high blood pressure , or weakened or clogged arteries — as children , not as adults .
And statins , a family of drugs that lower cholesterol , seem to be safe for adults .
The AAP knows well that upwards of 80 percent of heart attacks can be avoided by not smoking , exercising 30 minutes daily , eating well , maintaining a consistent and normal body weight , and drinking a little alcohol .
These are results from the Nurses Health Study and other studies .
But there 's the issue of the other 20 percent , those folks who do everything right but still die young from heart disease .
Conditions such as high cholesterol in childhood likely increase their already high risk of dying young .
Report 's dark side
The rage is misplaced :
The AAP guidelines are a vindication of the power of diet and exercise to lower cholesterol levels .
They actually place limits on pharmaceutical intervention .
And pharmaceutical companies are n't expected to cash in , because a miniscule number of children would be prescribed statins ; and most statins are entering the post - patent , generic - drug ( i.e. little profit ) stage for the big companies .
What 's nuts is putting an 8 - year - old on statins .
Adolescence is a black box .
There 's absolutely no data on what these powerful drugs would do to a young body going through the hormonal upheaval of adolescence .
If the AAP report has a fault , it would be not providing enough detail as to why the age of statin use can be as low as 8 instead of , say , 15 .
Also , there is no discussion in the report about the cost of lengthy statin therapy or the fact that cholesterol is but one risk factor for heart disease .
Maybe more is coming , although a call for blood pressure medication for children will likely cause just as many heart attacks .
And Fred Flintstone is n't much of a role model , anyway .

Tech spending has grown to trillions of dollars among US companies .
This is largely due to how much consumers expect customized and automated experiences .
Even small businesses are starting to invest heavily in technology and alongside that , IT services .
As technology becomes more integral to your daily operations and you consider hiring IT professionals to help you manage ins and outs , you may wonder if managed services or professional services are the better way to go about getting support .
Below , we break down what managed and professional IT services look like .
We also share what to keep in mind when investing in them and which may be better for your business .
What Are Managed Services ?
When it comes to IT , managed services is a term used to describe a more traditional work arrangement between a company and an external IT team .
This arrangement typically includes a contract that keeps IT professionals available for a specified period of time .
During that period , IT professionals will manage a business ’s daily technology tasks .
That would include general maintenance and occasional larger projects like ingratiating new software .
Note that managed service providers are still contractors .
Consequently , companies do n’t pay those teams benefits like they would a typical employee .
What Are Professional Services ?
Professional services are case - by - case IT service providers .
These teams ( or sometimes single professionals ) act as freelancers that negotiate a rate with you to complete a single project .
For example , say you needed a quick set of additional hands to help with a cloud migration .
In that case , professional services would be an excellent option .
They could tackle your job without expecting a commitment while managed services would .
Key Differences to Consider
Now that you know what professional and managed services are , let ’s focus on key differences to keep in mind when picking one or the other .
The primary factors we suggest focusing on when choosing include :
Cost
Since professional service providers work on a per-project basis and managed services expect larger contracts , the former is cheaper …
At least in the short - term .
When you break down how much managed IT services cost over time , you ’re likely getting a better rate with that arrangement .
Commitment
Managed services are the way to go if you ’d like something that resembles and in - house IT team without having to pay benefits .
Professional service providers will only see you through a single project .
They may also not be available when you want to hire them later due to other short - term commitments .
Only You Can Decide Between Professional and Managed Services
As you ’ve come to discover , there ’s no answer to whether professional services are better than managed services or the reverse .
Each service offers a different experience that suits different businesses .
We hope our brief outline has brought clarity to how you might move forward with onboarding an IT team .

ISPs have been worried to learn that BT 's ongoing multibillion pound " 21CN " network upgrade wo n't offer native support for IPv6 , the networking protocol that it 's planned will form the bedrock of a rapidly expanding 21st century internet .
The ommission surfaced when business provider AAISP , one of a select group of resellers currently able to offer ADSL2 + via BT 's 21CN network , asked BT to fix a bug in Cisco equipment that was affecting subscribers using IPv6 .
BT Wholesale replied : " BT currently supports IP v4 on it 's broadband products and does not support IPv6 . "
It 's still possible for ISPs to offer customers IP v6 services , but they 'll have to use tunneling , which adds to their overheads .
AAISP said : " Tunneled IP v6 works in all cases , and native IP v6 works in some cases where this bug is not affecting it .
In some ways the issue is more commercial than technical - IP v6 mostly works , but BT appear to be saying that if it stops working then they wo n't fix it . "
IPv6 was defined in 1996 when it became clear that the current IP v4 protocol would eventually run out of addresses .
Recent estimates say IP v4 could be exhausted in 2011 .
The delay - hit rollout of 21CN , which will shift all of the national telecoms backbone to packet switched networking , is currently scheduled for completion in 2012 .
BT was unavailable for comment this morning . ®
At a campaign rally in South Dakota , McCain yelled “ When I ’m president of the United States , I ’m not going to let them [ Congress ] go on vacation ! ” — referring to the fact that Congress is currently taking their August break .
And in Eastern Pennsylvania yesterday , McCain called for Congress to come back to work “ Congress should come back into session , and I ’m willing to come off the campaign trail . ”
What a joke .
McCain has hardly worked a day at his Senate job since he started campaigning .
He holds the record for most votes missed of any Senator .
Mexico's Supreme Court has voted to uphold legal abortion in Mexico City , making the Mexican capital one of only a handful of places in Latin America that allow abortion without limitations in the first trimester .
Here 's the early AP story .
The law was considered historic when it was passed last year , according to this NYT story .
Most countries in Latin America permit abortions only under very limited circumstances , notes the Times , like after a rape and to save the life of the mother , although abortion rights groups say that , in practice , women face hurdles in obtaining abortions even in those cases .
Chile , Nicaragua and El Salvador outlaw abortion altogether .
The Roman Catholic Church had opposed the Mexico City law , buying a one - minute television advertisement to speak against abortion during prime time on Sunday night .
And Magistrate Mariano Azuela , who was one of two justices to speak against the law , declared that life begins at conception .
" I feel that a woman in some way has to live with the phenomenon of becoming pregnant , " he reportedly said .
" When she does not want to keep the product of the pregnancy , she still has to suffer the effects during the whole period . "
It may take some time to load .
" What people do n't realise is that there are now almost the same levels of these metals present on our city streets as there are in the places where they are originally mined .

Make No Mistake : McCain 's a Neocon Since clinching the Republican presidential nomination , John McCain has sought to hide the forest of his neoconservative alignment with George W. Bush amid the trees of details , such as stressing differences over military tactics used in Iraq .

But the larger reality should be clear : McCain is a hard - line neoconservative who buys into Bush ’s “ preemptive war ” theories abroad and his concept of an all - powerful “ unitary executive ” at home .
From McCain ’s pre-Iraq invasion speeches to his campaign ’s recent embrace of Bush ’s imperial presidency , American voters should realize that if they choose John McCain , they will be locking in at least four more years of war with much of the Islamic world while selling out the Founders ’ vision of a democratic Republic where no one is above the law .
Take , for instance , an address that McCain gave to the Munich Conference on Security Policy on Feb. 2 , 2002 .
In the speech – with the ambitious title , “ From Crisis to Opportunity : American Internationalism and the New Atlantic Order ” – the Arizona senator laid out the “ full monte ” of a neocon agenda .
In those heady days after the U.S. ouster of Afghanistan ’s Taliban regime , McCain hailed “ a new American internationalism ” designed “ to end safe harbor for terrorists anywhere , to aggressively target rogue regimes that threaten us with weapons of mass destruction , and to consolidate freedom ’s gains through institutions that reflect our values . ”
To McCain , this meant that the United States had a fundamental right to invade any country on earth that was viewed as an actual or potential threat , a theory of American exceptionalism to international law that was at the heart of Bush ’s strategy of “ preemptive war . ”
“ Americans believe we have a mandate to defeat and dismantle the global terrorist network that threatens both Europe and America , ” McCain said .
“ As our President has said , this network includes not just the terrorists but the states that make possible their continued operation .
“ Many of these are rogue regimes that possess or are developing weapons of mass destruction which threaten Europeans and Americans alike .
We in America learned the hard way that we can never again wait for our enemies to choose their moment .
The initiative is now ours , and we are seizing it . ”
Neocon Forerunner McCain even presented himself as a forerunner to Bush ’s neoconservative policies .
“ Several years ago , I and many others argued that the United States , in concert with willing allies , should work to undermine from within and without outlaw regimes that disdain the rules of international conduct and whose internal dysfunction threatened other nations , ” McCain said .
“ Just this week , the American people heard our President articulate a policy to defeat the ‘ axis of evil ’ that threatens us with its support for terror and development of weapons of mass destruction , ” McCain said in reference to Bush ’s warning to Iraq , Iran and North Korea .
“ Dictators that harbor terrorists and build these weapons are now on notice that such behavior is , in itself , a casus belli .
Nowhere is such an ultimatum more applicable than in Saddam Hussein 's Iraq . ”
McCain then reprised what turned out to be the bogus case for invading Iraq .
” Almost everyone familiar with Saddam 's record of biological weapons development over the past two decades agrees that he surely possesses such weapons .
He also possesses vast stocks of chemical weapons and is known to have aggressively pursued , with some success , the development of nuclear weapons , ” McCain said .
“ Terrorist training camps exist on Iraqi soil , and Iraqi officials are known to have had a number of contacts with al - Qaeda .
These were probably not courtesy calls , ” McCain added in the smug , sarcastic tone common to that period .
As it turned out , the “ vast stocks ” of chemical weapons and the prospect of nuclear weapons were non-existent .
The “ terrorist training camps ” on Iraqi soil were hostile to Hussein ’s secular regime and were located outside Baghdad ’s control in areas protected by the U.S. - British - enforced “ no - fly zone . ”
Evidence collected after the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 revealed that Saddam Hussein rebuffed overtures from al - Qaeda , which he regarded as an enemy in the Arab world .
Those contacts were not even “ courtesy calls . ”
[ For details , see Neck Deep : The Disastrous Presidency of George W. Bush . ]
Rush to War However , in February 2002 , McCain was a leading voice in the neocon rush for war in Iraq , as an extension of Bush ’s “ war on terror . ”
“ The next front is apparent , and we should not shirk from acknowledging it , ” McCain said .
“ A terrorist resides in Baghdad , with the resources of an entire state at his disposal , flush with cash from illicit oil revenues and proud of a decade - long record of defying the international community 's demands that he come clean on his programs to develop weapons of mass destruction .
” A day of reckoning is approaching .
Not simply for Saddam Hussein , but for all members of the Atlantic community , whose governments face the choice of ending the threat we face every day from this rogue regime or carrying on as if such behavior , in the wake of September 11th , were somehow still tolerable .
“ The Afghan campaign set a precedent , and provided a model : the success of air power , combined with Special Operations forces working together with indigenous opposition forces , in waging modern war .
” The next phase of the war on terror can build on this model , but we also must learn from its limitations .
More American boots on the ground may be required to prevent the escape of terrorists we target in the future , and we should all be mindful that such a commitment might entail higher casualties than we have suffered in Afghanistan , ” McCain continued .
” The most compelling defense of war is the moral claim that it allows the victors to define a stronger and more enduring basis for peace .
Just as September 11th revolutionized our resolve to defeat our enemies , so has it brought into focus the opportunities we now have to secure and expand freedom . ”
McCain ’s full embrace of this neocon global theory – both in its grandiose substance and its grandiloquent rhetoric – marked the over - the - top hubris that contributed to the suppression of any serious pre-Iraq War debate in the United States and then to the ill - considered rush to invade Iraq .
As the war in Iraq turned sour and anti-Americanism swept the Middle East , McCain began criticizing the Bush administration not for its imperial overreach but for not reaching even farther .
McCain began advocating a larger U.S. expeditionary force to pacify Iraq , a policy that gave rise to the “ surge . ” ‘ League of Democracies ’
Despite these tactical differences , McCain has shown no sign of rethinking his vision of an alliance of “ willing ” nations going around the world challenging and replacing disfavored governments .
Indeed , he has made this neocon concept a centerpiece of his presidential campaign .
The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has proposed a “ League of Democracies , ” which would apply economic and military pressure on “ rogue states ” when the United Nations Security Council refuses to do so .
Though McCain has dressed up his League of Democracies in pretty language about respecting international law and spreading freedom , its essence is to make permanent Bush ’s “ coalition of the willing ” concept used in Iraq .
McCain insists his League wo n’t supplant the Security Council , but it would do just that , fulfilling a long - held neocon dream of voiding the international system that U.S. leaders fashioned after World War II to enforce the Nuremberg principle that aggressive war was the “ supreme ” international crime .
McCain ’s League would create for the U.S. President a standing organization for engaging in aggressive war against “ rogue regimes ” whether they are an immediate , potential -- or imaginary -- threat .
The irony is that when McCain and Bush talk about the danger of “ rogue regimes ” operating outside international law and threatening other nations , that is exactly what their neocon theories have made the United States : a country that – along with a few allies – becomes a law onto itself .
Similarly , McCain and Bush share the view that the President of the United States should embody and personify these new imperial powers .
Just as the U.S. government can act in any way it sees fit under these neocon theories , its Commander in Chief also can do whatever he wants without legal constraints .
That was spelled out by a top McCain adviser , Douglas Holtz - Eakin , declaring in a letter to the right - wing National Review that McCain agreed with Bush ’s assertion that the President may override laws that he deems an impediment to fighting the “ war on terror . ”
Holtz - Eakin said McCain supports
Bush ’s program of warrantless wiretaps despite the Fourth Amendment ’s protections against unreasonable searches and a 1978 law requiring the Executive to gain approval from a special court for intelligence - related wiretaps inside the United States .
“ Neither the administration nor the telecoms need apologize for actions that most people , except for the ACLU and trial lawyers , understand were constitutional and appropriate in the wake of the attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 , ” Holtz - Eakin wrote in describing McCain ’s position .
Article II Powers Holtz - Eakin further cited Article II powers of the Constitution in explaining how McCain would act as President , suggesting that McCain – like Bush – would exercise virtually unlimited executive powers for the duration of the indefinite “ war on terror . ”
McCain also has announced that he would appoint Supreme Court justices like Samuel Alito and John Roberts who – along with Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas – represent four votes in favor of reinterpreting the Constitution to grant the President the broad powers claimed by Bush and McCain .
If a President McCain gets to replace one of the five other justices with another Alito or Roberts , the new court majority could , in effect , rewrite the rules of the American Republic to declare the imperial presidency “ constitutional . ”
If that happens , the American people would no longer possess “ unalienable rights , ” as promised by the Founders and enshrined in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
The President would possess what the neocons call “ plenary ” – or total – power .
That means the President would have the authority to arrest anyone as an “ unlawful enemy combatant , ” deny the person the right to a lawyer or a trial by jury , and subject the individual to any treatment that the President sees fit , from indefinite imprisonment up to torture and death .
This neocon vision also holds that the President – on his own authority – could take the nation to war anywhere in the world for whatever reason .
In essence , the United States would cease to be a democratic Republic with citizens guaranteed fundamental liberties and with an Executive possessing limited authority constrained by the Legislature .
All meaningful power would be invested in the President as a modern - day monarch .
John McCain may criticize President Bush on the edges of neoconservative policies , such as failing to prosecute the Iraq
War more aggressively , and he may differ with Bush on the efficacy of torture , given McCain ’s own mistreatment as a Vietnam prisoner of war .
But there should be no doubt that a McCain victory would give the neocons another four - year lease on the White House .
And , after those four years , there might be no feasible way back for the great American Republic .

In two relatively easy steps I will show you how you can integrate Delicious bookmarks into your sites .
A little HTML and JavaScript knowledge is useful .
If you have questions , feel free to leave a comment or mail me .
First take a look at my improved prototype site : Recipebook 2.0 .
The grid featuring recipes is what we ’ll be creating in this post .
Previous coverage of the site ’s architecture can be found here .
Time required : about an hour if you want to try and experiment
As I mentioned , the whole process involves 2 steps :
Getting the data Displaying the data
There are many ways to do both , so I encourage experimentation .
Step 1 . Getting the data
The data we want is a list of recipes stored as delicious bookmarks .
You can find the “ normal ” delicious page with my recipes right here .
To use this data inside an Ext application , we use the Ext.data package whose usage is shown in the image above .
Do n’t panic just yet , it looks complicated , but it really is n’t .
The store needs 2 components , firstly a proxy to get the data from the Internet and secondly , a reader that knows how the data is structured , and can parse it .
For this the reader needs a record definition .
All of this , boils down to only a few lines of code :
deliciousStore = new Ext.data .
Store ( { proxy : new Ext.data.ScriptTagProxy ( { url : ' http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/json/pbackx/recipes' } ) , reader : new Ext.data.JsonReader ( { } , Ext.data.Record.create ( [ { name : ' url ' , mapping : 'u' } , { name : ' title ' , mapping : ' d ' } , { name : ' description ' , mapping : ' n'} ] ) ) } ) ;
A few things worth noticing :
The ScriptTagProxy is used .
This is important because this avoids cross domain warnings in your application .
This is a long subject , so I ’m keeping this for later , or you can Google it yourself .
Basically if you plan to use any URLs that are not withing your own domain ( in this case I use delicious.com from recipebook20.com ) , you need a ScriptTagProxy .
I build the URL based on the Delicious feed page .
It will get the first 15 bookmarks from user “ pbackx ” ( me ) with tag “ recipes ” and return it in the JSON format .
The reader is a JsonReader , exactly because the format downloaded from Delicious is JSON .
The record contains the mappings .
I figured this out by entering the URL in a browser and looking at the output .
It ’s not the most beautiful code in there , but it is pretty straightforward to figure it out .
I mapped the fairly nonsensical name “ u ” , “ d ” , and “ n ” onto “ url ” , “ title ” , and “ description ” .
If I use the store in my application , I can use the much more meaningful versions .
Now it ’s just a matter of calling
deliciousStore.load ( )
to get all the data into your application .
Step 2 .
Using the data .
Once you got data in a store , there are many things to do with it , here I ’ll show you how to get it in a GridPanel .
Here is a simplified version of the GridPanel I use :
recipesGrid = new Ext.grid .
GridPanel ( { height:300 , width:300 , title : ' recipes ' , store : deliciousStore , cm : new Ext.grid.ColumnModel ( [ { header : ' Link ' , dataIndex : 'url ' , } , { header : ' Recipe name ' , dataIndex : ' title ' , } ] ) } ) ; recipesGrid.render (' recipeContent ' ) ;
When this piece of code is executed , it will create a GridPanel that uses the store we defined as its datasource .
There are 2 columns , one showing the URL and another the title ( the mapping was also defined in the store ) .
Obviously there are many parameters to tweak the display , but I will leave that up to you .
See it in action .
If you want to watch all this in action , I suggest you install Firefox and the Firebug extension .
Open the Firebug display and go to recipebook 20.com .
The tabs with interesting information are “ Net ” , where you will see exactly which Delicious feeds are loaded and “ Script ” , which allows you to look at the full JavaScript code .
If you want to get started from a blank slate , here ’s a zip file with only the code that was discussed in this post .
This file does not include the Ext library , you will have to download that one yourself on the Ext site and you might need to adapt the path in the index.html to get it to work .
Happy experimenting .
JOHANNESBURG  President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai struck a power - sharing deal on Thursday after more than a month of wrangling , but it was still far from clear how the bitter foes would divide the authority to govern .
The agreement , brokered by President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa , signals that Mr. Mugabe may be willing to cede some authority to Mr. Tsvangirai , loosening the tight grip on power he has maintained for nearly three decades and easing the political crisis that has engulfed Zimbabwe for months .
They did not spell out how the deal would work , but Mr. Mbeki said the details of the agreement would be released Monday at a signing ceremony .
Officials in both the governing and opposition parties described an arrangement that seemed to leave neither man clearly in charge .
That may reduce the chances that the accord will bring stability and attract the foreign aid needed to rebuild the country ’s ruined economy .
Under the agreement , officials said , Mr. Tsvangirai would become prime minister and oversee a council of ministers that would formulate and carry out policies .
Mr. Mugabe would retain his title of president and would lead a cabinet of the ministers that would supervise the council .
That arrangement appears to give both men the power to oversee the same group of ministers .
Confessions of a troubled secularist by Shiv Visvanathan “ If Muslims insist on speaking
exclusively for Muslims
and do not recognize Bodo
suffering then theirs is an
ethnic of narcissism ”
This is an essay on secularism and the Indian Muslim .
And I must admit the
recent events have made this a difficult piece to write .
Let me begin
at the beginning .
I was born in Jamshedpur where I saw riot after riot triggered in urban
areas .
I still remember the day in school when my classmate Obidul Islam
came to say goodbye .
He told me sadly that his family was going
back to Pakistan .
Obidul was a brilliant 100 - metre runner and I
am still unsuccessfully racing against him .
As I grew older and watched the Mumbai 1992 riots and the Gujarat carnage of 2002 , I saw with sadness how for the majority community , democracy tasted like castor oil , good for health but difficult to consume .
While studying the Gujarat violence I saw how the community of Muslim survivors built a new citizenship around a community of law .
I heard Mr Bandukwala , once professor of physics at Baroda University , tell the Hindus that even if you do not apologise I forgive you .
Listening to all this I wondered what secularism meant .

Listening for the concern behind the complaint Acclaimed educationist and activist Hemlata Prabhu was the general secretary of the People 's Union for Civil Liberties 's Rajasthan unit from 1983 to 1997 and its president in 1997 - 1998 .
On April 23 , Rajni Bakshi , author and journalist , delivered the 5th annual Hemlata Prabhu Memorial Lecture in Jaipur .
The following is a translated transcription of the lecture :
You are alive
Believe in the triumph of life
If there is a heaven anywhere bring it down to earth .
This verse conveys the resolve , the energy and faith that Hemlata Prabhu embodied .
It is the fragrance and effervescent colours of these qualities that form the essence of this gathering in Miss Prabhu 's honour .
In the late 1980s and early 1990s I had the privilege of being involved in various political campaigns where Miss Prabhu was at the helm .
When Rajiv Gandhi's government gave into pressure from orthodox Muslim groups and amended the law to deny divorced Muslim women the right to claim maintenance from their ex-husbands -- we protested against this as a violation of the letter and spirit of the Indian Constitution .
When a young women named Roop Kanwar was burnt on her dead husband 's pyre in the village of Deorala we protested against this crime and those who sought to glorify sati .
In 1990 as the Ram Janambhoomi campaign began to gather momentum across Rajasthan Miss Prabhu led our motley group of human rights activists in a campaign to advocate communal harmony .
But looking back I realise that the biggest gift I got from Miss Prabhu was how she defined and celebrated a term that has now become fraught with controversy -- azaadi ( freedom ) .
I have vivid memories of the depth of feeling with which she recalled her memories of 15th August 1947 : ' Ah , what a joy it was to be young and celebrate the joy of and passion for freedom ! '
When she said this Miss Prabhu was not just feeling proud of liberation from British rule she was revelling in the promise of azaadi as a harbinger of a society based on equality , justice and compassion .
She inspired us to see India 's Independence not as a moment in history but as a dimension of our collective consciousness -- as an ongoing resolve , as the basis for a ceaseless striving .
So what now , in 2016 , is the challenge for all those who cherish this liberal resolve and are committed to living by it ?
How should we live in a time of increasingly bitter polarisation -- of Hindutva versus Secular -- or at times violently competitive notions of nationalism ?
Citizens for Peace , a small Mumbai - based group of which I am a trustee , have been pondering these questions for over ten years .
Our quest for answers has led us to initiate dialogues with people from diverse backgrounds -- scholars as well as activists representing religious and caste - based groups as well as different political orientations .
These interactions have taught us that direct confrontation between opposing views does not resolve conflicts .
But a different and fruitful chemistry comes into play when there is a willingness to look for and listen to the concern behind our opponent 's complaint .
On the face of it , this may seem absurd .
You could say that listening for the anxiety and fears behind the hate and anger that led to the murder of anti-superstition activist Narendra Dabholkar in 2013 would not have saved his life .
This seems even more starkly true in relation to the exhibitionist brutality of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and other terrorist groups .
Yes , there do seem to be groups and individuals whose worldview and actions are driven by hatred so severe that nothing less than obliterating the ' other ' will satisfy them .
But as Vinoba
Bhave often said such people tend to be a miniscule minority at one far end of the spectrum of humanity .
At the opposite end are mystics and saints -- Buddha , Jesus , Kabir , Gandhi .
The overwhelming majority of human beings fall in the middle of this spectrum and tend to be swayed towards either pole -- depending on the circumstances and mental climate of their times .
It is within this vast majority that listening for the concern behind the complaint can work wonders .
We live in a time when hideous anger easily flares up , particularly on identity - related issues .
This happens not just on social media and television shows designed as spectacle but within families , at work - places , among friends .
Often advocates of harmony and compassion fall victim to the same anger and end up hating the ' haters ' !
This changes the moment we are able to turn the slanging match into a conversation .
Our limited experience in Citizens for Peace has shown that this begins to happen the moment you ask the other person what is really bothering them , what is it that they really fear .
More often than not you may find that there is agreement on a fundamental truth -- respect for the life and dignity of all .
Even when this elementary humanism gets obscured and people in our lives seem in the grip of hatred this state may be a temporary phase .
It can not remain a permanent state if empathic listening nurtures spaces that are more inviting and healing .
Anger and hatred are draining , sapping emotions and ideologies based on them are inevitably degenerative .
The strongest way of celebrating Miss Prabhu 's definition of azaadi as equality and dignity for all is to constantly remember that this way lies joy and a fulfilling life .

Growth or Secularism : A False Choice
In the final lap of the Lok Sabha election campaign many contenders and political commentators are claiming that voters have to choose between growth and secularism .
This is a false claim .
Why then , does the idea of a stark ‘ choice ’ between economic growth or secularism appear to be so compelling to a wide range of people ?
Firstly , the idea of growth and its mechanics are not closely examined .
Secondly , it is assumed that a more decisive and forceful Prime Minister will work an economic miracle .
Thirdly , therefore it is worthwhile to compromise on secularism which many view as being a sham in any case .
To further complicate the matter , growth is seen as something tangible while secularism is treated as a fussy idea , or worse a political ploy , cynically deployed by both BJP and Congress .
How then might voters resolve their polling day dilemma ?
First and foremost it is vital to be clear that growth vs. secularism is a decoy .
What is actually at stake is the core principle of a truly democratic polity –namely , the primacy of foundational principles and values over the mechanics of how goods , services and livelihoods are generated .
This is why Mahatma Gandhi repeatedly emphasized that true swaraj depends on each person , and society as a whole , honoring ‘ dharma ’ .
By using the term dharma Gandhi was not referring to a particular religion or sect but to the philosophical and moral markers which show us the path of righteousness – the basis of a society worth living in .
If that sounds too lofty we can just focus on the key markers of right action as enshrined in the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India .
Article 15 ( 1 ) makes it incumbent on the State to be religion neutral .
This article prohibits the State from discriminating against any citizen on grounds of religion , race , caste , sex or place of birth .
Even more importantly , section two of the same article implies that citizens cannot deny each other access to public spaces on grounds of religion , race , caste , sex , place of birth .
In its most elementary form , this is what secularism means .
This text book truth needs to be highlighted because over the past three decades secularism has come to be seen as a political ploy .
Political parties of various hues have , from time to time , failed to be ‘ dharmanirpeksha ’ or religion neutral .
At the level of everyday life citizens have in many cases rejected and violated the value of creative co-existence of different faiths or ‘ sarva dharma sambhav ’ .
These inadequacies or failures do not undermine the soundness of the principle and the need to keep striving for a secular polity .
It is being suggested that India is now in such dire straits that as an emergency measure economic imperatives must be given priority over foundational principles of society .
This argument is profoundly flawed .
Since the late 1980s it has been widely acknowledged that GNP growth by itself is not a valid measure of a nation ’s material or social well being .
Even the promise of ‘ inclusive growth ’ can be a chimera since higher incomes do not necessarily lead to higher quality of life in terms of improved housing , education , health care and leisure time .
Even as a means to an end growth is important only if it is defined and measured in terms which include not just monetized goods and services but also sustainability of both nature ’s eco-systems and the social fabric .
The worthwhile goal is economic democracy not growth per say .
At the very least economic democracy is about fair and open access to social facilities and productive resources .
But above all , it is about the promise of dignity for all – the promise enshrined in Article 15 .
An economy can grow exponentially with vast concentrations of power which may increase jobs but actually dis-empower the overwhelming majority because a handful of people call the shots in both the economic and political sphere .
There are complicated structural flaws that are preventing Indian society and economy from the goal of ‘ sarvodaya ’ , well - being for all .
Let us be wary of tall claims that a decisive leader can provide a quick fix .
Like much of life elections do n’t offer easy or ideal choices .
Voters in many constituencies may find that there is no candidate on their ballot paper whom they can fully trust .
But here is a litmus test for choosing between competing imperfection .
Reject any candidate or party that gives primacy to expediency over foundational principles – such as asking you to put growth above secularism .
Instead , let us go to the polling stations with the conviction that we can only build a sustained prosperity on the sound principle of equal respect for all and dignity for all regardless of caste , religion , language or regional affinity .

APPEAL TO INDIAN VOTERS Dear Fellow - Indians ,
The best thing about our country is its cultural diversity , its
pluralism – the co-existence of a number of religions and ethnicities
over centuries , and hence the blooming of multiple streams of intellectual
and artistic thought .
And , this has been possible only because Indian societ
yhas prided itself on being essentially secular in character , rejecting
communal hatred , embracing tolerance .
Today , that very sense of India is vulnerable .
The need of the hour is to
protect our country ’s secular foundation .
Undoubtedly , corruption
and governance are important issues , but we will have to vigilantly work
out ways of holding our government accountable to that .
However , one thing is clear : India 's secular character is not negotiable !
Not now , not ever .
As Indian citizens who love our motherland , we appeal to you to vote for
the secular party , which is most likely to win in your constituency .
Jai Hind !

Why I wo n't vote BJP - by Dilip D'Souza
The pity is , I actually think our constituency has a good politician
from the BJP .
If he ever runs for parliament , my opinion of him , by
itself , would tempt me to vote for him .
Yet I cannot forget : he is
from the BJP .
Much as I 'm also tempted by the logic that we must
sometimes look at the candidate and not the party , I know this like
the back of my hand : I will not vote for this party .
The pity is , too , that any party that presides over the plethora of
scams of the last few years deserves no less than to be flung out of
power .
I mean the Congress , of course .
And even so , I wo n't vote BJP .
They have done too much to turn away
too many people like me .
Perhaps they do n't care , but that 's the way
it is .
To start , there 's the obsession with the Ram temple .
Every time we
hear that times have changed and young Indians are n't interested in
this tired old nag of an issue , somebody in the BJP will announce that
building that temple is on their agenda .
Whether India is afflicted
with scams , or still widespread poverty , or poor primary education --
whatever it is , the BJP returns , every time , to that lazy way to ask
for votes : champion the Ram temple .
Sure enough , it appears in their
newest manifesto too .
If you had to judge solely from the several
decades that the BJP has demanded it -- luckily , you do n't -- this
temple is this country 's highest priority .
It must take singularly
warped minds to hold tight to this warped vision for India for so
long .
On from there is the way the BJP and fans label anyone remotely
critical as " anti-Hindu " .
A good example is a " List of Anti-Hindu
Personalities and their intricate connections " that 's made the rounds
for years .
( Full disclosure : I 'm on the list ) .
This marvel of
convoluted paranoia and illogic would be laughable if so many people
did n't appear to take it so seriously .
Like : Among many places you'll
find it on the web is LK Advani 's own site , lkadvani.in , where it has
resided since before our previous Lok Sabha election .
I know why these lists are made .
" Anti-Hindu " is a surer way to get
people 's bile up , after all , than a mere " anti-BJP " .
( Similar are the
labels " Pakistani agent " , " Italian origin " etc ) .
It 's also a lazy way
to argue , used when bereft of anything more substantial .
And in this
case , it 's hilarious to note that also on the list are the relatively
recent BJP inductees Udit Raj and Subramanian Swamy .
" Anti-Hindu
Personalities " : that 's you , kind sirs .
On from there ... I could go on , with plenty more reasons not to vote
BJP .
Among them , their unwillingness to see justice done for horrific
crimes .
Above all , though , I believe their politics demean India .
I believe we have the people , the talents and the passions in this
country to take on the world .
But the BJP chooses instead to
systematically turn Indian against Indian .
This applies to the
" anti- Hindu " label , it applies to the lies and suspicion directed at
critics , it applies to episodes of murderous violence left to fester .
For me , all this is unforgivable .
And when you call them on it , the BJP 's supporters have only this
particularly brainless response : " But the Congress also does crappy
things . "
Well yes , it does .
In fact , crappiness from the Congress was the
reason this country grew repulsed by that party in the first place .
But when they came to power , the BJP turned out to be no different ,
and in many ways even worse .
( To my knowledge , not even the Congress
holds on to lists of " Anti-Hindu Personalities . " )
That 's where plenty of us are today : left with no national political
alternative to choose from .
I 'm talking about the plenty of us who
live ordinary Indian lives , pay our Indian taxes , obey Indian laws .
I
mean Indians who care what kinds of lives our fellow Indians --
indeed , our fellow humans -- live , because it's as simple as John
Donne once explained : no man is an island and any man 's suffering
diminishes us all .
I mean Indians who want to see India wise , strong
and compassionate , a force for good on a violent , fractured planet .
Our great dilemma is that on fundamental counts like these , our two
major political parties have failed us .
I wo n't shy away from the challenge this dilemma poses , for when I
head for the voting booth .
But it does also leave me with this
certainty : I wo n't vote for the BJP .
Japan ( TGW ) – Scientists at Kyushu University in Japan have come up with a solution to Japan ’s energy and food problems : massive floating generators .
200,000 hexagonal photovoltaic generators and wind turbines on the floating “ eco-rigs ” , which measure 1.2 miles by 0.5 miles , would produce about 300 megawatt hours of power .
Some of that power would be lost in transporting the power back to shore , but by strapping three of the rigs together , the effect would be the same as a standard nuclear power plant .
Some of the energy from the solar cells and wind generators would be diverted to power LEDs on the bottom of the rigs .
The lights would turn the platform into a nursery for a specially selected type of seaweed that absorbs carbon dioxide and feeds fish and plankton .
The eco-rigs will be unmanned and automatic .
The first rigs are expected to be ready three years from now .

What Is Laser Engraving ?
A Tech Guide on the Key Things to Know
The word laser breeds excitement .
It ’s just human nature .
Thanks to advancements in technology , lasers have a more practical use .
Because of this , laser engraving is growing in popularity .
Use among craftsmen and a generation of do - it - yourselfers has only increased because of accessibility .
Laser engravers can help you create some unique projects .
It may seem scary at first , but understanding the definition of laser engraving leads to a less intimidating process .
Before you work with a laser engraving machine , you should learn more .
Understand the difference between engraving , marking , and etching .
Each has its own function and process .
Here we ’ll walk you through the ins and outs of laser engraving .
So without further ado , let ’s begin .
What is a Laser ?
For those who do n’t know , the word laser is an acronym .
Laser stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation .
This may come as a shock to you , but let ’s explain .
A laser works by way of electricity that drives light amplification .
As energy passes through specialized material , atoms begin to bounce around .
The atoms then discharge and release extra energy that results in light .
This light material is called photons .
It ’s concentrated by mirrors inside the equipment to shoot a beam of light or as you know it , a laser .
The laser you ’d use for engraving is a lot different than the one you ’d get your cat to chase .
A high - powered laser will burn the surface of an item .
Engravers are hooked up to additional technology that calibrates the temperature of the photons and guides the laser .
This provides a focused beam that ’s easy to engrave with .
Understand Laser Engraving
Engraving is an aggressive method of laser use .
It creates intricate “ cuts ” on different materials ( usually metals , silver , gold , platinum , etc. ) for visual pleasure .
The laser is used to melt the surface of the material and change its roughness .
The laser changes that solid to a gas , skipping the step of a liquid altogether .
The energy needed to reach a vaporization temperature makes an engraver very powerful .
Jewelry is the most popular item to have engraved .
Wedding rings , watches , pendants , but almost anything can be engraved .
So how do you get different types of engravings ?
The depth of the laser depends on the controller .
The power that drives the machine along with the number of passes can create different designs .
Each item you ’re engraving has a specific depth it should be engraved at .
Some shallow and others deep .
Engraving depends on the design .
Using a Laser Engraver Machine
When you ’re using a laser engraver you have a few steps to follow :
Consider a Design – Before you engrave anything , take the time to consider the design .
Laser engraving is permanent .
You ’ll want to practice and think out your future engraving beforehand so you can avoid mistakes .
Creation Phase –
Now that you ’ve found some inspiration , you need to design your image or text .
Designing can be done with a computer program to ensure the laser engraver does the job right .
Most engraving machines come with their own software , but you might need to use other forms like Adobe Illustrator .
Decide on Settings –
The settings you choose will control the laser ’s strength , depth of cut , speed , passes , line thickness , and other important information .
You should mess around with the settings a few times on scrap material to get the design you want .
Start – Engraving can be as easy as pressing start .
Once you ’ve sorted out the nitty - gritty , pressing a button will start the process if you ’re using a machine .
Remove and Observe – Once the piece is done being engraved you can remove it from the machine .
If you ’ve left anything out , make a design that solves the issue .
Rise , wash , repeat .
Laser engraving is simple as long as you follow these steps .
Now that you ‘ve mastered this process , you can get into the fun additives of engraving .
Color Creation
The color you ’re creating has everything to do with the material being engraved .
Certain materials react with high - energy laser light on a chemical level .
Production of color is n’t the scientific answer .
Burning and stripping away layers of the material is what gives way to specific colors .
If you ’re considering aluminum , the oxidation properties actually turn the material white .
This is n’t the case when you ’re engraving other materials .
Adding color takes additional techniques .
The use of foils and powdered dyes can introduce color to a material when engraving a logo .
These are spread overtop of the engraving and passed over once again making them permanent .
What ’s the Difference ?
When it comes to etching , engraving , and marking , there are some evident differences .
You know what engraving is so let ’s focus on the other two laser uses .
Marking is done by operating a lower - powered laser .
This laser creates high - contrast marking on a surface but does n’t alter the surface as significantly as engraving .
The surface will be discolored but left alone as far as composition .
Etching uses a high - heat laser but is the opposite of engraving .
This laser actually melts the layer of the material , expands it , and then raises .
Etching melts the first thousandth of an inch of the surface of your material creating an embossed design .
More to Learn
Technological advancements make laser engraving possible .
The information on the internet that is at your disposal is endless .
Laser engraving can be as detailed and intricate as you want it to be .
By now you should see how easy it is to use a laser engraver , the only steps left are to try it yourself .
Give it some time and remember , practice makes perfect .

It used to be that the smart kids went to graduate school .
But today , the workplace is different , and it might be that only the desperate kids go to graduate school .
Today there are new rules , and new standards for success .
And for most people , graduate school is the path to nowhere .
Here are seven reasons why :
1. Graduate school is an extreme investment for a fluid workplace .
If you are graduating from college today , you will change careers about five times over the course of your life .
So going to graduate school for four years — investing maybe $ 80,000 — is probably over - investing in one of those careers .
If you stayed in one career for your whole life , the idea is more reasonable .
But we do n’t do that anymore , so graduate school needs to change before it is reasonable again .
2. Graduate school is no longer a ticket to play .
It used to be that you could n’t go into business without an MBA .
But recently , the only reason you need an MBA is to climb a corporate ladder .
And , as Paul Graham says , “ corporate ladders are obsolete . ”
That ’s because if you try to climb one , you are likely to lose your footing due to downsizing , layoffs , de-equitization , or lack of respect for your personal life .
So imagine where you want to go , and notice all the people who got there already without having an MBA .
Because you can do that , too , in a wide range of fields , including finance .
3. Graduate school requires you to know what will make you happy before you try it .
But we are notoriously bad at knowing what will make us happy .
The positive psychology movement has shown us that our brains are actually fine - tuned to trick us into thinking we know about our own happiness .
And then we make mistakes .
So the best route to happiness is one of trial and error .
Otherwise , you could over - commit to a terrible path .
For example , today most lawyers do not like being lawyers : more than 55 % of members of the American Bar Association say they would not recommend getting a law degree today .
4. Graduate degrees shut doors rather than open them .
You better be really certain you know what you ’re going to do with that degree because you ’re going to need to earn a lot of money to pay it back .
Law school opens doors only to careers that pay enough to repay your loans .
Likewise , your loan payments from an MBA program mean that you cannot have a scrappy start - up without starving .
Medical school opens doors to careers with such bad work - life balance that the most popular specialty right now is ophthalmology because it has good hours .
5 . If you do n’t actually use your graduate degree , you look unemployable .
Let ’s say you spend years in graduate school ( and maybe boatloads of money ) , but then you do n’t work in that field .
Instead , you start applying for jobs that are , at best , only tangentially related .
What it looks like is that you are asking people to give you a job even though you did n’t really want to be doing that job .
You wanted another job but you could n’t get it .
No employer likes to hire from the reject pile , and no employer wants to be second choice .
6. Graduate school is an extension of childhood .
Thomas Benton , columnist at the Chronicle of Higher Education , says that some students are addicted to the immediate feedback and constant praise teachers give , but the work world does n’t provide that .
Also , kids know how to do what teachers assign .
But they have little idea of how to create their own assignments — which is what adult life is , really .
So Benton says students go back to school more for comfort than because they have a clear idea of what they want to do with their life .
7 . Early adult life is best if you are lost .
It used to be that you graduated from college and got on a path .
The smart kids got themselves on a safe path fast .
Today there are no more safe paths , there is only emerging adulthood , where you have to figure out who you are and where you fit , and the quarter - life crisis , which is a premature midlife crisis that comes when people try to skip over the being lost part of early adult life .
Being lost is a great path for today ’s graduates .
And for most people , graduate school undermines that process with very little reward at the end .
Dan Ariely , economist at MIT , found that when people have a complicated choice to make — and there is a default choice — they pick the default nearly every time .
So if your parents or friends went to graduate school , you are likely to do the same , not because it ’s good for you personally , but because choosing the alternatives seem more difficult .
But making exactly that kind of difficult choice is what your early adult life is all about .
So do n’t skip it .

LANCASTER —
A woman was ordered to serve three days in jail after a judge found her in contempt of court for inappropriate dress .
Kirstie Arnold , 28 , of Lancaster , was sent to the Boyle County Jail after wearing short shorts during a court appearance Monday before Garrard District Judge Janet Booth .
Booth had warned Arnold about her clothes in two previous court appearances , and in the last appearance had fined Arnold $ 50 for her attire .
A court videotape of Monday ’s proceeding contains the following exchange :
“ Why should n’t I put you in jail for contempt today ? ” Booth asked .
“ I told you twice . ”
“ I ’m sorry , ” Arnold said .
“ No , you ’re not , ” Booth said .
“ I told you twice .
I even fined you for being in contempt .
Why should n’t I throw you in jail today ?
You apparently do n’t care about the court ’s orders .
“ I forgot , ” Arnold said .
“ How could you forget ? ” Booth said .
“ No , seriously , how could you forget ?
It ’s a complete disregard of court order .
Complete .
You should go to jail today , and you ’re going . ”
“ Well , next time I wo n’t wear shorts , ” Arnold said .
“ I bet you won’t , ” Booth said .
And with that , Booth ordered her to serve three days of temporary detention “ for disregard and disrespect for court proceedings . ”
Arnold went to the Boyle County jail because the Lincoln County jail , which normally holds Garrard prisoners , had no room for her .
She declined to be interviewed Thursday .
Booth could not be reached immediately for comment .
Arnold would have been released Thursday except that she got into more trouble when she allegedly tried to conceal a drug from Lancaster Police Officer Allen Weston .
Court records say that Arnold moved Suboxone , a drug for treatment of opiate addiction , from her purse into her pocket .
She was then charged with possession of a controlled substance , tampering with physical evidence , possession of drug paraphernalia , and having a controlled substance not in its original container .
The new charges against Arnold are in addition to pending charges of harassment , criminal trespass and leaving the scene of an accident .
The last charge came after she allegedly knocked over a tombstone in a Lancaster cemetery with a vehicle and left , according to court records .
Arnold remained in the Boyle jail Thursday afternoon , but bond information was not available .
Arnold ’s next court appearance is scheduled for Monday in Garrard District Court .
If she is still an inmate at that time , she will wear a bright yellow jail uniform .

Friendships Can Depend on Who You Meet First
I vividly remember my first day at University when I was 18 - years - old : not just the terror and the excitement but also the sheer , crushing weight of people I did n’t know , and who did n’t know me .
Of course everyone was in the same boat and it was n’t long before I had made new friends .
When I think back , one of my firmest friends was a guy I met at the introductory session of my course on the very first day .
I wonder if there is something special about the very first people we meet in new social surroundings ?
Perhaps we are so relieved to find someone to talk to – an island of acceptance in a sea of strangers – that we are more likely to form a lasting bond .
Or perhaps I ’m making too much of it ; after all , at a new job , club or society we ’ll probably get to meet everyone eventually .
Surely the person we just happen to meet first should n’t be more likely to become a firm friend in the long run ?
Nerve - wracking first day
It ’s this question that Dr. Mitja Back and colleagues from the University of Leipzig investigated in a new study to be published in Psychological Science ( Back , Schmukle & Egloff , 2008 ) .
To find out they subjected brand new psychology students to a nerve - wracking first day .
At their introductory session each student was told to sit in a random seat .
Then each trembling newbie had to come up to the front and briefly introduce themselves .
Immediately afterwards everyone else rated that person on two scales : how much they liked them and whether they would like to get to know them more ( sounds frightening for your first day ! ) .
The results showed that people liked – and wanted to be friends with – the people who were initially sat next to them .
This might not be that surprising : people have had slightly more exposure to those who they were sitting next to .
Or people might have felt a certain affinity for those they were sat near …
One year later
Fast - forward one year .
The students are well settled into the course , have probably mixed extensively and now know each other much better .
Surely that day one year ago when the lecturer tortured them with random seat allocations , public introductions and instant judgements can’t still have an effect , can it ?
It absolutely did .
Even after one year students who sat on the same row as each other on that very first day liked each other better than people who sat nowhere near each other .
For those who sat right next to each other the level of liking was even higher .
This study suggests that in a new social situation it really does matter who you happen to meet first .
So , when meeting a new bunch of people , be careful who you approach first , or who you are approached by : you could be stuck with them for a long time !

Mark Dery / AlterNet | July 10 , 2008
Scott McClellan is having a “ Matrix ” moment — the moment when you wake up , with a jolt , from the reassuring fictions of the media dreamworld to the face - slapping reality of unspun fact .
Remember that scene in “ The Matrix ” where Laurence Fishburne parts the veil of illusion — the computer - generated simulation humanity experiences as everyday reality — to reveal the movie ’s post - apocalyptic world for the irradiated slag heap it really is ?
Like that .
“ Welcome to the Desert of the Real , ” he tells Keanu Reeves , a riff on the postmodern philosopher Jean Baudrillard ’s pronouncement , in his book Simulations , that we live in a “ desert of the real ” — an ever - more - virtual reality where firsthand experience and empirical truth are being displaced by media fictions .
He offers an example tailor - made for the Bush presidency : “ Propaganda and advertising fuse in the same marketing and merchandising of objects and ideologies . ”
This , in a word , is life inside the Bush administration ’s Ministry of Truth , as described by McClellan in What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington ’s Culture of Deception .
In his frag ’em - and - run memoir , the former White House press secretary — whose Secret Service code name , I kid you not , was “ Matrix ” — recounts how he and the rest of Team Dubya got caught up in the “ permanent campaign , ” a nonstop propaganda war whose tactical weapons were “ the manipulation of shades of truth , partial truths , twisting of the truth , and spin , ” and whose goal was to stage - manage the media narrative and thus public opinion .
Now that McClellan has broken free from what he calls the “ Washington bubble , ” he can see the “ massive marketing campaign ” ( his words , my italics ) to sell the war in Iraq for the steaming heap of dookie it was : a PR operation characterized by a , er , “ lack of candor and honesty , ” as the author so masterfully understates it , having just told us that the administration dropped the trap on chief economic adviser Larry Lindsey for telling the Wall Street Journal that Bush ’s war would likely cost between $ 100 billion and $ 200 billion — a fatal misspeak at a moment when “ talking about the projected cost of a potential war was n’t part of the script . ”
Neither was talking about “ possible unpleasant consequences ” ( the choice of adjective is sheer virtuosity , like a grace note in a Paganini caprice ) ; “ casualties , economic effects , geopolitical risks , diplomatic repercussions , ” and other buzz - killers might jeopardize what advertisers call the “ supportive atmosphere ” that puts consumers in that impulse - buying mood — in this instance , buying the dubious case for war from a president who famously prefers faith to facts , a president who listens to his gut .
Unfortunately , the trustworthy gurglings of the Bush gut were indistinguishable , in this case , from the offstage urgings of the neocons Colin Powell derided as “ fucking crazies . ”
What Happened is a dyspeptic mixture of born - again confessional and media culpa ; it ’s The Confessions of St. Augustine , as written by Michael Deaver .
Four sentences in , McClellan lets us know that today ’s homily will take as its text John 8:32 : “ And ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free . ”
Our pilgrim spends much of his progress bogged down in that Slough of Despond , Washington , D.C. , where even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night , like the “ fundamentally decent ” George W. Bush , can fall prey to the rancorously partisan , win- at - any - cost mindset of the Permanent Campaign Mentality .
Narrow is the gate and straight is the way , and lying in wait in the tall grass are the news media , whom McClellan somewhat redundantly insists on calling “ complicit enablers . ”
( Personally , I prefer the more precise Enabling Enablers Who Enable Too Much . )
The media oversimplify complex issues , batten on scandal , are “ too deferential ” to power ( yet another nail in the coffin of the liberal - media canard , not that it will stay buried ) , and focus on the horse - race aspects of politics rather than the weighty matters that furrow the American brow , between episodes of “ Flavor of Love . ”
The book ends with some halfhearted bromides , on loan from Billy Graham : “ Let the one who is without sin cast the first stone . ”
The organ swells , sobbingly .
“ It would be difficult if not impossible to find anyone who has lived in this destructive world of Washington … who is truly ‘ without sin . ' ”
All together now : “ A - maz-ing grace , how sweet the sound / That saved a wretch like me ! ”
Of course , the Winston Smith of the West Wing knows too well that , in a media age , “ shaping the narrative before it shapes you ” is how you win hearts and minds and , not incidentally , sell books .
Watching him stay relentlessly on message as he makes the talk show rounds , one can’t help but wonder :
Is the man still spinning ?
The White House and its flying monkeys in the right - wing blogosphere and over at Fox News think so :
They ’ve launched a counterspin offensive , Richard Clarke - ing him as a shameless prevaricator who will do anything to boost his book sales .
( It was ranked No. 1 on Amazon.com shortly after its release , although it had slipped to No. 52 as of this writing . )

Northampton council , which did not implement the Act during the past 12 months , said that it had used the legislation on five previous occasions to tackle dog fouling .
Councils have used the RIPA to recruit children for surveillance operations .
Dudley and County Durham exploited the Act to send children into shops with secret video and audio equipment to see whether they could buy cigarettes and alcohol .
Officials in Durham have mounted 60 RIPA investigations against these kinds of businesses in the past 12 months .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The FBI is investigating Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Lehman Brothers and AIG - and their executives - as part of a broad look into possible mortgage fraud , sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN Tuesday .
Two officials with knowledge of the FBI investigation into the mortgage crisis said " the investigation is all very preliminary " .
They said there is a lot of anger and people want someone held accountable .
Officials are looking into whether any criminal activity occurred , but the Bureau said the investigation will take some time .
They said the investigation is in the preliminary stages , and so far it is a broad look at the companies involved .
" From what I 've seen so far , I really do n't believe we 're going to find widespread fraud , " according to one of the officials .
They said they have to go where evidence and facts lead .
Just because an investigation has been opened does n't mean there will be charges .
At this point , the officials said they are not pursuing specific individuals at the four firms under investigation because these firms are facing serious financial problems and they need to find out if it's the result of criminal activity .
Again , the officials stressed this is going to be a long road .
" Do n't expect indictments tomorrow or next week or next month , " one of the officials told CNN .
FBI spokesman Special Agent Richard Kolko had no comment on that information , but said 26 firms are currently under investigation as part of the bureau 's mortgage fraud inquiry .
Earlier this month , FBI Director Robert Mueller told Congress that 1,400 individual real estate lenders , brokers and appraisers are now under investigation in addition to two dozen corporations .
" The FBI currently has 26 pending corporate fraud investigations involving subprime lenders , " Kolko said .
" As we have seen , this number can fluctuate over time ; however we do not discuss which companies may or may not be the subject of an investigation . "
Previously , CNN has reported that lender Countrywide and Atlanta - based homebuilder Beazer ( BZH ) - which dropped out of the mortgage business early this year - are part of the investigation .
The sources said the probes of Fannie ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) , Freddie ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) , Lehman ( LEH , Fortune 500 ) and AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) are believed to be in the early stages .
One source said the government would be " remiss " if it did n't look into what happened at these companies because of the financial problems they are involved in and the actions of individuals running them .
Lehman Brothers and Freddie Mac declined comment on the matter .
AIG spokesman Joseph Norton said , " We do n't have details about the FBI investigation .
Of course , we will cooperate with the FBI . "
The United States is in the midst of a spiraling economic crisis fueled largely by the housing market .
Earlier this decade , mortgage lenders relaxed restrictions on obtaining mortgages as home prices soared about 85 % from 1996 through 2006 in inflation - adjusted dollars , creating a bubble .
Then the bubble popped , and lenders - as well as mortgages - took the hit .
Last week , mortgage insurer AIG narrowly avoided bankruptcy when the federal government took 80 % of its equity in exchange for an $ 85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve while Lehman filed the largest bankruptcy in American history .
Earlier this month , the government took over mortgage giants Fannie and Freddie .
Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) bought Countrywide in July .
Beazer dropped its mortgage arm early this year after an internal investigation - prompted by a Charlotte Observer investigation - found " evidence that employees violated [ federal ] regulations ... back to at least 2000 . "
The company said it is cooperating with the federal investigation .
Other bank failures and takeovers have led to the Bush administration 's current proposal to spend $ 700 billion to shore up the financial markets .
The proposal is under consideration by Congress , where lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have balked at the proposal 's lack of oversight provisions , among other issues .
As the mortgage industry began to unravel , the FBI , with assistance from the IRS , launched a broad investigation into mortgage fraud .
In June , its Mortgage Fraud Task Force arrested more than 400 mortgage brokers , lenders , appraisers and other industry insiders who , it said , were responsible for more than $ 1 billion in losses .
Last month , a Mortgage Asset Research Institute ( MARI ) study found that the number of fraudulent loans issued during the first three months of 2008 skyrocketed 42 % compared with the same period in 2007 .
McCain raises cash while limited to public funds
WASHINGTON  Republican John McCain is asking donors to give far in excess of what they can contribute to him directly , even as he is limited to taking only public funds for the fall campaign .
McCain 's fundraising is legal because the money he is asking for does not come straight to him .
He is collecting funds for federal and state GOP committees that will aid his White House bid .
Donors can give a total of nearly $ 70,000 to these committees , far in excess of the $ 2,300 individuals can give directly to a candidate .
Barack Obama , meanwhile , also has agreements with the Democratic National Committee and 18 state parties to raise and spend money separately from his campaign .
Unlike McCain , who is limited to $ 84.1 million in public funds , Obama can raise and spend as much as he'd like because he opted not to take taxpayer money .
The use of these committees to raise money violates the spirit of campaign - finance laws aimed at curbing the clout of special interests , said Craig Holman of Public Citizen , a watchdog group .
McCain and Obama both have made reducing special interests a priority .
" The wealthy can still give a fortune to help pay for our next president , " Holman said .
McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said most of the money McCain is now raising would be used for voter mobilization .
" It 's important that the Republican get - out - the - vote effort has the adequate resources , and John McCain is committed to helping where he can , " he said .
Obama spokesman Nick Shapiro said the joint fundraising " is an ordinary process . "
He said Obama " has changed the way political campaigns are funded " by rejecting money from federal lobbyists .
McCain has lagged behind Obama in money , but the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) had a nearly 10 - to - 1 edge in cash on hand over its Democratic counterpart through June , campaign reports show .
The restriction on raising private money kicked in once McCain became his party 's nominee last week .
He can accept only $ 2,300 from individuals to pay for legal and accounting expenses .
The Arizona senator , however , appeared at a $ 4 million fundraiser Monday night in Chicago where donors gave anywhere from $ 1,000 to nearly $ 70,000 .
Most of the money was split among the RNC and state parties in the battleground states of Michigan , Missouri , Ohio and Pennsylvania , according to Bill Strong , who helped organize the event .
Contributors who gave at least $ 25,000 attended a private dinner with McCain .
Strong said enthusiasm among donors was high , partly because of vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin .
" We got unsolicited telephone calls from female executives in the Chicago area offering to contribute money , " he said .
" Fundraising has accelerated since the convention . "
Bounds said McCain would do more fundraising for the joint committees ; he could n't say how much .
Jan Baran , a top GOP ethics lawyer , said the joint fundraising is not unusual .
But he noted " there 's an irony there that Sen .
McCain is swearing off private money for his own campaign … but actively raising money for party organizations . "

Minn . -
Now that much of America is starting to pay closer attention to the presidential campaign - and with the race a virtual tie - Republicans have intensified their strategy to corral the undecided stragglers : reignite the culture wars .
This version wo n't be as explicit as conservative Pat Buchanan 's 1992 GOP convention call for a " cultural war " or even the 2004 race , where anti-gay marriage referendums drove cultural conservatives to the polls in 11 mostly swing states .
Instead , this battle will be fought under the cloak of the candidates ' personal biographies .
Using the GOP paintbrush , the race pits the " ex - POW war hero " and the " hockey mom " versus the Ivy League elitist and the career senator .
Their battlefield : small towns versus big cities ; talk radio versus mainstream media and the liberal blogs ; heartland versus " Eastern elites . "
" It is going to be fought in cities with populations between 50,000 and 100,000 residents , " said veteran GOP pollster Frank Luntz .
In battleground states like Michigan and Ohio , " instead of going to Detroit and Cleveland , you 're going to see them a lot more in the small towns . "
The GOP is crafting its narrative in the language of a sort of reverse snobbery .
On Thursday , Rep. Lynn Westmoreland , R - Ga. , called the Obamas - who were both educated at Ivy League schools - " members of an elitist class that thinks they 're uppity . "
Though Westmoreland , a white Republican who represents the Atlanta suburbs , said he did n't mean it in a racial sense , the term has its roots in the pre-Civil War South to describe blacks who spoke up for themselves .
Viewers saw the culture - war strategy blossom during last week 's GOP convention , as the Republicans rallied around Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , the party 's vice presidential nominee , after they felt the media was treating her harshly .
" She is from a small town , with small - town values , but that 's not good enough for those folks who are attacking her and her family , " said former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson .
When former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani sneered as he mocked Sen. Barack Obama 's post - college job as a " community organizer , " the hard - core conservatives inside the Xcel Center laughed at Giuliani 's joke with seemingly no punch line .
In case viewers watching on television did n't get the inference , Palin provided the context a few moments later .
Responding to criticism that the next biggest line of executive experience on her resume was mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , population 7,000 : " I guess a small - town mayor is sort of like a community organizer , " Palin said , " except that you have actual responsibilities . "
" I might add , " Palin continued , " that in small towns , we do n't quite know what to make of a candidate who lavishes praise on working people when they are listening , and then talks about how bitterly they cling to their religion and guns when those people are n't listening . "
' Community organizer '
In this war , " community organizer " is synonymous with working for a liberal nonprofit organization .
Apparently , Republicans have forgotten about how President George H.W. Bush 's call for a " thousand points of light " turned into the Hands On Network / Points of Light Foundation , which organizes volunteers to do charitable work .
" The culture wars are back on , baby , " said MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow , a liberal commentator whose " The Rachel Maddow Show " premieres on the cable network Monday .
" Sarah Palin 's speech was so hotly anticipated because so little was known about her .
Who would have thought that she would have got up there and start channeling Pat Buchanan 1992 ? "
The difference now , Maddow said , it " is sort of being done more self - consciously than it was then , " Maddow said .
" Then , the ascendant right wing was really looking to change America by steamrolling out of the country people who they felt like were anathema to their idea of American values .
Now , there is a more self - conscious sense that they are saying they want to do that so as to create a divide in the electorate that they can exploit for political gain . "
Republicans have christened Palin , a newcomer to the national political stage , to be their envoy to small - town America .
" When you 're in Fresno and something happens , it 's news in Fresno , " said longtime GOP strategist Ken Khachigian , who was an adviser to Thompson 's failed White House bid this year .
" But it 's not national news . "
Khachigian would know how to handle a surprise - and much - maligned - vice presidential pick .
In the 1988 presidential campaign , he was a top aide to Dan Quayle , who served as vice president under George H.W. Bush .
All news , all the time
But in this age , everybody with a cell phone camera is a journalist .
It will be hard to hide Palin in Ypsilanti , Mich. , or Lima , Ohio .
Any gaffe will be uploaded to the Internet within minutes .
Still , as part of its bash - the - media tactic , the McCain campaign already is showing signs that it 's going to keep her protected from tough questions from reporters , letting the glow of her acceptance speech burn for a while as she hits the road .
Senior campaign officials told the Atlantic.com that Palin wo n't be doing any interviews for a while outside of , perhaps , local press from Alaska .
None of this matters to the hard - core conservatives who greeted her like a rock star at the GOP convention last week and who are showing up at her early events on the campaign trail shouting " Sa-rah ! Sa-rah !
Sa-rah ! "
They loathe the media and love her hard line on abortion , which she opposes even if the woman is the victim of rape or incest .
And social conservatives approve of her conservative evangelical Christian church in Wasilla supporting a conference in nearby Anchorage that proposes to convert gays to heterosexuals through the power of prayer .
" She is tough , she is strong , she has an attitude that is needed in Washington , " said Matt Hayes , a 51 - year - old security consultant from Dallas who described her convention speech as " the best I 've ever heard .
...
She looks especially good when she 's contrasted with the elitists on the other side . "
But Mark Baldassare , president of the Public Policy Institute of California , said the culture - war rhetoric may disappear in a couple of weeks if the McCain campaign 's internal polling shows that it is n't connecting with swing voters .
" They were test - marketing a lot of concepts in ( Palin's ) speech , " Baldassare said .
" They were trying out an anti-Washington message , an anti-media message and an anti-Democratic message .
We 'll know more in a couple of weeks .
And we 'll also be able to tell a lot by how the Democrats respond . "

SCI -FI WRITER SUES BUSH : YOU GUYS STOLE MY END OF THE WORLD STORY
Satire by R J Shulman
OLD LYME , Connecticut  ( PTSD News ) Simon Le Bovier , a popular science fiction writer best known for The Village Idiot Chronicles , filed a lawsuit against the Bush administration for stealing the ideas from his book , Masters of the End Times .
 They not only stole the story , theyve put it into action . 
Le Bovier claims that a hacker broke into his computer in 1999 and stole the Masters manuscript .
He says he thought nothing of it at the time .
In the book , a madman gets a moron from a well connected political family elected president of the most powerful and benevolent nation on the planet
Thear , because he convinces people they need a leader they feel they could drink a beer with .
The madman runs things of course , because he picks himself as the vice president .
He gets the people to give up their freedom by staging a terrorist attack on a national symbol of its strength and warning them that their Constitutional freedoms are quaint and need to be scuttled if they want to win the war on terror .
The madman then launches several wars , declares martial law , suspends future elections and ultimately causes a life - ending nuclear war , all because he believes it will bring the return of a messiah who is the only being who can relieve the madman from his self - torture that has almost eaten away his mind .
Le Bovier says the book was eventually rejected by his publisher as being too unrealistic .
 But I look at what has happened to America , and the world and I see my book was the blueprint .
Le Bovier claims that he has recently traced the hacker to a site located in a bunker somewhere in Wyoming .
A spokesman from the White House said he is not familiar with the lawsuit but any similarities between the book and what has happened is a coincidence .

McCain Suspends Campaign
Pajamas Media ^ | September 24 , 2008 | Richard Miniter
Posted on by AJKauf
In a shrewd move , Senator McCain has just proposed delaying Fridays first presidential debate in order to convene a meeting with Obama , President Bush and other decision - makers from both parties to sort out the financial mess .
It makes McCain look engaged in solving the number one issue on the minds of Americans , right now .
It also presents a strategic problem for Obama ....

In other news , Obama says the debate is still on .
Perhaps the McCain campaign could sent Sarah Palin as a proxy to debate manboy Obama .
Let Sarah rip him a new one .

Why not just suspend the elections until this is sorted out ?
When Paulson and Bernanke tell us it is safe to come out , we can get back to that silly partsian game of “ Presidential Elections . ”
It ’s not like the newly elected President is going to get to do anything once all this power is handed to Paulson .
Since the Secretary of the Treasury will be in charge for the next two years anyway - according to the Bush proposal - let ’s just postpone them until 2010 .
By then , McCain may be dead and we can just elect Palin .

It most certainly is an example of " Country First . "

It 's not a shrewd move .
He 's a member of the Senate and this is a critical matter which will effect our country .
McCain believes in " Duty First " .
His whole life tells us that .
As usual , Obama goes into the shadows .
He 's thinking like Shakespeare .... something bad behind every door .
He 's being over cautious now ... waiting till someone else speaks ... Hoping " his people " wo n't ask : " Are will still getting " stuff " .
He 's PROMISED you nothing and that 's exactly what you 'll get .

People forget that Sen. McCain graduated from Annapolis and learned strategy and tactics from his Admiral father and Admiral grandfather .
He also has some smart cookies running his campaign .
His latest tactical move to suspend his campaign to focus on solving the economy  in the Senate has Obama on his heels .
McCain can take the high road , while Obama searches for a way to exploit the situation .

“ On Batman ” by Thomas Kempis
Batman is a mighty power ,
a great and complete good .
Batman alone lightens every burden , and makes rough places smooth .
He bears every hardship as though it were nothing , and renders
all bitterness sweet and acceptable .
Nothing is sweeter than Batman ,
Nothing stronger ,
Nothing higher ,
Nothing wider ,
Nothing more pleasant ,
Nothing fuller or better in heaven or earth ; for Batman is born of God .
Batman flies , runs and leaps for joy .
He is free and unrestrained .
Batman knows no limits , but ardently transcends all bounds .
Batman feels no burden , takes no account of toil ,
attempts things beyond his strength .
Batman sees nothing as impossible ,
for he feels able to achieve all things .
He is strange and effective ,
while those who lack Batman faint and fail .
Batman is not fickle and sentimental ,
nor is he intent on vanities .
Like a living flame and a burning torch ,
he surges upward and surely surmounts every obstacle .
Seriously , now , this is the best the McCain campaign could come up with ?
Palin is an idiot , just like you ?
I ’m sorry , but she needs a lot more going for her if she ’s going to be a 72 year old cancer survivor ’s heartbeat away from the presidency .
America tried the “ vote for the dumb guy , he ’s funny ” thing already – twice in fact .
Did n’t work out so well .
More from Huff Post :
“ She ’s not lived in the world of Washington , so she does n’t know every detail of all the questions senators deal with , ” Lieberman told NBC ’s Andrea Mitchell .
“ But , frankly , that ’s her strength .
I think that ’s why a lot of regular people out across America think she ’s going to be their voice . ”
Mitchell interjected , “ Senator , she wants to be a heartbeat away from the presidency .
You know , that does n’t mean just being an average mom , it means bringing other skills . ”
But Lieberman stayed on the point , stating later , “ I think tonight is not a kind of final college exam .
I think the point is who is she as a person …
Whether she can answer every detailed question , I do n’t think that ultimately matters to the American people so long as they think she passes those other personal thresholds . ”
You know , call me a Washington elitist , but when I have to call my bank to see if my retirement savings is safe , I do n’t want to find some dumb nice person on the other end of the line .
I want the smartest person I can find taking care of my assets , my economy , my country .
The notion that our country is facing its most severe economic crisis since the Great Depression and we ’re to trust the reins of government to Sarah Palin because she ’s kind of an idiot , but nice , is beyond absurd .
Yes , Americans vote their gut .
But they also vote their wallet .
Our life savings are on the line .
And no one – NO ONE – trusts Sarah Palin with their bank account .
And frankly , only a Washington elitist like Lieberman would .

As I sat down to write this , I tried to think of how many different times I have written about Senate extensions of the investment tax credits and production tax credits for renewable energy in the last year .
And honestly , I ’m not sure – but I know it ’s a lot ( a few of them can be linked to below ) .
What I do know , is that as early as tomorrow , the Senate will vote on S. 3335 , which includes an 8 year extension of the commercial and residential solar tax credit , and doubles the residential cap to $ 4,000 .
S. 3335 ( pdf ) was devised by Senate Democrats to include bi-partisan must - pass provisions , such as tax relief for families and businesses affected by natural disasters this year in the Midwest and West , and an exemption on the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) for middle - income families .
An eight year of the investment tax credit would give the solar industry the long term security it needs to ramp up production in the United States , which in turn , would create jobs , and limit the need for the construction of any new coal - fired power plants .
If you want to see this bill pass , I urge you to take action on the investment tax credit by contacting your Senator immediately .

UPDATE : We 've driven it , and here 's our full 2010 Chevy Camaro review !
This is it .
The 2010 Chevy Camaro , revealed in all its glory .
According to details we 've been told by the folks breaking the embargo , the new Chevy Camaro will come in LS , LT and SS ( yes , we know there 's a badge there that says " RS " ) — and be available in either 6 - speed manual or auto flavors .
Under the hood , a 296 HP 3.6 - liter V6 or a 416 HP 6.2 - liter V8 with cylinder deactivation .
And check out that interior — looks very muscular to us .
Weight ?
How about 3,747 lb — lighter than the Challenger .
Full details below the jump .
UPDATE : Now we 've got even more pictures !

Here 's what we 're told from the folks at CarTribe :
The Camaro will come in LS , LT and full - on SS specs and be available with 6 - speed manual and auto transmissions .
Under the bonnet sit fuel - efficient 296 bhp 3.6 - liter V6 and 416 bhp 6.2 - liter V8 engines , which can run on fewer cylinders to improve economy .
It should n't just be a burnout king either , handling should be pretty good thanks to an all - independent suspension setup and a StabiliTrak stability control system .
4 - pot Brembo brakes front and rear shed the speed on the SS .
Weight balance is split 52 /48 front / rear too , but the Camaro is a porker , weighing in at more than 1,700 kgs .
The interior gets cool LED lighting , leather seats on posher models and dials and gauges inspired by 1969 Camaros .
The US gets the car in early 2009 , while we 'll get it some time after that .
Super .

McCain camp : Obama is ' radical , ' pals around with terrorists
Pegged to a Times story that adds nothing to the theory that Obama and Bill Ayers were particularly close , the McCain camp is focusing on that association again today , in an attempt to move the conversation beyond the economic issues on which Obama looks to spend the last month of the race .
Palin hit Obama a bit harder on this than McCain has in the past .
" There 's been a lot of interest in what I read lately .
Well , I was reading my copy of today ’s New York Times and I was really interested to read about Barack ’s friends from Chicago .
Turns out , one of his earliest supporters is a man who , according to The New York Times , was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that , quote , ‘ launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol , ' " Palin said today , according to a transcript distributed by the campaign .
" These are the same guys who think patriotism is paying higher taxes .
This is not a man who sees America as you and I do — as the greatest force for good in the world .
" This is someone who sees America as imperfect enough to pal around with terrorists who targeted their own country , " Palin concluded , in the hardest shot of the statement .
The McCain camp also has a second statement out , responding to Obama 's attack on McCain 's health care plan as " radical . "
" On a day when new reports have surfaced about Barack Obama 's long association with a domestic terrorist , our Democratic opponent had the audacity to call John McCain 's health care plan ' radical . '
The American people know radical when they hear it , and John McCain is not the candidate in this election they should be concerned about , " said spokesman Tucker Bounds .
Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan responded :
Governor Palin ’s comments , while offensive , are not surprising , given the McCain campaign ’s statement this morning that they would be launching Swift boat - like attacks in hopes of deflecting attention from the nation ’s economic ills .
In fact , the very newspaper story Governor Palin cited in hurling her shameless attack made clear that Senator Obama is not close to Bill Ayers , much less " pals , " and that he has strongly condemned the despicable acts Ayers committed 40 years ago , when Obama was eight .
What ’s clear is that John McCain and Sarah Palin would rather spend their time tearing down Barack Obama than laying out a plan to build up our economy .

Make no mistake :
At this point , it ’s clear that the voter fraud chimera , and its potential to keep thousands or millions of Obama voters out of the final count , is becoming the central Republican strategy for winning this election .
The party doubts it can win if every legitimate vote is counted , so they aim to make sure that some of them are n’t .
False allegations of voter fraud , which can serve to both intimidate voters and challenge ballots , is their means to this end .
As David Corn wrote last week , the right ’s “ desperation is showing ” as they scramble to reverse John McCain ’s free - fall by smearing Barack Obama with every scary label they can find .
( As David summarized it : “ Obama is a Black Muslim , Anti-Christian Socialist Plotting with an Evil Jewish Billionaire . ” )
But in case this fails to frighten off enough voters to close Obama ’s lead , vote suppression is the Republicans ’ last - ditch tactic for snatching a tainted victory from the jaws of defeat .
This is a strategy that ’s been developing for years within the Republican Party .
But it ’s really taken off during the Bush administration — maybe because W ( or , more likely , Dick Cheney ) remained conscious that he only got into the White House through vote suppression , and could only stay there through more vote suppression .
The administration ’s zeal to advance the myth of voter fraud was key to what has become one of its biggest scandals : the politically motivated firings of nine U.S. attorneys by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2006 .
Clearest of all is the case of David Igelsias , U.S. Attorney for the District of New Mexico .
It has since been revealed — and confirmed by the Justice Department ’s own Inspector General — that the primary reason for Iglesias ’s dismissal was his failure to aggressively pursue alledged cases of voter fraud after the 2004 election –including a case involving the current GOP target , ACORN , which registered a couple of underaged boys .
Iglesias ( a Republican himself ) found insufficient evidence in that case , and no grounds for any others , so he resisted the urging of Republican politicians and party activists in the state–and was fired .
An especially good — and concise — take on this case comes from an Albuquerque elections lawyer , John Boyd , via Brad Friedman ( who blogs about “ electile dysfunction ” at BradBlog.com ) .
Boyd describes what he calls the “ three - pronged scandal ” of the attorney firings and the “ ‘ voter fraud ’ fraud ” :
First , there is the scandal of the “ voter fraud ” fraud which the Republicans have been trying to use to help promote restrictive , disenfranchising voter i.d. legislation .
Second , there is the scandal of the Republicans attempting to enlist the US Atty ’s office in their voter fraud fraud by getting him , at taxpayer expense and contrary to the most elemental ethics , to use his office to generate headlines about “ voter fraud ” when none was occurring , for the sole purpose of shaving Democratic party margins .
Third , there is the scandal of firing Iglesias for refusing to go along with this fraudulent manipulation .
The Obama campaign is now seeking to highlight all of these connections , by urging the Justice Department to have the same special prosecutor who is handling the attorney firings , Nora Dannehy , investigate whether the F.B.I. ’s current investigations of ACORN are politically motivated as well .
It ’s a shrewd move , and it positions the Democrats to fight the legal battles that are sure to follow the election if the vote count in swing states is close .
But at this point , it wo n’t do much to fight abuses on election day .
That will depend in large part on the perseverance of the voters .
It ’s already clear just what they will up against .
New reports document the obstacle course that many voters — especially first - time voters — will have to run simply to exercise their most basic democratic right .
I got a first glimpse of their determination in New Mexico , which I traveled through on my cross-country trip with a Guardian Films team .
While there may have been few signs of voter fraud in David Iglesias ’s former jurisdiction , there has been rampant evidence of vote suppression .
In the 2004 election , the state became notorious for its sky - high rate of “ undervotes ” — ballots that have been cast but do not include a vote in a particular contest .
Records show an astonishing 1 in 36 ballots in New Mexico missing a vote for president that year .
The total undervotes came to over 21,000 — more than five times the margin of victory in the state , which George W. Bush won by fewer than 4,000 votes .
About 80 percent of those undervote ballots were cast on electronic voting machines with no verifiable paper trails .
The machines have since been banned and paper ballots mandated ( though now there are concerns about the machines that tally up those paper ballots ) .
But once burned , New Mexicans are still worried about their votes being counted .
On Saturday we stopped at a rally in Santa Fe with state Democratic politicians , meant to draw locals to the in - person early voting that ’s just begun in New Mexico .
When we got there the place looked dead , and we decided it was a bust .
But then we rounded the corner of a building , and there were the voters : not 10 or 20 , but a good 75 or more , prepared to wait in the blazing sun for as long as two hours , with more people joining the line all the time .
Emerging from the voting booth in his wheelchair , Joe Parker , a state employee , told me that he had been turned away from voting at the primary and was n’t going to have that happen again .
“ I want to be sure there are no problems , ” he said with a tight smile .
Ballots in New Mexico , he explained , had a way of “ getting lost . ”

In a well known , but less well fully appreciated strategy , China for several years has been moving to lock - in commodity supplies in various parts of the world , especially Africa .
Now , a powerful article from journalist Peter Hitchens in London ’s Daily Mail newspaper alleges that in addition to the longer term political and economic ramifications of those moves , some Chinese companies operating in Africa are , at best , exploiting local workers and , in some cases , treating them almost like “ slave labor , ” according to a leading politician in Zambia .
Hitchens visited Chinese - owned operations in both Zambia and The Congo .
The former is a reasonably functioning democratic country with some semblance of political and legal structure .
The Congo is a chaotic country ruled by a despot , President Joseph Kabila .
For the past several years , China has been buying commodity - based assets and land in many African countries , using a variety of mechanisms to get those deals done .
“ Out of desperation , much of the continent is selling itself into a new era of corruption and virtual slavery as China seeks to buy up all the metals , minerals and oil she can lay her hands on , ” Hitchens wrote .
China “ regards Zambia as a great prize , alongside its other favored nations of Sudan ( oil ) , Angola ( oil ) and Congo ( metals ) , ” Hitchens added .
To win political favor in Zambia , China has cancelled some of the country ’s debts , eased Zambian exports to China , established a “ special economic zone ” in the Copper Belt , offered to build a sports stadium , schools , a hospital and an anti-malaria center as well as providing scholarships and dispatching experts to help with agriculture .
Zambia - China trade is growing rapidly , primarily in the form of copper .
Just how big is China ’s presence and involvement in Africa ?
No one really knows .
" You 've got Africa , the big black hole of data , and China , the big black hole of data -- put the two of them together and it's a disaster , " Lucy Corkin , a China - Africa think - tank expert , said last year .
China is said to be offering zero interest loans to businesses investing in Africa .
( Global Supply Chain and Logistics Article - Continued Below ) CATEGORY SPONSOR : SOFTEON Deplorable Working Conditions
The Chinese “ invasion ” of Africa and the alleged exploitation of the workers there is a “ wicked enterprise , ” Hitchens says .
“ The poor , hopeless , angry people exist by grubbing for scraps of cobalt and copper ore in the filth and dust of abandoned copper mines in The Congo , sinking perilous 80 - foot shafts by hand , washing their finds in cholera - infected streams full of human filth , then pushing enormous two - hundredweight loads uphill on ancient bicycles to the nearby town of Likasi where middlemen buy them to sell on , mainly to Chinese businessmen hungry for these vital metals , ” he says .
Hitchens says many workers die as their primitive mines collapse on them , or are horribly injured without hope of medical treatment .
Many of the workers are children .
The pay : about $ 3.00 for a very long and grueling day .
Hitchens says Chinese - owned mining operations “ looked like a penal colony in an ancient slave empire . ”
Nearby are the graves of 54 Zambian workers killed a few years ago in a factory explosion .
While Hitchens was there , another Zambian worker was beaten unconscious by Chinese employees angered that the man had fallen asleep on the job .
A government minister was recently shown weeping on TV after she saw first hand the working conditions at a Chinese - owned coal mine in the Southern Province of Zambia .
Corruption and Bribes Hitchens also found heavy levels of corruption , with bribery of local and national officials by Chinese companies commonplace , while most Western companies cannot play by those rules .
“ A [ Western ] businessman shrugged over the way he is forced to wait weeks to get his products out of the country , while the Chinese have no such problems , ” Hitchens wrote .
“ I ’m not sure the Chinese even know there are customs regulations , ” Hitchens quoted the businessman as saying .
“ They do n't fill in the forms , they just pay [ the bribes ] . ”
Hitchens vividly describes just how bad the conditions are : “ As dusk falls and the shadows lengthen , the scene looks like the blasted land of Mordor in Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings : a pre-medieval prospect of hopeless , condemned toil in pits surrounded by stony desolation . ”
What is your reaction to this story by Peter Hitchens ?
What if anything can Western governments or companies do ?
Should we be more concerned with the efforts by Chinese companies to gain control of these commodities ?

One thing I hate about the Fourth Estate , and our culture in general , is the very short attention span that traps us in the present .
No one remembers anything .
Everything is now , now , now .
There is no follow - up : stories are n’t developed so much as they are announced , and then shoved down the Memory Hole .
The result is that the general public , as well as the media , is suffering from a collective form of Alzheimer ’s .
Ah , but here at Antiwar.com we live by a different standard , one that recalls the old - fashioned reportorial style of the sixties and seventies , long before the conflation of news and what passes for entertainment these days .
We ’re doing some follow - up today , on a story that I covered here , here , and here , which is among the most bizarre in recent memory : the Yushchenko poisoning mystery .
Viktor Yushchenko , you ’ll remember , was the young handsome investment banker and politician who led Ukraine ’s " Orange Revolution , " the most successful and dramatic of several " color revolutions " inspired and often funded by the US government as part of an effort to encircle Putin ’s Russia .
Yushchenko was portrayed as a hero and quasi-libertarian free - market type .
His Russian - backed rival , Viktor Yanukovich , was depicted as the latter - day equivalent of Josef Stalin .
As the election campaign reached a crescendo of activity and international interest , Yushchenko fell victim to a mysterious illness .
His formerly handsome face was covered with lesions and unsightly bumps , and he seemed to have been permanently scarred .
Yushchneko claimed he had been poisoned by his nefarious opponents , and the Western media went with his story almost without asking any questions .
The media narrative at the time was staunchly behind the poisoning theory , with the clear addendum that the Kremlin was responsible , if not Putin personally then some " rogue " element of the FSB , which was routinely referred to by its old acronym : KGB .
There were all sort of indications , however , including testimony from Dr. Lothar Wicke  at the time chief medical doctor at the Rudolfinerhaus clinic , where Yushcenko was treated  that pointed to a rather more complicated if less dramatic diagnosis : pancreatitis , brought on by alcohol abuse .
Wicke ’s public statements disputing the official diagnosis provoked the ire of Yushchenko ’s supporters , threats were made , and Wicke had to be provided with police protection .
As I wrote at the time :
" The Yushchenko story is a textbook example of news management , neocon - style : of how the conventional wisdom is created out of very few real facts , and contrary views are kept out of the debate .
Instead of questioning the logic of Yushchenko ’s insistence that he was poisoned by supporters of Yanukovich , and raising alternate explanations , we were supposed to simply echo the politically correct version of the story .
Instead of wondering why anyone would use dioxin  a substance that has never been known to kill a single person  in an assassination attempt , we were supposed to just keep quiet , accept the conventional wisdom , and come up with catchy headlines like : Pro-Western Bearer of  Democracy ’ Martyred by Commie Rats .
" Except we did n’t  and we wo n’t .
The truth has barely begun to unfold , and we will cover [ the story ] in these pages , no matter where it goes .
What seems clear at this point , however , is that what everyone  knew ” ‘ to be true  the “ poisoned soup ” story pushed by Yushchenko and his Western supporters  is definitely not true , and I ’m proud to say that we at Antiwar.com were not taken in for a single moment . "
For four years , the " investigation " into the alleged poisoning plot has plodded along , without identifying a single suspect , much less issuing an indictment or making an arrest .
Now it turns out that a key member of Yushchenko ’s inner circle  or , at least a former member  is calling him out on the alleged KGB " poison plot . "
His former campaign manager , David Zhvania  a guest at the September 5 , 2004 dinner at which Yushchenko was supposedly poisoned  is telling us that the whole thing was a put - up job :
" Zhvania cast doubt over the validity of dioxin - poisoning tests done years ago that suggested Yushchenko was poisoned .
Zhvania insisted that Yushchenko was first diagnosed as suffering the effects of pancreatitis , herpes and facial nerve inflammation ..
Zhvania said the dinner - poisoning scenario emerged from discussions in Yushchenko’s headquarters after the then - presidential candidate fell ill .
Zhvania was present at the dinner in question which took place at Satsyuk ’s dacha , but insists Yushchenko was not poisoned there . "
Zhvania , whose picture appears in summer vacation photos with the Yushchenko family , bluntly accuses his former leader and mentor of perpetrating a massive fraud :
" It was common food poisoning .
The diagnosis was made the first day .
These kinds of poisonings happen a lot , to every third person in the world .
It was a stomach infection .
On the day that he went to the doctor , they all came to this same conclusion .
I was there .
Then they decided that he should fly to Austria [ for medical care ] .
I was opposed … because the proposed clinic had nothing to do with stomach infections .
It was a cardiologic center . "
According to Zhvania , " all subsequent tests showing that Yushchchenko had been poisoned by dioxide were falsified and that the Orange campaign team had thought up the poisoning version for political gain . "
He also relates that , prior to the dinner where Yushchenko was allegedly poisoned  also attended by Ihor Smeshko , at the time head of the SBU , Ukraine ’s security service  the candidate " had partaken in an earlier meal just before the Smeshko visit , and before that had stopped off at the home of a completely unknown tinkerer where the president downed no small quantity of moonshine . "
I do n’t know what kind of moonshine the Western media was imbibing when they swallowed the Yushchenko - was - poisoned - by - evil - commies narrative , but the sort bottled by the US government is pretty strong stuff  and a media that has lately been reduced to transcribing government press releases and calling it " news " is particularly vulnerable to rapid inebriation .
Which is precisely the reason for Antiwar.com  we ’re here to fact - check the reams of propaganda that are daily churned out by official and unofficial outlets , whether it be a statement by some government agency , or a " news " story prominently placed on the front page of the New York Times .
That it is often difficult to distinguish the two is a depressing sign of the age we live in  but all is not lost .
As long as we have Antiwar.com checking the real facts , and looking behind the headlines , there ’s hope that the truth will not only come out but will be widely known .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
As if to confirm my long - expressed suspicions of the Yushchenko " poisoning " scenario  and the thuggish instincts of the " Orange revolutionaries " in power  the Ukrainian President is now accusing none other than David Zhvania of having poisoned him .
According to Yushchenko , his former campaign manager was planted by the KGB to knock him off .
It ’s just a coincidence that Zhvania has since become one of the Ukrainian President ’s most visible opponents , and that he now stands accused of attempted murder .
And if you believe that one , there ’s a bridge in Brooklyn I ’d like to sell you
ABSTRACT Introduction .
Many speculations have been made on the possible existence of a “ female prostate gland ” and “ female ejaculation . ”
Despite several reports on the subject , controversy still exists around the “ female prostate ” and whether such a gland might be the source of fluid emitted during orgasm ( ejaculation ) .
Aim .
To investigate the ultrasonographic , biochemical , and endoscopic features in two women who reported actual ejaculations during orgasm .
Main Outcome Measures .
Perineal ultrasound studies , as well as biochemical characteristics of ejaculate and urethroscopy , have been performed in two women .
Methods .
Two premenopausal women — 44 and 45 years of age — who actually reported fluid expulsion ( ejaculation ) during orgasm have been investigated .
Ultrasound imaging , biochemical studies of the ejaculated fluid , and endoscopy of the urethra have been used to identify a prostate in the female .
Ejaculated fluid parameters have been compared to voided urine samples .
Results .
On high - definition perineal ultrasound images , a structure was identified consistent with the gland tissue surrounding the entire length of the female urethra .
On urethroscopy , one midline opening ( duct ) was seen just inside the external meatus in the six - o’ clock position .
Biochemically , the fluid emitted during orgasm showed all the parameters found in prostate plasma in contrast to the values measured in voided urine .
Conclusions .
Data of the two women presented further underline the concept of the female prostate both as an organ itself and as the source of female ejaculation .

Environmentalists , businesses reach compromise
Governmental inaction is prompting environmental groups and big business to cut unprecedented deals to promote energy exploration and other development in return for major conservation initiatives .
The agreements preserve large amounts of undeveloped land , impose stricter environmental practices than required by law and generate big investments in alternative energy .
The deals also clear the way for oil drilling , new power plants and large residential developments .
Experts say the move to private agreements reflects a loss of faith in the government 's ability to handle some of the USA 's most pressing environmental disputes .
" I started off believing in regulation , but government agencies compromise and change rules , " San Francisco environmental lawyer Clem Shute says .
" These private deals are a pragmatic way to accomplish good things . "
BUSINESS DEAL : How a businessman and an environmental group found common ground
Steven Hayward , an environmental scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute , says the agreements signal an era of " practical environmentalism . "
He says Congress has been in a stalemate for decades on major environmental legislation , especially on emerging issues such as land conservation , transportation and energy .
That has forced businesses and environmental groups to reach out to each other , often after sparring a few rounds in court .
Recent big deals :
• Land use .
Tejon Ranch Co. , owner of the largest tract of private property in California , signed a deal in June with five environmental groups to preserve 90 % of the 422 - square - mile property , located about 60 miles north of Los Angeles .
The environmental groups agreed not to oppose the building of up to 26,000 homes on the remaining 10 % of the company 's land , a vast expanse of hills , valleys and canyons that is a home for the rare California condor .
• Energy exploration .
Environmentalists agreed in April to support a Houston oil company 's plan to expand drilling off the coast of Santa Barbara , Calif. , where an oil spill in 1969 helped launch the environmental movement .
In exchange , the firm agreed to end all offshore drilling there in 2022 and donate 3,900 acres for parks .
• Green products .
The Sierra Club agreed in January to put the group 's logo on a new line of environmentally sensitive cleaning products , called Green Works , manufactured by Clorox .
In exchange , the Sierra Club will get a share of the sales .
Many deals have brought opposition from some environmentalists worried that too much was sacrificed .
The local Sierra Club in Traverse City , Mich. , disbanded to protest the Clorox deal .
The two sides in the disputes often agree on complex trade - offs to avoid or end litigation .
" We were overjoyed by what we got , " says Susan Brown of Concerned Citizens of Platte County , Mo. , which challenged Kansas City Power and Light 's plan to build two coal - fired power plants .
The utility agreed to build only one plant , clean up two others and invest in wind power .
The firm is building the $ 1 billion plant without facing lawsuits .
A team of Japanese climbers claimed they have found the footprints of the legendary abominable snowman in the folds of the eastern Himalayas in Nepal .
An eight - member team claimed the footprints of the snowman or Yeti were about 20 centimetres long and were human in appearance .
The creature 's footprints were found on snow at an altitude of about 4,800 metres ( 15,748 feet ) in the Dhaulagiri mountain range in west Nepal .
The scientific community said there is no proof of the Yeti's existence despite decades of sightings .
" We saw three footprints which looked like that of human beings , " Kuniaki Yagihara , a member of the Yeti Project Japan , told Reuters , after returning with photographs of the footprints .
The Japanese crew said it was their third attempt to track down the half - man - half - ape , which has long been part of the western adventuring folklore in this part of the world .
The team said they have become adept at recognising the various beasts such as bear and snow leopards and are adamant that the " footprint " was " none of those " .
Although the climbers spent more than 40 days on Dhaulagiri IV - a 7,661 metre ( 25,135 - foot ) peak where they say they have seen traces of yetis in the past - they could not furnish the press with a single photograph of the Yeti .
" If I do n't believe in Yeti I would never come , " said Yagihara .
Nepali Sherpas say the legend of the Yeti rests deep in the Himalayan psyche .
Tales of wild hairy giants living in the snow are part of growing up in the mountains .
These prompted many , including Sir Edmund Hillary , to carry out yeti hunts .
The Yeti is also considered more than a myth by the world of cryptozoology , the study of uncatalogued creatures , which takes seriously the idea that the alleged creature may be the last fragments of a race of giant man-apes that existed in central Asia more than 300,000 years ago .
There appears a global trading industry in sightings of the abominable snowman .
Most turn out to be false .
In July Yeti hairs were supposedly found in north east India .
Upon testing they turned out to belong to a species of Himalayan goat .
In August , two men in the US claimed they had found the remains of a half - man - half - ape Bigfoot , which actually turned out to be a rubber gorilla suit .
As predicted , I totally failed at keeping with the writing .
In spite of the enthusiasm and spirit of my previous entry , I let everything else get in the wa ...

The selection of Sen. Joseph Biden as Barack Obama ’s running mate is drawing a chorus of disapproval from Catholic intellectual and pro-life leaders because of Biden ’s longstanding support for abortion .
Most recently , Archbishop Charles Chaput of Denver has said that Biden should refrain from Communion .
Over the weekend , CNA spoke with several prominent Catholics regarding Biden ’s nomination for the Democratic vice - presidential slot .
The well - known Catholic intellectual and author George Weigel explained to CNA that Obama ’s choice was expected .
“ Barack Obama is a pro-abortion radical , so there 's nothing surprising about his choosing a pro-abortion running mate , ” said Weigel .
According to Weigel , an Obama - Biden ticket is “ deeply disturbing ” because “ neither Senator Obama nor Senator Biden seems to have taken Catholic arguments about the first principles of justice seriously . ”
“ The Church 's pro-life position is not ‘ sectarian ; ’ it can be engaged by anyone willing to work through a serious philosophical argument , ” Weigel asserted .
“ Neither Obama nor Biden seems willing to do that -- which casts a rather large shadow over their claims to be the ticket of thoughtfulness and intellectual seriousness . ”
Weigel predicts that the choice of Biden will present the public with the sight of " ‘ Catholics for Obama ’ tying themselves into even tighter theological pretzels , as they try to justify a vote for what seems likely to be the most radically pro-abortion ticket in American history . ”
Deal Hudson , a Catholic political analyst , commented to CNA that the selection of Sen. Biden by Obama “ has underscored his abortion extremism . ”
On the other hand , the tapping of the senator from Delaware may have some positive implications for Obama as well , noted Hudson , who called him “ an affable , veteran politician who is unlikely to repeat the 2004 mistakes of Sen .
John Kerry by overselling his ‘ Catholic ’ credentials . ”
Fr. Frank Pavone , the head of Priests for Life , took a broader view of Barack Obama ’s vice presidential selection , calling it “ a wake - up call to the Church ( clergy and laity alike ) . ”
Among the steps that the Church needs to take , said Fr. Pavone , are : to “ improve the way we hand on the Faith , be willing to exercise the spiritual work of mercy of admonishing the sinner , and to keep politically active so that such people are voted out of office . ”
Politicians , Fr. Pavone underscored , are engaged in publicly expressing “ their support for keeping abortion legal ” while at the same time consistently refusing to admit what abortion is .
He added , “ if a politician cannot respect the life of a little baby , how is he supposed to respect yours and mine ? ”
Austin Ruse , the head of the Catholic Family & Human Rights Institute , reacted to the news of Sen.
Biden ’s selection by saying , “ The Democrats are slapping faithful Catholics right in the face .
First , they will nominate the most pro-abortion candidate in history .
Then they refuse to invite the beloved Archbishop of Denver even to offer a prayer at their convention .
And now they nominate a pro-abortion Catholic as vice - president .
Only self - hating Catholics could vote for this ticket . ”
The president of the national Catholic advocacy group Fidelis , Brian Burch , interpreted the Biden pick as having “ re-opened a wound among American Catholics . ”
He added that , “ the American bishops have made clear that Catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person , including the unborn .
Sadly , Joe Biden 's tenure in the United States Senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion . "
Burch also highlighted the fact that , “ Biden 's own bishop , Bishop Michael Saltarelli of Wilmington , Del. , has said that the issues pertaining to the sanctity of human life are the ‘ great civil rights issues of this generation ’ . ”
Bishop Saltarelli denounced the notion that politicians can ' personally oppose ' abortion , but refuse to pass laws protecting the unborn .
In fact , Bishop Saltarelli has made clear that pro-abortion Catholic politicians should refrain from receiving the Eucharist .
On Monday morning in Denver , where the Democratic National Convention is underway , Archbishop Charles Chaput told the Associated Press that because of support for abortion , Biden should refrain from taking Communion .
During his tenure in the senate , Joe Biden has voted numerous times in support of abortion and has characterized himself as a strong supporter of Roe v. Wade .
Biden also revealed at a Democratic presidential primary debate in Las Vegas last November that his criteria for selecting nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court would include a pro-Roe test .
“ I would not appoint anyone who did not understand that Section 5 of the 14th Amendment and the Liberty Clause of the 14th Amendment provided a right to privacy , ” Biden said .
“ That 's the question I 'd ask them .
If that is answered correctly , that that is the case , then it answers the question , which means they would support Roe v. Wade . "

Dude , first you lost ABC , and now you 've lost FOX News , as evidenced by this testy segment with Shepard Smith yesterday .
That 's just gotta smart for a Republican when the official water carrier for the Republican Party openly chastises you for keeping the press away from Sarah Palin during her crash course in getting the appearance of foreign policy gravitas via photo ops .
The campaign had never intended to actually let the press pool into Palin 's sessions with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe , but Palin 's aides indicated last night that designated reporters would be able to watch the Alaska governor greet the visiting dignitaries before heading into a closed - door session .
Palin is also meeting with former secretary of state Henry Kissinger later today , where the same rules would apply .
This morning the campaign shifted course and said no print reporters would be welcome at the outset of the meetings , though a foreign policy aide might brief the print media later today .
Cameras , however , would remain free to capture Palin 's entry onto the world stage .
Does the McCain campaign actually think that a photo of Palin with world leaders ( because you know that at best they exchanged a few inane niceties , nothing that could be considered substantive ) will actually obviate the charge of being a lightweight on foreign policy ?
Clearly the answer is ' yes ' , but considering the press reaction , this could backfire on him big time .
Could n't happen to a more deserving campaign .
Electronic Arts ( EA ) and Amazon have been the targets of a justified online rebellion the last couple weeks .
The impetus for the backlash is EA 's use of Digital Restrictions Management ( DRM ) technology in its game Spore .
As of right now , the game has received 2,226 1 - star reviews on Amazon -- more than we 've ever seen before -- and they are primarily focused on EA 's DRM system .
DefectiveByDesign members have tagged the game with tags like defectivebydesign and drm infected .
As with music and video , this system controls how many copies a user can make of her game , and requires that she allow her computer to phone home periodically to an activation server to be granted permission .
The system is called SecuROM , and while that name might not be familiar , there are familiar names behind it .
SecuROM is a product of Sony DADC -- the same Sony that had to reach a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission last year over the rootkit installed by their noxious DRM .
EA , forced to respond to the complaints , has done the minimum amount possible to try and make the heat go away .
Their upcoming game Command & Conquer : Red Alert 3 will restrict users to five copies instead of three , and will enforce the phone - home requirement when the game is first installed rather than later on .
But they have not changed the fundamentals of the system .
Their " concession " is just more proof of the problems with DRM -- the ability of EA to arbitrarily decide how a user can use software on her own computer , and to make a part of her own computer off - limits so that it can spy on her in order to make sure that she abides by their restrictions .
Requiring online activation on installation at all means that once the activation servers are shut down ( as has been threatened all too often lately with music services like MSN and Yahoo ) , users are out of luck .
Activation also does n't mean what you might think -- the Amazon reviews are full of horror stories about failed activations after adding new components like video cards and disk drives to an existing computer .
The packaging and advertising for Spore of course does not mention its DRM .
When people find out about it , they do n't want to buy it .
The only way people are going to hear about it is if they hear it from you .
Take Action
1 . If you 're already an Amazon customer , go to the product pageand add your own rating then review Spore , and tag it defectivebydesign and drm infected .
Reviews are n't open for Red Alert 3 , but you can still tag it and add information about DRM to its discussion forum .
and .
Reviews are n't open for Red Alert 3 , but you can still tag it and add information about DRM to its discussion forum .
2 . Write directly to EA's CEO John Riccitiello at < jriccitiello@ea.com > to tell him that his response misses the point -- you will not be bought off by the ability to make two more copies than you could before .
EA should act like true leaders in game design by getting rid of DRM once and for all .
CC us at info@defectivebydesign.org .
3. Support DRM - free games like those based on the recently announced free software game Hexen .
Suggest more DRM - free games that we can add to our Guide , by emailing us at info@defectivebydesign.org .
The more support we can show for these games , the more there will be .
Much like what happened with Digg and the AACS encryption key , Amazon after initially taking many of the reviews down was forced by public pressure to put them back up again .
This is because there is nothing abusive or wrong with these reviews -- they are honest criticisms of an abusive technology used by far too many proprietary software game companies .
We can have the most success here if we keep things that way , and do n't give Amazon any justification for removing them or EA reason to dismiss them .
It 's been exciting to see awareness of DRM already rising to such a high level .
Congratulations to all the DefectiveByDesign activists and other reviewers who made this happen .
Let 's keep this momentum going until all game companies do the right thing and eliminate DRM !
Batavia , Ill . - Physicists of the DZero experiment at the U.S. Department of Energy 's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory have discovered a new particle made of three quarks , the Omega - sub - b ( Ωb ) .
The particle contains two strange quarks and a bottom quark ( s - s-b ) .
It is an exotic relative of the much more common proton and weighs about six times the proton mass .
The discovery of the doubly strange particle brings scientists a step closer to understanding exactly how quarks form matter and to completing the " periodic table of baryons . "
Baryons ( derived from the Greek word " barys , " meaning " heavy " ) are particles that contain three quarks , the basic building blocks of matter .
The proton comprises two up quarks and a down quark ( u - u -d ) .
Combing through almost 100 trillion collision events produced by the Tevatron particle collider at Fermilab , the DZero collaboration found 18 incidents in which the particles emerging from a proton - antiproton collision revealed the distinctive signature of the Omega - sub -b .
Once produced , the Omega - sub - b travels about a millimeter before it disintegrates into lighter particles .
Its decay , mediated by the weak force , occurs in about a trillionth of a second .
Theorists predicted the mass of the Omega - sub - b baryon to be in the range of 5.9 to 6.1 GeV / c2 .
The DZero collaboration measured its mass to be 6.165 ± 0.016 GeV / c2 .
The particle has the same electric charge as an electron and has spin J=1/2 .
The Omega - sub - b is the latest and most exotic discovery of a new type of baryon containing a bottom quark at the Tevatron particle collider at Fermilab .
Its discovery follows the observation of the Cascade - b- minus baryon ( Ξb - ) , first observed by the DZero experiment in 2007 , and two types of Sigma - sub - b baryons ( Σb ) , discovered by the CDF experiment at Fermilab in 2006 .
" The observation of the doubly strange b baryon is yet another triumph of the quark model , " said DZero cospokesperson Dmitri Denisov , of Fermilab .
" Our measurement of its mass , production and decay properties will help to better understand the strong force that binds quarks together . "
According to the quark model , invented in 1961 by theorists Murray Gell - Mann and Yuval Ne'eman as well as George Zweig , the four quarks up , down , strange and bottom can be arranged to form 20 different spin - 1 / 2 baryons .
Scientists now have observed 13 of these combinations .
" The measurement of the mass of the Omega - sub - b provides a great test of computer calculations using lattice quantum chromodynamics , " said Fermilab theorist Andreas Kronfeld .
" The discovery of this particle is an example of all the wonderful results pouring out of accelerator laboratories over the past few years . "
The Omega - sub - b is a relative of the famous and " even stranger " Omega - minus , which is made of three strange quarks ( s - s-s ) .
" After the discovery of the Omega - minus , people started to accept that quarks really exist , " said DZero co-spokesperson Darien Wood , of Northeastern University .
" Its discovery , made with a bubble chamber at Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1964 , is the textbook example of the predictive power of the quark model . "
###
The DZero collaboration submitted a paper that summarizes the details of its discovery to the journal Physical Review Letters .
It is available online at : http://www-d0. fnal .

DZero is an international experiment of about 600 physicists from 90 institutions in 18 countries .

Fresh evidence tonight that the brilliant McCain campaign strategy to lock away the political effervescence of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to stoke overconfidence among the nation 's Democrats and set the stage for yet another improbable Arizona comeback is working exactly as planned .
For more than 10 days now the 44 - year - old mother of five , who upset the ancient Republican establishment in Alaska two years ago by driving herself to campaign events and talking to pretty much any group that would h ave her , has been cut off from normal Americans who watched her by the many millions give a spunky speech at the Republican National Convention and then overnight turned her name into seven of the top 10 search terms on Google .
But John McCain 's strategists had a better idea than letting Palin be Palin .
They set her up with TV reporters born to ask questions until they found some she could n't answer .
No doubt the campaign 's idea was to show the hockey mom was pretty much like any other American who could n't recall Marbury vs. Madison if their cellphone depended on it .
Wait , come to think of it , the other vice presidential candidate did n't cite a famous Supreme Court case by name either .
But never mind .
We do n't want to confuse the conventional Palin storyline .
So the pressure is even greater for Thursday night 's sole vice presidential debate between Palin and Democrat Joe Biden , the senator from somewhere who wears his hair down pretty much all the time .
The Washington Post published a new poll this morning showing that six out of 10 Americans now see Palin's two years as governor of the largest state as insufficient experience to become president .
Almost half the voters polled expressed discomfort with McCain 's age and , of those , 85 % found Palin too inexperienced to take over .
A third of those polled now say they 're less likely to vote for McCain because of Palin .
It 's almost like a dream , it 's working so well .
A previous Times poll showed little Palin effect on female voters .
Our colleague Mark Silva over at the Swamp reports on a separate Pew Research Center poll that also shows this Hanoi strategy unfolding perfectly .
Confidence in Palin 's ability to lead has plummeted from 52 % in early September before the imprisonment of Palin to 37 % now .
It 's not all good news though .
The Pew poll finds 70 % view Palin as down - to - earth , vs. only 55 % for the gaffey guy who 's been a yabbering senator with congressional perqs since Palin was eight years old .
Also discouraging for the McCain camp must be the finding of a new Marist Poll , described by the Swamp 's same Silva .
It reveals that while a plurality ( 45 % ) expect Biden to perform better in the debate and a majority ( 61 % ) expect him to show a greater understanding of issues , compared to Palin 's 36 % and 28 % , nearly two out of three expect Palin to come across as more likeable , compared to Biden 's measly 23 % anticipated likeability .
To facilitate the latest McCain plunge into oblivion by Nov. 4 , the hockey mom is clearly going to have to do something outrageous during the debate to drive down her likeability .
Maybe talk innocently about hairplugs .
Or let slip something about her home state being 279 times larger than , say , Delaware .

The Ultimate Counterterrorism Weapon By Douglas Farah
In the day - to - day discussions and actions to combat terrorism , particularly radical Islamist terrorism , we generally agree that it will be a long struggle that could last generations .
I agree .
But it is useful to step back and realize there is a powerful weapon that we CAN use to great effect .
Both presidential candidates agreed on it , and it is long overdue : that is to decrease our consumption of oil so that our money does not flow to those who want to destroy us .
The effects have already been dramatic , as this IHT article describes .
Two regimes that pose direct threats to U.S , Latin American and Middle Eastern stability – Iran and Venezuela – are teetering on the edge of severe financial meltdowns because oil prices have dropped .
A third country that is increasingly willing to deal with rogue regimes – Russia – is also hard hit , although not to the degree of Iran and Venezuela .
Saudi Arabia ’s ability to fund the propagation of Wahhabi extremism and intolerance will also be curtailed if the prices stay down .
Why ?
Because these regimes conservatively built their budgets , including the expansionary weapons purchases , on oil averaging $ 80 to $ 90 a barrel .
When it falls below that , particularly to where it has been recently , they are forced to choose between their expansionist and militarist dreams , and feeding their own people .
Both Obama and McCain focused on the fact that we spend billions of dollars buying oil from regimes that hate us and have a radically different view of what the world should look like than most of its neighbors .
Both viewed the issue of energy independence as a matter of national security .
While differing on the margins over where to drill and the priority given nuclear energy , the campaigns , representing candidates supported by about 96 % of the voting population , were in agreement .
The choices are stark .
Iran wants a Shiite theocracy , which puts it at odds not only with the West , but with the Sunni regimes .
It can not finance its nuclear program , its massive expansion into Latin America or terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Quds Force , without oil money .
It has nothing else .
Venezuela wants a 21st century view of socialism and one party rule .
Without oil money , Chávez cannot join Iran in pushing and financing the broad anti-democratic agenda he has established .
Bankrupting the enemy by cutting diminishing it export revenues is not a long - term proposition .
It is happening now , with no formal policy in place to do this .
And , unless policies are rapidly enacted to keep consumption low , the prices will inevitably rise again .
If the Obama administration can move quickly on this front , he will take a dramatic anti-terrorism action with no military or diplomatic actions needed .
There is a down side , at least in Venezuela .
As oil revenues shrink , the Chávez government can replenish its coffers from the drug trade .
It can survive , but it wo n’t because we are legally importing his products .

Read more ... Defeating Terror With a Sound Energy Policy By Mehul Kamdar
It has yet to be determined whether it is political correctness run amok or whether it is sheer laziness that has left the world and its free nations in particular , reluctant to admit that the main source of funding for international terror these days comes from the vast energy reserves held by the nations of the Middle East .
With the bulk of the world 's oil under the control of the Arab nations and Iran , the West in particular and with India and China following , is stuck in a bind , unwilling to break free from the stranglehold that the worst sponsors of international terror have over them in their control over the world 's crude oil .
It is true that a change from the oil based transportation and power generation structure of these countries would require fundamental change in several directions if it is to succeed - it would not be inexpensive and neither would it be easy .
But , if this is successfully pulled off , it would mean cutting off the oxygen of support to nations that the West in particular is unable to do anything about even while these nations openly permit organizations operating from their territory to carry out terror attacks on their main client states .
It is often farcical to see the USA in particular chafe and fume about Iran , a nation that it has done much to try to isolate ( without much success , it must be stressed ) while American presidents and the current , outgoing incumbent in particular , go with begging bowls to the ruling monarch of the nation that was home to most of the attackers responsible for the worst terrorist atrocity on its soil on 9/11 whenever oil prices are artificially raised or lowered by the Saudis in conjunction with their other Gulf , African and Venezuelan allies when they feel like gouging the rest of the world in order to build a palace or two or finance one or another mosque in other parts of the world to recruit and train more suicide attackers .
Let there be no soft talk here - after the 9/11 attacks , when the USA captured Afghanistan driving the Taliban into ungoverned parts of Pakistan celebratory videos were found of Osama bin Laden waxing eloquent on the attack on the twin towers .
A lame Saudi cleric Sheikh Atiyatullah who is clearly seen on the tape was taken back into Saudi Arabia afterwards and " forgiven " for his role in the attacks .
The Saudis have never allowed him to be questioned or interrogated by the USA leaving Washington looking as helpless as a beheaded chicken in the bargain while the Saudi monarchy underlined its association with those who were responsible through its protection of Atiyatullah .
In order to deny the biggest sponsors of Islamist terror their chief source of funds with which they finance their jihad against the rest of the world , therefore , there is no option that the West and its partners in India and China have other than to eliminate the use of Middle Eastern oil and starve the Middle East of its main source of income .
While some technologies to reduce oil consumption like nuclear technology and wind and solar energy exist and are being worked on , the fact is that none of this work is funded to any major extent in a race to rid the world of the use of oil as a fuel .
Some technologies like Solar Thermal Energy are currently available at an advanced stage and ready to be deployed in nations with exposure to sunlight , including to power starved states of the USA like California , Nevada , Arizona , Texas , Oklahoma , Georgia and Florida .
The use of insulated concrete form construction methods and the more advanced Thermasave ( trademark of www.thermasave.us) methods would effortlessly help reduce the use of energy to a considerable extent depending on the extent to which they are deployed in new construction around the world .
These methods could be further enhanced by integrating solar photovoltaic collectors and solar powered water heaters into all new constructions , reducing the need for oil to heat homes even in the colder parts of Europe and the USA and Canada and China .
There remains work to be done in the development of battery technology for transportation , but this could be achieved if the West put its mind to it .
Greater technical achievements have been made in the past under even more dire circumstances - the development of Radio as a the tool that won World War - 1 and of Radar that won World War - 2 are developments that come immediately to mind .
And the parallel is entirely apt as the world faces as great a danger from Middle Eastern terror as it did under Imperial Germany and under the Nazis .
The danger that the world faces from Middle eastern terror is vastly greater than it did from the Nazis because it was not dependent on the Nazis to supply it with a vital component for its daily existence and could , therefore , fight the Nazis on a one to one basis .
Defeating the current threat to the West 's existence would require weaning itself off its addiction to Middle Eastern oil and starving the Gulf nations of their main source of income .
And the Middle east has not , exactly , remained unaware of this possibility .
In recent months , as increasing awareness around the world pushes its nations to look for alternatives to oil , new bands of " experts " have come up offering to turn the Saudi deserts into a source of solar power to be sent into Europe via a new grid that would connect that nation across borders into European nations ' power grids .
Giving up national sovereignty as far as oil is concerned to surrender it immediately in order to buy electricity from the very nations that have used their income from oil to finance terror would be a terrible mistake , the equivalent of putting the Medellin and Cali cartels to oversee the Drug Enforcement Administration and Interpol simultaneously .
Southern Europe , like the Southern United States have enough land to generate a substantial amount of power and manage their energy needs by using more nuclear and wind and wave power in addition to solar power .
The sooner this happens , the better it would be for the world outside the borders of the murderous regimes that are clustered in the Middle East .

Iraq
War vet ’s service attacked in Ohio campaign By Joel Mowbray
When Josh Mandel got a call from the Marines last year asking him to return voluntarily to Iraq , he had much more to contemplate than when he first enlisted in 2000 .
He had just been elected to the Ohio state legislature .
Family considerations were also important to him .
He ultimately decided to serve a second tour in Iraq “ because I did n’t join the Marine Corps to say no when my country called , ” Mr. Mandel explains .
Of all the factors he weighed , Mr. Mandel says political concerns were not among them .
Now he has been forced to deal with the politics of that decision .
The opponent in his tough re-election fight , trial attorney Bob Belovich , is attacking Mr. Mandel ’s service , arguing that he abandoned voters .
Mr. Belovich ’s wife , Barbara , acknowledged in an interview for this column that she has told voters that Mr. Mandel “ went AWOL ” ( a military term for desertion ) by fighting in Iraq .
Even Mr. Mandel ’s motives for serving in Iraq are being questioned .
Mrs. Belovich claimed in an interview with this columnist that Mandel “ put his personal ambitions ahead of his constituents . ”
Asked why anyone would enter a war zone out of “ personal ambition , ” Barbara Belovich replied curtly , “ Certainly he was n’t serving our needs . ”
That ’s not how one prominent local Democrat sees it .
“ I have great respect for what Josh did .
To say that he did n’t serve his constituents by risking his life in Iraq is absurd , ” says Broadview Heights mayor Sam Alai .
Considered a rising star by the Ohio GOP , Mr. Mandel was n’t on anyone ’s radar two years ago .
In 2006 , he was a long - shot candidate to win his Cleveland - area district , where Democrats outnumber Republicans by well over two - to - one .
Democrats did n’t take him seriously , so they spent little money to retain the open seat .
But after knocking on almost 20,000 doors , Mr. Mandel scored a stunning victory .
Mr. Mandel faces a much tougher race this time around .
Ohio Democrats targeted him from the beginning , because at just 31 years old , he is seen as a top up - and - comer .
Progressive Majority , a moveon.org - affiliated political action committee that focuses on local races , has made defeating Mr. Mandel a top priority .
Then there ’s the Obama effect .
ACORN activists have blanketed the area , and every liberal group from moveon.org to the Obama campaign is working to maximize Democratic turnout .
The Belovich campaign has not been bashful in going after Mr. Mandel ’s military service .
At a major Democratic Party event in Cleveland this March , while Mr. Mandel was still in Iraq , Mrs. Belovich told Mr. Alai , “ Josh Mandel is n’t serving our country , he ’s serving George Bush . ”
Though in a phone interview Mr. Belovich denied hearing his wife ’s comments , Mr. Alai says that ’s impossible : “ We were so close , I could have reached out and smacked him in the face .
She said it , he heard it , and he said nothing .
It was clear he did n’t disagree . ”
At a Progressive Majority event in Cleveland this July , Mr. and Mrs. Belovich laid out their campaign blueprint for defeating Mandel .
“ [ Mandel ] feels that his obligation to George Bush is stronger than his , you know , his obligation to the people in the 17th District , ” Barbara Belovich said .
( An audio recording made by someone who overheard the discussion was recently posted online , and neither Bob nor Barbara Belovich deny making those remarks . )
As heard in the recording , Bob Belovich then added that Mandel won in 2006 in part because of his “ blue sign ” and “ Jewish name . ”
Asked recently by this columnist what he meant by the comment , Belovich stated that many people think Mr. Mandel is a Democrat , including some who think so because Mr. Mandel is Jewish .
Belovich , who is Catholic , then spent five minutes discussing the implications of Mr. Mandel being Jewish .
( The district ’s Catholic population is three to four times bigger than its Jewish one . )
“ To some Jewish voters , they would be attracted to him because he ’s Jewish .
To other Jewish voters , they would n’t support him because of his stance on the issues . ”
Questioned as to whether he was speaking of Jews generally or Jewish Democrats specifically , Mr. Belovich responded that he was referencing Jewish voters overall .
This apparently rules out the possibility of Jews supporting Mr. Mandel because of his policy positions or legislative achievements .
Asked if he thinks he ’ll receive Jewish votes for being Jewish himself , Mr. Mandel answered , “ Maybe my opponent has met people who blindly support me because I ’m Jewish , but I certainly have n’t . ”
As for the attacks on his decision to return to Iraq , Mr. Mandel says , “ If they want to take shots at me , I can defend myself .
But what they ’re saying comes awfully close to degrading the sacrifices of our young men and women over there now . ”
Attacks on Mr. Mandel ’s military service could easily backfire .
But given that the lines are still being repeated so close to the election suggests that they ’ve resonated with at least some voters in a district where the war remains deeply unpopular .
The obvious implication is that by serving in Iraq , Mr. Mandel was a do - nothing legislator .
Yet he was one of the two people who lead the successful fight to force Ohio ’s multi-billion dollar pension funds to divest from companies doing energy - related business in Iran and Sudan .
Pension fund managers agreed to start divesting when legislation co-sponsored by Mr. Mandel and Rep. Shannon Jones was poised for passage .
Knowing the enormity of the challenge facing him , Mr. Mandel is making one last push for the homestretch .
He vows to avoid negative campaigning .
And he is optimistic that voters will reject his opponent ’s tactics .
“ I really believe that no matter how someone feels about the war , just about everyone truly supports the troops , ” says Mr. Mandel .
For Josh Mandel to win re-election in his heavily Democratic district , he needs to be right .

Read more ... Divesting From the Islamic Republic By Jamie Glazov
Frontpage Interview ’s guest today is Joel Anderson , a California State Assemblyman who represents San Diego ’s East County .
FP : Joel Anderson , welcome to Frontpage Interview .
Anderson :
It 's my pleasure .
Thank you for having me , Jamie .
FP : You are focusing on Iran and pursuing Iran divestment bills and resolutions .
Tell us some of the things you are up to .
What inspires you to pursue these courses of action ?
Anderson :
In the State Assembly , I sit on the Public Employment committee , which has oversight of California 's public pension systems .
CalPERS and CalSTRS -- the public employees and schoolteachers -- are the two largest public pensions in the nation .
So , when I learned they were investing tens of billions of dollars in Iran , a terrorist regime , I was shocked and disappointed .
I knew we had to do something to stop this practice .
FP : Ok , so what did you do ?
Anderson : I introduced Assembly Bill 221 to divest CalPERS and CalSTRS from the Islamic Republic of Iran and prevent them from putting any more of our tax dollars at risk in a nation whose rogue leader craves nuclear technology and wants to start another Holocaust .
We worked hard and formed a broad coalition to push this measure through a number of committees , the floor of each house , and ultimately secured the Governor 's signature to make AB 221 law .
I knew this was the type of bill everyone should share credit and we encouraged legislators to sign on as co-authors .
Ultimately , people fundamentally understand money is the mother 's milk of terrorism .
FP : Have you encountered any obstacles from the Democrats in the CA Assembly and the CA Senate ?
How about pro-Islamic republic lobbyists ?
Anderson :
Well , ours was a bipartisan effort from the start .
I actually wrote AB 221 based on a piece of legislation that a Democrat had authored to stop our money from going to Sudan .
And before that , Democrat Maxine Waters -- prior to her election to Congress -- led the charge to divest from racial apartheid in South Africa .
With very few exceptions , Democrats and Republicans joined together early on for many different reasons , because everyone agrees that divesting from Iran is simply the right thing to do .
The most outspoken groups against my bill were outside radical groups tied to the Islamic Regime and California ’s State Teachers ’ Retirement System , who fought me in every committee hearing .
FP : Did you have the support of the Iranian opposition organizations and individuals in the US ?
Who are they ?
Anderson : Our coalition really was an amazing group .
We built a broad coalition from all walks of life : labor unions , ethnic organizations , holocaust survivors , state employees , students , you name it .
The Iranian groups were fantastic .
Roozbeh Farahanipour of Marze Por-Gohar , with the Iranians for a Secular Republic , testified before each legislative committee that heard the bill , and told his tragic , personal story of oppression by Iran 's government .
The Iranian American Chamber of Commerce , Committee for Religious Minority Rights in Iran , Iran of Tomorrow Movement , and Iranians for a Secular Republic also lent their strong support .
FP : Tell us a bit about Iran ’s human rights abuses and your efforts and plans to try to stop them .
Anderson : The Islamic Republic of Iran ’s lack of human rights includes public hangings , the stoning of innocent women , producing IEDS that kill civilians and promoting the ethnic genocide of a country .
This is where California can have a powerful impact .
By pulling back our hard - earned dollars from the companies that prop up this odious regime , we can send a clear message that supporting the Islamic Republic of Iran is the wrong place to invest our retirement nest eggs .
Our citizens want nothing to do with their blood money .
FP : What is the Assembly Concurrent Resolution ( ACR ) 79 ?
How did it do ?
Anderson : ACR 79 was a follow - up to AB 221 .
I wanted to carry forward the spirit and intent of AB 221 by pushing for University of California -- a $ 42 billion pension -- to join CalPERS and CalSTRS in divesting from Iran .
It gathered overwhelmingly bipartisan votes , as AB 221 did before , but the clock ran out before its final vote in the Senate .
FP : Tell us about Iran Divestment on California Port .
Anderson :
Other governmental entities are starting to realize the danger of risking their investment dollars in a place like the Islamic Republic of Iran .
We 've already seen the City of Los Angeles take steps toward shoring up their retirement system , and now , other public employees at the county level are looking at that , too .
As an example , the San Diego Port Authority has been in touch with me because they are concerned about the message we 're sending by putting public dollars in a place like Iran .
It is important to know we have a real opportunity to bring the Islamic Republic of Iran back to the world community without ever firing a shot .
We can do it through divestment .
FP : Joel Anderson , thank you for joining us .
Anderson : Thank you Jamie .

Read more ... OPEC's Heavy Hand By Walid Phares
Who manufactured the financial meltdown ?
It was n’t only Wall Street : OPEC ’s heavy hand is felt but unseen by the media and our politicians .
In bypassing a narrow economic analysis of the ongoing crisis , we can detect clearly the connection between the dizzying ups in petrol pricing and the slowing of American buying capacity .
Though we have to conclude that while it is due largely to both Wall Street ’s corruption and politicians ’ abuse of the system handed the tools of doom to the middle class , Main Street ’s rapid disenfranchisement was manufactured overseas , thousands of miles away , at the hands of many of the members of OPEC , the oil - producing Cartel .
Indeed , as economic commentators tell us ( including a strong accusation leveled by real estate tycoon Donald Trump on Fox News against OPEC ) , the oil powers are behind the instability that crumbled the will of millions of middle class Americans over the past three years .
If we go back in time , we can see that oil pricing by OPEC ’s hard core shows clearly that US leadership was n’t able to convince the top producers from the Gulf to give American oil consumers a chance .
Most producing regimes replied that demand -- mostly from China and India -- was putting pressure on production .
Pressed by Washington to produce more , the “ regimes ” alleged it would affect the selling price and thus minimize their profits , but promised they would try to “ be understanding ” of US needs in energy .
This attitude gave the producers discretion over price , while Jihadi propagandists roamed the media accusing Washington of putting unbearable pressure “ on the region ” to follow American injunctions in setting petrol ’s prices .
Was there a direct connection between the oil regimes and the Jihadi propagandist machine ?
We have no answer to that now , but clearly an oil strategy was in the works with a calculated impact on the US economy .
This charge is still in its early stages , it will be challenged ferociously , but it will stand as long as convincing answers are not provided .
What adds to the inquiry into the OPEC destabilization factor are the many indicators that strategic political motives have appeared to be behind the pricing maneuvers .
Over a period of half a decade , many voices heard on the region ’s airwaves have intimated that the US economy will be made to pay for what America ’s leadership is doing .
Commentators , some funded by oil producers on several outlets including on al Jazeera , underlined that as long as average citizens in the United States ( and eventually in the West ) do n’t feel financial pain , the war on terror and spreading of Democracy wo n’t be stopped .
Sheikh Yussuf al Qardawi , Muslim Brotherhood ideologue and mentor of the Qatari - funded channel , spoke openly of Silah al Naft , i.e , “ the weapon of oil . ”
Indeed , it was called a weapon - as in a warfare situation -- and most likely it was used as such .
Of course , the producing “ regimes ” will deny the existence of a real strategy to bring the US to its knees by striking at its pumps .
They will dismiss statements made by emirs and commentators in this regard .
The “ field Jihadists ” , however , wo n’t deny the existence of such a battlefield .
For years now , Salafist web sites and al Qaeda spokespersons have loudly called for an “ oil Jihad against infidel America and its lackeys . ”
Online material is still circulating .
But more revealing are the official speeches by Osama Bin Laden and his deputy on the “ absolute necessity to use that weapon . ”
Ayman Zawahiri called expressly and repetitively on the public to sell their US dollars and buy gold instead ( Be ’u al dullar washtaru al zahab ) .
These were stunning statements ignored by most analysts at the time but that are making sense today .
He predicted a collapse in the infidels ’ economy , starting from American markets .
Was he a part of the lobbying effort in the OPEC game ?
Most likely not , but he seems to have been privy to the game , having insiders in the Wahhabi radical circles in the Peninsula : in the end there are too many political signs to dismiss and the analysis of price warfare is too evident to ignore .
OPEC ’s manipulation of the markets did hit Americans hard in their pockets .
Hundreds of millions of John and Jane Does were intimidated , terrorized really , into abandoning their lifelong dreams of owning properties because of the aggressive stance of petro-regimes towards the US and its campaign to spread democracy in the Greater Middle East .
In historical terms , America was punished for daring to change the status quo in the Arab and Muslim world to the advantage of the weakest and the suppressed : Shia and Kurds in Iraq , Syrian reformers , Lebanese civil society , Africans in Darfur , Iranian women and students , artists and liberals across the Arabian Peninsula .
In return , the U.S was submitted to economic destabilization , steady , gradual and by small doses .
Let ’s not underestimate the power of the Jihadi-oil lobby in America : it has decades of influence and it has long arms into the system , and it has powerful political allies .
It knows when Americans are messing up their own system , and it knows very well how to push them over the cliff , into the abyss of economic calamity .
A counterpoint to this thesis would vigorously argue that the alleged OPEC destabilization over the US economy is illogical , as many countries in the Gulf are experiencing a recession as a result of Wall Street ’s crunch .
In other words , they would n’t do it to themselves .
Yet the ideological forces manning the oil weapon are n’t particularly concerned about economic stability .
Their driving factor is Jihadism .
We ’ve heard their ideologues stating that even if they were to incur losses among their own societies in order to defeat the infidel powers , then let it be .
Ten percent losses in local companies and markets are a price that radicals would absorb if the final prize is an earth - shattering change in US policy in the region and a triumphant return to pre-9/11 status .
I find the rationale of this policy very Jihadist : if a world economic crisis is needed to remove the US democratization efforts from the region and to end its post 9/11 campaigns , the end justifies the means .
In addition , how intriguing to see that Saudi Arabia and other producers are among the very few who did n’t have to pump much cash into their markets yet ( Per news Agencies , today ) .
What some oil regimes -- or the ideological forces within -- want to accomplish from this alleged interference in US economics is to provoke a “ regime change ” in Washington , D.C. , so that regimes in their region are not challenged anymore .
But another issue is also coming to the surface : pressures against America ’s financial structures seem to have escalated in parallel to increasing US talk and commitment to achieving energy independence .
Since last April , the American debate finally reached a dramatic conclusion : “ We ’re sending 700 Billion Dollars a year to regimes that dislike us ; ” agree most national leaders ; “ and furthermore some of that money is ending up in the hands or accounts of Terrorists ” affirm some among them .
This revolutionary conclusion is a direct affront to the multi- decades - long dominance of petro- dollars in US politics .
What America is readying itself to do is to achieve its most dramatic war of independence since 1776 : ending the dependence on Middle East Oil .
Therefore , let ’s not be surprised that these gigantic interests would strike at the heart of this economic revolution , as I coined it in my latest book , The Confrontation .
Back to the ongoing crisis on these shores , we nevertheless must admit that the original sins are domestic first : financial drunkenness and economic recklessness .
Without these plagues , outside forces would n’t have been able to shake up America ’s stability .
But assuming that most capitalist societies travel through rough patches , it is vital to realize that America ’s economy is under attack by forces aiming to maintain US dependency on foreign energy , as a means to obstruct the rise of democracy .
Seven years after 9/11 , Americans are paying the price of liberty from their own economic flesh .

Read more ... The Soaring Price of Oil and Terrorism By Victor Comras
A few days ago , when oil was just $ 115.00 per barrel , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declared that the price of oil was still “ unrealistically low , ” and that “ Oil … needs to discover its real value . "
And , within a few days the market seemed to comply driving the price up to $ 120.00 per barrel !
The effects of this spiraling oil price on the US and world economy has been staggering , and the impact will continue to be intensified as the price of oil works its way through the international economic system .
Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups could never had imagined that events they set off at the turn of the millennium could ever have caused such oil dislocation and demand around the world .
Against this background it is with great trepidation that I put my pen to addressing the link between the price of oil and terrorism .
The factors involved in the pricing of oil are both extremely obscure and enormously complex , and few people can truly claim to understand them .
I certainly am not one of them .
But , broken down into its most basic components it apparently involves a mixture of the following factors : OPEC Oligarchy practices , intensified international competition for secure access to essential commodities , increased reliance on middlemen for oil lifting , profit - motive purchasing policies and upstream practices of major oil companies , the falling dollar , and intense speculative upward bidding of oil futures on the world ’s merchantile exchanges .
Taken together these factors have driven up the spot price of oil and pumped tens ( dare I say hundreds ) of billions of dollars into the coffers of countries known to either encourage or tolerate state and / or private funding for terrorism .
One may well conclude , as I am beginning to believe , that mercantile speculation , greed , and corporate profit taking are as responsible as OPEC , if not more so , for the windfall profits that help fund terrorism .
Iran 's Oil Minister Gholam - Hossein Nozari had a different answer .
Speaking before the representatives of some 60 exporting and consumer countries at the bi-annual International Energy Forum , he blamed the spike in oil prices on “ war and sanctions , ” alluding to the measures the US had adopted toward both Iran and Iraq .
But , this simplistic explanation does n’t match reality .
In fact , today ’s oil prices do n’t seem to have any direct relationship to the actual oil market conditions , demand and consumption .
The fact is that oil output has generally kept pace with actual consumption rates , and bookings for oil transport ships and tankers are actually declining showing a slackening in demand .
Speculation based on future worst case assumptions seems to be pressing the price of the oil , not past events .
This includes anything from a projected heavy hurricane season to recent attacks on Nigeria ’s Shell oil pipelines .
But , the supply effect of such events in the past have been shown to be quite minimal and of short duration .
Any reason to push oil prices higher seems to suffice for the oil traders .
Another explanation for today ’s high oil prices is the declining value of the dollar .
So why is n’t it that Europe is getting a bargain when it comes to buying oil ?
The fact is that the price of oil in Europe has also hit the roof , causing European leaders to consider extraordinary measures , such as drawing on their emergency oil reserves .
The EU commission has just decided to launch its own “ public consultation ” on whether changes should be made to the management of emergency oil stocks held by EU members in the face of these skyrocketing prices .
Today ’s oil prices are considerably higher than anyone could have predicted a year or so ago .
Look at what the International Energy Agency projected in their annual World Energy Outlook for 2007 .
They predicted that oil prices would now be the range of $ 45 to $ 56 per barrel , and would only reach $ 95.00 per barrel sometimes in 2030 .
Boy , are we ahead of that curve !.
Remember , that in 2000 , OPEC oil was selling for under $ 28.00 a barrel and oil consumption somewhere around 76 million barrels per day .
Current estimates put oil consumption at around 84 million barrels , about the same as current production levels .
So , in actual fact , it is the oil speculators that appear to be responsible , more than any other group , for the high prices of oil , and the revenue boasts that may help support terrorism .
Perhaps its time for governments to get a handle on such speculation by intervening in the oil market , as necessary to stabilize the price of oil .
Just a thought !

Advertisement India 's Tata group has abandoned plans to build the world 's cheapest car in the eastern state of West Bengal .
Tata group chief Ratan Tata said : " We have little choice but to move out of Bengal .
We can not run a factory with police around all the time . "
He was speaking after protests in a row over land acquired from local farmers .
The car , the Nano , is expected to cost about 100,000 rupees ( $ 2,130 ) .
It was due to be launched in October and will be ready " this year " , Mr Tata said .
We will have to make the best of the deadline that we have
Tata group chief Ratan Tata
The BBC's Subir Bhuamik in Calcutta says the company is initially expected to produce several thousand Nanos this year at other sites in India .
It had planned to make 250,000 cars a year at the Singur plant in West Bengal , rising to 350,000 .
A number of other car firms also plan vehicles to compete with the Nano but have not yet begun production .
The dispute in West Bengal highlights a wider problem between India 's growing industry - which needs land - and its farmers who are unwilling to give it up .
' Offers ' Work at Tata 's Singur plant has been suspended since the end of August following protests led by the state 's opposition Trinamul Congress party .
Exclusive look at the Tata Nano Mr Tata said the Nano will be built " within this year but I can't tell you where " .
" We are going to do everything possible to come close to the deadline we had established , " he told journalists in Calcutta .
" We have got offers from several Indian states but we have not yet finalised where to produce the Nano ...
All these issues we will announce in the next few days when we have a clearer picture . "
Mr Tata said his group would still consider West Bengal as an investment destination in future .
" I value the considerable intellectual resources this state has , but something will have to change here , " he said .
He was speaking after meeting the West Bengal chief minister Buddhadev Bhattacharya and his colleagues .
" This is a black day for Bengal .
We will have so much more difficulty getting investments now , " said the state 's industry minister , Nirupam Sen.
Compensation
The West Bengal government acquired 1,000 acres of land for the Nano project two years ago .
More than 10,000 farmers accepted compensation for their land , but just over 2,000 of them refused and demanded land be returned .
During the protests
Tata 's engineers and workers were attacked , prompting the group to stop work .
Our correspondent says the Bengal governor then intervened and tried to mediate a deal between the government and the opposition but that did not work .
The plant was seen as a key part of industrialisation efforts in what is one of India 's least developed states .

What are these ?
A banking system in crisis after the collapse of a housing bubble .
An economy hemorrhaging jobs .
A market - oriented government struggling to stem the panic .
Sound familiar ?
It does to Sweden .
The country was so far in the hole in 1992  after years of imprudent regulation , short - sighted economic policy and the end of its property boom  that its banking system was , for all practical purposes , insolvent .
But Sweden took a different course than the one now being proposed by the United States Treasury .
And Swedish officials say there are lessons from their own nightmare that Washington may be missing .
Sweden did not just bail out its financial institutions by having the government take over the bad debts .
It extracted pounds of flesh from bank shareholders before writing checks .
Banks had to write down losses and issue warrants to the government .
Police have no leads in the search for a missing Barrie teen , despite an air and ground search and a massive flyer campaign over the weekend .
The father of 15 - year - old Brandon Crisp , meanwhile , says his son 's addiction to an Xbox game may have led to his disappearance .
Brandon was last seen on Monday , Oct. 13 at 3 p.m. when he left his Hickling Trail home after fighting with his parents , who wanted him to stop playing video games .
" He left because we took his Xbox away , " said Steve Crisp , Brandon 's father .
He says his son was losing sleep because he spent so much time playing Call of Duty , a World War II - themed shooting game .
" This was his addiction . "
Brandon asked for directions to Oro Medonte township , a semirural area east of Barrie where some of his friends lived , before taking off on his yellow and black Huffy bicycle .
That day , a resident of the area found a similar bike near Ridge Rd. and Second Line .
She left the bike in the area , but by the weekend , it was missing .
Police focused their search on the area , calling in helicopters and canine units to scour the area Sunday .
The search came up empty .
Over the weekend , Brandon 's parents and volunteers fanned out across the city and the surrounding area to put up posters with the teen 's picture and hand out flyers .
Brandon has n't contacted any of his friends , and although police have received reports of several sightings of the teen , none has turned out to be him .
" Most ( runaways ) return home within 24 hours after they 've cooled off , " said Barrie police Sgt. Dave Goodbrand , adding that the police are broadening their search beyond the Barrie area .
" He could have hopped on a bus , he could have hitchhiked out there . "
Although police have determined that he has n't logged onto his Xbox since he left , they are still trying to track down anyone he might have met playing Call of Duty .
" My personal feeling is that he 's met someone online through this game , " said Steve .
" As a parent , you fear the worst when you do n't hear anything for seven days . "
Brandon 's parents had tried to limit his Xbox use , but it did n't work , prompting them to take the console away .
" ( Kids ) play these games and it becomes an addiction .
It becomes their whole life , " he said .
Steve wants his son to contact someone - even if it is n't his family - to let them know he 's safe .
" I want to make sure that he knows that he wo n't be in trouble if he comes home .
We love him and we just want to get him home safe , " he said .

Crisp is 5 - foot - 3 , weighs 100 pounds and was last seen dressed in blue jeans , a burgundy American Eagle hoodie , a yellow and grey jacket with white running shoes with a camouflage stripe .
Anyone who might know where he is can contact Barrie police at 705-725-7025 .
The talk started in late September .
That ’s when Anderson Silva , the UFC middleweight champion regarded by many as the No. 1 pound - for - pound fighter in the world , said on a Brazilian TV show that he was going to retire in 2009 .
Silva ’s manager , Ed Soares , explained that his fighter would finish out the six remaining bouts on his UFC contract .
Although Soares ’ statement seemed to appease some fans , others understood that Silva ’s retirement could still come soon even if he fights six more times .
“ Everything has its time , ” Silva told Sherdog.com in an exclusive video interview , “ and I believe my time is already over . ”
So what would be Silva ’s next move if he does retire ?
Boxing maybe ?
Coaching ?
“ I ’m going to be fat , with a big belly by the side of the Octagon , eating popcorn behind the scenes , making my imitations and screaming for the fighters : “ Go there !
Kick his face !
Put him down ! ”
Silva , who is famous around the Brazilian fight scene for his uncanny impersonations of fighters and trainers , also discussed with Sherdog.com whether compensation has played a role in his decision as well as whether he has been motivated to train for his title defense against Patrick Cote on Oct. 25 at UFC 90 .
Ant fills a hole with its whole body .
I do n't use the word " amazing " and " great " very often .
It 's amazing , I know , but with a great vocabulary like mine , there 's usually a great many options for words that you can use .
But I have to say : Ants , they 'reAnd yes , they 're amazing .
Growing up , and going to Elementary school , you 're guaranteed to get made fun of at some point in your life .
There 's very few who have never been the butt of a joke .
Maybe you were the fat kid , or the dorky kid .
Maybe you ate glue , or smelled bad .
In my case , I was a boy with the name Alishah .
The only equalizer in all of this was that we all got made fun of at some point - but the fact still remained , we were all very cruel .
And little has changed , I 've found .
There 's fewer people who eat glue , that 's for sure - but there 's strong evidence in this world ( particularly if you pay any attention to Global affairs , politics , or even the Olympics ) that we humans seldom get along .
In fact , the sad truth of it is , whenever we do get along , someone has to go ahead and point out how great it is that we 're able to get along - which says without saying , that the norm is quite the contrary - otherwise there would be no need to remark anything .
It seems to me that the only time humans ever unify , the only time we set aside our differences , is in Hollywood movies .
And Hollywood itself knows this whole " getting along " thing is a little far fetched itself , so it 's only ever reserved for one specific circumstance : fighting aliens , or rogue robots .
And even in those scenarios , we often find ourselves in two circumstances : i)
We 're all united , because somehow we 're all American , as in Starship Troopers . ii )
Despite a united humanity , there are still some of us who will help out the rogue robots ( see : The Matrix ) .
But ants ?
Ants , now they get along .
Not only do they get along , but they 're all about the comradery .
Giving oneself up for the greater good .
There is no I in team .
That 's ants .
In 2007 a popular article floated around the world , and the internet , when humans discovered how selfless ants can bee .
Pictures of ants running to find food , with the ones finding pot holes immediately filling up the hole with their own bodies .
That 's what I call taking one for the team .
If you missed out on this great story , be sure to read Living plugs : smooth ant journey But now , I 've found out - ants consider themselves much more than hole - fillers .
Humans came up with a great number of ideas when it came to crossing various precipices : hanging bridges made of vines , which later became rope and wooden planks , then later steel cables with wooden planks , eventually just steel girders .
We went so far as to even creating University courses and giving people degrees just so they can help us cross canyons .
Ants though - ants decided , why use wood or steel , when you can use yourself ?
And so now we are finding that not only are ants willing to throw their bodies over a hole , so the team can run without pause ( compare this to Sir Walter Raleigh , who only sacrificed his overcoat so the Queen could cross a puddle - sure it 's romantic , but ladies , would n't you prefer a man to toss his entire self over that puddle so you can - quite literally - walk all over him ? ) but they 're also willing to let themselves be used as make - shift bridges .
The idea is simple , yet bold : Do n't bring equipment , just bring yourselves ( and a lot of friends ) !
But then , maybe there 's something to us humans .
We brought rope and wood , because we felt : " Hey , let 's get everyone across this chasm .
I 'm tired of always stepping on Joey !
He 's such a good kid !
Let 's come up with a way that we can all cross , without some of us plummeting to our death when arms get tired . "
But any idea for comradery was immediately crushed when we did cross that chasm with our rope and wood bridge , just to kill the people on the other side of the chasm .
The fact is , ants get along in a way we humans will never understand .
We consider ourselves the most intelligent creatures on Earth .
Moreover , we 'll kill each other to prove that the people living on this land mass , are smarter than the people living on that land mass - and as we build our bridge , we watch those silly little ants building their own bridge out of themselves .
Being the smart creatures we are , we immediately assume that any other creature of intelligence must therefore be like us .
So we call them Army Ants , convinced their building bridges purely to wage war .
Meanwhile , the ants on both land masses are working together building a very long ant - bridge , so they can move around freely - and likely , without Passports .
I wish there was some lesson to be learned from all this , but I 'm convinced any lesson here would just be lost on us .
The ants do n't need the lesson .
They already get it .
And we humans are only able to look at them , and smile at their silly Engineering .
Eventually we get bored , and then we step on their sand - houses , and watch them frantically scurry around to reconstruct their house - just so that we can crush it again , passing the time while we await instructions on which human house to crush next .
Thanks ants .
Thants .

Git vs. Mercurial : Please Relax
August 7 , 2008 at 7:12 pm
Everyone ’s up in arms to embrace distributed version control as the new must - have tool for the developer in the know .
Though many people have not yet migrated from Subversion , those that have almost invariably extoll the virtues of their particular choice .
But though all of the major DVCS ’s have features that set them above the previous generation of centralized systems , none stands head - and - shoulders above the others as Subversion does among the last generation : each of them was designed for a specific purpose , and each of them will serve those with different habits , workflows and development styles differently .
Having used both git and Mercurial for the better part of a year , I ’ve had the opportunity to compare the two .
It saddened me to see a Twitter - based debate flamewar erupt over which is better , so I thought I ’d do my best to try and ease the tension – with analogies !
Git is MacGyver
Git ’s design philosophy is unmistakably that of Unix : unlike Subversion , CVS , or Mercurial , git is not one monolithic binary but a multitude of individual tools , ranging from high - level “ porcelain ” commands such as git- pull , git - merge , and git - checkout to low - level “ plumbing ” commands such as git- apply , git - hash - object and git - merge - file .
So , like MacGyver , you can do just about anything you need with Git – this includes totally awesome Wiki engines , issue trackers , filesystems , sysadmin tools – everything short of fuse repair :
As such , git is not so much a version control system as it is a tool for building your own version - controlled workflow .
For example , when faced with the fact that no git tool performs the equivalent of hg addremove – a useful Mercurial command that adds all untracked files and removes all missing files – I found one line to a script originally written by James Robey :
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# git-addremove
git add .
git ls-files - deleted | xargs git rm
Git ’s branching , tagging , merging , and rebasing are near flawless : git ’s merging algorithm is close to omniscient , having once merged 12 Linux kernel patches simultaneously .
Additionally , git provides you with tools to go back in time and edit your commit history – useful for those of us who have left certain critical elements out of a commit and had to quickly recommit with a helpful message such as “ oops ” .
( And when I say “ those of us ” , I mean “ every developer , ever ” . )
Personally , I elect to only use this feature to edit my last commit ( using git commit -- amend ) ; I have never needed or wanted to meddle further with the past .
git is also extremely fast thanks to its C codebase .
There is no better emblem of git ’s flexibility than GitHub .
GitHub ’s rise to success has been positively meteoric , and with good reason .
It ’s a brilliantly - designed site that serves as more than a pretty , browsable frontend to my source tree in that it brings a social aspect to programming – using Git , I can fork anyone ’s project , make my changes , petition for them to be included in the main repository , and pull other people ’s changes to mine .
Though it took a while for me to adjust to the anarchic notion of every user having their own equally - valid fork of a project – should n’t there be one definitive version of a project ?
– I realized its potential when working with other contributors to Nu .
Add the fact that GitHub is one of the most solid and reliable services I ’ve ever used , and you ’ve got what very well might be the deal - breaker in the fight for DVCS dominance .
On the other hand , migrating from Subversion / CVS to git requires a lot of work .
Linus has made it clear that he disagrees with the fundamental ideas behind Subversion / CVS , referring to SVN as “ the most pointless project ever started ” .
As such , the git project has consciously made no effort to make the migration to git easy : the revert command in Subversion resets your current working copy to the last commit , but in git undoes a supplied patch and commits the changes needed to remove that patch .
( The equivalent command for svn revert in git is git reset -- hard HEAD^ . )
Whining about this on the git mailing list is a little like this :
Get it ?
No ?
Too bad .
Apparently the choices that Linus et . al made when designing git are sensible – if , of course , you understand the internal structure of git and how it stores your data .
I ’m afraid I ’m only halfway through PeepCode ’s great Git Internals , so I ca n’t comment on whether that statement is true .
But I have to admit that if I had to read a $ 9 , 100 - page PDF to learn every new tool I downloaded , I would have no time and no money .
This brings us to another of git ’s faults : its documentation is terrible .
Man pages are no longer a sufficient replacement for a good , well - updated wiki or reference work ; git ’s wiki still has a long , long way to go .
Add in the fact that since , like many OS X users , I installed git through MacPorts , only the main git tool comes with a man page , leaving me to consult the Web to find out exactly how to format revision specifiers .
I ’ve observed that developers that were able to learn git from colleagues already familiar with git and its internals tend to have a higher opinion of it , in contrast to people such as myself that had to waste a lot of time digging around through Google and the man pages .
However , considering the fact that git is supposed to be a platform , one would suppose that it would have clear , bridgable functions to reuse in your own C projects and bridge to other languages .
One would be completely wrong – libgit . a is a joke , and the Ruby git gem ( and my own vastly - inferior Nu/ Git bindings ) depend on running shell commands and parsing the output , which really gets quite tiresome after a while .
The fact that console output may differ from platform to platform and any new feature may change the format of console output makes me very reluctant to commit to maintaining my Nu / Git bridge .
( I swear , that ’s the reason .
It ’s not because I ’m lazy . )
In conclusion , Git is perfect for command - line wizards , people with large teams and complicated projects , and those who need their DVCS to be endlessly configurable .
Certain developers have a workflow which , when interrupted , causes much grief and lamentation – if that description fits you , then git is almost certainly what you want , because it can be molded to fit the most esoteric workflow .
Solo developers and those accustomed to working with centralized VCS ’s may find git to be hostile , unfriendly and needlessly complex .
When I work on a large project with many committers , I prefer git and GitHub .
Mercurial is James Bond
mercurial |mərˌkyoŏrēəl|
adjective
1 ) Subject to sudden or unpredictable changes of mood or mind : his mercurial temperament .
Though there have been many unfortunate open - source project names , Mercurial ( also referred to by its command - line - tool name , hg ) is both apt and unfortunate : though it is definitely speedy , both in terms of learning curve and execution speed , it is also at times inconsistent , maddening , and unpredictable .
Mercurial is like James Bond : though they are not suited for each and every job , put them in a situation for which they are prepared and you will get things done .
( If your programming job is as exciting as a Bond movie , please get in touch with me right away when one of your programmers is killed in action . )
In contrast to git ’s philosophy of providing a flexible platform built out of individual components , Mercurial is monolithic and ( relatively ) inflexible .
Developers who like to keep their system clean will probably appreciate the fact that hg installs one binary in contrast to the 144 that make up git , and developers who think that git ’s ability to edit your previous commits is moronic , unnecessary , and dangerous will appreciate the simplicity hg provides by omitting that particular feature .
Compared to git , hg ’s branching , merging and tagging systems are equally powerful and only slightly slower .
The only current flaw in Mercurial ’s branching system – and sweet crouching Jesus , is it ever a huge flaw – is that deleting named branches is unbelievably difficult : as far as I can tell , the only way to do so is to learn and enable the patch - queuing system ( about which I have heard raves , but have not had the time yet to sit down and grok ) and use the hg strip command , or install the local - branches extension .
Selenium currently recommend you use tags instead of branches , which practically redefines the concept of a half - assed solution .
Despite that glaring flaw , the rest of hg is excellent .
It functions almost identically to Subversion in the commands that it shares , and the new concepts – branching , merging , etc. – are easily learned and intuitive .
Whereas I ’m still learning how to do relatively basic things in git , I learned pretty much all of hg ’s functionality in about a day .
If you ’re familiar with Subversion , transitioning to Mercurial should be a piece of cake – the functions you ’re familiar with will be there , and the new functions are easy - to - learn and well - documented .
Though I ’ve never tried to integrate Mercurial ’s functionality into my own projects , I hear that since it ’s written in Python it ’s very easy just to import its classes and call them programatically rather than parse the output of shell scripts .
I wanted to write a Mercurial frontend for OS X ( I was planning to call it ‘ hermetic ’ – get the elaborate literary pun ? ) , but the viral nature of the GPL discouraged me – since no company has granted me stock options for my code , I ’m a little reluctant to just give away the fruits of my labors .
Mercurial ’s answer to GitHub is BitBucket , which I have not tried yet .
If I do , I will update this entry posthaste .
In conclusion , Mercurial is the yin to git ’s yang : those such as myself who are constantly experimenting with new ways to work and write code will object less to the restrictions that hg imposes on workflows .
After switching to Mercurial for a small two - person project last year , my collaborator observed that Mercurial feels a lot more Mac - like – usability and smoothness of operation trump Unix philosophy when necessary .
If I do n’t have to share my code with anyone , I tend to use Mercurial in order to get things done faster .
So , What ’s My Point ?
To paraphrase Colin Wheeler , it ’s OK to proselytize to those who have not switched to a distrubuted VCS yet , but trying to convert a git user to Mercurial ( or vice - versa ) is a waste of everyone ’s time and energy .
If you want to switch to a DVCS , then here are five easy steps :
Evaluate your workflow and decide which tool suits you best .
Learn how to use your chosen tool as well as you possibly can .
Help newbies to make the transition .
Shut up about the tools you use and write some code .

In the nation 's first such ruling , a federal judge on Wednesday said copyright owners must consider " fair use " of their works before sending takedown notices to online video - sharing sites .
... " Even if Universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement , the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright , " U.S. District Judge Jeremy Fogel ruled .
" Accordingly , in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the DMCA with ' a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner , its agent , or the law , ' the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright . "
Fogel added that an " allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim . "
Another of those rare bits of good news Background : " fair use " of a small portion of copyrighted material , for education , journalism , criticism , or satire , has always been permitted under copyright law .
The truly vile Digital Millenium Copyright Act , thanks to heavy lobbying , tilted the playing field far in the direction of copyright owners , by allowing them to demand that material be removed from the Internet on a mere allegation of infringement .
As a vain measure to prevent this power from being misused , the DMCA allowed legal recourse if the " takedown " notice involved misrepresentation of the infringement .
Up to now , DMCA " misrepresentation " has been prosecuted about as often as false allegations of child abuse during divorce proceedings ( i.e. , approximately never ) .
Now Judge Fogel has taken some of that advantage away from Big Media , by ruling that falsely claiming a fair use is " infringement " is , in fact , misrepresentation .
A salute to the Electronic Frontier Foundation for winning this ruling !
Terri Schiavo suffered a heart attack in 1990 at age 26 .
As a result she had cardiac arrest and although she was revived the resultant lack of blood supply to her brain caused significant damage .
For the next 15 years Terri remained in a persistent vegetative state ( PVS ) , requiring a feeding tube for hydration and nutrition but able to breath on her own .
PVS results from significant damage to both hemispheres of the brain .
The more primitive and basic function in the deep parts of the brain and the brain stem may be intact , but the thinking part of the brain is too damaged to allow for consciousness .
Although there is nothing particularly interesting in the Schiavo case from a neurological perspective – PVS is not uncommon – in 2005 the case came to national attention .
The story involved her husband , who wanted to remove her feeding tube and allow her to die , and her parents , who sought legal action to prevent the removal of her feeding tube .
The conflict surrounding Terri Schiavo became a test case for the religious right ’s support for right to life issues , the right of a husband to make life and death decisions for his comatose wife , the right of her family to intervene , and the role of the government in such decisions .
Emotions ran high on all sides as the case touched on the right to life vs the right to privacy issue that remains very divisive in this country .
A media storm ensued .
Somewhat lost in all the politics , however , were the medical facts underlying the case .
Now a new study ( the paper is not available without a subscription , so I linked to the press release ) published yesterday online in the journal Neurology reviews the media coverage of the Schiavo case , focusing on the completeness and accuracy of the reporting .
Not surprisingly , the study authors found the coverage to be wanting .
Dr. Éric Racine of the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montréal ( IRCM ) and experts from Stanford University , in California , and the University of British Columbia reviewed 1141 articles and over 400 letters to the editor .
They found that only 1 % of the articles defined persistent vegetative state , a point critical to the story .
Dr. Racine also reports :
“ In the course of our research , we were surprised by the amount of medical inaccuracies that these newspapers had published .
Some journalists even wrote about Mrs. Schiavo ’s reactions to specific words or expressions supposedly showing that she was conscious .
“ Our observations show that the press capitalized on the controversy to a large extent , and selling copies mattered more than delivering scientific information .
Media coverage sustained myths and false hopes . ”
They also found that 21 % of reports indicated that there was hope of recovery .
That was the very crux of the controversy .
Someone who has been in a PVS for 15 years has no meaningful chance of recovery .
Sixteen separate neurologists examined Terri Schiavo over the course of the court cases about her condition , and they all agreed , after extensive examination , that she was in a PVS .
The only exception was Dr. William Hammesfahr .
He said that she could recover , and that his special treatment could help her .
By coincidence I had previously been asked by the state of Florida to give expert testimony regarding Dr. Hammesfahr ’s special treatment , which I found to be completely pseudoscientific and even unethical .
This is a separate story , but the end result was that the judge found Dr. Hammesfahr ’s treatment to be substandard and ruled against him .
But on appeal Hammesfahr ’s lawyer argued that his treatment was “ alternative ” and under a recent Florida statute “ alternative ” treatments could not be held to a standard of care .
We can suffice to say that Hammesfahr ’s opinion was an outlier and there are reasons not to give it any credence whatsoever .
This did not stop a major news outlet ( Hannity and Colmes on Fox ) from choosing him to be the source of neurological opinion in the case .
From a political perspective , the Schiavo case clearly indicated that the majority of Americans favor privacy in such issues over government intrusion .
The Congress overstepped their bounds in trying to meddle in the case , and the conventional wisdom is that the affair ended the presidential aspirations of Senator Bill Frist .
He heavily supported the right - to - life side of this controversy .
But worse , he is also a physician , and he announced that he reviewed a video tape of Terri Schiavo and concluded that she was not in a PVS .
It was generally seen as crass political maneuvering to use his status as a physician to bolster his political opinions – especially when his medical opinions turned out to be completely wrong .
From the perspective of the media , this new study supports what many of us subjectively felt – that the media focussed on the controversy and did not adequately give the scientific / medical facts around which the case turned .
Many outlets even gave false , inadequate , or misleading information or relied upon cherry - picked experts to support the minority opinion .
Sometimes this was just bad journalism , but often the scientific errors supported the politics of the writer or news outlet .
The neurology of the case , in the end , was not truly controversial .
It was clear that Terri Schiavo was in a PVS and had no hope of recovery .
The parents and others made a common error is assessing her condition .
In a PVS people will still have sleep - wake cycles , they will open their eyes , have roving eye movements , turn their head and sometimes grimace or move .
These actions , however , are random and not accompanied by any detectable conscious thought .
It takes careful and trained observation to see that the actions are random and not directed .
Casual , untrained , or emotional observation , however , typically will seek out random correlations and then confirmation bias will result in the false conclusion that the actions are conscious or are reacting to the environment .
In the Schiavo case hours of video was reviewed to find a couple of instances when Schiavo happened to turn her head when someone called her name , or when she seemed to be looking toward a visitor .
However , the neurologists examined and viewed her for hours and found that her actions did not correlate with any stimulation – they were random .
The occasional correlation of an action with a stimulus is just chance .
This is a common experience for neurologists .
Family members commonly over - interpret such random movements , or even subconscious reflexes .
It is the job of the neurologist to interpret the exam clinically , without emotion , and to explain their findings to the family in order to give them accurate information with which they can make their very difficult decisions .
And that is the final lesson in all this .
There were emotional , personal , societal , and political decisions to be made in this case – and the science alone was not enough to resolve these important issues .
But such questions should be informed by accurate and unbiased science .
What often happened instead was that the science was distorted to suit the politics .
At least in this case there was significant closure .
Schiavo ’s husband , Michael , ultimately won the court battle and had her feeding tube removed .
She passed away on March 31 , 2005 .
The results of her autopsy were reported several months later – it showed that her brain weighed only half of what it should have weighed .
She had irreversible catastrophic brain damage compatible with a persistent vegetative state , and incompatible with any conscious awareness or hope of recovery .
( In a shocking display of the power of denial , Schiavo ’s parents refused to accept the findings of the autopsy . )
This was consistent with the consensus of clinical neurological opinion ( putting aside the one self - promoting quack ) .
The entire affair should stand as a cautionary tale .
When a public controversy rests upon an empirical scientific claim , it is best to listen to the consensus of scientific opinion so at least the public discussion can be well informed .
It is perilous to give equal weight to a dubious minority opinion , to cherry - pick facts and opinions that support one ’s politics , or to listen to the scientific opinions of politicians or those with a significant personal or ideological interest .
These lessons apply to many science - based controversies still relevant today .

Why did you vote for Bush ?
George W Bush was re-elected as President of the United States with a majority of Americans choosing him over Democrat John Kerry .
Mr Bush won both the popular and electoral college votes and has strengthened his control of Congress .
His second term in office does not officially begin until January , but he has already pledged " to reach out " to a divided nation .
What convinced you to re-elect Bush ?
What are your hopes for his second term ?
This debate is now closed .
Read a selection of your comments below .
Your comments : I voted for W because the most paramount issue facing America is replacing a runaway Supreme Court with justices who will interpret our constitution literally , not impose their ideas of social engineering on the masses .
John , Philadelphia , PA I am an old guy who was first eligible to vote for president in 1972 .
I also have studied both world and US history extensively .
I am convinced that our best presidents are those who have a moral compass and the will to carry out their agenda .
It does not matter whether I agree with all of the agenda or not ( I would not have agreed with FDR 's socialist agenda ) the results for the country have always been far better than when we had a leader who drifted with political winds ( Clinton , whom I also voted for ) .
Bush has the moral compass .
Kerry does not .
He changed positions depending upon audience .
His late Viet Nam actions also , in my opinion , disqualified him from serving as the US President .
Phil Qualls , Fredericksburg , VA Just remember that you sleep in safety tonight because Americans , led by our president , are willing to die for your safety
Gary Williams , Granbur I voted for George W Bush because I believe he 's a man of strong convictions , beliefs and principles .
I 'm a native Texan and I see in President Bush the best of the Texas character .
Now , our European cousins might not understand us because they 've lost their clear sense of right and wrong .
They might not see that the world really is pretty much black and white , right and wrong .
You treat others as you want to be treated - that 's right .
You hurt someone else , that 's wrong .
Every man has a right to defend his family from harm .
Every man has the right to see justice served .
You may not like our president but you 'd better thank God he 's in office .
My world - your world - is much safer because President Bush understands the need to seek out and punish those who have and would continue to harm us .
I 've read the nasty comments made by the European press .
I 've heard what the Canadian MP said earlier today .
Go ahead and say what 's on your mind .
Just remember that you sleep in safety tonight because Americans , led by our president , are willing to die for your safety .
It 's the Texas way , y'all .
You just do n't understand .
Gary Williams , Granbury , Texas I voted for George W Bush because the Democrats spent all their time attacking the President , and not telling the country how they would do anything different .
Bush has turned the recession into a growing economy , and is keeping us safe from terrorism .
That 's worth my vote any day .
Joe Brassard , Boston , Massachusetts , USA I voted for Bush because he is an honourable man who makes decisions based on principles , not polls and a man who can be taken at his word .
Unfortunately , this seems to be a rarity among politicians .
Cathy Jones , Bayonet Point , Florida
He will not allow terrorist actions to go unpunished
Hayley , Dallas , Texas I voted for President Bush in my first election since I became eligible to vote because , while I prefer Kerry 's social policies , I do n't believe that the Democratic Party with its ambiguous stance on terror and the war in Iraq is truly capable of defending the US in a hostile world .
President Bush may be polarizing in his international policies , but at least I can be certain that he will not allow terrorist actions to go unpunished , as former President Clinton shamefully did after the attack on the USS Cole in 2000 .
I feel that too many Kerry supporters have forgotten what happened on September 11th , but I can be confident that President Bush has not .
Hayley , Dallas , Texas , USA I voted for Bush to usher in the complete and utter destruction of the United States .
Sometimes , you just have to tear it all down and start over again .
No one will destroy America faster than Bush .
Go Bush !
Tim , Los Angeles , CA , USA I voted for President Bush because we need a strong man for these trying times .
I live in Germany and believe that your average European just does n't get it .
Europeans " are able to sleep soundly in their beds because rough men ( US ) stand ready to do violence on their behalf " .
Your average European needs to watch the movie " Open Range " to better understand their American cousins .
We all must defend Western Civilization before it is subsumed by the barbarians .
The Europeans are going to ( not ) breed themselves out of existence and only the US will be left to carry on the civilization that has come to us all from the Greeks , through the Romans and brought into the modern age by the Europeans .
Mark Salas , Boswell , OK Bush offers a vision of democracy and a hope for freedom in the world
Rebecca , Louisiana Strong , decisive leadership are the hallmarks of the Bush presidency .
Nuanced and conciliatory responses to the Middle East problems by the U.S. and other countries over practically the entirety of my lifetime have achieved nothing but an ever increasing barrage of complaints and growing resentment against the U.S.
It is time for something different .
Bush offers a vision of democracy and a hope for freedom in the world .
Achieving this requires sacrifices and action and steadfastness .
The threat of terrorism was my top issue in the election and that is why I voted for Bush .
Rebecca , Louisiana
I am saddened that I live in a country of intolerance toward other cultures and beliefs .
I am saddened that our country believes it can arrogantly push its ideals of democracy on everybody else .
With the erosion of our own civil rights , how can we hope to bring any to those in other countries ?
As for those who say this president supports Christian values , whatever happened to ' love thy neighbour ' ?
Our country is more concerned with interfering with other people 's privacy than actually helping anyone .
I hope all you Bush - supporters lose your jobs in the next four years of economic crisis .
Sara Smith , Atlanta , GA President Bush is a true defender of the American people , a stalwart , often stubborn , always determined , man of his word .
He is a straight shooter who loves this country and is willing to defend it , regardless of whatever opinions may be expressed around the world .
I admire him greatly , and feel much more secure knowing that he will be in office four more years .
Russell Herbst , McKinney , TX , USA I registered to vote simply to vote against him
John Doe , Charlotte , USA I wish Bush would resign .
As a young American I registered to vote simply to vote against him .
Something truly scares me about a man that cannot properly pronounce nuclear having control of the world 's largest nuclear armament .
John Doe , Charlotte , USA
Lest the world think that all Americans are idiots , I 'm not part of the religious right , and Bush did n't get my vote .
It 's also clear to me that he 's going to do precious little " reaching out " to people who hold my views .
That 's fine with me because I intend to fight him and his kind with every breath I take .
If we 're extremely lucky , we 'll have four years of deadlock in Washington .
Dan Parker , Raleigh , NC , USA
For me , the decision was a no - brainer .
As a young New Yorker , who has experienced terrorism first hand , who has many friends in same - sex relationships , who has seen poverty on the streets and wealth along 5th Avenue , who has had peers seek help from Planned Parenthood , I face these issues on a daily basis .
I voted for Kerry , along with 75 % of New Yorkers .
He was the best man for the job , given the issues concerning us now .
But then again , the issues concerning us New Yorkers and other major cities in the US do not seem to affect " Middle America . "
Annie , New York , NY
He makes me feel safe
Danielle , Illinois , USA
He is strong , confident , and stands by his integrity .
He is not swayed by those who disagree with him , yet he allows them their right to disagree .
He makes me feel safe .
Danielle , Illinois , USA I voted for Bush because of his moral clarity in confronting the challenges in our time .
He is a sincere man who truly has the stomach to preserve our republic .
History will demonstrate how farsighted he was as democracies take hold in the middle east and peace expands .
History will also shame Europe for largely hiding behind their borders during this time when western democracies should be supporting the democratising of the Middle East .
Ryan O'Gara , Woodbridge , VA - USA I voted for Mr. Bush by carefully examining the issues of each candidate and where they stood on these issues .
I was very impressed with Mr. Bush on how he handled the 9/11 tragedy .
He mourned and shed tears like the rest of us , during the ceremonies .
After , he spent hours comforting the families of the people lost in this horrific act of terrorism .
Bush is a man of compassion , great integrity and willing to lead our nation in the face of adversity .
He is a man that will not back down and change his mind .
He will get the job done .
Margaret , Minneapolis - USA
Bush is against abortion and that is all that matters to me .
That is the only issue I consider and there are a lot of Americans who feel the same way .
Some people say it is ignorant to disregard the other issues , and maybe it is , but that is how I feel .
Bertha , Upstate NY
He says and does what he thinks is right , regardless if it does n't win him any fans
Rebecca Saunders , Houston Texas
Not because we both live in Texas , but because he says and does what he thinks is right , regardless if it does n't win him any fans .
If he had been president in the 90's UBL would not have gotten away with everything he has done .
He will be caught by President Bush , that most American believe , even if the liberal media does n't want to report what Americans really feel .
President Bush is Great !
Rebecca Saunders , Houston Texas I voted for Bush because I am a Bible - thumping right - wing gun lunatic who hates gays , is n't that right ?
That 's not actually true , but it does n't matter what the reality is , because that 's how the European media will depict it .
According to them , if I do n't agree with pacifism and appeasement , I must be an inbred redneck idiot .
So I suppose that 's why I voted for Bush : I am an idiot .
Gonzalo Rodriguez , London , UK I made my choice for GW Bush based upon his strong " I wo n't back down " resolve to fight terrorism .
I voted against John Kerry because of his betrayal of his fellow servicemen who were in combat in Vietnam while he was publicly trashing them to the world here in the States .
Lynda Roberts , Ruckersville , Virginia , USA I voted for Bush because I am Pro-Life and against gay marriage .
Bush stands more for these issues than does the Democratic Party .
David Schultz , Fenton , Iowa , USA Americans have never liked being told what we should do , or how we should do it
Arthur Xanthos , New York City I voted for George Bush ( to the disapproving consternation of my European cousins ) because an election is a choice , and the two candidates offered two different approaches to leadership .
Ever since an attempt was made in the 1770s to tax our favourite breakfast beverage , Americans have never liked being told what we should do , or how we should do it .
From what I have read , I expect the majority of the European populace , most of whom I assume were born post - war , not to approve of the American people 's decision .
For insight , however , I suggest that holidays or other visits to the US not be limited to Boston , New York and Los Angeles .
Arthur Xanthos , New York City , USA I voted for Bush because he stands for many things I like .
With regard to the things about Bush that I do n't like , John Kerry did not present a clear and viable alternative policy .
What else could I do ?
Nathaniel , Houston , TX
He sets a good example for my children
Carrie , Pittsburgh , PA I voted for President Bush most importantly because he holds strong moral convictions that do not waver .
I believe America is in the middle of a culture war , perpetuated by Hollywood , the media , and elitists who are tearing down the traditional values that are so important to me and my family .
Secondly , I voted for him because he has not turned a blind eye to the problem of Islamic terrorists who are determined to kill us .
He is a good man with clarity in his beliefs , and he sets a good example for my children .
God Bless President Bush .
Carrie , Pittsburgh , PA , USA I voted for Bush because his political policies are most like my own .
I voted for Bush in rejection of the corruption of the elite media .
I voted for Bush in rejection of the vast corruption in the UN .
I voted for Bush in rejection of fashionable politics with no substance .
I voted for Bush because there is a time for diplomacy and he understands when that is .
Shante ' Fosket , Chesapeake , VA Because he does n't believe that our foreign policy needs a global test .
Europe needs to get on board with us or get left behind !
Ben Rice , Chambersburg , Pennsylvania
I voted for George W Bush because he has a moral compass and a strong faith in the living God and these things are evident by his words , actions and deeds and they resonate with my heart .
It does not matter how intelligent you are if you 're wise in your own eyes and it does n't matter how well you are able to speak if your words are clanging cymbals but it does matter who you worship and serve .
You are unable to lead and serve others if you do not serve God first .
Penny , USA 1 . Strong on defence
2. Strong on moral values
3. Staunch supporter of economic freedom for all Americans and freedom for all nations
4. Decisive and unambiguous
5 . Will take care of North Korea 's and Iran 's nuclear arms ambitions
6 . Will never sign the Kyoto insane Protocol
I have flown six thousand miles ( from Poland ) just to re-elect him .
I shall do the same for Condi Rice !
Miek Kondracki , American in Poland I knew I liked this guy right after 9/11
John , St Paul , US I knew I liked this guy right after 9/11 when he stood among Americans on a pile of rubble and stated " I can hear you , the world can hear you and soon the terrorists that knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon " .
Whether the Democrats want to admit it or not had there been a Democrat president in office at the time the most he would have done is throw a few harsh words at Osama and then would have forgot the whole thing happened .
John , St Paul , US I voted for George because :
1 . He is intelligent .
He graduated from Harvard Business School .
They do n't give out free passes there .
2 . He has character .
I grew up in backwoods
Texas where bank loans were granted upon a handshake .
Your word was your bond .
3 . We face a threat that does not respond to human kindness .
He is resolute and unrelenting in the face of this threat .
4 . He can love more than just his family .
God Bless America .
Warren , Salisbury , NC , USA I voted for Bush because I will not have Bruce Springsteen , Gerhard Schroeder , Osama Bin Laden and Michael Moore telling me who to vote for .
The world will respect Americans more because they have elected a strong leader and did not succumb to our enemies ' demands for electing Kerry who would be more likely to appease terrorists and America haters then Bush .
Peter Sosniak , New York
My decision can be summed up in most of these posts .
The point I want to share is that these reasons cannot be understood by many who do not understand the philosophy of most Americans .
The US was founded on Judeo - Christian values and a majority of Americans still hold close to these .
Some may want to deny this , some may be deceived by what they see on the television , and some actually may not know this .
This is hard to comprehend for a lot Europeans who have discarded these values and embraced secularism .
But until you take the time to understand what we fundamentally believe in , Judeo - Christian values , you will never understand why we do what we do .
Here 's a hint to get you started , look at the election map and see who elected Bush and there you will find the heart and soul of America .
Michael , Texas Presidents come and go but basic principals are here to stay
David Belland , USA
The liberal Democrats just do n't get it .
Jesus Christ , the American flag , the Ten Commandments , Life , Liberty and the pursuit of happiness are as sacred as the Bill of Rights .
Only President Bush and the Republicans have consistently stood up for these ideals .
Presidents come and go but basic principals are here to stay .
David Belland , USA During a war a change in leadership may bring comfort to the enemy .
Never bring your enemy comfort .
While I am a Democrat domestically I would never want to bring comfort to our enemies .
Also democrats are not as strong on moral issues as we should be .
Maybe this will wake some of the leadership in our party .
Dewey Simpson , Erlanger , KY , USA
My vote for Bush was a vote against Kerry .
I do not like how Bush allows his religious beliefs to run his domestic policies .
I had planned on voting for Ralph Nader instead .
About a month ago I read the 8,000 word article in the Sunday New York Times magazine that discussed John Kerry 's views on terrorism and how he feels it should be handled .
Frankly it scared me .
It scared me that he wanted to handle it in the same manner as it has been handled in the 30 years prior to 9/11 .
Kerry scared me .
I felt that the US and the world would be far less secure with Kerry in office .
Sure we may have felt safe , like we had for the past 30 years .
After all , those dying would be elsewhere ... while terrorist organizations built themselves up for the next big attack as diplomats and attorneys worried about the legal and political ramifications of actually doing something .
Tom , Hudson , USA I voted for Mr Bush as he an honest God fearing man who will see us through these dark days of terror .
Tammy E Smith , Memphis , Tennessee Some cold water cities are out of touch with the majority ; this does not represent a divided nation
Jim , Duluth , GA First , the US is not divided .
Eighty - one percent of all US counties voted for Bush .
Some cold water cities are out of touch with the majority ; this does not represent a divided nation .
The president received more votes than any other president did and a higher percentage of all votes cast in any presidential election after 1988 .
The president lives everyday the moral values that are important to my family , my country and me .
I may agree with some policies and disagree with others but without the moral authority to lead it is all for nothing .
Jim , Duluth , GA , USA President Bush makes strong , principled , and often difficult choices .
A person like that is always going to be divisive because he can't be all things to all people .
I respect him for that .
L Cardwell , Tampa , FL , USA
He will stand up to those terrorists who want to harm our country
Katherine Pacha , Iowa City I voted for Bush because he in my view is a lot stronger on many moral and ethical values that I hold dear .
He will stand up to those terrorists who want to harm our country .
Unlike Mr Kerry , Bush will be able to help our country in the long run .
Katherine Pacha , Iowa City , Iowa , USA
There is a lot of Biblical teaching on how God judges nations .
The story of Lot is one example on how corrupt societies corrupt good people and bring down a community .
Gay marriage and abortion are a threat to our culture and security .
I voted to preserve the morale values of this country .
Howard , Chicago , USA I voted for President Bush mainly so he would be the one appointing a Supreme Court justice this term .
Secondly for his moral stand .
I hope and pray that President Bush will give serious and prolonged thought into bringing within his goals and / or policies some of the points and concerns that Senator Kerry has for our country .
Paul Young , Ivey , USA I voted for Bush because he is an excellent commander - in - chief , has a long range understanding of US strategic problems and brings personal stature to the White House .
Donal D Kavanagh , Atlantic Beach , FL
We need him to appoint judges who will finally allow some reasonable limits on abortion
John , Boston , Mass , USA I voted for Bush because we need him to appoint judges who will finally allow some reasonable limits on abortion in this country .
The system of no limits abortion that liberal judges imposed in the 1970s is one of the great evils that our generation must redress .
Bush has also proven that he has the spine to fight another great evil of our time - terrorism .
And Bush has shown the heart to bring democracy to two of the worst places on earth - Afghanistan and Iraq .
John , Boston , Mass , USA I voted for President Bush because I refuse to be associated with a candidate or party that openly welcomes Michael Moore .
I was actually leaning toward Kerry until Fahrenheit 911 was released .
That heinous , hate filled movie and the fact that many in the Democratic Party and the Hollywood elite actually promoted it as the truth turned me .
As a 911 survivor , it insulted my intelligence and the memory of all my friends , neighbours , and colleagues who perished at the hands of criminals .
Rob , Madison , NJ , USA I voted for Mr Bush because he stands for the values as defined by the word of God .
Mike McF , Frisco , Texas , USA
He 's a hard worker who has the guts to do what has to be done .
He is working towards freedom for all even though he has met resistance .
The world needs a man like him who is not afraid to be unpopular ... and the irony is he won the highest popular vote since Kennedy .
He 's doing what is right even though it 's difficult .
This is a tough world , but his heart is in the right place .
We need the world to work with us now and world peace will be closer than ever .
Ann Cipriani , PA , USA I was not about to vote for Kerry since that 's what Europe wanted me to do
John , Stockholm , Sweden I moved to Europe nearly a year ago , and while I have tended to vote Republican most of my life , I was not particularly warm to President Bush .
After being in Europe for a few months , however , my support for Bush was galvanized by seeing the completely unfair treatment he gets in the media here and hearing the constant criticism and contempt displayed for him by most Europeans .
A few Americans I know conclude that this must mean he is bad , but most react like me , defensively , and rally around our leader .
I think I would have voted for Bush anyway , but I was not about to vote for Kerry since that 's what Europe wanted me to do .
Bush is our president , we elected him , we care about religion , and Europe better get used to it because we 're not about to let you vote !
John , Stockholm , Sweden I voted for President Bush because he provided relief to all taxpayers .
Most importantly , however , Bush has liberated 50 million people in Afghanistan and Iraq , 75 percent of Bin Laden 's henchmen have been captured or killed , while the remaining terrorists are running for their lives .
Thank God for President Bush and America 's greatest ally , Prime Minister Blair .
Thomas Cunningham , St. Petersburg , FL , USA
His faith and dependency on the almighty God have won my respect .
He is not ashamed to publicly declare his faith .
I hope his second term will bring peace and democracy to the troubled regions of the world and domestically bring greater prosperity not only to America but also to the Third world .
Ben , New York I vote for politicians who come closest to my views :
1 . A strong national defence ,
2. Smaller government ,
3 . More power and responsibility devolved to state and local governments , and
4 . An end to carte blanche abortion .
While George Bush failed on smaller government , John Kerry fails on all of them .
Glenn Meyer , Bridgeton , USA
We do not separate our personal , religious convictions from the expectations we have of our leaders
Leah , Richmond , VA I voted for President Bush because I feel he is a decisive leader , who does not waiver in his convictions .
The majority of Americans have a solid belief system based on their moral and religious beliefs .
Contrary to most of the opinions I have seen expressed by most Europeans , we do not separate our personal , religious convictions from the expectations we have of our leaders .
The issues of abortion and stem cell research played a significant role in our decision making process .
In addition , post 9/11 , our country desires a leader whom we feel will never kowtow to the demands , threats and terrorist acts of any group , whether inside or outside of American borders .
To the rest of the world , whose comments have been nothing but disparaging :
You simply do not understand Americans !
You never have , and I doubt that you will ever fully understand our thought process , which is intricately intertwined with our religious convictions , whether Democrat or Republican .
Leah , Richmond , VA I think that it is n't enough that Kerry was n't Bush .
He had no solid plans except to make a better America .
OK .
How ?
He could n't answer that .
The more people heard him speak the more they realized that he had no clear plan .
That is something that would be detrimental to both the US and the world .
I am glad that Bush has four more years , he has been a better president than Kerry ever could be .
Alex , Boston , MA Reason :
He gave Saddam Hussein 48 hours to get out ; that 's what we expected from Mr Carter a few years ago in getting our hostages back from Iran .
In short , many Americans have waited all our lives to finally see an American president deliver an ultimatum and then back it up .
Hopes : build trade with Europe , not just alliances against terror .
Our trade policy now is merely a money pipeline to China .
David Rittenhouse , Deerfield Beach , FL , USA I voted for George Bush because he is un-wavering with his course of actions and I believe has morals based in true faith of God .
All through the election I saw John Kerry change his stance on almost every issue with no real plans to back up any of his promises .
To have a candidate come out day in and day out and state what he could do with no explanation of how to do it got old really fast .
Billy T , Marietta , Georgia , USA I voted for President Bush because I believe he is honest , consistent , and truly cares about people ; not just Americans .
He desires democratic freedom for everyone .
Lynn , USA I voted for President Bush , because what others saw as stubbornness and arrogance ...
I saw as strength and perseverance .
A strong nation needs a strong leader .
Especially one who has beliefs and values which are based on compassion and a true desire for elevating the lives of others .
Laura , USA I voted for Bush for the same reasons so many else did .
With President Bush , you know exactly where he stands and his strength as a leader in these tough times is something that was not seen in Senator Kerry .
Senator Kerry moved with the wind where as Bush walks through it .
Clearly , President Bush is very misunderstood around the world due to his portrayal through the liberal media .
Our friends across the great pond really need to dig past the media to understand President Bush .
Ironically , it 's the liberal media and those like Michael Moore which led to Bush 's re-election .
So , on behalf of Bush supporters - Hey , thanks !
Fayne Moore , Crofton , Maryland , US I voted for Bush because I would never vote to put a Democrat in the White House when we are at war , their track record in that department being reprehensible .
I voted for Bush because for the first time in my lifetime , we have a President who does what he says he is going to do , and in the end , I voted for Bush because I trust him .
Warren Jorgensen , New York , USA I voted for President Bush because he was n't interested in increasing the already heavy tax burden on the wealthiest classes .
He made a point to outline his plans for America for the next four years , which Senator Kerry never did .
At the end of the day , Kerry simply was n't a strong enough candidate and Edwards could n't even deliver his own state .
This election was a testament to how out of touch the Democratic Party has become to the American people .
They assumed that all it took was a few speeches and sparkling smiles to win the presidency , but America saw through it .
Paul , New York , USA
The Republicans should thank Moore and give him a prominent table at the inauguration !
Michael C , NY , USA I voted for Bush because I could not stand the elitist media and the pundits telling me that he was a fool .
I was tired of people like Michael Moore trying to influence my decision by making movies that had only one purpose - tear down the president .
I disagree with many of his policies and would not have voted for him except for the fact that I am sick and tired of these people telling me that I am not smart enough to figure out for myself what is right and what is wrong .
The Republicans should thank Moore and give him a prominent table at the inauguration !
Michael C , NY , USA
It boiled down to Bush being Protestant .
I agreed with many of Kerry 's policies and liked him very much , but in decisions that would require going on faith , I felt less secure trusting Kerry .
Also , John Edwards gave me bad vibes .
He was like a car salesman during the debates .
Jonathan , Washington , DC I voted for Bush for a number of reasons , but I have to confess one of them was because of all the lecturing and condescending opinions I read in the foreign press and heard from the " holier than thou " crowd in Europe .
It just got on my nerves so much that people who only get a sliver of heavily bias coverage about America could hold such closed - minded opinions about our elections .
Maybe four more years will give you a chance to open your minds to new ideas and consider that there are Americans who have a right to believe differently than you .
Andrew , Washington , DC I had made my mind up many months ago about who I would vote for in the elections .
I believe in our president and his vision for the future .
Morality , domestic agenda , international affairs , and the war on terrorism were key for my decision to vote for our president .
The next term will be more productive .
We will see more attention to domestic issues and continued international involvement .
Terrorists will continue to be brought to justice and Iraq and Afghanistan will continue to develop towards their independence .
It is a big job and going to be very busy for our president .
I am confident in his ability to succeed .
Thanks !
James , Lexington , KY , USA
In general , President Bush makes decisions based on strong , unchanging convictions ( with which I agree ) instead of what is politically popular at the moment .
My three important issues are : belief in moral absolutes ; strong national defence protecting American interests abroad ; and limited government .
GI Miller , Raleigh , NC , USA I just prayed that God 's will be done
Marie Dockery , United States
He is the best man for the job .
He wo n't back down to terrorists .
We know where he stands .
He is a gracious and honourable man who is God fearing .
As much as I wanted him to win , I never prayed that he would .
I just prayed that God 's will be done .
I do believe it was .
The bias liberal news media infuriates the American people for the way they treat Bush .
I do believe this was a factor in Kerry losing .
Just my thoughts .
Marie Dockery , United States
I voted for Bush , so that he can clean up all his mess during his second term .
No - one else should be made responsible for all his folly and self - disillusioned war on terror .
The only war that the world needs to fight is to eradicate poverty , diseases , genocide , atrocity and many unjust situations in many parts of the world .
These are the real terrors that breeds human terrorists .
Go to the roots of the cause .
Do n't try to be a fool to treat symptoms of these terrors .
Jaime Stuart I voted for Bush for a number of reasons .
I believe he is taking the correct approach on terrorism and that Iraq is an integral part of that war .
I believe that abortion is murder and see his re-election as the best chance of reversing that barbarous activity .
And on the few issues I disagree with him I respect the fact that I know where he stands , I could never make that claim of his opponent .
Richard Lamb , Jacksonville , FL I voted for Mr Bush because Mr Kerry can not be trusted .
He has no moral values and I need a leader that stands by his actions and does not run when it gets tough .
The world does not understand us here in America .
I 'm a highly educated , married person that owns guns , hunts , and is against gay marriage .
I live and grew up in Massachusetts .
Patrick Burke , Swampscott , MA , USA Bush is our war time President .
It is would be a nation defeat if he should have lost .
We want him to fight these Islamic terrorists till the end .
He needs to win the heart of the world by fighting this war more broadly and involving every one with a freedom flag .
We hail Bush .
Saurabh K , Santa Cruz , CA Europeans do n't seem to understand American politics or our values .
Americans including myself , voted for Bush because he was not afraid to show his faith in God nor does he back down from his word .
He 's a strong leader that can defend the US interests no matter the peer pressure from the world .
Kerry is too liberal in his values and too cosy with the French .
Americans prefer someone who will stand up to the world for America 's sake .
Shawnay Faircloth , Glasgow , Scotland
We live in difficult times .
The world faces an enemy that most people do not want to recognize .
But our President not only sees the threat , but is willing to take the battle to their door step .
No longer can the terrorist attack and go hide to come out another day .
If Weapons of Mass Destruction get into the hands of the enemy , then the whole world will pay .
George Green , Tipp City , Ohio , USA I voted for President Bush because I see all the crisis level issues as originating from the leadership of the Democrat Party .
President Johnson 's opening of the SSI trust fund to borrow to fund his Camelot dream has ultimately threatened our economy by encouraging debt spending ( no politician fails to spend what 's available ) and threatened the stability of the retirement system itself .
Carter 's decision to de-emphasize human intelligence and rely instead upon electronic intelligence has threatened our security .
Clinton 's decision to first take human rights out of China 's MFN review process and then make the newly - renamed NTR status permanent for China lost high - paying manufacturing jobs to prison labour overseas .
Every succeeding president has followed these policies , but the short - sighted polices themselves all have Democrat signatures putting them in place .
We just can't afford another Democrat president and their feel - good record of implementing short - sighted , permanent national policy .

The Palin Puzzle
McCain had been steadily gaining on Obama ( before the inevitable convention bounce ) and had the race in a dead heat in a year in which the generic Democrat is running ten points ahead of the generic Republican .
He had succeeded in making this a referendum on Obama .
The devastating line of attack was , " Is he ready to lead ? "
The Palin selection completely undercuts the argument about Obama 's inexperience and readiness to lead -- on the theory that because Palin is a maverick and a corruption fighter , she bolsters McCain 's claim to be the reformer in this campaign .
In her rollout today , Palin spoke a lot about change .
McCain is now trying to steal " change " from Obama , a contest McCain will lose in an overwhelmingly Democratic year with an overwhelmingly unpopular incumbent Republican administration .
At the same time , he 's weakening his strong suit -- readiness vs. unreadiness .
The McCain campaign is reveling in the fact that Palin is a game changer .
But why a game changer when you ’ve been gaining ?
To gratuitously undercut the remarkably successful " Is he ready to lead " line of attack seems near suicidal .

< embed align = ” left ” id =” VideoPlayback ” Hundreds of peaceful protesters with the Poor People ’s Economic Human Rights Campaign demonstrating lawfully inside a free speech zone were harassed by police officers on Tuesday , September 8th , 2008 during the RNC in downtown St. Paul .
ImpeachForPeace.org organizer Jodin Morey , whose phone was taken and who was shot with a rubber bullet , was among those present .
Mr. Morey tells about what happened to him .
Senator John McCain , who has been critical of President Bush on the environment and other policies this week , on Thursday morning wholeheartedly endorsed Mr. Bush ’s veiled rebuke in the Israeli Knesset of Senator Barack Obama that talking to “ terrorists and radicals ” was no different than appeasing Hitler and the Nazis .
“ Yes , there have been appeasers in the past , and the president is exactly right , and one of them is Neville Chamberlain , ” Mr. McCain told reporters on his campaign bus after a speech in Columbus , Ohio .
“ I believe that it ’s not an accident that our hostages came home from Iran when President Reagan was president of the United States .
He did n’t sit down in a negotiation with the religious extremists in Iran , he made it very clear that those hostages were coming home . ”
Asked if he thought that former President Jimmy Carter , who struggled with the hostage crisis , was an appeaser , Mr. McCain replied : “ I do n’t know if he was an appeaser or not , but he terribly mishandled the Iranian hostage crisis . ”
Asked if he thought Mr. Obama was an appeaser — the Democratic candidate has said he would be willing to meet with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the president of Iran — Mr. McCain sidestepped and said , “ I think that Barack Obama needs to explain why he wants to sit down and talk with a man who is the head of a government that is a state sponsor of terrorism , that is responsible for the killing of brave young Americans , that wants to wipe Israel off the map , who denies the Holocaust .
That ’s what I think Senator Obama ought to explain to the American people . ”
Mr. McCain ’s aides , some of whom used to work for Mr. Bush , said they had not coordinated with the White House on Mr. Bush ’s remarks and that they were not aware of what the president was going to say in the Knesset .
Mr. Obama ’s campaign sent out the following statement in response .

Police looks forward to catch more criminals who send anonymous text messages .
Now police seeks help from ecologists and language experts , who are using techniques of studying ocean life in order to identify authors of text messages by their grammar , syntax and the way they use words in a message .
The method had already been used in several cases of murder but it still needs to pass some tests so the court would accept it as routine proof .
In 2005 police applied to linguistic analysis in order to find Yorkshire teenager Jenny Nicholl .
Language experts found that text messages sent from the teenager 's phone have probably been written by David Hodgson , a murder suspect .
By analyzing the characters of abbreviation scientists found that Ms Nicholl usually wrote " I am " and " Myself " , however , after the teen 's disappearance , these words turned into " im " and " meself " , which was quite common for Hodgson 's text writing .
Thus evidence was able to secure Hodgson 's conviction for murder .
Tim Grant , deputy director of the Centre for Forensic Linguistics at Aston University , applied to the help of ecologists , experts able to differentiate between marine mediums by identifying how close or far apart the environments are according to species .
By using the same techniques experts can identify how close or distant various species of writing are .
Currently scientists are working on developing a database of text messages provided by volunteers to be able to identify variations in style and language among individuals , which can then be used to investigate anonymous messages from suspects .
Till now scientists managed to gather about 8,000 text messages from about 1,000 members of the public .
" We can measure similarity and difference by means of the stylistic distance between any two text messages .
Pairs of text messages by the same author are going to be more alike .
And where you get groups of people who text one another a lot , or pairs of people , their language becomes more similar .
We 're moving away from human - based expertise and opinion to a method which will make it easier to discuss things like error rates , " said Dr Grant .

Medcal treatments will take a quantum leap forward once we can develop drugs that are genetically tailored to a specific individual .
But to do that , we need a way to sequence someone 's DNA quickly and cheaply .
Today , it takes months and costs six figures .
Pacific Biosciences ' Single - Molecule , Real - Time ( SMRT ) DNA sequencer is going to change that .
DNA sequencing is slow and takes a lot of computational power .
To put it into Homer Simpson terms , the DNA is replicated , torn into little pieces , sorted out and analyzed bit by bit , then reassembled by a computer .
The SMRT sequencer improves on the process because it " watches " the DNA as it is being replicated by the polymerase , reading each piece of DNA in something called the Zero - Mode Waveguide .
The ZMW is a " nanophotonic visualization chamber " made by making a hole just a few tens of nanometers across in a metal film just 100 nanometers thick .
Chemicals introduced into the reaction give off tiny flashes of colored light , which are detected by the highly parallel optics system ( pictured ) .
The CCD can detect the lights , and computers use that information to figure out which base pairs are in which ZMW window , decoding long strands of DNA in real - time .
You could be running down to the DNA - Mart for a quick DNA scan as soon as 2013 . [ Via io9.com
A top national - security adviser to Barack Obama said he expects military spending during a Democratic administration would n't drop , a key concern for a defense industry that is accustomed to growing Pentagon budgets and anxious about potential cutbacks .
Richard Danzig , a U.S. Navy secretary during the Clinton administration and a leading contender to be the secretary of Defense in an Obama administration , said he does n't " see defense spending declining in the first years of an Obama administration .

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) -- Aides to Gov. Sarah Palin wo n't comply with subpoenas issued by state lawmakers investigating the firing of Alaska 's former public safety commissioner because Palin " has declined to participate " in the probe , her attorney general says .
Gov. Sarah Palin has refused to cooperate with an inquiry into the firing of her public safety commissioner .
" As state employees , our clients have taken an oath to uphold the Alaska Constitution , and for that reason , they respect the Legislature 's desire to carry out an investigation in support of its lawmaking powers , " Attorney General Talis Colberg , a Palin appointee , told the investigation 's manager in a letter released Wednesday .
" However , our clients are also loyal employees subject to the supervision of the governor . "
The chairman of the bipartisan panel that commissioned the probe said Colberg is breaking an agreement his office made a week ago .
" I feel like Charlie Brown after Lucy moved the football , " state Sen. Kim Elton , the Democratic chairman of the state Legislative Council , wrote back to Colberg .
Palin once pledged to cooperate with the state Legislature 's investigation into the July firing of Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan .
After his dismissal , Monegan accused Palin of trying to pressure him into firing her ex-brother - in - law , a state trooper who had been involved in an acrimonious divorce from the governor 's sister .
Palin has denied wrongdoing .
Her allies argue the investigation has become a " partisan circus " since she became Republican presidential nominee Sen .
John McCain 's running mate , and they argue that any investigation should be handled by the State Personnel Board .
Watch how the trooper probe has become political »
" Moreover , two lawsuits have been filed challenging the legitimacy of the investigation , " Colberg wrote .
" On behalf of our clients , we respectfully ask that you withdraw the subpoenas directed to our clients and thereby relieve them from the circumstance of having to choose where their loyalties lie . "
It was unclear whether the letter covered Palin 's husband , Todd Palin , who was among those subpoenaed by the Senate Judiciary Committee last week .
Colberg 's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
The letter was sent to Sen. Hollis French , the Democratic chairman of the state Senate Judiciary Committee , which approved the subpoenas last week .
Palin 's allies have blasted French over comments he made to ABC News in early September , warning that the investigation into Monegan 's firing could yield an " October surprise " for the GOP ticket in the form of criminal charges .
The campaign began holding daily press conferences this week to blast French , Special Counsel Steve Branchflower and Elton .
That bipartisan panel voted unanimously to commission the investigation in July , but the McCain - Palin campaign said it has now been " tainted " by partisan politics .
Five Republican state lawmakers went to court Tuesday in Anchorage to shut down the Legislature 's investigation , arguing that its leaders " are unable to hold the balance between vindicating their own political interests and the interests of those who are being investigated . "
But Elton , a Democrat , called the lawsuit " a distraction . "
" I 'm comfortable with the notion that the court will review the substance of the suit and find the council acted properly , and that the decisions made during the course of the investigation so far are appropriate and well within the mandate of the council , " Elton said in a written statement .
The investigation will continue until otherwise ordered , he added .
Other Palin allies filed a similar suit in Fairbanks the same day .
The judge assigned to hear the Anchorage case , John Suddock , recused himself Wednesday .
Suddock heard the divorce case between Palin 's sister and the trooper at the center of the allegations , Mike Wooten -- and he warned the governor 's family against trying to get her then - brother - in - law fired long before the Monegan controversy erupted , according to court records .
Wooten and Palin 's sister , Molly McCann , began divorce proceedings in 2005 after four years of marriage .
Palin , then a private citizen , and other members of her family filed several complaints about Wooten with the state police , accusing him of threatening his in - laws and other improper conduct .
Wooten was suspended for five days in March 2006 , after state police commanders determined he had used a Taser on his 10 - year - old stepson " in a training capacity ; " drove his patrol car while drinking beer ; and illegally shot a moose using his wife 's hunting permit .
Palin initially denied that anyone in her administration or family had pressed for action against Wooten , whom she has branded a " rogue trooper . "
But in August , two weeks before her nomination as a vice presidential candidate , she acknowledged that members of her staff had contacted Monegan 's office nearly two dozen times about the trooper .
An aide was suspended after being taped telling a state trooper lieutenant that the Palins were concerned that there had been " absolutely no action for a year on this issue . "
Monday , the McCain campaign released documents it said bolster its argument that Monegan was fired over budget disputes and " egregious insubordination . "
The records include e-mails in which Palin advisers complain Monegan was continuing to seek funds for programs the governor opposed .

While there are countless Digg clones out there ( Pligg , Newsvine and Reddit , to name a few ) , only a handful gain enough traction to stay on the radar .
Mixx is one of them , and the company has released metrics today showing steady growth over its year - long existence .
Mixx reports that it has increased its monthly unique visitors by seven times , growing from 400,000 to 4 million monthly uniques since May .
The social news aggregator claims the major differentiator between itself and Digg is the attention it gives to its user base .
It says this focus on its users is why its seen such strong growth to date .
Digg , however , still brings in over 22 million unique visitors a month .
Mixx ’s user - focused features include the ability to better control user comments and leaderboard recognition for the site ’s top contributors .
With funding earlier this year and additional investment from the LA Times , Mixx has sought growth through partnerships with mainstream print publications , just as Digg and another competitor , Reddit , have done .
Yet Digg is still far and away the leader .
Mixx , Reddit , both of which have had similar growth patterns are still well out of reach of Digg ’s dominance , according to web site ranking engine Compete .
To exacerbate the issue of differentiation , many features that were unique to Mixx and Reddit , such as subgroups within the larger social news site , have now been picked up by Digg .
Given Digg ’s recent round of funding for $ 28.7 million , it ’s likely that Digg will continue to keep pace with new releases from competitors , including Reddit ’s open source option .
Most importantly , however , Digg still has a stronghold on its community , which has stuck by the site despite complaints about sporadic changes to the algorithm and tweaks to the comments and recommendation systems .

Paris Hilton has deployed some heavyweight backing for her bid to become the next ( fake ) president of the US of A - none other than West Wing thesp Martin Sheen , who offers the talented heiress some sound campaign advice in this rather silly video down at Funny or Die :
Paris watchers will , of course , be aware that Ms Hilton launched her pitch for the White House following John McCain 's comparison of Barack Obama to " superficial " celebs , specifically naming Hilton and Britney Spears as examples .
She hit back with this vid , notable for its plausible solution to America 's energy woes :
Well , fair play to Paris and Sheen ( and son ) for providing some light relief amid the economic gloom and increasingly tiresome US presidential election catfight campaign .
See you at the fake ballot box , bitches . ®

Re-Scan Tests of 260 Initially Rejected Ballots in Disputed Palm Beach Election UN - Rejects Different Numbers of Ballots Each Time They Are Scanned
Same Failed Company Fighting Against Public Disclosure of Similar Problems Today in both Washington D.C. and New Jersey ...
Brad Friedman Byon
10/3/2008 , 12:21 pm PT
John Gideon briefly noted what happened in Florida in yesterday 's Daily Voting News , but it deserves a bit more attention .
A lot more attention , actually .
A recent contested election for Circuit Judge in Palm Beach County , FL , where the initial results showed a 17 vote margin for one of the candidates , continues to reveal differing counts every time the same ballots are run through the county 's new optical - scan paper ballot counters made by Sequoia Voting Systems .
Sequoia is one of America 's largest private voting machine vendors , and one of its worst ( even though we realize such judgements are akin to determing whether Mussolini was worse than Stalin . )
Just 30 - some days from America 's next and likely - largest election ever , the desperate company is under fire today for recent voting system failures in Palm Beach , Washington D.C. , and New Jersey .
For the moment , let 's look at what was reported out of Palm Beach yesterday , where re-scans of 262 rejected ballots on Sequoia paper - ballot scanners revealed differing results each and every time they were scanned ...
Palm Beach County 's high - speed ballot counting machines could n't count the same ballots the same way twice in tests performed Wednesday evening .
As part of a challenge to a disputed judicial race , elections officials tested two Sequoia 400 - C counting machines to see how they handled ballots they previously rejected as either over - or under-votes .
...
Wednesday 's tests were simple .
Election workers took 262 ballots previously rejected by the machines as over - or under-votes in the judicial race and ran them through two machines .
All of them should have been rejected again in the tests .
That did n't happen .
On the first two tests of 160 ballots , the machines accepted three ballots as good votes .
On tests on 102 more ballots that should have been rejected , the machines first accepted 13 ballots as good votes and then 90 on a second run .
To be clear :
The failed Sequoia voting systems are electronic paper - ballot scanners , made by a private company which does not allow the public election officials who use them to determine the results of public elections or any independent , public examination of the hardware or software of the systems .
The same type of proprietary voting systems are used to count ballots in every state in the nation .
Results of ballots " counted " on them are typically accepted by officials , the media , and the public as accurate , and are almost never double - checked , in any way , shape or form , to determine whether the computer - reported results actually are .
Sequoia is currently in court in New Jersey fighting to keep the results of a court - ordered independent test of its failed New Jersey machines from being made public , even though --- as The BRAD BLOG reported exclusively last May --- the company does n't even own the intellectual property rights to the voting systems , as it is claiming in that case .
" Even the Governor and the Secretary of State of New Jersey are not permitted , by the Court 's order , to read this report in order to inform their policy making , " wrote Andrew Appell yesterday .
He was one of the Princeton University computer scientists who carried out the court - ordered analysis of the NJ Sequoia machines which misreported vote totals during this year 's Super Tuesday primary in a number of counties .
Appell , an expert witness for the citizen plaintiffs in the case , and the leader of the scientific analysis team , goes on to note that despite Sequoia not even being a party to the case , and despite the team of experts unwillingness to examine the " machines under conditions that prevent public discussion of their findings , " the judge in the case made a remarkable u-turn this week from her ruling last Summer that allowed for the public disclosure of all findings .
Those findings , completed and turned in to the court weeks ago , are being held following oral argument in which Sequoia --- which , we 'll repeat , is not a party in the case --- " grossly mischaracterized " the report of the computer scientists , according to Appell .
Meanwhile , Back in Florida ...
To his candidate 's and the voters ' credit , following the recent tests of those ballots in Florida , the attorney for one of the candidates in the Palm Beach contest now says the machines cannot be trusted .
Attorney Gerald Richman told the Sun-Sentinel , " We have to get a new election or a hand recount . "
The paper goes on to highlight the problem with relying on a few private vendors to handle every election in the United States of America ...
Richman predicts problems in November .
He said the voting machine manufacturer , Sequoia Voting Systems , which sold the county the $ 5.5 million optical scan system , must " immediately rectify the problem . "
Representatives of the company , he said , " Need to come down and correct whatever the problem is . "
A spokesman for the company could not be reached in time for this report .
If election officials ran their own elections , with completely transparent citizen oversight , they would n't have to wait for private company employees to " come down and correct whatever the problem is " ( as if anybody would know if it was actually corrected after they got done with it . )
They also would n't have to go to court , only to be told they 're not allowed to see what went wrong in their very own elections .
Sequoia was otherwise very busy today anyway , with its top executives answering questions at a public meeting about similarly failed machines in Washington D.C. , where thousands of " phantom votes " were added to the results of an election in last month 's primary .
Sequoia has said the reason that 1,500 non-existent write - in votes were reported by their voting system , in a precinct where just 326 people cast votes , was most likely due to " static electricity . "
Yeah .
That 's what they actually said .
Feel better ?
And if you 're wondering , since we get the same question every time we write such an article , no , Obama and the DNC are doing absolutely nothing about any of this .
[ NOTE : Will your candidate take the pledge to not concede an election until all ballots this year are known to have actually been counted and counted accurately ?
On tonight 's Mike Malloy Show ( which we are Guest Hosting this week ) , we 'll have as one of our guests the only Presidential candidate so far who has been willing to take that pledge .
It 's your democracy , and therefore your responsibility , to make sure that your candidate , whoever it is , does similarly ! ]

And maybe you remember our own snow last winter , not to mention the roofs buckling under the drifts in Quebec .
Brace yourself for a fresh round of nay - saying about " so - called global warming , " and accusations of " hysteria " directed at those who forecast dramatic climate change in our near future .
These sprout like mushrooms every time some weather headline plays against the stereotype of a planet getting steadily warmer and drier .
And it 's true that 2008 has been a colder - than - we 're - used - to ( lately ) year for North America .
In fact , there is a good chance that the next few years will be much like it .
But it 's not because the laws of thermodynamics have suddenly changed .
One cold , wet summer -- or even several in a row -- does not mean global cooling has begun .
Deluding ourselves into thinking it has would be dangerous indeed .
Especially so on the eve of an election that may turn on Canada 's climate strategy .
The ocean as bathtub
The reason we so easily fall for these kinds of delusions , and why willfully short - sighted pundits persist in exploiting them , is that they confuse a few days , or weeks or even months in one place on earth , for the fluid continuum of swirling air and water that constitutes our planet 's atmospheric and ocean system .
Put simply : the planet may be colder for the moment here , but it is certain to be warmer somewhere else .
Short - sighted climate ostriches have reported that according to the U.S. National Climate Data Center , global average temperatures dipped between 1998 and 2005 .
Fox
News took pleasure earlier this year in noting that four teams tracking global surface temperatures had noticed a drop " large enough to erase nearly all the global warming recorded over the past 100 years . "
What such reports overlook is that global surface temperature estimates are based overwhelmingly on observations of air temperature .
As a matter of physics , the atmosphere holds relatively little of the extra heat building up inside Earth 's greenhouse - gas shell .
Most of that heat is being absorbed into the oceans ( accounting , incidentally , for about half the rise in ocean levels worldwide , as warmer water molecules expand ) .
But science has relatively few tools for measuring ocean temperature , or factoring the heat stored there the average global temperature .
The oceans themselves are big places , and not uniform .
Sometimes warmer water sits on top of a cooler mass ( a description of the El Niño phenomenon in the eastern Pacific ) .
Sometimes colder water covers the surface ( La Niña ) .
Whichever one is uppermost has much more impact on the easily influenced surface air temperature and current weather over the continents , than does the heat absorbed and temporarily locked away in submerged ocean layers .
Niño and Niña , troublesome twins
That 's what 's happening now .
Early 2008 experienced a sharp , cold La Niña .
The chilly , wet northern non-summer we 've experienced since then was fully foreseeable and foreseen as a consequence .
The Niño twins alternate over periods of three to eight years .
Other more mysterious cycles run over much longer periods .
But the two most important of these , as it happens , seem to be flipping from warm states to cooler ones .
Two or three times a century , a vast swirling lagoon of slightly warmer water forms in the western Pacific and over two or three decades drift up past Alaska and dissipates west of the Queen Charlotte Islands .
Just such a cycle ( known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation ) ended a couple of years ago , leaving cooler water exposed and chilling the air over millions of square miles of ocean .
The same air that will follow the prevailing winds to the B.C. coast .
In the Atlantic meanwhile , the northernmost loop of a much larger current that swings across both oceans similarly surges and weakens over periods of decades .
When the current runs faster , temps across eastern North America and Europe rise for years on end .
But the current has been weakening , and some scientists think the so - called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation may be poised to slip into its slower " negative " state -- bringing temps down again for a few years .
If that happens , and the rapid warming of the 1990s and early '00s takes a break for the next few years , it will be easy for North Americans and Europeans to relax their concern , and perhaps even to think that the ostriches may have been right .
When the rubber band snaps back
But the heat is still building up .
It may be trapped for the moment , perhaps even for a few years to come , in tropical oceans or deeply submerged layers of the sea .
But it is not gone .
Sooner or later , that heat will out .
And when it finally does break out into the near - surface atmosphere where weather happens and we live , its effect will be like the elastic we 've stretched to the limit and released : too likely to snap us in the eye .
That snapback moment will come , British scientists calculate , around the middle of the coming decade .
What then ?
When these huge sea-cycles perform their next oscillation , as they must , and begin to pass all the heat energy that 's been stored up temporarily in the deep or tropical oceans through to North America , we will get to experience new categories of extremes at the other end of the scale : exhausting series of droughts and scorching heat - waves .
In the meantime , while we may enjoy a relative cool , in those parts of the world where the heat is building up , it will drive increasingly violent storms ( witness , currently , northeast India ) .
One particularly myopic commentator claimed recently in the right - wing Canadian Free Press that Russia 's aggression in Georgia has put a " nail in the coffin of climate change hysteria . "
The truth is that Georgia , like Iraq and Afghanistan and the other places people are killing each other for political motives , is a sideshow to the only two truly existential threats our civilization faces : the double helix of climate change and ecological overdraft .
The ocean tides may be giving North Americans a break on the symptoms of the first , but it is only a topical and temporary salve .
The second threat , our ecological overdraft , is running flat out toward a precipice .
We could use any reprieve on climate change to get serious about our broader overdraft at the bank of nature .
We'd then be vastly readier to absorb the next wave of climate change when it comes .
Or , of course , not .

When there 's no time for best practices
[ / caption ]
Everyone loves twinkling stars and moonlit nights — EXCEPT astronomers .
But astronomers are crafty people , so they ’ve come up with ways to mitigate the distortion that Earth ’s thick atmosphere causes for ground based telescopes ( from which stars appear to twinkle ) .
And now , a new image - correction technique has delivered the sharpest whole - planet ground - based picture ever .
The Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) performed a record two - hour observation of Jupiter using a breakthrough technique to remove atmospheric blur .
And what a result !
Just take a look at that gorgeous image …
And this new image reveals changes in Jupiter ’s smog - like haze , probably in response to a planet - wide upheaval more than a year ago .
Being able to correct wide field images for atmospheric distortions has been the dream of scientists and engineers for decades .
Astronomers used a new device called the Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics Demonstrator ( MAD ) prototype instrument mounted on ESO ’s Very Large Telescope ( VLT )
The new images of Jupiter prove the value of the advanced technology used by MAD , which uses two or more guide stars instead of one as references to remove the blur caused by atmospheric turbulence over a field of view thirty times larger than existing techniques .
“ This type of adaptive optics has a big advantage for looking at large objects , such as planets , star clusters or nebulae , ” says lead researcher Franck Marchis , from UC Berkeley and the SETI Institute in Mountain View , California , USA .
“ While regular adaptive optics provides excellent correction in a small field of view , MAD provides good correction over a larger area of sky .
And in fact , were it not for MAD , we would not have been able to perform these amazing observations . ”
MAD allowed the researchers to observe Jupiter for almost two hours on 16 and 17 August 2008 , a record duration , according to the observing team .
They were able to take a series of 265 snapshots .
Conventional adaptive optics systems using a single Jupiter moon as reference cannot monitor Jupiter for so long because the moon moves too far from the planet .
The Hubble Space Telescope cannot observe Jupiter continuously for more than about 50 minutes , because its view is regularly blocked by the Earth during Hubble ’s 96 - minute orbit .
Using MAD , ESO astronomer Paola Amico , MAD project manager Enrico Marchetti and Sébastien Tordo from the MAD team tracked two of Jupiter ’s largest moons , Europa and Io – one on each side of the planet – to provide a good correction across the full disc of the planet .
“ It was the most challenging observation we performed with MAD , because we had to track with high accuracy two moons moving at different speeds , while simultaneously chasing Jupiter , ” says Marchetti .
With this unique series of images , the team found a major alteration in the brightness of the equatorial haze , which lies in a 16,000 - kilometer wide belt over Jupiter ’s equator .
More sunlight reflecting off upper atmospheric haze means that the amount of haze has increased , or that it has moved up to higher altitudes .
“ The brightest portion had shifted south by more than 6,000 kilometers , ” explains team member Mike Wong .
This conclusion came after comparison with images taken in 2005 by Wong and colleague Imke de Pater using the Hubble Space Telescope .
The Hubble images , taken at infrared wavelengths very close to those used for the VLT study , show more haze in the northern half of the bright Equatorial Zone , while the 2008 VLT images show a clear shift to the south .
“ The change we see in the haze could be related to big changes in cloud patterns associated with last year ’s planet - wide upheaval , but we need to look at more data to narrow down precisely when the changes occurred , ” declares Wong

Just compare this recording of Palin in Alaska in 2006 to what you heard last night .
Ask yourself where the folksiness is .
See how many times she says " doggone " in 2006 .
Or " betcha " .
Or " Joe Six - Pack " .
Make up your own mind .
In my judgment she is the biggest fraud we have seen in national politics in generations .
She makes the Clintons look honest , and Nixon look as if he has nothing to hide .

Brad :
You may want to comment tonight on this Jerk 's article : Diebold Caught Again in Politics of Technology where the guy says :
I personally do n't really care what kind of software is used inside U.S. voting machines but I hope people from outside the U.S do not get the impression from these conspiracy theory wackos that software --- open or closed source --- caused the voting problems in the U.S. in 2000 and 2004 .
Just to refresh everyone 's memory : -- the problem in Fla in 2000 and Ohio in 2004 ( to the extent there really was a problem in Ohio ) was a turn of the century ( as in 1900 ) technology called punched cards , not software .
--
In New Mexico , the problem was allegedly a matter of ballots not being counted at all , not in their being misread by embedded software .
Of course , to really buy into the Diebold conspiracy theories you have to assume one of two things happens .
Either all the Diebold voting machines are rigged by Diebold executives in the middle of the night after the working stiff programmers go home , or you have to assume that the working stiff programmers are also Republicans .

Thanks Zelduh -
No time to read that one right now , but will try to look at it before tomorrow 's show .
As you know , whoever said that is full of shit .
ONE of the biggest probs in FL 2000 was when Diebold 's tabulators ( then owned by Global Election Systems ) registered NEGATIVE 16,022 votes " for " Al Gore in Volusia County , leading to the later - retracted concessions , leading to the later - argued Bush litigation in the Supreme Court that he would be harmed if they bothere dto count the ballots since he had already been announced the winner by the media .
In NM , thousands of voters on Native American reservations showed no vote at all for President on Sequoia touch - screens machines .
As to his nonsense that Diebold execs are needed to hack an election , that 's absurd , as their programmers have already screwed up the machines ( by their own admission , they lose thousands of votes ! ) , but anyone with access to a single voting machine can flip an entire election .
I guess those " conspiracy theory whackos " of Princeton University must need a talking to .

Sorry for the salty language .
It does not excuse the overt and dishonest race - baiting from Marcy .
There was no such " race - baiting from Marcy " and you were inaccurate not only in your obnoxious ad - hominem attacks , but on your attempted assertions about her posting blackface something or other .
Marcy -
If McCain is in the bag for Freddie / Fannie , one might expect that he would have taken more money from them than Baracky .
I wonder why Baracky has taken more from them than McCain .
She never said " McCain is in the bag for Freddie / Fannie " .
Her ( correct ) point is that McCain has attacked Obama ( using inaccurate and race - baiting ads ) to suggest he's in the bag for Freddie / Fannie when McCain 's own TOP advisor has taken far more money from Freddie / Fannie than anybody .
I 'll make the mistake of presuming you 're intellectually honest , and can go out and get your facts straight now that someone other than Fox " News " has offered you some .
Quite simply , Marcy and her ilk seem to be intent on calling anyone that disagrees with them racists .
SHOCKA .
Bullshit , JD .
Knock it off , or your gone .
We have a policy here against knowing disinformation , and you have presented absolutely no evidence for your obnoxious and inaccurate assertion .

Thanks for having me on , Brad .
using inaccurate and race - baiting ads I have to respectfully disagree .
I do n't see how it 's race - baiting to point out that Raines gave advice to Obama on mortgage and housing policy matters .
JD is a spirited commenter who is exaggerating for effect when he says " Marcy and her ilk seem to be intent on calling anyone that disagrees with them racists . "
But an unexaggerated version of that statement --- that some on the left are to quick to make accusations of racism --- would have a kernel of truth .
Look , I understand that Raines does n't appear to have been Obama 's closest advisor .
But he 's a guy with baggage and connections to Obama , and the McCain campaign would be stupid not to take a shot at that .
Again , I enjoyed being on the show , and making your acquaintance .

Hey Floriodiot , that 's a good article and I think I 've read it before , but with both parties being controled by corporate campign financing no matter how much the people raise in membership we can never compete with their influence .
Just look at the bailout bill .
The first dem proposed bill was much better than the crap their going to shove down both repugs & dems throats .
Now the article I linked to above talks about who 's running the debates and guess what ?
It 's big corps .
When third party candidates are included the myths from just the two parties are exposed and the level of discoarse is raised .
Does n't that benefit everyone ?

Maria Remedios Garcia
Albert is said to have worked for an NGO
Spanish police say they have arrested the representative of the left - wing Colombian rebel group Farc in Spain .
Maria Remedios Garcia Albert , a Spanish national , was detained near Madrid , as part of a joint operation by the Spanish and Colombian authorities .
She faces charges of being part of an armed group and managing the rebel group 's finances in Europe .
Farc , which has waged a 44 - year civil war in Colombia , is considered a terrorist group by the EU and the US .
The Colombian authorities have recently warned that large amounts of money raised from cocaine by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - or Farc - are often invested in Europe .
The BBC's Steve Kingstone in Madrid says it is alleged that under the cover of her job with a non-governmental organisation , Ms Garcia provided organisational support and funds to the Farc .
Computer files
In a statement , the Spanish police said Ms Garcia had travelled to Colombia last year - and held operational meetings with the militant group 's secretariat .
She is said to have taken direct orders from Raul Reyes - a senior Farc commander who was killed by the Colombian army in March .
Information from his computer hard drive is said to have led the police to make this arrest .
At the suspect 's home in San Lorenzo del Escorial , north west of Madrid , officers recovered a computer and documents , allegedly referring to the Farc .
It is claimed that Ms Garcia helped co-ordinate the group 's wider activities in Europe - allegedly liaising with counterparts in Switzerland and Sweden .

The events on Wall Street , the collapse of Lehman and the selling off of Merrill , are magnificent and inspiring events .
What we see here are examples of sweeping and fundamental change taking place , a huge upheaval that affects the whole of society , and toward the better , since what we have going on here is a massive reallocation of resources away from failing uses toward more productive uses .
Hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars are on the move , sweeping all before them .
And yet take note : it is not war accomplishing this .
It is not violence .
It is not the result of a planning committee .
No election is necessary .
No terrorist act took place .
There was no government edict .
The agent of change here is that composite of all the world 's exchanges that relentlessly shove resources this way and that way , so that they will find their most economically valued uses in society .
No one person is in charge .
Layers upon layers of decisions by millions and billions of people are the essential mechanism that makes the process move forward .
All these decisions and choices and guesses come to be aggregated in a single number called the price , and that price can then be used in that simple calculation that indicates success or failure .
Every instant of time all around the world that calculation is made , and it results in shifts and movement and progress .
But as wonderful as the daily shifts and movements are , what really inspires are the massive acts of creative destruction such as when old - line firms like Lehman and Merrill melt before our eyes , their good assets transferred to more competent hands and their bad liabilities banished from the face of the earth .
This is the kind of shock and awe we should all celebrate .
It is contrary to the wish of all the principal players and it accords with the will of society as a whole and the dictate of the market that waste not last and last .
No matter how large , how entrenched , how exalted the institution , it is always vulnerable to being blown away by market forces — no more or less so than the lemonade stand down the street .
The need for dramatic shifts is essential for progress .
But adapting to changing conditions and becoming an agent of that change , staying with the curve and jumping out in front of it — this is the real challenge .
Enacting change — any kind of change but especially big and fundamental change — sometimes seems impossible in this world .
We all desire it and know it is necessary .
Seeking the reality of rebirth has an appeal .
But finding the mechanism to make it happen is hugely difficult .
Try to change an institution from the inside and you will meet resistance around every corner .
Bureaucracies are nearly impossible to change .
Even firms in private enterprise are reluctant to adapt , and have to be pushed and nudged by the accounting ledger or no movement happens .
Churches and other charitable organizations can whither and die without periodic and fundamental change and upheaval .
Many institutions grow up around the principle of stability first .
The organizational structure tends in the direction of the protective mode , with everyone burrowing in and resisting doing something different today and tomorrow from what he or she did yesterday and the day before .
Inertia is the default .
How to break away from this problem is a great challenge .
The theory of democracy was that we would have a voting mechanism to enact and force change , but the problem is that votes and personnel shifts bring a change in the look and feel of government but do not get below the surface .
Wars and revolutions yield change but at too great a cost .
The change wrought by markets goes to the very core of the issue .
It makes and breaks whole institutions , sometimes overnight .
And it does so in a beneficial way for the whole , without blood and without the risk of unanticipated calamity .
All the plans of big shots , all the desires of our governing masters , all the wishes and dreams of people who imagine themselves to be larger and more important than the rest of us , melt like snow on a sunny day .
In this sense , the market is the great leveler , the force in the universe that humbles all people and reminds them that they are no more important than anyone else and that their wishes must ultimately be shelved when faced with the overwhelming desire on the part of market traders that some other reality emerge .
For this reason , everyone has reason to celebrate the end of Lehman and Merrill .
Overnight , while we slept , the seemingly mighty were humbled , the first made last and the last made first .
The greatest became the least , all without a shot being fired .

In a study of Christian church members who approached their church for help with a personal or family member 's diagnosed mental illness , researchers found that more than 32 percent were told by their pastor that they or their loved one did not really have a mental illness .
The problem was solely spiritual in nature , they were told .
Here 's the thing :
Other studies have found that clergy , and not psychologists or other mental health experts , are the most common source of help sought in times of psychological distress .
" The results are troubling because it suggests individuals in the local church are either denying or dismissing a somewhat high percentage of mental health diagnosis , " said study leader Matthew Stanford , professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor University in Texas .
" Those whose mental illness is dismissed by clergy are not only being told they do n't have a mental illness , they are also being told they need to stop taking their medication .
That can be a very dangerous thing . "
The results , based on surveys of 293 individuals , were published in the journal Mental Health , Religion and Culture .
Baylor researchers also found that women were more likely than men to have their mental disorders dismissed by the church .
In a subsequent survey , Baylor researchers found the dismissal or denial of the existence of mental illness happened more in conservative churches , rather than more liberal ones .
All of the participants in both studies were previously diagnosed by a licensed mental health provider as having a serious mental illness , such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia , prior to approaching their local church for assistance .
It matters what we call things .
It took too long for the Bush administration to admit that its intended liberation of Iraq had become an occupation , that US forces faced a home - grown insurgency there , and that a transition to Iraqi democracy might not result in a nation that supports US interests .
Finally , not until 2007 did the Pentagon acknowledge that Iraqi sectarian violence had crossed a threshold to become a civil war .
But policymakers still have n't come to terms with the implications of that fact .
If they did , they 'd see that a wisely executed withdrawal of US - led forces could well be the surest path to peace .
That 's because withdrawal is likely to transform the fighting in Iraq into a defensive struggle for power in a nation - state , as opposed to an offensive battle rooted in religion .
The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the war in Iraq is a religious civil war and that – even putting aside Al Qaeda in Iraq – Islam is at the heart of it for three reasons .
First , Iraq 's Sunnis and Shiites themselves see the war in these terms .
They identify first and foremost as Shiites and Sunnis .
Second , they use religious identity both to target opponents and define threats .
Finally , they have appealed beyond the borders of Iraq for aid – fighters , arms , cash – in religious terms .
Islam is not based in a specific territory ; it is a transnational faith that unites its community , or umma , in the minds of men .
Further , Islam does not have one leader who can dictate what is right or who is wrong .
The absence of an ultimate authority figure means that Shiites – who , unlike Sunnis , believe that religious scholars are needed to help interpret the will of God – often latch on to charismatic imams .
This helps explain why the cleric Moqtada al - Sadr has recently committed himself to further religious study in Iran .
It also helps to explain why Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki will fail to gain acceptance as a leader among the vast majority of Iraq 's Shiite population .
Not only does Mr. Maliki not have support in the street – his government 's failure to deliver even basic security and life 's needs is apparent to most Iraqis – but he has no religious credentials of his own to fall back on .
By contrast , Mr. Sadr 's ability to deliver security and services through his Mahdi Army , and his authority as cleric and the son of the martyred Grand Ayatollah Mohammed al - Sadr , has assured him a devoted following .
Sectarian conflict in Iraq was previously limited to fighting between Sunnis and Shiites .
But today , the conflict has grown to include Shiites against fellow Shiites .
Despite signs that security has improved , the religious civil wars in Iraq may have only just begun .
My research on civil wars from 1940 to 2000 highlights three important facts about such wars , all of which apply to Iraq .
First , nearly half of all ongoing civil wars ( 46 percent ) involve religion in some form .
Second , Islam has been involved in more than 80 percent of all religious civil wars .
Third , religious civil wars are less likely to end in negotiated settlement .
Instead , combatants tend to duke it out until one side achieves victory .
In Iraq , a negotiated settlement is going to be very difficult for two reasons .
First , the Shiites will want to remain in almost complete control due to two entirely legitimate concerns : ( 1 ) fears of Sunni repression as experienced in the past , and ( 2 ) a sense of majority - rule justice .
Second , the Shiites themselves are divided on how Iraq should be ruled , so it 's difficult to know whom to bargain with on the Shiite side , and therefore who can credibly commit to abide by the terms of any settlement .
What then can the United States and its allies do to bring about a negotiated settlement ?
Ironically , the best way to support a negotiated settlement would be to leave Iraq .
The withdrawal of US forces would allow Iraq 's predominantly Arab Shiites and Sunnis to find common interest in opposing their two more classical historical adversaries : Kurds and Persians .
The longer the US and Britain stay , the more they facilitate a shift away from the identity that long unified Iraq to the religious identity that is tearing it apart and facilitating its manipulation by Iran .
There are three obvious downsides to this approach .
First , the end of violence in Iraq following a US withdrawal would lead to the emergence of a nonsecular , nondemocratic government in Iraq .
It would be more friendly toward Iran ( though not Iran 's puppet , as currently feared ) , but less friendly toward Israel , although a democratic Iraq would be no improvement in this regard .
Second , since US withdrawal has been conditioned on a de-escalation of violence in Iraq , the Bush and Brown governments would be left the unenviable task of explaining to their countries that " withdrawal is the best way to create the conditions for , withdrawal . "
Third , withdrawal before violence has fully ceased will look like failure to most Americans and Britons .
The idea of victory versus failure is really a false dichotomy , however .
The real choice for US and British policymakers is between the more costly failure that will obtain from current policy and the less costly failure that might obtain from a well - thought - out and well - executed withdrawal .

ANCHORAGE 
The state has long suffered the highest sexual assault rate in the nation , and the problem is worst in rural areas , according to a report released Tuesday .
The numbers are unacceptable , troopers said at a news conference Tuesday detailing the study .
" Each of us has a role in ending sexual violence in Alaska , " said trooper Col. Audie Holloway .
" We need to think into the future . "
In nearly 1,000 cases studied over two years , the average age of victims was 16 , while the average age of those accused was 29 .
In four out of five cases , the suspects were relatives , friends or acquaintances .
Overall , 89 % of the victims were female .
One out of three cases were reported more than a month after the abuse occurred , leaving evidence hard to collect .
The study , conducted by the University of Alaska Anchorage 's Justice Center , looked at 989 sexual assault cases reported to state troopers in 2003 and 2004 .
Researchers did not look at cases reported in the same period to municipal police departments , including those in Anchorage or other urban centers that account for 80 % of Alaska 's 670,000 residents .
Overall , 46 % of the cases were referred for prosecution .
Of those 452 cases , about half resulted in convictions .
The study is believed to represent only a fraction of abuse actually committed in trooper jurisdiction .
Still , Alaska has had the nation 's highest per capita occurrence since 1995 .
According to statewide figures for 2003 and 2004 alone , there were 89 rapes per 100,000 people , almost three times the national average of 32 per 100,000 , said Andre Rosay , the Justice Center 's interim director .
" There are a lot of excellent programs here , so it could be reporting rates are higher here .
We do n't know , though , " he said .
" But even if there are higher reporting rates , our rates far surpass those in the lower 48 . "
Just less than half the cases studied occurred in the troopers ' immense , sparsely populated western area known as the C Detachment .
The largely native region contains a third of the state 's land mass , stretching from Kotzebue in the north to the Aleutian Islands chain .
With few communities connected by roads , about 50 troopers working in the region must fly to villages to respond to crimes beyond the scope of village safety officers .
Capt .
Steve Arlow , commander of the detachment , said the numbers were not surprising .
Sexual assaults account for the bulk of work done by troopers , he said .
" Our troopers are out there dealing with it every day , " he said .
Michelle DeWitt , director of the Tundra Women 's Coalition , said that sexual crimes are about power and that many in the region feel increasingly powerless as native cultures are undermined .
The coalition runs a regional emergency shelter in Bethel , a commercial hub for the western region .
Another huge problem , she said , arises when the accused is known to the victim .
That dilemma is intensified for those living in tiny villages .
" When a victim knows who harmed them and they live in a small community where everyone is related , they know that if they report that they were harmed , then other community members will be impacted , " DeWitt said .
" Knowing that someone may be removed from the community makes it very difficult to talk about it . "

LONDON  The French writer Jean - Marie Gustave Le Clézio , whose work reflects a seemingly insatiable restlessness and sense of wonder about other places and other cultures , won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday .
In its citation , the Swedish Academy praised Mr. Le Clézio , 68 , as the “ author of new departures , poetic adventure and sensual ecstasy , explorer of a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilization . ”
Mr. Le Clézio ’s work defies easy characterization , but in more than 40 essays , novels and children ’s books , he has written of exile and self - discovery , of cultural dislocation and globalization , of the clash between modern civilization and traditional cultures .
Having lived and taught in many parts of the world , he writes as fluently about North African immigrants in France , native Indians in Mexico and islanders in the Indian Ocean as he does about his own past .
Mr. Le Clézio is not well known in the United States , where few of his books are available in translation , but he is considered a major figure in European literature and has long been mentioned as a possible laureate .
The awards ceremony is planned for Dec. 10 in Stockholm , and , as the winner , Mr. Le Clézio will receive 10 million Swedish kronor , or about $ 1.4 million .
At an impromptu news conference in Paris at the headquarters of his publisher , Éditions Gallimard , Mr. Le Clézio seemed unperturbed by all the attention .
He said he had received the telephone call telling him about the prize while he was reading “ Dictatorship of Sorrow , ” by the 1940s Swedish writer Stig Dagerman .
In picking Palin , McCain has ignited a wave of elation and emotion that has led some grassroots activists to weep with joy .
Palin electrifies conservative base
ST . PAUL , Minn . —
The selection of Sarah Palin as John McCain ’s running mate has electrified conservative activists , providing a boost of energy to the GOP nominee - in - waiting from a key constituency that previously had been lukewarm — at best — about him .
By tapping the anti-abortion and pro-gun Alaska governor just ahead of his convention , which is set to start here Monday , McCain has n’t just won approval from a skeptical Republican base — he ’s ignited a wave of elation and emotion that has led some grass - roots activists to weep with joy .
Advertisement
Serious questions remain about McCain ’s pick — exactly how much he knows about her and her positions , past and present , on key issues .
But for the worker bee core of the party that is essential to any Republican victory , there are no doubts .
“ I woke up and my e-mail was just going crazy , ” said Charmaine Yoest , head of the legislative arm of Americans United for Life and a former top official in Mike Huckabee ’s presidential campaign .
“ And then when it was announced — it was like you could n’t breathe . ”
The media elite — as well as elite members of the GOP consulting community — have all but mocked Palin as a former small - town mayor with zero Washington experience .
But that view of her totally misses the cultural resonance she carries to crucial Republican power centers and could not be more at odds with the jubilation felt among true believers that one of their own is on the ticket .
Palin , say conservative activists , has instantly changed how they feel about McCain ’s campaign and spurred them to go to work for the Republican ticket .
First , though , they ’re expressing their newfound fondness for McCain with their checkbooks .
Since tapping Palin , the campaign has raised nearly $ 7 million online , according to McCain aides .
Most importantly for McCain , the two constituencies who are most energized by Palin just happen to be the twin grassroots pillars of the GOP : anti-abortion activists and pro-Second Amendment enthusiasts and sportsmen .
Without these two camps making phone calls , stuffing envelopes and knocking on doors , Republican presidential candidates would severely lack for volunteers .
They are critical to the health of the conservative coalition that has dominated Republican politics for a generation .
Republicans say the primary source for the passion can be found in Palin ’s example and authenticity .
Not only is the 44 - year - old governor opposed to abortion rights — but she carried and gave birth to a child with Down syndrome earlier this year , a profound and powerful motivating force to both opponents of abortion rights and the parents and relatives of special needs children .
And not only is she a supporter of the right to bear arms — but she ’s a lifetime member of the NRA and an avid hunter and fisherman whose gubernatorial office couch is adorned with a massive grizzly bear pelt .
“ She ’s lived it ! ” exulted Yoest .
“ It ’s so satisfying as a conservative woman .
When she walked out on that stage there was just this moment .
It was really emotional for a lot of us . ”
After hearing the news , Yoest , who was in St. Paul preparing for the convention , said she and other Republican women here “ were grabbing each other and jumping up and down . ”
Steve Duprey , a former New Hampshire GOP chairman and top McCain backer who hails from the moderate wing of the party , was also in the Twin Cities when the news broke .
“ I was in the Rules Committee with about 150 people in the room .
They had TVs set up and we took a break to watch the announcement .
For a second after she came out , it was silent .
Then there was a gasp and everybody stood up and started cheering and clapping .
We stayed standing the whole speech . ”
After Palin finished , he said , the emotion set in .
“ There were 10 or 12 women , party stalwarts , in tears , using napkins and handkerchiefs . ”
Part of the reason for the joy is what President Bush once called , in another context , “ the soft bigotry of low expectations . ”
Social conservatives just did n’t expect one of their own to be tapped and were actually bracing themselves for the selection of a supporter of abortion rights .
“ There is an electricity going through the social conservative crowd right now ; it ’s unbelievable , ” said James Muffett , head of Michigan ’s Citizens for Traditional Values , who had met with McCain in the weeks leading up to his selection of a running mate .
“ Especially given all the set - ups and head fakes — it ’s amazing .
A lot of people were sure he was going to show his more moderate colors . ”
Muffett said the effect on his conservative comrades in arms has been immediate and visceral .
“ My wife and I watched an MSNBC special on her last night , ” he said .
“ My wife knew nothing about this woman .
But she was in tears listening to her articulate the views she had . ”
Since the pick , Muffett said , he ’s gotten “ dozens of e-mails and the phones have been ringing off the hook ” from other social conservatives who had assumed McCain would spurn them .
“ They were taunting me , saying ‘ McCain ’s going to disappoint you , ’ ” he said of the sentiment before the pick .
Since ?
“ ’Boy , what kind of prayers have you been saying for McCain ? ’ ” he said with a chuckle about the question asked on one phone call .
“ He went and chose a Pentecostal for his running mate ! ”
The adoration goes beyond Christian conservatives .
Sportsmen are also overjoyed at the addition of one of their own , and ca n’t get enough of video and pictures showing Palin firing a weapon .
“ She 's one of us , ” wrote Michael Bane , a prominent Colorado - based gun enthusiast who has a show on the Outdoor Channel , on his blog .
“ FINALLY , we can get 100 percent behind the Republican ticket ... change we can believe in ! ”
“ You know I 've had my problems with McCain , but he has reached out a hand to us both at the NRA Annual Meeting [ earlier this year ] and with the amazing selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate , ” Bane added .
And then there is the contrast : “ While [ Barack Obama ] wants to ban AR - 15s , Palin shoots AR - 15s , and apparently pretty well . ”
“ Every shooter , every hunter , every gun owner , every competitor needs to understand that it is time to , in the words of Bruce Willis , ‘ cowboy the 'f ...' up .’ ”
Chris Cox , the top political aide at the NRA , suggested that his job just got a whole lot easier , not just with a pro-gun Republican vice presidential nominee but a Democratic number two — Delaware Sen.
Joe Biden — who is anathema to the Second Amendment community
“ We ’ll be able to have some fun contrasting not just McCain and Obama , but Biden and Palin , ” said Cox , whose organization is giving " I 'm a Bitter Gun Owner and I Vote ! " signs and T - shirts to its members .
“ She ’s great on our issues and [ Biden ’s ] been terrible for 35 years . ”
Her image as a pistol - packin ’ mama could prove especially key in the hunter - filled Rust Belt , said Paul Erhardt , a longtime political strategist who specializes on gun issues .
“ Palin could play strong in the sporting states like Michigan , Ohio and Pennsylvania , depending on how they use her , ” he said .
“ Most pundits will underestimate her appeal in these key areas because they do n't know her and they are unfamiliar with the sporting scene .
But among sportsmen , authenticity counts and Palin 's got that and then some . ”
Palin also reassures those concerned about McCain 's judgment on judges .
Said Gary Marx , head of the Judicial Confirmation Network and a former Mitt Romney aide : " I can tell you that this pick tells millions in the base of the party that they can trust McCain .
More specifically that they can trust him with Supreme Court picks and other key appoitments "
The sense of rejuvenation is not just limited to party activists , though .
Conservative elites , among the most disdainful of McCain , are also coming around .
James Dobson , long a McCain skeptic , said after the announcement Friday that he ’d support Palin .
And he ’s not alone .
“ I ’ve talked to two prominent social conservative leaders in the past 24 hours who told me they had previously not planned to attend the convention , but were now coming to Minneapolis after the Palin pick , ” wrote Ralph Reed , a Christian conservative leader who has tangled with McCain , in an e-mail .
“ One scrambled to find a hotel room and is coming tomorrow ; the other rearranged his schedule and is flying in Wednesday .
I got a call this afternoon from an evangelical business leader who told me he was contacting the McCain campaign and offering to host a fundraiser with his friends for McCain ( sans the candidate ) before the Thursday deadline [ when McCain shifts to the public financing system ] .
I do n’t know if I ’ve ever seen a veep pick energize the grass roots like this . ”
Rush Limbaugh , who exulted on the air this week , summed up the response he ’s gotten from his loyal listeners : “ Home f*** ing run . ”
“ Palin=Guns , Babies , Jesus , ” he wrote in an e-mail .
“ Contrast that to Obama 's bitter clingers .
Obama just lost blue - collar , white Democratic voters in Pennsylvania and other states . ”
And , he said , the line that the pick was aimed at picking off Democratic women who backed Hillary Rodham Clinton does n’t get it right .
“ [ The ] choice is to shore up the conservative , pro-drilling base , ” he said .
“ This is an aggressive , on - offense pick , not a defensive pick . ”
The pick caps off what has been a turbulent few weeks for conservative Republicans .
Muffett , who was talking on his cell phone from a church outing at Ohio ’s Cedar Point amusement park , likened McCain ’s campaign to the world - record 17 roller coasters that dot the park on the banks of Lake Erie .
“ Oh my gosh , holy moly , ” he said .
“ He floated the pro-abortion running mate , then there was his performance at the Saddleback debate , and then you had the Lieberman headfake and now this . ”
“ Up and down , up and down . ”
For now , though , at least as it relates to the long - mistrustful conservatives he ’ll need energized to win , McCain is sky - high .
“ Now that he has so thoroughly exceeded their expectations for his candidacy ( first with his stellar performance at the Saddleback Showdown , now with his selection of his running mate ) , social conservatives are finally putting on their cleats and getting on to the field , ” wrote Reed .
“ It ’s really quite remarkable , and something that no one would have guessed would happen even three months ago . ”
A climate prof noted for data mining of archived ships ' logs has produced further insights into global warming .
Dr Dennis Wheeler of Sunderland Uni says his latest analysis shows sudden warming of the North Atlantic and Europe - much like that seen in recent times - during the 1730s .
This ,
Wheeler believes , shows that widespread rises in temperature of the kind recorded lately can be caused naturally .
He thinks that human - caused carbon emissions are contributing to climate change now , but says it is unwise to link human emissions to specific events unless evidence is very strong .
“ Global warming is a reality , but what our data shows is that climate science is complex and that it is wrong to take particular events and link them to CO 2 emissions , " Wheeler told the Times at the weekend .
Wheeler 's new 1730s temperature spike info comes from trawling through mountains of archived ship 's logs .
Royal
Navy logbooks have been particularly valuable , both for this project and previous ones .
“ British archives contain more than 100,000 Royal Navy logbooks from around 1670 to 1850 alone , " says Wheeler .
" They are a stunning resource . ”
The new research , compiled by Wheeler and colleagues from the Met Office and other institutions , is to be published in the journal Climatic Change .
The paper has already gained a good deal of ink in the UK media , generally referencing Admiral Nelson and Captain Cook for their zeal in keeping accurate records .
As neither Cook nor Nelson were at sea during the 1730s , this seems a bit unreasonable .
Perhaps the most famous British naval officer active at the time was Captain ( later Admiral ) George Anson .
Anson subsequently became a naval legend after his epic voyage round the world from 1740 - 44 , during which he and his crew captured a Spanish treasure galleon in the Pacific - making the survivors who eventually got home to England rich men .
Later , as an admiral , Anson also handed the French a massive kicking at Cape Finisterre and then became First Sea Lord - the head of the Navy .
During the 1730s - the period where Wheeler 's sudden warming occurs - Captain Anson was at sea in the Atlantic , so it 's likely that his logs form part of Wheeler 's data set .
However , it was n't normal for warships to carry thermometers at the time , so much of the analysis draws on winds and the " consistent language " used by sea officers of the time , as well as European shore - based records . ®
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
Fairly or not , some critics say they can't help but see similarities between the Bush administration 's hurried approach to the financial market crisis and its headlong plunge into the Iraq war .
" You can draw some valid parallels between the prosecution of the war under the Bush regime and the way the financial sector has operated in recent years , " said Tom Schlesinger , head of the nonprofit research group Financial Markets Center in Howardsville , Va .
" It fails the most basic test of democratic accountability , " Schlesinger said .
“ More questions than answers , and rising fear of ' government bungling that will cost taxpayers , big - time . ' ”
On Tuesday , Washington kicks off the first hearings in which top officials will defend their prescription before lawmakers , who also are compelled by circumstances to take speedy action .
Some policy observers point to a " trust us " mentality in the administration 's call to obtain sweeping powers that are scant on checks and balances on the executive branch .
In addition , the White House is faulted with a failure to raise alarm before the situation spiraled out of control , forcing the mobilization of more troops and untold financial resources .
Outlining the administration 's remedy , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson came up with a three - page plan to spend $ 700 billion on toxic mortgage debt that was very spare on key details .
It boils down to " give me the money and trust me , " Schlesinger said .
James Angel , a professor of finance at Georgetown University , said the White House appears to be " flying by the seat of their pants . "
Sidelined
Congress got little advance warning of the proposed bailout , as the Treasury Department waited until five days before lawmakers were set to leave town for the presidential and Congressional election campaigns .
As a result , any discussion of alternatives has been sidelined .
In the eight years of the Bush administration , investment firms have , like the security contractor Blackwater , been subjected to slim or no oversight , Schlesinger said .
Now comes another big contracting job .
Struggling to assess the cost of a financial rescue , analysts have honed in on the price the Treasury pays for seizing toxic assets on the books of financial institutions .
The department has pledged to hire financial market experts to conduct the plan .
Treasury is talking about a plan that essentially would allow sellers to name their price for the securities .
Under the plan , a so - called reverse auction , institutions that choose the lowest price -- say 50 cents on the dollar -- would win instead of a firm that wants 60 cents .
Price too low
Economists said there was a central problem to the Paulson plan .
Most of the toxic waste in question does have some price , but it has been too low for the financial institution holding them to accept .
So the government buyout would only work if taxpayers overpay for the assets .
" It is no wonder that the Bush administration is pressing to get the plan passed quickly before any real oversight can be brought to bear , because even the simplest due diligence suggests that it needs some work if the taxpayer 's interests are to be even minimally protected and some real oversight brought to bear on the whole process , " wrote Josh Shapiro , chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc. in a note to clients .
And that may be precisely what is most worrisome to economists who fear , as Angel put it , " government bungling that will cost taxpayers , big - time . "
At issue would be what assets Treasury buys .
" How much are they going to pay for them ?
How are they going to service those assets ? , " Angel said .
" It is a trust - me operation .
And this administration has n't really earned a lot of trust by its execution in a number of areas , " including crises like Hurricane Katrina and Iraq .
Despite the flaws perceived in the administration 's proposal , there is a feeling that the train has left the station and Paulson is about to be empowered to take toxic mortgage loans off of the balance sheets of scores of financial firms .
Election season
As in the debate on whether to authorize the Iraq war , Democrats see little upside in opposing the bailout .
In an election season , the leadership does n't want to be painted as the party that did nothing to help restore calm to financial markets and everyone 's 401 ( k ) account .
So the price Democrats are asking the White House to pay is not very steep .
While Rep. Barney Frank , a key lawmaker , said the Bush administration and Democrats have agreed to additions to the plan , including creating an independent oversight board and aid for homeowners facing foreclosure , uncertainty remains over a proposal to allow the government to take an equity position in companies that participate in the U.S. program .
See full story .
Some analysts see another Iraq parallel :
The administration has been slow to understand the gravity of the financial turmoil just as it was slow to realize how difficult it would be to govern Iraq after toppling the government of Saddam Hussein .
" Paulson never seemed to grasp the seriousness of the situation , said Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research , a liberal think tank based in Washington .
Until just last week , Paulson consistently told reporters there was no need for massive government intervention in the mortgage crisis .
" This is Paulson 's surge here , " Angel said .
" In much the same way the administration let the insurgency get out of hand , Paulson let this turmoil get out of hand .
Now he is finally combating it by sending in enough troops to quell it . "
After the nation 's savings and loan debacle , many people made fortunes by flipping cheap assets they bought on the cheap from the Resolution Trust Corp .
" If the Treasury overpays for bad paper and then dumps it on the market , it is a recipe for plenty of hedge fund smoothies to make a fortune , " Angel said .
On other thing is certain as legacy of both Iraq and the mortgage crisis , whoever is the next president will have to tackle many hard questions left unanswered by the Bush presidency .
Open Source Roboticists
On a Path to C3P0
by Ostatic Staff - Sep. 05 , 2008
If you happen to own a Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner , you already have a robot in your life .
( I have a Roomba , and highly recommend it -- available at Target . )
Roomba is a classic example of how a robot does n't have to be humanoid to be useful .
In the open source community , though , there are several efforts to develop robots that look and / or act like humans , performing interesting and useful tasks .
They 're not C3PO at this stage of their development , but they show tremendous promise , especially if more open source contributions are made to the projects .
Here are a couple of good examples to take a gander at .
Willow Garage is an open source robotics project that originated at Stanford University .
Robots being developed with the project run ROS ( Robot Operating System ) software .
The operating system comes complete with tutorials , a developer 's guide , and more -- all at the link just provided .
PR2 is the mobile hardware design for Willow Garage robots , featuring stereo and laser sensors .
It 's shown at left .
Stanford hosts a series of highly entertaining and interesting videos here , showing PR2 robots performing tasks such as tidying up a room and retrieving beer from a refrigerator .
Senior citizens are a big part of the target audience that Willow Garage is aiming for .
" All industrialized countries are facing aging populations that require assistance and care to remain independent into old age .
By 2020 close to 20 percent of the US population will be over 65 , " the project leaders say .
" These numbers are even higher in Western European and Asian countries . "
Willow Garage is aiming to produce several types of assistive robots .
We covered the iCub open source robot , seen at left , once before , here .
The iCub , unlike many less advanced robots , is capable of learning from experience .
It looks like a metallic , 2 - year old child , and it has sensors in its hands , eyes and elsewhere that help it navigate its surroundings .
There is an open source hardware design for iCub , and an open source software platform .
Who says C3PO and R2D2 can't come from the open source community ?
McCain 's mother laments : ' They wo n't let me talk ' Nick Juliano and David Edwards
Published : Wednesday September 3 , 2008
Print This Email This
On a few occasions during this campaign season , the let - it - all - hang - out rhetorical style John McCain 's 96 - year - old mother employs has caused some unwanted distractions for the Republican presidential candidate .
Roberta McCain 's gaffes used to seem an endearing marker of the " straight talk " candidate 's roots , but just as the GOP message - men have forced their candidate to stick to the script , so are they keeping his mother away from any open microphones , according to Sirius Radio 's Michelangelo Signorile .
" They wo n't let me be interviewed , " McCain lamented to the radio host who approached her Tuesday during the Republican convention in St. Paul .
" They wo n't let me talk . "
RAW STORY obtained audio of Signorile 's aborted interview attempt , which demonstrated the extent to which message control is the name of the game at the GOP 's gathering in Minnesota .
The host was n't even inquiring about anything controversial : " What is it like for you this week ? " he asked as McCain 's handlers shuffled her away .
In a blog post about the incident , Signorile described McCain 's facial expression as " pained " and said she looked at him " helplessly , pleadingly , " as she was led away for a photo - op alongside would - be First Lady Cindy McCain .
Of course , it 's not like their fears that Roberta McCain would say something distracting was completely unfounded .
Earlier this year , she let slip her true feelings about the Republican party base her son is now reaching out to in his quest for the White House .
" Holding their nose , they 're going to have to take him , " McCain said in January before the son she still refers to as " Johnny " emerged as the GOP nominee .
" I 'm really popping off , " the elder McCain continued , " but he worked like a dog to get Bush reelected .
He 's backed Bush in everything except Rumsfeld .
...
And I 've never seen any public recognition of the work that he 's done for the Republican Party . "
Last year , McCain took a swipe at her son's top rival , Mitt Romney , saying Mormons were to blame for a scandal at the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City , Utah .
And just last month , the matriarch of the McCain family said her son's " celebrity " ad was " kinda stupid . "
The Republican apparatus has been trying to keep McCain away from the press for some time , as Los Angeles Times reporter James Rainey recounted earlier this summer .
But after months waiting in vain for a formal interview , I 'm beginning to believe that her son's presidential campaign really is n't interested in getting Roberta McCain and me together for , as the man likes to call it , a little " straight talk . "
" They 've got me muzzled , " Mrs. McCain , 96 , said when I phoned the other day .
She added with a chuckle : " Now do n't you print that .
. . .
I really do n't like to be interviewed . "
For her part , McCain was not the only nonagenarian featured at the two parties ' late - summer conventions .
Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden shared some endearing stories of his 91 - year - old mother , Catherine Biden , during his acceptance speech last week .
The elder Biden was not so press shy after her own turn in the spotlight .
" He 's a wonderful man , a wonderful son , " Biden told a Rocky Mountain News reporter , keeping her remarks simple and uncontroversial .
" It 's a happy family ....
That 's pretty much all . "

What is Sketch Please ?
When we first started Sketch Please in 2005 , we were a couple of artists who just wanted to keep each other motivated to draw .
We agreed to complete one drawing a week on a specific topic .
We never imagined that we 'd still be drawing over 300 weeks later — or how many other artists around the world would also want to participate .
We 've heard from many of you out there that you want to join the site , and though we had been working on a public version of the Sketch Please website which would allow everyone to join , we 've had to hit pause due to work and life stuff .
We still have every intention of making the site public , so if you 've contacted us in the past , we 've kept your information on file , and will let you know when the public site opens .
If you 'd like to contact for any other reason , send us a message through our contact page .
In the meantime , please like us on Facebook or Google + by clicking the buttons at the top of the page , leave some comments , and enjoy this magical nonsense we 've created .

The sixth annual Altered Barbie art show 1 / 14 Back to Gallery
Barbie is the ultimate cougar .
She 's single , frolics with younger men and , at 49 years old , does n't look a day over 17 .
That is , until she 's altered .
" She 's sexy .
But the concept of altering Barbie , of turning her into a piece of art , brings it into the realm of personal identity , " says Julie Andersen , curator of " Altered Barbie , " the annual exhibition of three - dimensional art , photography , dance and music that runs through Aug. 17 at Art 94124 Gallery .
" For many of the artists , it stops being about Barbie and becomes a celebration of the self . "
For the sixth annual show , the theme is recycled and reusable materials , which many of the 60 artists have used to represent distorted body image , as well as to create everything from fashionable Barbie outfits to anatomically correct versions of the doll .
The exhibition also includes quilts , print making , poetry , film , workshops on altering Barbie and " self - marriages , " ceremonies intended to help people appreciate their capacity to control their own lives .
At the center of this burgeoning summer institution is Barbie , a kind of three - dimensional blank canvas that allows artists to display their reverence , humor or biting satire .
Barbie is used to create stories about contemporary culture , and also used as a yardstick to measure American progress .
To some , who grew up combing her hair and having her play Mom to younger sister Skipper , Barbie recalls simpler times , when Mom cooked and Dad worked .
To others , as noted by Susan Stern in her 1998 documentary " Barbie Nation : An Unauthorized Tour , " Barbie was a sexual liberator .
Based on the early 1950s German doll Lilli , a barroom floozy , Barbie used television to bypass uninterested parents and more directly market herself to girls with her huge wardrobe of potential styles and personalities .
In her early days , Barbie wore white gloves .
Today , Mattel 's versions alone have held more than 75 jobs .
Then there are the altered Barbies .
Debbie Fimrite , 50 , a Berkeley artist and doll collector , creates deaf , multicultural , and gay and lesbian Barbies .
As a girl , Fimrite played with Barbie , but never quite realized how negatively the doll affected her self - image .
" Now I spend my time trying to alter the Barbie image by making Barbie into a warrior , a social deviant , fattening her , giving her more muscle , " she says .
" Sometimes I try to make her more like the actual people in my life because I am so sick of the blond princess image and the glamour queen doll I grew up with . "
Last year , her mother accompanied Fimrite to the show dressed as Grandmother Barbie .
There she was joined by Drag Queen Barbies , War Veteran Ken and Celebrity Substance - Abuse Barbie .
Photographer Danny Sanchez of San Jose plans to show a series of black - and - white prints .
The images are part of " Life as Plastastic , " which focuses on Barbie wanting to be part of the real world .
Sanchez incorporates story lines , such as people who seek out plastic surgery to shape their bodies to look more like Barbie dolls .
" The reason I enjoy working with Barbie is that she is iconic and always seems to be ready for her up - close , " says Sanchez , 29 .
A 2007 series of Barbie photographs called " Put That Down , That S- Expensive ! " by Melissa Chow focused on the all - consuming nature that Barbie embodies .
Instead of monitoring her own oil consumption , the doll is pictured inhaling the costly commodity .
" She 's just a part of Americana , " says Chow , 26 .
" She represents the good and the bad stereotypes of culture , race , materialism , womanhood .
In that sense , I find something amusing and gratifying about altering something so solidly representative of old - fashioned values . "
While the San Francisco version of " Altered Barbie " has enjoyed success , drawing large crowds of browsers and even a handful of buyers ( prices range from $ 50 to several thousand ) , it 's hardly the first art show centered on the theme of altering Mattel 's leggy blonde .
The Soft Touch Artists ' Collective held a show in 1998 in commemoration of Barbie 's 40th birthday .
For LaVonne Sallee of San Francisco , it 's the thrill of creating something modern from something so well established that she likes best .
Born in Roswell , N.M. , Sallee grew up a tomboy with little interest in Barbie .
By the time she turned 25 , she had lived in 35 apartments , houses and trailers in four states and gone to nine schools .
Instead of pursuing art , her passion , she worked for 25 years as a criminal investigator for a bank .
" I have always considered myself an artist , " says Sallee , 62 .
Two years ago , she stumbled onto the exhibition on Market Street .
Since then she has been hooked on creating art .
" The thing about Barbie that makes me feel sorry for her is that she has no nipples , " she says .
" Nipples are my specialty , and many of my Barbies are bare - chested , so I can give her a beautiful set of nipples .
She likes that . "
What looks easily put together can be painstakingly difficult work , says Charlotte Davis , co-founder of the show , who teaches workshops on altering Barbie .
Davis , a hot - glue expert , says that because Barbie is fashioned from so many types of plastic , altering the doll often involves trial and error and requires keeping up with the methods of Barbie 's makers .
Artist Jody Banks ' early creations were rather primitive , but still good enough to swap for a round a drinks at Burning Man .
This year , Banks used photomontage to avoid the complexities of physically altering Barbie , which often involves fastening various plastics and metals together .
His themes include marriage , divorce , aging and death .
Banks says he decided to incorporate marriage into his pieces because " Barbie has always been very focused on getting married - almost every Barbie book ends with her engagement or wedding - and I 'm attempting to subvert the idea of marriage as a goal or end in itself for both women and men with these pieces . "

Ordinarily , I would not pry into a family ’s business .
So why should anyone care whether new vice presidential candidate , Sarah Palin , is the mother of Trig , or her 16 year old daughter is ?
The answer is – blackmail by foreign powers at the level of the Oval Office .
Such a prize has never before been available to our opponents , and we can not allow it to occur now .
If Sarah Palin ’s minor daughter is the mother of Trig as appears near certainty , then depending on the paternity of the child , Trig may be a smoking gun for a major felony compounded by felonies to cover up .
There are several motives that could drive Governor Palin to cover up her daughter ’s pregnancy .
Some motives are benign , but others are extremely powerful motivators , and the more Sarah appears to cover up , the higher the probability she is motivated by something serious .
If Sarah ’s daughter got pregnant by a boy in her age group and the doctor said the baby had Down ’s syndrome , Sarah could take the baby to spare her daughter that task , and to spare herself the political embarrassment of a daughter with an out of wedlock child .
Neither I , nor most sensible people would think this wrong .
If her daughter got pregnant by a young man known to the family who would face a statutory rape charge , Sarah could take the baby as hers to protect her daughter that pain and the young man prison , because if the baby is Sarah 's , no DA can order a test of paternity .
This is also understandable , and many people with humanity would do the same .
If the girl got pregnant by Sarah ’s husband while he was drunk and Sarah was busy eclipsing him in her governorship , her husband would face statutory rape with special conditions while Sarah would face career ruin , family destruction and a financial trainwreck .
Note that heavy drinking and marital isues are two of the three major correlates of what therapists will tell you is a very common family incident .
If the daughter got pregnant by Sarah ’s older son , the son could go to prison , he would be dishonorably discharged , and Sarah ’s political career would probably be over .
This also happens more commonly than most believe , but I consider it less likely .
It is with great reluctance that I write this .
But the possible problems are nothing less than compromise of the presidency through blackmail by a foreign power , and that requires us to invert the normal standards which would require extraordinary proof before breathing a word of such possibilities .
This has the appearance of a textbook example of the kind of personal problem that agents look for to force someone to be a traitor to their country .
The keys to the kingdom of compromise are sex , drugs , and financial problems .
The Kremlin and the gentlemen in Beijing would like nothing quite so much as to have a lever worth hundreds of billions of dollars in armaments .
For that matter , so would Iran ’s Pasdaran , a secret service which is quite capable for such a small nation , and worth being concerned about .

Charlotte Corday at the guillotine .
English School / The Bridgeman Art Library / Getty Images
At one time in history , decapitation was one of the preferred methods of execution , in part thanks to the guillotine .
Although many countries that execute criminals have dispatched with the method , it 's still performed by certain governments , terrorists and others .
There 's nothing more final than the severing of one 's head .
The guillotine came about because of the desire for a quick , relatively humane death .
But how quick is it ?
If your head were cut off , would you still be able to see or otherwise move it , even for just a few seconds ?
This concept perhaps first appeared during the French Revolution , the very time period in which the guillotine was created .
On July 17 , 1793 , a woman named Charlotte Corday was executed by guillotine for the assassination of Jean - Paul Marat , a radical journalist , politician and revolutionary .
Marat was well - liked for his ideas and the mob awaiting the guillotine was eager to see Corday pay .
After the blade dropped and Corday 's head fell , one of the executioner 's assistants picked it up and slapped its cheek .
According to witnesses , Corday 's eyes turned to look at the man and her face changed to an expression of indignation .
Following this incident , people executed by guillotine during the Revolution were asked to blink afterward , and witnesses claim that the blinking occurred for up to 30 seconds .

Another often - told tale of demonstrated consciousness following beheading dates to 1905 .
French physician Dr. Gabriel Beaurieux witnessed the beheading of a man named Languille .
He wrote that immediately afterward , " the eyelids and lips ... worked in irregularly rhythmic contractions for about five or six seconds . "
Dr. Beaurieux called out his name and said that Languille 's eyelids " slowly lifted up , without any spasmodic contraction " and that " his pupils focused themselves " [ source : Kershaw ] .
This happened a second time , but the third time Beaurieux spoke , he got no response .
These stories seem to give credence to the idea that it 's possible for someone to remain conscious , even for just a few seconds , after being beheaded .
However , most modern physicians believe that the reactions described above are actually reflexive twitching of muscles , rather than conscious , deliberate movement .
Cut off from the heart ( and therefore , from oxygen ) , the brain immediately goes into a coma and begins to die .
According to Dr. Harold Hillman , consciousness is " probably lost within 2 - 3 seconds , due to a rapid fall of intracranial perfusion of blood " [ source : New Scientist ] .
So while it 's not entirely impossible for someone to still be conscious after being decapitated , it 's not likely .
Hillman also goes on to point out that the so - called painless guillotine is likely anything but .
He states that " death occurs due to separation of the brain and spinal cord , after transection of the surrounding tissues .
This must cause acute and possibly severe pain . "
This is one of the reasons why the guillotine , and beheading in general , is no longer an accepted method of execution in many countries with capital punishment .
If your head stays on your shoulders , though , it can still be damaged beyond repair .
Next , let 's take a look about how long brain damage can last .

No so long ago , auto buyers stumbled over themselves — and sometimes their own financial well - being — to get new rides .
They raced through lease paperwork , grabbed easy credit and nodded wildly when asked about home - equity loans to cover monthly vehicle payments .
Of course , that was before consumers had their feet yanked off the economic pedal , leaving a lot less love on dealer lots .
Now , dealers across the nation are scrambling to rework their businesses to survive one of the industry ’s roughest slumps in decades .
Depending on the dealership , customers are likely to notice the changes , from fewer vehicles available on lots to harder - charging salespeople and more pressure to pull into dealer service bays , typically a source of higher profit margins .
Some changes may be further reaching .
One of the nation ’s biggest dealership groups , Asbury Automotive Group , which is moving its headquarters from New York to Duluth , Ga. , is preparing to add salary to what had been largely commission - only compensation of its salespeople .
It ’s an attempt to help talented employees get through the current hungry times , said chief executive Charles Oglesby , who previously oversaw the group ’s Nalley Automotive Group in metro Atlanta .
But he said he ’s hoping it will stick , even after the market improves , leading to higher pay for salespeople overall and easing pressure to negotiate a fast deal .
Most dealers , though , would be happy just to get through the industry ’s immediate pain .
Steve Rayman , who has ownership stakes in nine dealerships , including five in metro Atlanta , has been in the auto business 30 years .
“ It ’s the toughest I ’ve seen , ” he said of the current market .
Sales are half what they were just a year ago , he said .
“ It ’s mind boggling . ”
Every month a vehicle sits unsold adds more financing expenses for the dealer .
“ Our new - car departments are terrible .
We are losing a lot of money .
There really is no net profit , ” Rayman said .
“ When customers come in the dealership now we are a lot more aggressive .
We have got to put every customer in a car . ”
The economy slowed .
Lenders cut back on credit for buyers .
Gas prices surged .
Banks and lending arms of automakers opted to curb or eliminate leasing options that in the past enabled consumers to get more expensive vehicles and keep them for shorter periods .
At the same time , many manufacturers — particularly domestic makers — are teetering after a stunning shift in the kinds of vehicles consumers want to buy : smaller , more efficient cars .

False Allegations of child sexual exploitation .
Canadian Children 's Rights Council website shut down by false allegations of child pornography
November 29 , 2007
The Canadian Children 's Rights Council alleged the following which has not yet been proven in a civil and / or criminal court and is the subject of litigation initiated by the Canadian Children 's Rights Council and our executive falsely reported as being a pedophile .
The criminal aspect is mischief committed by the person making the false allegation .
The civil is the damages and cost to change web hosting companies .
In February 2007 , just before Valentines Day , an executive volunteer of the Canadian Children 's Rights Council , started a website for his daughter using authorized web space allocated by the Canadian Children 's Rights Council .
The website , while being totally autonomous from our website was on web hosting space which is part of the web hosting package with one of the largest Internet web hosting companies in the world , 1 & 1 Internet Inc. of the USA .
The website contained a few pictures of the adult daughter taken when she was a child and a valentines greeting without any personal information other than the first and last name of the daughter whom had already had provided substantial personal information on the social network open to the world called Facebook .
A " Nude " picture was on the website .
The picture is of a toddler taken from the back / side with the baby standing with her diaper around her feet .
The only possible " bare " area was a tiny portion of her bottom since both her bottom and her chest were blocked out in orange in the picture displayed on that internet website .
This picture below is the actual picture as shown on that website which included the orange block - outs as shown , although we are of the opinion that they are n't even needed .
If you are a member of the media and wish to use the picture below , please contact us .
We will note your contact information and , in most cases , provide permission to use the photo in your publication .
Largest American web hosting company 1and1.com said this picture is child pornography .
This is the original picture as you see it which included the orange block - outs as shown .
Service to that website was terminated without notice and a false explanation was provided by the customer service of the Internet web hosting company .
Days later , they finally revealed that they had a phone call from a woman who stated she was the ex-wife of one the executive of the Canadian Children 's Rights Council falsely claiming that the executive is a pedophile and had put child porn on the website in question .
The Internet webhosting company had terminated service , locked the website content and reported it to the FBI .
They had not looked at the website .
When they finally admitted why they shut down the website and all other websites in the web hosting package including the website of the Canadian Children 's Rights Council , they were asked to view the website in question .
The company had a policy of shutting down websites first and not reviewing them , leaving these websites to be viewed by police who would determine if the content was child porn as defined by the criminal justice system .
The web hosting company then claimed that their 20 page contract stated that they could shut down any websites without notice for any reason whatsoever .
They had such a policy to " protect children from sexual exploitation " .
The Canadian Children 's Rights Council fully supports the reporting of real child porn and child abuse and has passed on such reports when received immediately to national and international police services .
We support Cypertips.ca and have provided information about them to every person who has had contact with us regarding a possible incident of child sexual exploitation .
The Cybertips.ca website stated on November 29 , 2007 " Since launching Cybertip.ca in September 2002 , the tipline has forwarded reports to law enforcement that have resulted in 27 arrests and the removal of as many as 2100 websites . "
We wonder about the extent of the problem and the effectiveness of methods used to fight child sexual exploitation in Canada and internationally .
Why with 2100 websites reported has there been only 27 arrests in 5 years ?
What was the criteria for the websites ?
We estimate that over 50,000 children in Manitoba are suffering from Parental Alienation Syndrome , a form of child abuse .
Why are n't there statistics from that government about this important form of child abuse .
Why is n't the Manitoba government doing something ?
This is a major children 's mental health issue .
Why does n't the government provide no charge lawyers to these child victims and their parents that are the victims of Parental Alienation for the purpose of stopping this form of child abuse ?
The provincial governments do supply lawyers at no cost to parents for the purpose of collecting child financial support as ordered by the court but they do n't go after parents disobeying parenting time orders made by court or negotiated in separation agreements by divorcing or never married parents .
A reader proposes :
" Yesterday I talked to a group of voters about how the McCain campaign is trying to call their continuation of just about every single Bush - Cheney policy of the last eight years " change . "
In doing so , I used a common , hundred - year - old phrase that we all understand :
You can put lipstick on a pig , but it 's still a pig .
Now the McCain campaign demands that I apologize for saying this .
Everyone , it seems , wants to hear my answer .
Here it is : NO .
No , I will not apologize for telling the American people the truth : That McCain and Palin represent a stunning , and disastrous , continuation of Bush and Cheney 's policies .
Policies of sacrificing the middle class to give huge tax cuts to millionaires and big corporations .
Policies that prevent Americans from getting the health care they need .
Policies that would privatize Social Security and take away a woman 's right to choose .
No , I will not apologize for saying the truth , even if it hurts John McCain 's and Sarah Palin 's feelings .
Because this is not about them .
And it 's not about me .
It 's about you .
These past eight years , Americans have suffered a lot more than hurt feelings . . . [ insert brief litany of Bush disasters here ] .
You are the ones who have been hurt , and someone has to fight for you .
And I will do that , even if it gets me in trouble .
There 's a word I 've heard from the McCain campaign recently : " deference . "
No one is going to ask Sarah Palin a question , they say , unless they show her " deference . "
Joe Biden points out that they oppose all stem cell research , and they are offended he even mentioned it .
I point out that their claim of bringing change is ridiculous , and they demand an apology .
Apparently we are not showing them enough deference .
Let me explain something to Senator McCain and Governor Palin , as deferentially as I can :
This is a democracy -- not a monarchy .
You do n't get to demand " deference " from the American people as if they were your royal subjects .
You -- and I -- and everyone who seeks elected office must defer to the American people , and answer their questions , and fight for them even when it 's politically inconvenient .
That is what I promise to do .
Thank You . "

SAN FRANCISCO –
Where do those burners get those crazy costumes ?
Aside from the art installations at Burning Man , the campers ' clothes ( if they 're wearing any , that is ) can make the desert art fest seem like a giant , psychedelic fashion show .
Making your own outrageous outfit can be time - consuming , so Prepare for the Playa events make it easy to load up on eye - catching gear you wo n't find on the shelves at Old Navy .
These flea - markets - on - acid are a chance for burner - based businesses to connect , says Nikki Doran , one of the three Prepare for the Playa organizers , but they 're also educational : Playa U how - to workshops put seasoned burners in touch with newbies to go over everything from shower construction and bike lighting to poi-twirling .
Fake fur is a staple of many Burning Man styles , and Glow Fur – composed of an electroluminescent , wired matrix mesh that is sewn into the fur and diffused by gauzy fabric for an even , vibrant glow – can make any fellow burner jealous .
" It was invented by David Lee and was designed with the burner in mind , " says Casson Trenor , who worked the Glow Fur booth Sunday .
" It keeps you warm at night on the playa . "
Glow Fur garments , such as the one worn by Ginger Larsan ( above , left ) , range in price from $ 100 to $ 1,500 for a full - length Glow Fur coat .
The final Prepare for the Playa gathering Sunday at San Francisco 's Cafe Cocomo found burners stocking up on essentials like funky furry garments , glittering underwear , goofy goggles and glow toys .
The Sparkle Plenty Creations booth lives up to its name with sequined , beaded , tasseled and trimmed bras in every size to meet any female burner 's support and fashion needs .
" It brings out your inner radiance , " says Jude Marks , proprietor and creative mind behind the bedazzling bustier line .
" Women come here and they absolutely light up .
I want to help women feel beautiful . "
Michael Malott and Steve Boverie 's light toy booth is a big hit at Prepare for the Playa .
The LED and black light effects draw a lot of foot traffic and supplies dwindle late in the evening .
" We really do n't have much left , " said Boverie .
At the Pod Belt booth , burners can find all sorts of laser - cut latex apparel , including cuffs , bras , gauntlets , skirts and necklaces .
" The laser - cut latex is designed on a computer and printed , essentially , " explains Isa Gordon , who managed the booth .
Gordon is the inventor of the Pod Belt , a modular , customizable utility belt .
First - time burner Ivan Ramof , center , waits at the expansive bar at Cafe Cocomo , where the Prepare for the Playa event was held .
Ramof said he came looking for pointers for the playa and some new duds .
" I 'm trying to look for some Burning Man attire , " says Ramof .
" I just joined this new crowd and I wanted to do something different . "
It 's not all buying and selling at Prepare for the Playa .
Brandee Arro , right , a third - year burner , has her face painted by Sophia Harrington at a free face - painting booth outside Cafe Cocomo .
" Burning Man is the single most creative place I 've ever been , " says Arro , in anticipation of this year 's festival .
" I 've never walked into a piece of art and had it move me to tears like it does on the playa . "
On the practical side , the Playa Survival booth offers goggles , dust masks , earplugs , reusable stainless steel water containers and hand sanitizer .
Survival kits are $ 25 and contain a little bit of everything .
Eve Gutierres , right , and Jacinda Kee with Ever Blaise Designs touch up their makeup before the final fashion show of the evening .
" I 've gone the past four years , " says Deana Blaise , the fashion mastermind behind the collection .
" I just fell in love with and I 've been designing silly , costume burner clothes ever since . "
The Prepare for the Playa event in the Cafe Cocomo filled the main dance floor , the outside courtyard and even climbed its way into the upstairs balcony .
The Medium Reality burner clothing line danced it's way across the stage during the final fashion show of the evening .

Sarah Palin ’s Pipeline should be a major issue in this campaign .
It is a disaster and a major scandal unfolding in real time .
Here are three things that Voters should know about Sarah Palin ’s Pipeline deal :
It will cost US Tax Payers Billions of dollars .
It does not guarantee delivery of natural gas to US markets .
It will Accelerate Climate Change and the destruction of our planet
And here is what you need to know :
#1 :
The Palin Pipeline is a deal conceived and nurtured in the corrupt intersection of Alaskan politics , Republican politics and the Oil & Gas Industry .
President Carter ’s Administration approved the concept of a natural gas pipeline to bring Alaskan natural gas to market .
Since then , it has been a constant fight between competing groups of grifters to get a pipeline built that maximizes profits while passing on the risks to others .
In 2006 Palin became Governor during the that year ’s battle over the pipeline .
The Palin Pipeline finally hits the sweet spot — it will maximize profits and dump the risks .
Under the Palin Pipeline plan , American taxpayers are the " easy marks " of the scam .
At the heart of the Palin Pipeline is the concept that the US Federal Government should shoulder all the financial risks — in fact , without massive Federal aid and loan guarantees , the pipeline will never be built .
Perhaps , this is why Palin is on the ticket .
Not surprisingly , the law firm that Palin hired to put the deal together , review the applications and defend the TransCanada proposal is Greenberg Traurig ( GT ) .
Not only were they Jack Abramoff ’s employer at the height of his corruption , they are also tied to many , many other scandals and questionable deals .
While Jack was a lobbyist for GT he hired an Alaskan lobbyist , Steven Silver , to work on " Issues Relating to Indian / Native American Policy " and " Exploration for Oil and Gas " .
It turns out that Silver was also Palin ’s lobbyist and that Jack hired him at the same time that GT moved into the " Oil & Gas " business by opening offices in Texas .
Another aspect of the corrupt nature of this deal is that the Palin Pipeline will continue the long tradition of stealing resources from the indigenous peoples of North America while destroying their land and cultures .
Greenberg Traurig ’s entry into the international Oil & Gas business began after they hired Jack Abramoff and his scandal became a major problem for the firm .
The firm ’s involvement with Abramoff ’s work for his clients and the Republican Party threatened Greenberg Traurig with a corporate death sentence similar to the one that Authur Andersen got in the wake of Enron .
The firm was saved from this fate when they hired McCain ’s advisor Randy Scheunermann to " advise " GT on how to " work " with John McCain .
It was a good investment .
McCain ’s investigation cover-up of the Abramoff scandal gave Greenberg Traurig a " clean " bill of health and placed 750,000 pages of Abramoff documents that might prove otherwise into cold storage for 50 years .
Since then the firm has given McCain over $ 160,000 and now John McCain has chosen their pipeline deal employer , Sarah Palin , as his running mate .
# 2 :
The Palin Pipeline is a proposal that puts Alaska First .
On the campaign trail , the Palin Pipeline is being sold as something that is great for the United States of America .
Perhaps it will yield some good , but combing through the TransCanada application and the review of that application by Governor Palin and her Team , benefits to the United States are not mentioned .
The focus is on benefits to Alaska — as if the people negotiating the deal thought Alaska was a separate county or something .
The deal is also very concerned with the needs of the Oil & Gas companies who will use the pipeline and how to maximize their profits .
The deal is extremely concerned with ensuring that TransCanada is guaranteed a profit .
The deal relies on loan guarantees , earmarks , appropriations and open - ended financial commitments from the Federal Government ( aka US Taxpayers ) to build and complete the pipeline .
In return , there are no guarantees that the natural gas from the North Slope of Alaska will ever make it to the lower Forty - Eight States .
The Palin Pipeline will only move gas to Alberta , Canada .
But it also offers a plan to divert some of the gas for shipment to China in the form of Liquid Natural Gas from a yet to be built facility in Valdez , Alaska .
There is very little about benefits for the rest of the United States in the proposal .
The Federal Government only comes up when discussing regulations to get around ; how to guarantee that any private sector money put into the project will get a return on their investment ; and how any possible loss will be absorbed by US Taxpayers .
Only a liar would call this " the largest private - sector infrastructure project in North American history . "
It is a typical Republican project .
Guaranteed profits are outsourced while risks and problems are owned by the Government ( and that really means that the risks are owned by us — " We the people " ) .
The Palin Pipeline ensures that gas will get to homes and business in Alaska , but it does not guarantee that the gas will get to consumers and businesses in the lower Forty - Eight .
The Palin Pipeline will only get the gas to Canada and then it will be up to the invisible hand of the markets to get the gas across the border .
The end point of the Palin Pipeline does not connect to an existing gas pipeline to carry the gas South — that would have to be built by somebody else .
Of course if the gas stays in Canada it can earn more money for investors by pulling oil out of the Alberta Tar Sands , but I ’m sure that the McCain Campaign will tell you that in this case the " invisible hand " will put Country First .
Oh , you betcha .
# 3 :
The Palin Pipeline will cost US Taxpayers Billions of dollars
Since Jimmy Carter approved building an Alaskan Natural Gas Pipeline roughly 30 years ago , various grifters have been getting US Taxpayers to fund various different schemes and plans as the Republican politicians , Alaskan politicians and the Oil & Gas Companies have fought a battle to control the energy resources of Alaska .
Here we go again .
The Palin Pipeline plan guarantees that Alaskan taxpayers will give TransCanada $ 500 Million just to help cover the cost of getting the proposal through US and Canadian regulators , environmental reviews and negotiations with Alaskan and Canadian indigenous peoples .
Now , of course Governor Palin says the money comes from " Alaskan Taxpayers " , but in reality it is US Taxpayers who are picking up the tab .
Perhaps this payoff to TransCanada is how Governor Palin is choosing to spend the almost $ 500 Million that US taxpayers gave Alaska for the Bridge to Nowhere .
Or the money could come from the Billions of dollars in earmarks , giveaways and payoffs that Federal Government keeps sending to Alaska .
In 2005 Alaska got $ 1.84 for every $ 1 sent to the Federal Government .
It is an energy rich State that is subsidized by the tax payers of New Hampshire , Michigan and the rest of the lower Forty - Eight .
US Tax Payers are already on the dime for Federal loan guarantees to build the pipeline .
$ 18 Billion was appropriated as part of the Alaskan Natural Gas Pipeline Act of 2004 and more funds and loan guarantees will need to be committed if the pipeline is ever to be built .
And if anything goes wrong , taxpayers will fund the bail - out of TransCanada .
The TransCanada pipeline proposal not only pushed the idea of even more Federal Loan Guarantees , it also promoted the concept of the Federal Government acting as a " Bridge Shipper " to guarantee TransCanada payment for gas NOT shipped through the pipeline .
The Anchorage Daily News reported that " this means the government would agree to pay some of the pipeline transportation fees -- potentially billions of dollars -- should gas producers not commit enough gas initially to operate the line at full capacity . "
This reminds me of an old Marx Brothers routine where Groucho asks Chico what it would cost for him NOT to work and Chico replies " You could n’t afford it " .
A McCain / Palin Administration will ensure that all the financial risks of this project will be paid by US Taxpayers .
Hang onto your wallets .
Your pockets are being picked and — as a bonus — do n’t expect to ever see the gas .
# 4 :
The Palin Pipeline will divert natural gas to the tar sands of Alberta
When the McCain / Palin Campaign and their supporters brag about the Palin Pipeline they point to it as a " free - market " response to our dependence on foreign oil and the high costs of energy .
They may even go so far as to claim that the pipeline will reduce the clear and growing threat of Climate Change because natural gas is a cleaner burning fuel than oil or coal .
They may point to the pipeline as the " Invisible Hand of the Market " solving the energy problem and the climate crisis at the same time .
This is , of course , nonsense .
The Paline Pipeline is different from past Alaskan pipeline proposals because it does not place a lot of emphasis on how natural gas would get from Alberta to the lower Forty - Eight .
This is a detail to be worked out later — if at all .
Even the proposed spur of the pipeline to ship Liquid Natural Gas ( LNG ) from Valdez , Alaska is a secondary goal .
It seems to have been added to the TransCanada proposal to win support for the plan from that part of Alaska .
Way back in 2006 there were a number of competing pipeline plans .
There was an " All Alaskan Plan " that would build a pipeline from the North Slope to a LGN shipping facility in Valdez , AK .
There was the long discussed " Southern Route " that would build a pipeline that tracked the Alaskan Highway into Canada and connect with existing pipelines delivering gas to the lower Forty - Eight .
A third proposal took a different route to get the gas to US and international markets .
The Palin Pipeline just goes to Boundary Lake , Alberta .
Curious .
Raise your hand if you know why that might be the case .
Did you say oil sands or
tar sands ?
If you did , give yourself a gold star .
Now Canada has the world ’s second largest reserves of oil .
Estimates are that our neighbor to the North is sitting on over 179 billion barrels of oil .
Unfortunately for Canada and our planet , 95 % of those reserves are embedded in the tar sands of Alberta .
To pull oil out of those tar sands requires up to 4 barrels of fresh water per each barrel of oil and up to 1000 cubic feet of natural gas to heat the water and separate the oil from the tar sands .
As thing stand today , pulling oil from tar sands requires about 0.6 billion cubic feet of gas per day .
By 2015 the natural gas needs are projected to need 1.6 billion cubic feet of gas per day .
By the time the Palin Pipeline comes online in 2017 the gas per day requirements are projected to be higher — and energy needs to pull oil out of the tar sands will only keep growing if our only energy policy is to always feed our oil addiction until the system collapses .
It used to be that the cost of a barrel of oil was less than what it cost to pull oil out of the tar sands .
It is an energy , resource and labor intensive process and cost at least $ 28 per barrel to produce .
In 2006 , the price of a barrel of oil started climbing .
No wonder , the former pipeline plans that bypassed the tar sands had to be changed .
The price of natural gas is not rising nearly as much as the price of oil .
If you are an energy company , would you rather ship your gas to heat homes in the lower Forty - Eight for the market price of natural gas or would your move the your gas to your tar sand fields in Alberta , convert the gas to oil and then reap the profits .
For example , in their 2006 Annual Report Royal Dutch Shell bragged about doubling their profit per barrel of oil from their Alberta tar sand field when compared to the profits they were making from other means of oil production .
Moving gas to the Alberta tar fields is a cash cow .
And the Palin Pipeline is designed to maximize those profits .
TransCanada is not a competing oil company .
They ’ll make their profits from a piece of the action as the gas moves through their pipes ( or payments from the US taxpayers when the gas flow is less than they need for their bottom line ) .
Your energy companies , BP , Exxon , Shell and the like will have a low cost and low risk way to convert gas from Alaska into crazy profits .
And all of it will be protected for any downside by Treasury of the United States .
We get the risks and they get the profits .
We also get a doomed planet because pulling oil out of the Alberta Tar Sands is a Climate Change Acceleration Machine
# 5 :
The Palin Pipeline will Accelerate Climate Change and cause massive damage to people and the planet
If none of the above was true .
If everything about the Palin Pipeline was on the up and up ( and it is n’t ) this pipeline would still be a Global disaster because it will accelerate oil production from the tar sands of Alberta .
The current levels of oil production in Alberta is already a major contributor to the growing Climate Crisis .
These fields rival coal power plants as a major contributor to Climate Change , and that is saying a lot .
The only way to extract oil from these tar sands is to use massive amounts of energy .
And once the oil is pulled out it also will contribute to the climate crisis .
The Carbon Footprint of oil production in Alberta is massive .
Increasing production and the size of that Carbon Footprint is insane .
Because it terminates in Alberta to feed to energy needs of extracting oil from tar sands , the Carbon Footprint of the Palin Pipeline in massive , reckless and dangerous to the future of our planet .
This is a boondoggle that must be stopped .
Why only a person who does not believe in Climate Change and / or is a
Champion For Big
Oil could approve , push and promote such a reckless plan .
And only a fool would give such a person a chance to carry out the plan as Vice President .
And yet , here we are .
.
I could go into great depth on each of the points I made above and the details of this corrupt and dangerous pipeline .
This is a problem that transcends the election , but it is solvable if we defeat John McCain and elect Barack Obama .
Now , I think it is a good idea to build a natural gas pipeline in Alaska .
Way too many people in that energy rich do not have access to natural gas to heat their homes and businesses .
This is a problem that Jimmy Carter proposed solving 30 years ago and all the delays have been caused by an endless series of Republican grifters .
Governor Palin is just the latest one scamming the people of her state .
There are ways to build a pipeline that provides energy to the people of Alaska , protects the rights of indigenous peoples , protects the environment and that takes the Carbon Footprint of such a project into consideration as it is designed and used .
Barack Obama gets the simple concept that people come first and that energy can be delivered without destroying the planet .
In his June statement to Alaskan Democrats he discussed the State ’s energy problems starting at the 3:06 mark :
He comes out in favor of a pipeline and when he is President I am sure that we can get a sane pipeline built — especially is we also defeat professional grifters like Don Young , Ted Stevens , Sarah palin and John McCain .
The Palin Pipeline is an insane plan .
It must be stopped .
We can not let this Climate Change Acceleration Machine deliver billions of cubic feet of gas every day to fuel tar sand oil production in Alberta , Canada .
Lost in all this vetting and chatter about Governor Sarah Palin is a close examination of her pipeline deal with TransCanada .
Voters should know that this pipeline :
Will cost US Tax Payers Billions of dollars .
Does not guarantee delivery of natural gas to US markets .
Will Accelerate Climate Change and the destruction of our planet
Of the three points , it is the Acceleration of Climate Change that is the most dangerous and destructive .
It is also a problem that can be fixed with a different pipeline route and a prohibition on using Alaskan natural gas to support oil extraction from the tar sands .
Take a look at a detail from the map above :
Notice all the blue lines .
These are other pipelines owned by TransCanada .
Most of these are oil pipelines .
In fact , there is not a current gas pipeline that connects Boundary Lake , Alberta and the United States to the South .
Now , one could be built in the future and a recent report from the Canadian Energy Research Institute ( CERI ) looks into the issue :
CERI estimates that it will cost $ 1.8 billion Cdn to expand the TCPL Alberta system to handle Alaskan gas . [ snip ]
In the TCPL expansion scenario , Alaskan gas enters the TCPL Alberta system at Boundary Lake .
Gas delivered to the Empress / McNeill export location is then delivered to the U.S. Midwest area by means of the TCPL East main line and NBPL systems .
TCPL
East connects to a point south of Winnipeg , Manitoba where the flow follows two separate paths -- by the Great Lakes Gas Transmission System for delivery to Michigan markets and the St. Claire area and connection with the Dawn hub , or by TCPL Northern Ontario and TCPL Eastern Zone for delivery to the Toronto area and connection with the Dawn hub .
Exchange volumes on the Union Gas Dawn / Parkway system , the Vector Pipeline and ANR Pipeline systems will result in gas being delivered to Chicago - area markets .
There are other possible pipeline schemes and routes being discussed to for pipelines between Alberta and the lower Forty - Eight , but they are not for moving natural gas .
They are for moving oil , like this plan for a 2,000 - mile pipeline from Alberta to Texas .
While plans for pipelines to move natural gas between the US and Canada are thin , there are other plans moving ahead to move more gas to Alberta to feed the production needs of the tar sands ( emphasis added ) :
The Globe and Mail reported today that , " TransCanada said yesterday that it has filed a regulatory application to build ( a $ 1 - billion ) 300 - kilometre ... ( North Central Corridor ) pipeline to traverse northern Alberta , moving natural gas to ' feed ' increasing oil sand production around Fort McMurray .
It is expected to be in service by 2010 ... "
This is after a new National Energy Board forecasts that predicts tar sands production will almost triple by 2015 to three million barrels a day , all destined for the U.S. market .
It 's a lot of clear natural gas to waste on a filthy export , which even industry reps are willing to admit .
" Hal Kvisle , TransCanada chief executive officer , suggested in an interview yesterday that depending on natural gas for oil sands production is probably not the best use of a resource that heats the homes of most Canadians , " reported the Globe today .
" He said new technologies likely will eventually reduce the amount of gas needed but right now there is a market demand to ' feed Fort McMurray . ' "
On November 16 , the Globe reported on a NEB report that states , " Canada will become a net importer of natural gas by around 2028 if current production and price trends continue , with the shortfall from dwindling Western Canadian output being met by liquefied natural gas from overseas . "
Canada now exports 61 per cent of the natural gas we produce each year to the United States .
This figure would not include the natural gas that is consumed to produce the oil that we export to the United States .
( Canada exported to the United States 2.3 million barrels per day of oil and petroleum products in 2006 , according to the US Energy Information Administration . )
Hey , did you notice that Palin ’s pipeline builder , TransCanada , got a name check .
It looks like they are the natural gas supplier for the tar sand fields of Alberta and what do you want to bet that the Palin Pipeline they are building will feed into the gas pipelines they are building to power tar sand oil production .
That seems to be a safe bet , especially because it looks like Canada is running out of the natural gas that they will need to heat the water to extract oil from tar sands in the world ’s second largest oil reserve .
Saudi Arabia is number one in oil reserves and Canada is number two , but — as I ’ve mentioned — 95 % of Canadian oil is locked in the tar sands of Alberta .
And to get the oil out you need water and energy .
How much ?
Well , let ’s turn to the Canadian Government and their Q&A on Canada 's Oil Sands - Opportunities and Challenges to 2015 :
What is the natural gas requirement relative to oil sands development ?
It takes about 28 cubic metres ( 1000 cubic feet ) of natural gas to produce one barrel of bitumen from in situ projects and about 14 cubic metres ( 500 cubic feet ) for integrated projects .
Currently , the oil sands industry uses about 17 million cubic metres ( 0.6 billion cubic feet ) per day of purchased gas , or about four percent of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin production .
By 2015 , this increases to about 40 to 45 million cubic metres ( 1.4 to 1.6 billion cubic feet ) per day , or nearly 10 percent , assuming gas production stay level at 467 million cubic metres ( 16.5 billion cubic feet ) per day .
How much water is required to produce one barrel of oil from the oil sands ?
The water requirements for oil sands projects range from 2.5 to 4.0 barrels of water for each barrel of bitumen produced .
That ’s a lot of gas and a lot of water for each barrel of oil you pull from the tar sands .
It is a dirty , labor and energy intensive process .
And in the wake of each barrel of oil the process leaves behind pollution , toxins , destruction , danger and a massive carbon footprint .
In February of this year , Environmental Defence of Canada issued a major report on tar sands and their environmental damage .
They call the oil extraction effort in Alberta The Most Destructive Project on Earth .
I ’ve been looking into this and they very well may be right .
The report is damning .
They ’ve also launched a campaign to fight the destruction that included an open letter to the 22 Governors of the Western Governors Association in the US ( including Governor Palin ) .
The trouble with tar sands was highlighted in the letter :
The environmental costs from tar sands oil extraction are high .
Tar sands open pit mining and drilling are Canada ’s fastest growing source of global warming emissions .
Looking just at the production process , to produce a barrel of tar sands oil costs the climate three times the emissions as a barrel of conventional oil .
For mining , up to four barrels of water are drained from the Athabasca River to produce one barrel of tar sands oil , resulting in tailings ponds of toxics that can be seen from space by the naked eye .
Aboriginal communities downstream from the tar sands are concerned about high cancer rates .
Canada ’s DeSmogBlog ( a site dedicated to clearing the PR pollution that is clouding the science on climate change ) recently posted the Top 10 Facts About the Alberta Oil Sands :
Without anymore production capacity , the Tar Sands of Alberta are already one of the greatest environmental problems on the planet .
When the Palin Pipeline feeds the beast with as much gas as they can use , the Alberta Tar Sands will become a global environmental catastrophe .
It will accelerate climate change .
It will foul the land and waters of Canada and Washington , Idaho , Montana , North Dakota and all the States downstream .
So far , Sarah Palin has escaped vetting on her Energy record .
That needs to end .
A McCain / Palin Administration would be an environmental nightmare .
It would be worse than any previous Republican Administration and that is a high bar the McCain has shown a willingness to leap over .
He used to talk a good game about Climate Change , but like most everything he says , it was a lie .
With John McCain you have to watch his actions and ignore what he says .
And in choosing a running mate , he selected a Climate Crisis Denier who is pushing a gas pipeline that will accelerate the destruction of our planet .
This is yet another reason why we must work as hard as we can to defeat McCain and elect Barack Obama on November 4 , 2008 .
Every day counts .

John McCain on 60 Minutes , 9/21/08
Scott Pelley :
In 1999 , you were one of the senators who helped pass deregulation of Wall Street .
Do you regret that now ?
John McCain :
No , I think the deregulation was probably helpful to the growth of our economy .
NASA Maps Shed Light on Carbon Dioxide 's Global Nature
Media contacts : Alan Buis 818-354-0474

2008 - 189
PASADENA , Calif . - A NASA / university team has published the first global satellite maps of the key greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in Earth 's mid-troposphere , an area about 8 kilometers , or 5 miles , above Earth .
The team 's study reveals new information on how carbon dioxide , which directly contributes to climate change , is distributed in Earth 's atmosphere and moves around our world .
A research team led by Moustafa Chahine of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , found the distribution of carbon dioxide in the mid-troposphere is strongly influenced by major surface sources of carbon dioxide and by large - scale atmospheric circulation patterns , such as the jet streams and weather systems in Earth 's mid-latitudes .
Patterns of carbon dioxide distribution were also found to differ significantly between the northern hemisphere , with its many land masses , and the southern hemisphere , which is largely covered by ocean .
The findings are based on data collected from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder ( AIRS ) instrument on NASA 's Aqua spacecraft between September 2002 and July 2008 .
Chahine , the instrument 's science team leader , said the research products will be used by scientists to refine models of the processes that transport carbon dioxide within Earth 's atmosphere .
" These data capture global variations in the distribution of carbon dioxide over time , " Chahine said .
" These variations are not represented in the four chemistry - transport models used to determine where carbon dioxide is created and stored .
" Chahine said the AIRS data will complement existing and planned ground and aircraft measurements of carbon dioxide , as well as upcoming satellite missions to study Earth 's carbon cycle and climate .
Included in the new satellite missions is NASA 's Orbiting Carbon Observatory , planned for launch in January 2009 .
The combination of carbon dioxide data from AIRS and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory will allow scientists to determine the distribution of carbon dioxide in the lower atmosphere , above Earth 's surface .
" Carbon dioxide is difficult to measure and track , " he said .
" No place on Earth is immune from its influence .
It will take many independent measurements , including AIRS , to coax this culprit out of hiding and track its progress from creation to storage .
"
The new maps reveal enhanced concentrations of carbon dioxide south of the northern hemisphere jet stream , in a band between 30 and 40 degrees north latitude .
These enhanced concentrations correspond to a well - documented belt of pollution in the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes .
The team attributed the increased levels of carbon dioxide detected over the western North Atlantic to emissions transported from the Southeast U.S. on warm atmospheric " conveyor belts . "
These belts lift carbon dioxide from Earth 's surface into the middle and upper troposphere .
The AIRS maps also showed enhanced carbon dioxide over the Mediterranean , resulting from North American and European sources .
Carbon dioxide from South Asia ended up over the Middle East , while carbon dioxide from East Asia flowed out over the Pacific Ocean .
In the southern hemisphere , a belt of mid-tropospheric air containing enhanced concentrations of carbon dioxide emerged between 30 and 40 degrees south latitude .
This belt had not previously been seen in the four chemistry - transport models used in this study .
The researchers say the flow of air in this belt over South America 's high Andes Mountains lifts carbon dioxide from major sources on Earth 's surface , such as the respiration of plants , as well as forest fires and facilities used for synthetic fuel production and power generation .
A portion of this lifted carbon dioxide is then carried into the mid-troposphere , where it becomes trapped in the mid-latitude jet stream and transported rapidly around the world .
" The troposphere is like international waters , " Chahine said .
" What 's produced in one place will travel elsewhere .
" Study results were published recently in Geophysical Research Letters .
Other participants included the California Institute of Technology , Pasadena , Calif . ; and the University of California , Irvine .

Steve Fossett Wreckage Found - Bellanca 8 kcab n240r ( Crash Photos )
The Madera Country Sheriff 's department has released photos of the wreckage of the plane thatwas piloting on September 3 , 2007 .
The single engine Bellanca 8 kcab n240r appears to have crashed head on into the side of a mountain in the Inyo National Forest near Mammoth Lakes , California .
An air search was undertaken on Wednesday after hiker Preston Morrow found personal effects that belonged to Fossett approximately a 1 / 4 mile from where the plane was eventually located .
The tail number was verified at 11:00 p.m. on Wednesday evening .
An NTSB team arrived on Thursday to begin their crash investigation .
They are in the early stages of their fact finding mission but have stated that the high impact crash was likely a non survivable accident .
A body has not yet been discovered .
October 31 , 2008 UPDATE : Searchers have discovered human remains , a drivers license , $ 100 bill and tennis shoes belonging to missing aviator Steve Fossett .
Two long bones , and animal chewed personal effects were discovered 1 / 4 mile from where hikers found the initial ID cards and $ 1,000 cash .
Law enforcement officials believe that animals likely dragged Fossett 's body to the location where the remains were found yesterday .
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson reported during a press conference on October 30 , 2008 that the remains will undergo DNA testing .
He was hopeful that this will bring closure to the mystery of what happened to Steve Fossett .
November 3 , 2008 UPDATE : CNN is reporting that the two large bones found do match DNA that the Fossett family provided to investigators .
The tests were conducted at California 's State Crime Lab .
This finding will allow the case to be closed .
Photos below were released by the Madera County Sheriff and Mono County Sheriff Search and Rescue .

Explanation : Big , bright , and beautiful , spiral galaxy M83 lies a mere twelve million light - years away , near the southeastern tip of the very long constellation Hydra .
Prominent spiral arms traced by dark dust lanes and blue star clusters lend this galaxy its popular name of the Southern Pinwheel .
But reddish star forming regions that dot the sweeping arms highlighted in this sparkling color composite also suggest another nickname , The Thousand - Ruby Galaxy .
About 40,000 light - years across , M83 is a member of a group of galaxies that includes active galaxy Centaurus A .
The core of M83 itself is bright at x-ray energies , showing a high concentration of neutron stars and black holes left from an intense burst of star formation .
The sharp image , based on archival data from the European Southern Observatory 's Wide Field Imager camera , also features spiky foreground Milky Way stars and distant background galaxies .
Django – the fun framework ( presentation )
Yesterday I attended the excellent Geek Meet hosted by Robert Nyman at the Creuna office .
I held a presentation about the Django web framework , and took some time today to add some comments in english and make a PDF - file of the presentation .
Would you like to know why Django is more fun than what you 're using right now ?
So go ahead and have a look at the presentation : Django - the fun framework ( 11 Mb , PDF with english comments )
Ten thousand copies of a food magazine were recalled in Sweden after a mistake in one of its recipes left four people poisoned , the magazine said .
" There was a mistake in a recipe for apple cake .
Instead of calling for two pinches of nutmeg it said 20 nutmeg nuts were needed , " Matmagasinet 's chief editor Ulla Cocke said .
" We know that four adults ate one cake made from this recipe , and they did n't feel well , " she said .
" This is obviously very regrettable . "
The four people had experienced symptoms of poisoning , including dizziness and headaches , but were now feeling better , she said .
When Matmagasinet first discovered the mistake it immediately sent out letters to its 50,000 subscribers and placed a leaflet inside the copies sold in the store , cautioning that " high doses of nutmeg can cause poisoning symptoms " .
" At first we thought this would be enough , because we did n't really think anyone would bake or eat this cake , since so much nutmeg would give it a horrible , bitter taste , and because it is simply not that easy to get hold of that much nutmeg , " Ms Cocke said .
Once it became clear that people had been poisoned by the cake , the magazine immediately decided to recall all its store copies .
" We publish 1,200 recipes each year , and of course there have been times when they 've had a bit too much butter or too little flour , but we have never experienced anything like this before , " Ms Cocke said .

The fundamental dogma of all brands of socialism and communism is that the market economy or capitalism is a system that hurts the vital interests of the immense majority of people for the sole benefit of a small minority of rugged individualists .
It condemns the masses to progressing impoverishment .
It brings about misery , slavery , oppression , degradation and exploitation of the working men , while it enriches a class of idle and useless parasites .
This doctrine was not the work of Karl Marx .
It had been developed long before Marx entered the scene .
Its most successful propagators were not the Marxian authors , but such men as Carlyle and Ruskin , the British Fabians , the German professors , and the American Institutionalists .
And it is a very significant fact that the correctness of this dogma was contested only by a few economists who were very soon silenced and barred from access to the universities , the press , the leadership of political parties and , first of all , public office .
Public opinion by and large accepted the condemnation of capitalism without any reservation .
1. Socialism
But , of course , the practical political conclusions which people drew from this dogma were not uniform .
One group declared that there is but one way to wipe out these evils , namely to abolish capitalism entirely .
They advocate the substitution of public control of the means of production for private control .
They aim at the establishment of what is called socialism , communism , planning , or state capitalism .
All these terms signify the same thing .
No longer should the consumers , by their buying and abstention from buying , determine what should be produced , in what quantity and of what quality .
Henceforth a central authority alone should direct all production activities .
2. Interventionism , Allegedly a Middle - of - the - Road Policy
A second group seems to be less radical .
They reject socialism no less than capitalism .
They recommend a third system , which , as they say , is as far from capitalism as it is from socialism , which as a third system of society ’s economic organization , stands midway between the two other systems , and while retaining the advantages of both , avoids the disadvantages inherent in each .
This third system is known as the system of interventionism .
In the terminology of American politics it is often referred to as the middle - of - the - road policy .
What makes this third system popular with many people is the particular way they choose to look upon the problems involved .
As they see it , two classes , the capitalists and entrepreneurs on the one hand and the wage earners on the other hand , are arguing about the distribution of the yield of capital and entrepreneurial activities .
Both parties are claiming the whole cake for themselves .
Now , suggest these mediators , let us make peace by splitting the disputed value equally between the two classes .
The State as an impartial arbiter should interfere , and should curb the greed of the capitalists and assign a part of the profits to the working classes .
Thus it will be possible to dethrone the moloch capitalism without enthroning the moloch of totalitarian socialism .
Yet this mode of judging the issue is entirely fallacious .
The antagonism between capitalism and socialism is not a dispute about the distribution of booty .
It is a controversy about which two schemes for society ’s economic organization , capitalism or socialism , is conducive to the better attainment of those ends which all people consider as the ultimate aim of activities commonly called economic , viz. , the best possible supply of useful commodities and services .
Capitalism wants to attain these ends by private enterprise and initiative , subject to the supremacy of the public ’s buying and abstention from buying on the market .
The socialists want to substitute the unique plan of a central authority for the plans of the various individuals .
They want to put in place of what Marx called the “ anarchy of production ” the exclusive monopoly of the government .
The antagonism does not refer to the mode of distributing a fixed amount of amenities .
It refers to the mode of producing all those goods which people want to enjoy .
The conflict of the two principles is irreconcilable and does not allow for any compromise .
Control is indivisible .
Either the consumers ’ demand as manifested on the market decides for what purposes and how the factors of production should be employed , or the government takes care of these matters .
There is nothing that could mitigate the opposition between these two contradictory principles .
They preclude each other .
Interventionism is not a golden mean between capitalism and socialism .
It is the design of a third system of society ’s economic organization and must be appreciated as such .
3. How Interventionism Works
It is not the task of today ’s discussion to raise any questions about the merits either of capitalism or of socialism .
I am dealing today with interventionism alone .
And I do not intend to enter into an arbitrary evaluation of interventionism from any preconceived point of view .
My only concern is to show how interventionism works and whether or not it can be considered as a pattern of a permanent system for society ’s economic organization .
The interventionists emphasize that they plan to retain private ownership of the means of production , entrepreneurship and market exchange .
But , they go on to say , it is peremptory to prevent these capitalist institutions from spreading havoc and unfairly exploiting the majority of people .
It is the duty of government to restrain , by orders and prohibitions , the greed of the propertied classes lest their acquisitiveness harm the poorer classes .
Unhampered or laissez - faire capitalism is an evil .
But in order to eliminate its evils , there is no need to abolish capitalism entirely .
It is possible to improve the capitalist system by government interference with the actions of the capitalists and entrepreneurs .
Such government regulation and regimentation of business is the only method to keep off totalitarian socialism and to salvage those features of capitalism which are worth preserving .
On the ground of this philosophy , the interventionists advocate a galaxy of various measures .
Let us pick out one of them , the very popular scheme of price control .
4. How Price Control Leads to Socialism
The government believes that the price of a definite commodity , e.g. , milk , is too high .
It wants to make it possible for the poor to give their children more milk .
Thus it resorts to a price ceiling and fixes the price of milk at a lower rate than that prevailing on the free market .
The result is that the marginal producers of milk , those producing at the highest cost , now incur losses .
As no individual farmer or businessman can go on producing at a loss , these marginal producers stop producing and selling milk on the market .
They will use their cows and their skill for other more profitable purposes .
They will , for example , produce butter , cheese or meat .
There will be less milk available for the consumers , not more .
This , or course , is contrary to the intentions of the government .
It wanted to make it easier for some people to buy more milk .
But , as an outcome of its interference , the supply available drops .
The measure proves abortive from the very point of view of the government and the groups it was eager to favor .
It brings about a state of affairs , which — again from the point of view of the government — is even less desirable than the previous state of affairs which it was designed to improve .
Now , the government is faced with an alternative .
It can abrogate its decree and refrain from any further endeavors to control the price of milk .
But if it insists upon its intention to keep the price of milk below the rate the unhampered market would have determined and wants nonetheless to avoid a drop in the supply of milk , it must try to eliminate the causes that render the marginal producers ’ business unremunerative .
It must add to the first decree concerning only the price of milk a second decree fixing the prices of the factors of production necessary for the production of milk at such a low rate that the marginal producers of milk will no longer suffer losses and will therefore abstain from restricting output .
But then the same story repeats itself on a remoter plane .
The supply of the factors of production required for the production of milk drops , and again the government is back where it started .
If it does not want to admit defeat and to abstain from any meddling with prices , it must push further and fix the prices of those factors of production which are needed for the production of the factors necessary for the production of milk .
Thus the government is forced to go further and further , fixing step by step the prices of all consumers ’ goods and of all factors of production — both human , i.e. , labor , and material — and to order every entrepreneur and every worker to continue work at these prices and wages .
No branch of industry can be omitted from this all - around fixing of prices and wages and from this obligation to produce those quantities which the government wants to see produced .
If some branches were to be left free out of regard for the fact that they produce only goods qualified as non-vital or even as luxuries , capital and labor would tend to flow into them and the result would be a drop in the supply of those goods , the prices of which government has fixed precisely because it considers them as indispensable for the satisfaction of the needs of the masses .
But when this state of all - around control of business is attained , there can no longer be any question of a market economy .
No longer do the citizens by their buying and abstention from buying determine what should be produced and how .
The power to decide these matters has devolved upon the government .
This is no longer capitalism ; it is all - around planning by the government , it is socialism .
5 . The Zwangswirtschaft Type of Socialism
It is , of course , true that this type of socialism preserves some of the labels and the outward appearance of capitalism .
It maintains , seemingly and nominally , private ownership of the means of production , prices , wages , interest rates and profits .
In fact , however , nothing counts but the government ’s unrestricted autocracy .
The government tells the entrepreneurs and capitalists what to produce and in what quantity and quality , at what prices to buy and from whom , at what prices to sell and to whom .
It decrees at what wages and where the workers must work .
Market exchange is but a sham .
All the prices , wages , and interest rates are determined by the authority .
They are prices , wages , and interest rates in appearance only ; in fact they are merely quantity relations in the government ’s orders .
The government , not the consumers , directs production .
The government determines each citizen ’s income , it assigns to everybody the position in which he has to work .
This is socialism in the outward guise of capitalism .
It is the Zwangswirtschaft of Hitler ’s German Reich and the planned economy of Great Britain .
6. German and British Experience
For the scheme of social transformation which I have depicted is not merely a theoretical construction .
It is a realistic portrayal of the succession of events that brought about socialism in Germany , in Great Britain , and in some other countries .
The Germans , in the First World War , began with price ceilings for a small group of consumers ’ goods considered as vital necessities .
It was the inevitable failure of these measures that impelled them to go further and further until , in the second period of the war , they designed the Hindenburg plan .
In the context of the Hindenburg plan no room whatever was left for a free choice on the part of the consumers and for initiative action on the part of business .
All economic activities were unconditionally subordinated to the exclusive jurisdiction of the authorities .
The total defeat of the Kaiser swept the whole imperial apparatus of administration away and with it went also the grandiose plan .
But when in 1931 Chancellor Brüning embarked anew on a policy of price control and his successors , first of all Hitler , obstinately clung to it , the same story repeated itself .
Great Britain and all the other countries which in the First World War adopted measures of price control , had to experience the same failure .
They too were pushed further and further in their attempts to make the initial decrees work .
But they were still at a rudimentary stage of this development when the victory and the opposition of the public brushed away all schemes for controlling prices .
It was different in the Second World War .
Then Great Britain again resorted to price ceilings for a few vital commodities and had to run the whole gamut proceeding further and further until it had substituted all - around planning of the country ’s whole economy for economic freedom .
When the war came to an end , Great Britain was a socialist commonwealth .
It is noteworthy to remember that British socialism was not an achievement of Mr. Attlee ’s Labor Government , but of the war cabinet of Mr. Winston Churchill .
What the Labor Party did was not the establishment of socialism in a free country , but retaining socialism as it had developed during the war and in the post - war period .
The fact has been obscured by the great sensation made about the nationalization of the Bank of England , the coal mines , and other branches of business .
However , Great Britain is to be called a socialist country not because certain enterprises have been formally expropriated and nationalized , but because all the economic activities of all citizens are subject to full control of the government and its agencies .
The authorities direct the allocation of capital and of manpower to the various branches of business .
They determine what should be produced .
Supremacy in all business activities is exclusively vested in the government .
The people are reduced to the status of wards , unconditionally bound to obey orders .
To the businessmen , the former entrepreneurs , merely ancillary functions are left .
All that they are free to do is to carry into effect , within a nearly circumscribed narrow field , the decisions of the government departments .
What we have to realize is that price ceilings affecting only a few commodities fail to attain the ends sought .
On the contrary .
They produce effects which from the point of view of the government are even worse than the previous state of affairs which the government wanted to alter .
If the government , in order to eliminate these inevitable but unwelcome consequences , pursues its course further and further , it finally transforms the system of capitalism and free enterprise into socialism of the Hindenburg pattern .
7. Crises and Unemployment
The same is true of all other types of meddling with the market phenomena .
Minimum wage rates , whether decreed and enforced by the government or by labor union pressure and violence , result in mass unemployment prolonged year after year as soon as they try to raise wage rates above the height of the unhampered market .
The attempts to lower interest rates by credit expansion generate , it is true , a period of booming business .
But the prosperity thus created is only an artificial hot - house product and must inexorably lead to the slump and to the depression .
People must pay heavily for the easy - money orgy of a few years of credit expansion and inflation .
The recurrence of periods of depression and mass unemployment has discredited capitalism in the opinion of injudicious people .
Yet these events are not the outcome of the operation of the free market .
They are on the contrary the result of well - intentioned but ill - advised government interference with the market .
There are no means by which the height of wage rates and the general standard of living can be raised other than by accelerating the increase of capital as compared with population .
The only means to raise wage rates permanently for all those seeking jobs and eager to earn wages is to raise the productivity of the industrial effort by increasing the per -head quota of capital invested .
What makes American wage rates by far exceed the wage rates of Europe and Asia is the fact that the American worker ’s toil and trouble is aided by more and better tools .
All that good government can do to improve the material well - being of the people is to establish and to preserve an institutional order in which there are no obstacles to the progressing accumulation of new capital required for the improvement of technological methods of production .
This is what capitalism did achieve in the past and will achieve in the future too if not sabotaged by a bad policy .
8. Two Roads to Socialism
Interventionism cannot be considered as an economic system destined to stay .
It is a method for the transformation of capitalism into socialism by a series of successive steps .
It is as such different from the endeavors of the communists to bring about socialism at one stroke .
The difference does not refer to the ultimate end of the political movement ; it refers mainly to the tactics to be resorted to for the attainment of an end that both groups are aiming at .
Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels recommended successively each of these two ways for the realization of socialism .
In 1848 , in the Communist Manifesto , they outlined a plan for the step - by - step transformation of capitalism into socialism .
The proletariat should be raised to the position of the ruling class and use its political supremacy “ to wrest , by degrees , all capital from the bourgeoisie . ”
This , they declare , “ cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property and on the conditions of bourgeois production ; by means of measures , therefore , which appear economically insufficient and untenable , but which in the course of the movement outstrip themselves , necessitate further inroads upon the old social order , and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionizing the mode of production . ”
In this vein they enumerate by way of example ten measures .
In later years Marx and Engels changed their minds .
In his main treatise , Das Capital , first published in 1867 , Marx saw things in a different way .
Socialism is bound to come “ with the inexorability of a law of nature . ”
But it cannot appear before capitalism has reached its full maturity .
There is but one road to the collapse of capitalism , namely the progressive evolution of capitalism itself .
Then only will the great final revolt of the working class give it the finishing stroke and inaugurate the everlasting age of abundance .
From the point of view of this later doctrine Marx and the school of orthodox Marxism reject all policies that pretend to restrain , to regulate and to improve capitalism .
Such policies , they declare , are not only futile , but outright harmful .
For they rather delay the coming of age of capitalism , its maturity , and thereby also its collapse .
They are therefore not progressive , but reactionary .
It was this idea that led the German Social Democratic party to vote against Bismarck ’s social security legislation and to frustrate Bismarck ’s plan to nationalize the German tobacco industry .
From the point of view of the same doctrine , the communists branded the American New Deal as a reactionary plot extremely detrimental to the true interests of the working people .
What we must realize is that the antagonism between the interventionists and the communists is a manifestation of the conflict between the two doctrines of the early Marxism and of the late Marxism .
It is the conflict between the Marx of 1848 , the author of the Communist Manifesto , and the Marx of 1867 , the author of Das Capital .
And it is paradoxical indeed that the document in which Marx endorsed the policies of the present - day self - styled anti-communists is called the Communist Manifesto .
There are two methods available for the transformation of capitalism into socialism .
One is to expropriate all farms , plants , and shops and to operate them by a bureaucratic apparatus as departments of the government .
The whole of society , says Lenin , becomes “ one office and one factory , with equal work and equal pay , ” the whole economy will be organized “ like the postal system . ”
The second method is the method of the Hindenburg plan , the originally German pattern of the welfare state and of planning .
It forces every firm and every individual to comply strictly with the orders issued by the government ’s central board of production management .
Such was the intention of the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 which the resistance of business frustrated and the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional .
Such is the idea implied in the endeavors to substitute planning for private enterprise .
9. Foreign Exchange Control
The foremost vehicle for the realization of this second type of socialism in industrial countries like Germany and Great Britain is foreign exchange control .
These countries cannot feed and clothe their people out of domestic resources .
They must import large quantities of food and raw materials .
In order to pay for these badly needed imports , they must export manufactures , most of them produced out of imported raw material .
In such countries almost every business transaction directly or indirectly is conditioned either by exporting or importing or by both exporting and importing .
Hence the government ’s monopoly of buying and selling foreign exchange makes every kind of business activity depend on the discretion of the agency entrusted with foreign exchange control .
In this country matters are different .
The volume of foreign trade is rather small when compared with the total volume of the nation ’s trade .
Foreign exchange control would only slightly affect the much greater part of American business .
This is the reason why in the schemes of our planners there is hardly any question of foreign exchange control .
Their pursuits are directed toward the control of prices , wages , and interest rates , toward the control of investment and the limitation of profits and incomes .
10 . Progressive Taxation
Looking backward on the evolution of income tax rates from the beginning of the Federal income tax in 1913 until the present day , one can hardly expect that the tax will not one day absorb 100 percent of all surplus above the income of the average voter .
It is this that Marx and Engels had in mind when in the Communist Manifesto they recommended “ a heavy progressive or graduated income tax . ”
Another of the suggestions of the Communist Manifesto was “ abolition of all right of inheritance . ”
Now , neither in Great Britain nor in this country have the laws gone up to this point .
But again , looking backward upon the past history of the estate taxes , we have to realize that they more and more have approached the goal set by Marx .
Estate taxes of the height they have already attained for the upper brackets are no longer to be qualified as taxes .
They are measures of expropriation .
The philosophy underlying the system of progressive taxation is that the income and the wealth of the well - to - do classes can be freely tapped .
What the advocates of these tax rates fail to realize is that the greater part of the income taxed away would not have been consumed but saved and invested .
In fact , this fiscal policy does not only prevent the further accumulation of new capital .
It brings about capital decumulation .
This is certainly today the state of affairs in Great Britain .
11 . The Trend Toward Socialism
The course of events in the past thirty years shows a continuous , although sometimes interrupted progress toward the establishment in this country of socialism of the British and German pattern .
The United States embarked later than these two other countries upon this decline and is today still farther away from its end .
But if the trend of this policy will not change , the final result will only in accidental and negligible points differ from what happened in the England of Attlee and in the Germany of Hitler .
The middle - of - the - road policy is not an economic system that can last .
It is a method for the realization of socialism by installments .
12 . Loopholes Capitalism
Many people object .
They stress the fact that most of the laws which aim at planning or at expropriation by means of progressive taxation have left some loopholes which offer to private enterprise a margin within which it can go on .
That such loopholes still exist and that thanks to them this country is still a free country is certainly true .
But this “ loopholes capitalism ” is not a lasting system .
It is a respite .
Powerful forces are at work to close these loopholes .
From day to day the field in which private enterprise is free to operate is narrowed down .
13 . The Coming of Socialism is Not Inevitable
Of course , this outcome is not inevitable .
The trend can be reversed as was the case with many other trends in history .
The Marxian dogma according to which socialism is bound to come “ with the inexorability of a law of nature ” is just an arbitrary surmise devoid of any proof .
But the prestige which this vain prognostic enjoys not only with the Marxians , but with many self - styled non-Marxians , is the main instrument of the progress of socialism .
It spreads defeatism among those who otherwise would gallantly fight the socialist menace .
The most powerful ally of Soviet Russia is the doctrine that the “ wave of the future ” carries us toward socialism and that it is therefore “ progressive ” to sympathize with all measures that restrict more and more the operation of the market economy .
Even in this country which owes to a century of “ rugged individualism ” the highest standard of living ever attained by any nation , public opinion condemns laissez - faire .
In the last fifty years , thousands of books have been published to indict capitalism and to advocate radical interventionism , the welfare state , and socialism .
The few books which tried to explain adequately the working of the free - market economy were hardly noticed by the public .
Their authors remained obscure , while such authors as Veblen , Commons , John Dewey , and Laski were exuberantly praised .
It is a well - known fact that the legitimate stage as well as the Hollywood industry are no less radically critical of free enterprise than are many novels .
There are in this country many periodicals which in every issue furiously attack economic freedom .
There is hardly any magazine of opinion that would plead for the system that supplied the immense majority of the people with good food and shelter , with cars , refrigerators , radio sets , and other things which the subjects of other countries call luxuries .
The impact of this state of affairs is that practically very little is done to preserve the system of private enterprise .
There are only middle - of - the - roaders who think they have been successful when they have delayed for some time an especially ruinous measure .
They are always in retreat .
They put up today with measures which only ten or twenty years ago they would have considered as undiscussable .
They will in a few years acquiesce in other measures which they today consider as simply out of the question .
What can prevent the coming of totalitarian socialism is only a thorough change in ideologies .
What we need is neither anti-socialism nor anti-communism but an open positive endorsement of that system to which we owe all the wealth that distinguishes our age from the comparatively straitened conditions of ages gone by .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Most U.S. and foreign corporations doing business in the United States avoid paying any federal income taxes , despite trillions of dollars worth of sales , a government study released on Tuesday said .
The Government Accountability Office said 72 percent of all foreign corporations and about 57 percent of U.S. companies doing business in the United States paid no federal income taxes for at least one year between 1998 and 2005 .
More than half of foreign companies and about 42 percent of U.S. companies paid no U.S. income taxes for two or more years in that period , the report said .
During that time corporate sales in the United States totaled $ 2.5 trillion , according to Democratic Sens.
Carl Levin of Michigan and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota , who requested the GAO study .
The report did not name any companies .
The GAO said corporations escaped paying federal income taxes for a variety of reasons including operating losses , tax credits and an ability to use transactions within the company to shift income to low tax countries .
With the U.S. budget deficit this year running close to the record $ 413 billion that was set in 2004 and projected to hit a record $ 486 billion next year , lawmakers are looking to plug holes in the U.S. tax code and generate more revenues .
Dorgan in a statement called the report “ a shocking indictment of the current tax system . ”
Levin said it made clear that “ too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and avoid paying their fair share in the United States . ”
The study showed about 28 percent of large foreign corporations , those with more than $ 250 million in assets , doing business in the United States paid no federal income taxes in 2005 despite $ 372 billion in gross receipts , the senators said .
About 25 percent of the largest U.S. companies paid no federal income taxes in 2005 despite $ 1.1 trillion in gross sales that year , they said .
As recently as three weeks ago it was still possible to argue that the state of the U.S. economy , while clearly not good , was n’t disastrous  that the financial system , while under stress , was n’t in full meltdown and that Wall Street ’s troubles were n’t having that much impact on Main Street .
But that was then .
The financial and economic news since the middle of last month has been really , really bad .
And what ’s truly scary is that we ’re entering a period of severe crisis with weak , confused leadership .
The wave of bad news began on Sept. 14 .
Henry Paulson , the Treasury secretary , thought he could get away with letting Lehman Brothers , the investment bank , fail ; he was wrong .
The plight of investors trapped by Lehman ’s collapse  as an article in The Times put it , Lehman became “ the Roach Motel of Wall Street :
They checked in , but they ca n’t check out ”  created panic in the financial markets , which has only grown worse as the days go by .
Indicators of financial stress have soared to the equivalent of a 107 - degree fever , and large parts of the financial system have simply shut down .
There ’s growing evidence that the financial crunch is spreading to Main Street , with small businesses having trouble raising money and seeing their credit lines cut .
And leading indicators for both employment and industrial production have turned sharply worse , suggesting that even before Lehman ’s fall , the economy , which has been sagging since last year , was falling off a cliff .

Eating Out
Cranky and the World 's Hottest Burger , Off The Wall Diner , QLD , AU
Dear sweet arse - raping Jesus I will make this report VERY quick because just the memory of the burger is giving me bowel cramps .
First of all the burger in question can be found at the " Off The Wall Diner " at Wellington Point in Brisbane .
Secondly , before it gets served to you you have to put on rubber gloves .
Finally , it was not so much a meal as a physical assault .
I swear to god I have never been in so much pain in my life .
I was mentally prepared for the burn and had decided that no matter how hot it turned out to be I was just going to open a can of " harden the f * ck up " and keep eating .
So here 's how it panned out ...
4 of us head to Wellington Point around 2 pm for a cruisy Saturday lunch .
Me , Thommo and our two better halves .
We know that drinking beer wo n't help the burn , but just for psychological backup we have 2 6 packs of Little Creatures .
We drink one 6 pack on the way to the diner .
We start on the other as soon as we arrive .
The 2 guys order the megadeath burgers to much laughter and derision from the kitchen of the diner .
The 2 girls order sensible burgers .
We are downing the beer like water before we even see the burger so we run across the road and grab another 6 pack from the pub .
The girls burgers arrive and they are awesome - hand made giant patty motherf * cking things and I 'm starting to get REALLY hungry .
Our burgers arrive , with rubber gloves and a recovery kit consisting of a big drink of milk and a bowl of yogurt .
The challenge remains that if we can finish the burger without resorting to the recovery kit we get our names on a plaque on the wall ...
I start eating , and eating fast .
I stick with my game plan and ignore the burn , just push through the pain .
2 things happen immediately to my body .
1 . I get violent hiccups as my body tries to reject the molten lava I am putting into it .
2 . I begin crying like a little girl .
Not to be discouraged I forge ahead , quickly shovelling the burger into my mouth .
I begin to descend into my own little hell .
Staff come out and are watching us eat and are egging us on .
I can barely notice anything except the immense pain in my mouth , eyes , ears ( yes my ears were ringing ) but most importantly in my stomach ...
And this is the problem .
The burning mouth , the crying , the ringing ears I can handle .
But now with less than a third of the burger to go my stomach seizes up and refuses to let me put anything into it .
I take a deep breath and look for my can of " harden the f * ck up " when I notice that my mate Thommo has stopped eating his burger just beyond the halfway point and is wandering aimlessly up and down the street .
He has honestly lost the plot and is walking around in circles .
I decide I can't be defeated and manage one more bite before my stomach explains at this point that it is about to return to me everything I have just eaten at high speed .
Not being able to face the prospect of vomiting back something that hot I pull off my gloves and admit defeat with 2 mouthfuls to go .
The staff can't believe I have got this close and not finished it but at this point I really do n't give a f * ck because I have just started to hallucinate .
No exaggerations here for the next 15 - 20 minutes or so as we just sat there I was completely off my face .
it is one of the strangest drug experiences I have ever had ( that 's a BIG call ) .
The closest thing I can liken it to is the feeling you have when you are coming off an " e " and you are really jumpy , agitated , spun out and trippy .
Can I recommend this burger to anyone ?
No f * cking way .
Should you go and try it anyway ?
Absof * ckinglutely !
Mark ( crying like a little girl )
Thommo wants his mum
Defeated
And about 2 days later ...
It is now almost 48 hours later and I have just had my second shower for the morning .
Second shower ?
Why have 2 ?
Because I am still shitting white hot torrents of molten steel and I need to cool down my puckered , torn and abraded sphincter before it decides to go all " china syndrome " and melt through the crust of the earth to the core .
I swear to god all I have eaten in the past couple of days since the " event " is stomach and anus friendly food like yoghurt , and ham and salad rolls and yet here I am at 6 am on monday morning wondering why I have just been fisted by someone with a handful of broken glass and gravel ?
The burger was evil .
And it 's evilness continues to taunt my bunghole .
... and finally , a few days after that ...
LOL thanks for your concern f * cker
It lasted until Tuesday night ( I had the burger on Saturday lunchtime ) and I had my first * normal * crap on Wednesday morning .
My mate who also tried the burger with came good on Tuesday morning , but he admitted by " good " he meant he was n't bleeding profusely from his anus and eyeballs at the same time .
That burger was all f * cked up .
Now go try it .
More stupidity from the Dimwit Awards .

California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , alarmed by the ongoing national financial crisis , warned Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson on Thursday that the state might need an emergency loan of as much as $ 7 billion from the federal government within weeks .
The warning comes as California is close to running out of cash to fund day - to - day government operations and is unable to access routine short - term loans that it typically relies on to remain solvent .
The state of California is the biggest of several governments nationwide that are being locked out of the bond market by the global credit crunch .
If the state is unable to access the cash , administration officials say , payments to schools and other government entities could quickly be suspended and state employees could be laid off .
Plans by several state and local governments to borrow in recent days have been upended by the credit freeze .
New Mexico was forced to put off a $ 500 - million bond sale , Massachusetts had to pull the plug halfway into a $ 400 - million offering , and Maine is considering canceling road projects that were to be funded with bonds .

California finance experts say they know of no time in recent history when the state has sought an emergency loan of this magnitude from the federal government .
The only other such rescue was in 1975 , they said , when the federal government lent New York City money to avoid bankruptcy .
“ Absent a clear resolution to this financial crisis , ” Schwarzenegger wrote in a letter Thursday evening e-mailed to Paulson , “ California and other states may be unable to obtain the necessary level of financing to maintain government operations and may be forced to turn to the federal treasury for short - term financing . ”
The letter , obtained by The Times , came on the eve of a vote by the House of Representatives on a $ 700 - billion rescue package , but it was too soon to know how the package would affect the nation ’s paralyzed credit markets .
The Senate approved the so - called rescue bill Wednesday night .
A top Schwarzenegger aide followed up the letter with a call to the Treasury secretary Thursday night .
Treasury Department officials could not be reached for comment .

It ’s customary for California to borrow billions of dollars at the start of the fiscal year to fill its coffers until the usual flood of sales tax receipts comes in after Christmas and income tax receipts arrive in the spring .
“ California is so large that our short cash - flow needs exceed the entire budget of some states , ” Schwarzenegger wrote .
The cash needs to be in the state ’s bank account by Oct. 28 to be available to fund a scheduled $ 3 - billion payment to more than 1,000 school districts .
Said Matt David , Schwarzenegger ’s communications director : “ California faces the potential of a perfect storm created by the financial crisis ’ effect on liquidity , lower - than - anticipated revenues currently coming into the state , and our late budget .
The governor is taking steps to prepare for this scenario to ensure that the state can make critical payments . ”

But those payments wo n’t be forthcoming if the state ca n’t do routine borrowing .
For now , “ the window is shut , and if it stays shut , we are in deep trouble , ” said an administration official , who asked not to be identified , citing the sensitive talks with Washington .
Quick passage of the rescue bill by the House of Representatives today and a signature by President Bush could inject more money into the international financial system and allow California to borrow at a reasonable interest rate , the official said .
But there are no guarantees that the economic recovery plan before Congress will succeed , said California Treasurer Bill Lockyer , who has been working with Schwarzenegger to keep the state solvent .
Asking the federal government for a loan “ is one option on the table , ” said Tom Dresslar , a spokesman for Lockyer .
The treasurer , he added , is working with outside financial advisors on a possible emergency plan to sell short - term debt notes to the U.S. government .
Lockyer believes that such a plan is both feasible and legal , Dresslar said .

“ I do n’t think we have ever gone to the feds , ” said Fred Silva , senior fiscal policy advisor with California Forward , a state budget think tank .
Silva said the closest California came may have been in the days after the 1994 Northridge earthquake , when at the request of the state , Washington sped up payment of federal funds that the state was owed .
State officials now fear they face a potential cash crisis worse than California confronted in 2003 , in the final days of Schwarzenegger ’s predecessor , Gov. Gray Davis .
At that time , the precipitous decline of state revenue in the middle of a budget year forced officials to pay a syndicate of banks a premium of hundreds of millions of dollars for what amounted to an expensive “ payday loan . ”
Advertisement
Even that option , administration officials say , would not be available during the current credit drought .
They say if Congress does not approve a bailout plan -- and maybe even if it does -- there will be no lenders available to provide the state with the money it needs , regardless of the premium the state is willing to pay .
“ We need to go as wide as possible to try to find buyers at reasonable rates , ” said Robert Fayer , an attorney advising the state on its planned $ 7 - billion bond sale .
“ Whether it could ultimately be the federal government , I have no idea .
It is a fairly radical concept . ”

An old - fashioned dose of gloomy economic news sends the Dow down 348 points .
I have to admit that my respect for Katie Couric has grown immensely this week for her surprisingly comprehensive and very damaging interview with Sarah Palin .
Should the McCain / Palin ticket lose in November ( oh please , let it be so ) , I think that there 's a fairly strong argument that this interview really was the first nail in the coffin .
It has n't gotten as much splash as her reading lists or inability to recall a single Supreme Court decision , but this little exchange definitely caught my attention , especially since in my state of California , we 're fighting a proposition to eliminate the right of gays to marry :
I have , one of my absolute best friends for the last 30 years who happens to be gay .
And I love her dearly .
And she is not my " gay friend . "
She is one of my best friends who happens to have made a choice that is n't a choice that I have made .
But I am not gonna judge people .
And I love America where we are more tolerant than other countries are .
And are more accepting of some of these choices that sometimes people want to believe reflects solely on an individual 's values or not .
Homosexuality , I am not gonna judge people .
So Sarah Palin chose not to be homosexual ?
C'mon ... this is the 21st century .
Catch up .
It is n't a choice and it's not something you can pray away .
Nor should one need to .
The Human Rights Campaign went to Wasilla to see how the LGBT population felt about Palin as mayor and then governor :
Ironically , Palin 's running mate just gave an interview to the Washington Blade , an LGBT publication , the first such interview by a presidential candidate .
In it , he reiterates his anti-gay stances .
I 'm guessing he 's written off the Log Cabin vote .
Suzanne Goldenberg talks to evangelical groups in Colorado Springs
guardian.co.uk
As the words to the Christian rock song fade from the giant screens at Mountain Springs church , Pastor Steve Holt steps forward to speak to his congregation .
These are perilous times , he says , but he urges them not to despair .
" There are still two weeks before the election , " he says , before announcing a week of fasting and prayer in the run-up to polling day .
For conservative Christians , such as Holt and his congregation , the prospect of a Democratic victory represents sheer calamity .
Yet Evangelicals have not been natural supporters of John McCain , doubting the Republican 's commitment to banning abortion and gay marriage .
But conservative Christians believe a Barack Obama presidency would roll back a generation of political gains which culminated with their privileged position in George Bush 's White House .
" I do n't think we are going to have any influence with Barack Obama in the White House , " Holt told the Guardian .
The election represented a paradigm shift for the US as well as for evangelicals .
" I think there is a backlash against Bush because of the economy and I think frankly because of a lack of leadership , " Holt said .
" There is a sense we are in a position of weakness right now . "
A political forum at the church saw bewilderment and frustration among members of Holt 's flock as they tried to come to terms with Obama 's widening lead over McCain - and the potential loss of their power in Washington .
" Has Obama through mass hypnosis figured out a way to bypass the critical faculties of all Americans ? " asked Brian Sherman , a church volunteer .
Mark Andre , a commodities trader , said he had not started out a supporter of McCain - though the senator was well liked by his Democratic friends before the campaign .
" It 's almost like Democrats became hateful of McCain .
Has it been Sarah Palin and her stance , or is it just Obama and his ideology ?
What happened to all the Democrats who loved McCain ? "
Political soul - searching is under way at conservative churches across the US - but nowhere more so than Colorado Springs , a town known locally as the " evangelical mecca " .
Local government officials lured conservative Christian groups here with tax breaks in the 1980s .
Colorado Springs is now headquarters for the most powerful Christian organisations in the US .
The town and surrounding areas remain defiantly conservative in a state that has been leaning Democratic in state elections for the last four years since voting Bush in 2000 and 2004 .
John Morris , the chairman of the county Democratic party , called the town " a black hole of Republican extremism " .
Colorado is now emerging as a key battleground state , and Republicans are counting on the evangelicals to help McCain hang on .
The party has sent emissaries to 400 churches over the past few days to recruit volunteers for " evangelical - to - evangelical " phone banks .
It has also used the churches to generate excitement about Palin 's rally schedule yesterday , handing out tickets after morning services on Sunday .
In an ordinary election that grassroots organisation would make a difference .
Evangelicals consider it a " Christian duty " to vote .
Past elections have seen high turnouts among conservative voters - especially if there were ballots on gay marriage or abortion .
In an attempt to bring out the faithful this year conservatives in Colorado drafted a ballot measure that confers human rights on a fertilised egg from the moment of conception .
Church leaders have also tried to impress on their followers that - even if they are still cool towards McCain - conservatives cannot afford to have Obama in the White House .
But with election officials predicting unprecedented turnout across Colorado - up to 90 % in heavily Democratic Denver and Boulder - the tested Republican strategy of winning elections by getting out the evangelical vote is unlikely to work .
That vote would be simply swamped by a very high turnout .
There are also signs that evangelical power over the ballot box could be waning - even in Colorado Springs .
Recent years have seen more Democrats in the area .
There have also been signs of an internal revolt against local conservative Republican politicians .
Over the years , the influx of evangelicals to Colorado Springs shifted the local party establishment to the right .
Party politics increasingly revolved around the emotive issues such as abortion .
That alienated more traditional Republicans who wanted their officials to focus on the economy and infrastructure .
Last month , Jan Martin , a lifelong Republican and an elected city council official , announced she was supporting Obama because she believed the party had moved too far to the right .
" I think Bush has been too extreme , and he has catered to this black - and - white extreme view of conservative Christian thinking .
The leadership of the local party is still very conservative and still very much us against them . "
A number of evangelical leaders have also begun asking whether their movement has drifted too far to the right .
Some church leaders in Colorado Springs have called for the evangelical focus to be broadened beyond abortion and gay marriage and address issues such as climate change and poverty .
Few are willing to publicly write off McCain and the current brand of Republicanism .
But in the political forum at Mountain Springs , local Republican elected officials were already discussing how they would operate under an Obama administration .
" God forbid , but if it comes about we are going to have to be speaking out like never before , " said Doug Lamborn , the local Republican member of Congress .
Republicans needed to update their methods of communications by launching more conservative blogs , added Amy Stephens , a local state representative .
Holt was also now moving to reconcile himself to defeat .
" This could be the best thing that ever happened to the evangelical cause , " he said .
" We 're used to being against the tide . "

District Court judge Robert Hulme today said Evans had exploited very vulnerable young boys for his own sexual gratification and cultivated many of them to comply by giving them favourable attention and reward .
" The offender cultivated the complainants ' compliance with his unbridled sexual urges , '' Judge Hulme said .
Outside the court , one of the victims , who cannot be named , said he was " very happy " with the sentence .
But another of Evans 's victims said that he had expected a longer sentence and was disappointed he was not invited to the Pope 's apology .
Judge Hulme sentenced Evans to 15 years in prison , but said he would be eligible for parole in January 2018 .
After the court adjourned , victims and their supporters applauded in court and one of them yelled " you 're not so special now ' ' at Evans .
Judge Hulme said Evans was not entitled to leniency because his offences were not isolated incidents and many of the victims had told the court they had been abused regularly .
He said he was unsure about Evans ' prospects for rehabiliation because he was still denying the offences .
But when Judge Hulme said he took into account in sentencing that " there is no suggestion that in the intervening period he has committed any further offences ' ' , a gasp was heard in the court room , packed with Evans ' victims .
However , police in NSW and Victoria are investigating allegations of further offences allegedly committed by Evans while he was working in Victoria .
One of the victims spoke outside court and encouraged others who had the " courage and support ' ' to come forward .
The victims had explained credibly in court why they had not come forward before , Judge Hulme said .
Many of his young victims would not have had the psychological wherewithall to complain .
And , he said , " even if a boy was to complain [ at the time of the abuse ] there was a fair chance nothing would come of it ' ' .
" Who would believe that a priest would do such things to a boy in his care . ''
One of the boys told the court he told other boys about his abuse , and was soon asked to see the Boys Town rector , Father Flemming , who encouraged him to forget the incident , saying : " Nothing happened .
Men have got urges .
It does not mean anything . ''
The court heard that Father Flemming , who is dead , had also allegedly assaulted another boy .
One of the boys , the court had heard , harmed himself , burning his leg and later placed a tourniquet on it , leaving him with permanent scars , to erase the memory of his first assault by Evans .
The memory of the events had haunted each of the victims ever since , Judge Hulme said .
Colorado and Pennsylvania schools have their controversial t- shirts .
Turkey has its scarves .

Kambakhsh was tried on blasphemy charges and sentenced to death .

Now that a growing number of top Iraqi officials are talking openly about a timeline for U.S. troop withdrawal , it 's worth taking a moment to consider how this might factor into John McCain ’s vision of an indefinite war , followed by an indefinite troop presence .
As luck would have it , McCain was asked about this kind of scenario at the Council of Foreign Relations in 2004 , and gave a very straightforward answer .
Question : “ What would or should we do if , in the post - June 30th period , a so - called sovereign Iraqi government asks us to leave , even if we are unhappy about the security situation there ? ”
McCain ’s Answer : “ Well , if that scenario evolves than I think it ’s obvious that we would have to leave because — if it was an elected government of Iraq , and we ’ve been asked to leave other places in the world .
If it were an extremist government then I think we would have other challenges , but I do n’t see how we could stay when our whole emphasis and policy has been based on turning the Iraqi government over to the Iraqi people . ” [ emphasis added ]
Adam Blickstein asked , “ Does the John McCain of 2008 agree with this assessment ? ”
Sounds like the kind of question an enterprising political reporter might pose to the Republican candidate .

OTTAWA , Aug. 21 ( UPI ) -- Canada 's Conservative government has no plans to replace 40 - year - old military aircraft that patrol the Arctic region , an Ottawa newspaper reported .
The Ottawa Citizen said despite Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's assertions the country will defend its Arctic sovereignty rights as international disputes arise , his government has n't budgeted anything for the replacement of the four Twin Otter aircraft that operate out of Yellowknife , Northwest Territories .
Advertisement
The Twin Otter planes , which can carry 20 people , were purchased in 1970 and were scheduled to be decommissioned in 2010 but defense officials told the newspaper it appears that will be extended as far as 2017 .
Several months ago , Harper announced funding for more ships and manpower to monitor Arctic waters but the associated legislation made no provision for replacing the aging air fleet , the newspaper said .
With the Arctic ice shield gradually melting , Canada Russia , the United States , Denmark , Norway , Sweden , Iceland and Finland have been jostling to define their share of the Arctic with regard to potential energy resources and shipping routes .
The John McCain presidency effectively began on January 10 , 2007 , when George W. Bush announced the deployment of five more combat brigades to Iraq .
This escalation of an unpopular war ran counter to the advice of Bush 's senior military leadership , ignored the recommendations made by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group , and sidestepped the objections of the Iraqi government it was ostensibly intended to assist .
But the plan was nearly identical to what the Republican senior senator from Arizona , nearly alone among his Capitol Hill colleagues , had been advocating for months : boost troop levels by at least 20,000 , give coalition forces the authority to impose security in every corner of Baghdad , and increase the size of America 's overburdened standing military by around 100,000 during the next five years .
By enthusiastically endorsing McCain 's approach , the lame duck president all but finished the job of anointing the senator his political successor .
McCain had already spent the previous three years lining up Bush 's campaign team , making nice with the social conservatives he railed against in the 2000 primaries , and positioning himself as the most hawkish of all the nomination - chasing Republican hawks .
For the purposes of the 2008 campaign , Bush 's surge announcement was almost the perfect gift : McCain got to solidify his case with primary voters even while giving himself operational deniability .
( “ We 've made many , many mistakes since 2003 , and these will not be easily reversed , ” he said on January 11 , while reiterating his call for even more troops . )
The sheer unpopularity of Bush 's move did knock the previously front - running McCain a notch or two behind Rudy Giuliani in the polls .
( Both men have consistently finished ahead of Democratic contenders Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in head - to - head competition . )
But it also allowed McCain to recapture some of his lost reputation as a straight - talking independent .
“ I would much rather lose a campaign than lose a war , ” he said with a grin on Larry King Live right after Bush 's speech .
The press , which had been souring on the candidate during his noisy lurch to the right , breathed an audible sigh of relief .
“ Defiant McCain back as maverick , ” declared the Chicago Tribune .
The significance of the McCain Plan transcended horse - race politics .
It was a microcosm of the Arizona senator 's largely unexamined philosophy about the proper role of the U.S. government .
Like almost every past McCain crusade , from fining Big Tobacco to drug - testing athletes to restricting political speech in the name of campaign finance reform , the surge involved an increase in the power of the federal government , particularly in the executive branch .
Like many of his reform measuresidentifying weapons pork , eliminating congressional airport perks , even banning torturethe escalation had as much to do with appearances ( in this case , the appearance of continuing to project U.S. military strength rather than accept “ defeat ” ) as it did with reality .
And like the reputation - making actions of his heroes , including his father , his grandfather , and his political idol Teddy Roosevelt , the new Iraq strategy required yet another expansion of American military power to address what is , at least in part , a nonmilitary problem .
McCain 's dazzling rsumwar hero , campaign finance Quixote , chauffeur of the Straight Talk Express , reassuring National Uncletends to distract people from his philosophy of government , and his chumminess with national journalists does n't help .
There is a more useful key to decode how he might behave as president .
McCain 's singular goal in public life is to restore citizens ' faith in their government , to give us the same object of beliefnational greatnessthat helped save his life after he gave up hope as a POW in Vietnam .
Although Bill Kristol and David Brooks coined the phrase “ national - greatness conservatism ” in a 1997 Wall Street Journal op - ed piece , the sentiments they expressed and the movement forefathers they chose would have been right at home in one of the Chamber of Commerce speeches about the virtues of patriotism that McCain gave in the 1970s .
Kristol and Brooks wrote that “ wishing to be left alone is n't a governing doctrine ” and “ what 's missing from today 's American conservatism is America . ”
McCain , then an ambitious pol - to - be working the rubber chicken circuit as a famous ex-POW , would deliver inspiring sermonettes about the value of public service and restoring America as an international beacon .
All three men would eventually come together on such National Greatness projects as the “ forward strategy of freedom ” in the Middle East , trying to drive money out of politics , and , not least or last , getting John McCain elected president .
Like Kristol and Brooks , McCain regards Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln as political idols ; like them , he never hesitates in asserting that government power should be used to rekindle American ( and Republican ) pride in government .
Unlike most neoconservative intellectuals , however , McCain is intimately familiar with the bluntest edge of state - sponsored force .
A McCain presidency would put legislative flesh on David Brooks ' fuzzy pre-9/11 notions of “ grand aspiration , ” deploying a virtuous federal bureaucracy to purify unclean private transactions from the boardroom to the bedroom .
And it would prosecute the nation 's post - 9/11 wars with a militaristic zeal this country has n't seen in generations .
Military Son
To say John McCain comes from a military family is a little like pointing out that Prince Charles is a scion of the upper class .
Born in 1936 , McCain is the Navy captain son of a four - star admiral who was the son of another four - star admiral , all named John Sidney McCain .
And that just scratches the surface .
John McCain and his ancestors have served in every major U.S. war from the Revolution to Vietnam , and the line wo n't stop there : 20 - year - old John Sidney McCain IV ( you can call him Jack ) is learning the family trade at the Naval Academy , and 18 - year - old Jimmy is in the Marines , waiting to deploy to Iraq .
McCain 's father headed up the military 's Pacific command from 1968 to 1972 , convincing President Nixon to illegally attack Cambodia and famously ordering the bombing of Hanoi even though he knew his son was still imprisoned there .
He also led the controversial 1965 invasion of the Dominican Republic , which he defended by saying , “ People may not love you for being strong when you have to be , but they respect you for it and learn to behave themselves when you are . ”
He warned early and often that Soviet naval power would soon eclipse America's , and he palled around with the likes of the Indonesian dictator Haji Mohammad Suharto .
His favorite book was Alfred Thayer Mahan's The Influence of Sea Power Upon History , and his favorite poem was Oscar Wilde 's “ Ave Imperatrix , ” which he doubtless read as an unironic meditation on the righteous use of imperial power : “ England ! what shall men say of thee , / Before whose feet the worlds divide ?/ The earth , a brittle globe of glass , / Lies in the hollow of thy hand . ”
McCain 's grandfather commanded all naval air power during World War II and started a three - generation tradition of schmoozing in Washington by heading the Bureau of Naval Aeronautics , where he ordered up weapons systems .
McCain 's major - general granduncle was the father of the modern military draft .
And his paternal great - grandmother 's side of the family , he says , has an even stronger military tradition , including a militia captain on George Washington 's Revolutionary War staff , an Army captain in the War of 1812 , even royalist brawlers in England 's mid-17th - century Civil War .
The McCain men switched from Army to Navy right when Teddy Roosevelt dramatically expanded the country 's naval forcethe “ big stick ” he waved whenever a rival colonial power got uppity in the Americas or the Pacific .
McCain 's grandfather was on the flagship of the famous Great White Fleet when it finished its demonstrative 14 - month world tour in 1908 .
“ For the McCains of the United States Navy , as well as for many of our brother officers , presidents just did n't get much better than Teddy Roosevelt , ” McCain wrote in his 2002 book Worth the Fighting For .
“ He transformed the American navy from a small coastal defense force to an instrument for the global projection of power . ”
The senator , his father , and his grandfather all took as a given that the U.S.
Navy should control the world 's shipping lanes , guarantee the political stability of far - flung continents , and use overwhelming force at the hint of a threat to national interests .
When John Sidney McCain III was growing up , every male around the dinner table could cite the exploits of British Admiral Lord Nelson , recite verse from Rudyard Kipling , and sing ribald songs about drunken misbehavior in ports of call .
It 's the character trait reflected by that last fact , more than any highfalutin ' stirrings of National Greatness , that initially gave young John the fighting will to survive five years of brutal captivity during the Vietnam War .
John McCains I , II , and III shared more than just a name and profession .
Each was short for a sailor , quick to violent temper ( especially when accused of dishonesty or of benefiting from privilege ) , and lousy in the classroom .
( The future senator graduated 894th out of a Naval Academy class of 899 , but that was only marginally worse than his father , who was 423rd out of 441 . )
One reason for the poor academic performance was that each McCain was a five - star binge drinker and carouser .
Grandpa “ smoked , swore , drank , and gambled at every opportunity he had , ” Sen .
McCain wrote in his 1999 memoir Faith of My Fathers .
Dad , while more discreet , was an out - and - out alcoholic .
John spent his teens and 20s constantly flirting with disciplinary disaster by breaking every drinking and curfew rule on the books , concentrating more on Brazilian heiresses and Florida strippers than on his aviating skills .
This wide streak of good - time rebelliousnessand his unusual frankness in discussing itis one of many endearing things about the senator , along with his active and self - deprecating sense of humor , his still - salty tongue , and his convincing passion when confronting some types of injustice and government waste .
Any young McCain worth his salt could convert a grudge into motivational sustenance and torment his tormentors with defiant lip .
So after being shot out of the sky during a risky raid over Hanoi in 1967 , then pummeled by a mob of local Vietnamese and detained at the notorious prison nicknamed the Hanoi Hilton , McCain comported himself heroically despite two broken arms , a mangled knee , and innards wracked by dysentery and other maladies .
Every morning for two years a guard the prisoners called The Prick would demand that McCain bow to him .
Every morning McCain would refuse , then brace for his beating .
Herded into a made - for - propaganda Christmas
Eve service in the prison yard , McCain punctured the enforced silence with repeated shouts of “ Fuck you ! ” while raising his middle finger to the camera .
Beat senseless for days on end for refusing to divulge information or accept early release ( which would have given the North Vietnamese a propaganda victory and violated the Navy 's honor code ) , he would reveal only the names of every player he could remember from the Green Bay Packers .
“ Resisting , being uncooperative and a general pain in the ass , ” he wrote , “ proved , as it had in the past , to be a morale booster for me . ”
But it was n't enough to prevent him from finally cracking .
After two weeks of particularly severe beatings in 1968 , he recorded a forced confessionthough not before half - heartedly attempting suicideand then plunged into inconsolable , shame - wracked despair .
“ They were the worst two weeks of my life , ” he recalled .
What pulled him back from the brink was not the stubborn individuality that had sustained him through the years but the selfless encouragement of his fellow prisoners , who told him he did the best he could even while giving him strength to do better next time .
“ I discovered in prison that faith in myself alone , separate from other , more important allegiances , was ultimately no match for the cruelty that human beings could devise , ” he wrote .
“ It is , perhaps , the most important lesson I have ever learned . ”
Submerging and channeling his individuality into the “ greater cause ” of American patriotism became McCain 's reason for living .
“ I resolved that when I regained my freedom , ” he wrote in Faith of My Fathers , “ I would seize opportunities to spend what remained of my life in more important pursuits . ”
Upon his return to America he rehabilitated his injuries , studied the Vietnam War for a year at the National War College ( cashing in on his father 's connections to gain a privilege for which his rank of lieutenant commander did not qualify him ) , commanded an air squadron for two years ( again attaining a position for which he was n't technically qualified ) , and then rode out the 1970s as the Navy 's liaison officer to the U.S. Senate , where he built the political relationships that made possible his second career .
After divorcing his first wife , retiring from the Navy , and marrying the young Arizona - based daughter of one of the country 's largest Anheuser - Busch distributors , McCain hunted around for an available Arizona congressional seat , bought a house in the district of 30 - year GOP incumbent Jim Rhodes on the day the congressman announced his retirement , and served two terms in Congress before graduating to the Senate , where he succeeded a retiring Barry Goldwater in 1986 .
Starting off as a Reagan conservative , McCain soon got caught up in the 1989 “ Keating Five ” scandal , in which he and four other senators were raked over the coals for pressuring regulators to go easy on the savings and loan magnate ( and generous campaign donor ) Charles Keating .
Because the scandal called his honor and integrity into question , he counted it as an even worse experience than Vietnam .
After enduring the scandal and his wife 's messy addiction to pills , McCain locked in on a lifelong political goal : to give all Americans the same opportunity to transform their lives that he had , by focusing their belief on the Land of the Free .
The 12 - Step Guide to Expanding Government
Reading McCain 's four best - selling books is a revelatory experience .
Not since Teddy Roosevelt has a leading presidential contender committed so many words to print about his philosophies of life and governance before seeking the Oval Office .
All of McCain 's charming strengths and alarming foibles are there , hiding in plain sight , often unintentionally .
McCain on the page is reflexively self - effacing ( “ I have spent much of my life choosing my own attitude , often carelessly , often for no better reason than to indulge a conceit , ” he writes in the second paragraph of Faith of My Fathers ) , consciously reverent of his heroes ( Why Courage Matters and Character Is Destiny are basically collections of hagiographic mini- profiles threaded with a few self - help bromides ) , and refreshingly authentic - sounding ( for a politician , anyway ) .
He has a tendency to write passages that would fit perfectly in a 12 - step recovery guide , especially Steps 1 ( admitting the problem ) and 2 ( investing faith in a “ Power greater than ourselves ” ) .
There is n't any evidence that McCain himself has gone through the 12 steps , but his father was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous , his second wife received treatment in 1994 for her five - year addiction to pain medication , and he has spent a life surrounded by substance abusers .
“ I have learned the truth , ” he writes in Faith of My Fathers .
“ There are greater pursuits than self - seeking .
Glory belongs to the act of being constant to something greater than yourself . ”
That “ something ” is the “ last , best hope of humanity , ” the “ advocate for all who believed in the Rights of Man , ” the “ city on a hill ” once dreamed by Puritan pilgrim John Winthrop ( whom McCain celebrates in Character Is Destiny ) .
Any thing or person perceived as tarnishing that city 's luster has a sworn enemy in the Arizona senator .
“ Our greatness , ” he writes in Worth the Fighting For , “ depends upon our patriotism , and our patriotism is hardly encouraged when we cannot take pride in the highest public institutions , institutions that should transcend all sectarian , regional , and commercial conflicts to fortify the public 's allegiance to the national community . ”
So it was that McCain fought in 1994 to abolish a minor congressional privilegeuse of the parking lot closest to the main terminal at National Airport .
He readily acknowledged this was “ merely a symbol ” of corruption , not an actual abuse of power .
“ I meant only to recognize that people mistook such things for self - aggrandizement , ” he explained in Worth the Fighting For .
“ Every appearance that inadvertently exacerbates their distrust is a far more serious injury than it would be had we made other , more serious attempts to rekindle Americans ' pride in their government . ”
So many ways for Americans to lose their pride in government , so little time for reform !
Everything from the trivial to the sublime became a “ transcendent issue ” requiring urgent federal attention .
McCain has used the “ transcendent ” tag not just for campaign finance reform , the War on Terror , and Iraq , but for expanding Medicare , cracking down on Hollywood marketers , even banning ultimate fighting on Indian reservations .
“ National pride will not survive the people 's contempt for government , ” he wrote in Worth the Fighting For .
“ And national pride should be as indispensable to the happiness of Americans as is our self - respect . ”
Occasionally this impulse translates into a libertarian stance , as with the senator 's long - running rhetorical war on pork - barrel spending .
More often it results in more government , even at the expense of the First Amendment .
Such has been the case with McCain 's favorite domestic issue : campaign finance reform .
To restore Americans ' faith in their political system , McCain and Sen. Russell Feingold ( D - Wis. ) sponsored a 2002 law that prohibits advocacy groups such as the National Rifle Association and the Sierra Club from paying for any radio or TV ad that mentions a federal candidate within two months of an election .
As a result , active political participants ( candidates and parties ) and deep - pocketed media organizations can continue to attack and praise contenders , but independent groups may not ( unless they form separate political action committees subject to federal contribution limits ) .
Meanwhile , the McCain - Feingold bill tasked the Federal Election Commission with constantly re-interpreting the rules to close off new sources of financial support for political speech .
McCain 's fondness for government power does n't stop there .
He pushed for the huge airline industry bailouts after September 11 .
He recently proposed legislation requiring every registered sex offender in the country to report all their active email accounts to law enforcement or face prison .
He wants to federalize the oversight of professional boxing .
He wants yet more vigor in fighting the War on Meth .
He has been active in trying to shut down the “ gun show loophole , ” which allows private citizens to sell each other guns without conducting background checks .
He has lauded Teddy Roosevelt 's fight against the “ unrestricted individualism ” of the businessman who “ injures the future of all of us for his own temporary and immediate profit . ”
If you 're beginning to detect a rigid sense of citizenship and a skeptical attitude toward individual choice , you are beginning to understand what kind of president John McCain actually would make , in contrast with the straight - talking maverick that journalists love to quote but rarely examine in depth .
For years McCain has warned that a draft will be necessary if we do n't boost military pay , and he has long agitated for mandatory national service .
“ Those who claim their liberty but not their duty to the civilization that ensures it live a half - life , indulging their self - interest at the cost of their self - respect , ” he wrote in The Washington Monthly in 2001 .
“ Sacrifice for a cause greater than self - interest , however , and you invest your life with the eminence of that cause .
Americans did not fight and win World War II as discrete individuals . ”
McCain 's attitude toward individuals who choose paths he deems inappropriate is somewhere between inflexible and hostile .
Nowhere is that more evident than when he writes about his hero Teddy Roosevelt , a man whose racism ( he was a Darwin - inspired eugenicist who believed “ race purity must be maintained ” ) and megalomania ( he declared before the 1916 presidential campaign that “ it would be a mistake to nominate me unless the country has in its mood something of the heroic ” ) do not merit more than a couple paragraphs ' pause in McCain 's adulation of his expansionist accomplishments .
“ In the Roosevelt code , the authentic meaning of freedom gave equal respect to self - interest and common purpose , to rights and duties , ” McCain writes .
“ And it absolutely required that every loyal citizen take risks for the country 's sake .
His insistence that every citizen owed primary allegiance to American ideals , and to the symbols , habits , and consciousness of American citizenship , was as right then as it is now . ”
McCain , always disarmingly transparent in projecting his own ambitions onto the objects of his hagiography , describes Roosevelt as an “ Eastern swell ” who traveled West and fought wars to become “ a man of the people . ”
He admires in equal measure the former president 's trust busting , his prolific writing , and his boyish , bull - headed vigor , but somewhere down deep he will always see Roosevelt as the commander of the Great White Fleet .
All War , All the Time
McCain 's lack of respect for individual choice , coupled with his slow - motion suck - up to social conservatives , has led to several reversals of social policy positions , most conspicuously regarding gay rights .
McCain voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment to the Constitution , has repeatedly chastised his fellow Republicans for trying to win votes by marginalizing gay Americans , and gave a stirring eulogy in San Francisco for the United Flight 93 hero Mark Bingham , who was gay .
But in the 2006 elections he made a fool of himself campaigning for an Arizona ballot initiative banning gay marriage .
Perhaps because of the libertarian strain in Arizona 's political tradition , the proposition lost .
McCain has been a pretty consistent opponent of abortion , but he went from saying he would n't seek to reverse Roe v. Wade in 1999 to saying he would in 2006 .
Such flip - flops have cooled McCain 's longstanding , mutually satisfying love affair with journalists .
The senator had a natural affinity for writers long before his political careerbefriending , for example , the legendary New York Times scribe R.â€ … W. “ Johnny ” Apple before his imprisonment in Vietnam .
During the Keating Five scandal , he made a decision to start answering all media inquiries promptly and exhaustively .
If there 's one thing journalists love , it 's access .
( The New Republic 's John Judis opened a 2006 analysis of McCain by gushing about how he has liked him ever since a one - on - one interview a decade ago . )
And if there 's one thing reporters love more than access , it 's politicians who buck the orthodoxy of their own party , especially when the party is Republican .
McCain made some lifelong media allies when he called Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson “ agents of intolerance ” in 2000 and when he spoke out against ethanol subsidies despite the strategic importance of the Iowa caucuses .
Throw in his war hero status , which plays well in the eyes of a distinctly nonmartial profession , and you 've got the most favorable press notices of any U.S. senator .
Until now .
Besides the damage done by his sudden turn to social conservatism , McCain 's stubborn and distinctly glum support of Bush 's widely despised troop surge in Iraq has brought into sharp focus the candidate 's concepts of when and how Washington should use the strongest military ever assembled , and whether the president should recognize any constraints from the co-equal branches of government .
On these questions , the most militaristic presidential candidate since Ulysses S. Grant has provided a clear answer :
If you think George W. Bush had an itchy trigger finger , you ain't seen nothing yet .
In addition to calling for tens of thousands more troops in Iraq than Bush has committed , McCain has pushed to keep military options against Iran “ open , ” criticized the “ repeated failure to backrhetoric with action ” against North Korea , supported a general policy of “ rogue state rollback , ” and lamented the Pentagon 's failure to intervene in Darfur .
On his short list of senatorial regrets is voting to cut off funds for the botched invasion of Somalia and failing to push for sending troops to Rwanda .
Like the neoconservatives with whom he has increasingly aligned himself , he sees Iraq and Iran as integral to a new twilight struggle against Islamic radicalism , while holding onto the belief that too much multilateralism can screw up a perfectly good war .
“ A world where our ideals had a realistic chance of becoming a universal creed was our principal object in the last century , ” he wrote in Worth the Fighting For .
“ In the process , we became inextricably involved in the destiny of other nations .
That is not a cause for concern .
It is a cause for hope . ”
As for the current mess in Iraq , McCain defends Bush 's doubling down by arguing that the alternatives are too horrible to contemplate .
“ We should make no mistake : Potentially catastrophic consequences of failure demand that we do all we can to prevail in Iraq , ” he said in the Senate on January 11 .
“ We were able to walk away from Vietnam .
If we walk away from Iraq , we 'll be back , possibly in the context of a wider war in the world 's most volatile region . ”
Regarding the U.S. president 's war - related prerogatives , McCain has a nearly unbroken record of deferring to them , from the moment he volunteered to testify against The New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case ( even though his only expertise was in being a prisoner of war ) to his rollover when Bush insisted that his ballyhooed anti-torture bill deny habeas corpus rights to War on Terror detainees and give the White House authority “ to interpret the meaning and application of the Geneva Conventions . ”
McCain once wrote that Teddy Roosevelt “ invented the modern presidency by liberally interpreting the constitutional authority of the office to redress the imbalance of power between the executive and legislative branches that had tilted decisively toward Congress . ”
This is the kind of president John McCain is aching to be .
McCain is at his most unintentionally revealing when writing about his Republican predecessor in the Senate , Barry Goldwater .
“ I really do n't think he liked me much , ” he wrote in Worth the Fighting For .
“ I do n't know why that was .
He was usually cordial , just never as affectionate as I would have liked . ”
That it never occurred to McCain why a libertarian Westerner might keep a “ national greatness ” conservative and D.C. - bred carpetbagger at arm 's length is both touching and deeply worrisome .
Does he not understand that there are at least some people in American life who take liberty as seriously as McCain takes his notions of national duty ?
Judging by a comment he made recently on the Don Imus radio show , the answer seems to be no .
Defending campaign finance reform , McCain said , “ I would rather have a clean government than onewhere First Amendment rights ' are being respected that has become corrupt .
If I had my choice I 'd rather have a clean government . ”
He may have his choice soon enough .
A genetic analysis of a biopsy sample recently discovered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has led researchers to conclude that the virus that causes AIDS has existed in human populations for more than a century , according to a study released Wednesday .
The study , led by evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey of the University of Arizona in Tucson , puts the date of origin at around 1900 , which is 30 years earlier than previous analyses .
HIV - 1 , the most common form of the virus , is known to have originated in chimpanzees because of close genetic similarities to a simian virus .
It now infects an estimated 33 million people worldwide .
But figuring out when the virus jumped species and became established in humans has been difficult .
The first cases in the U.S. were recognized in 1981 , and the oldest evidence of the virus is a 1959 blood sample taken from a man who lived in what was then the Belgian Congo .

To find the point of origin , the scientists relied on a well - recognized genetic technique to determine the mutation rates of different sub - types of the virus .
With a known rate of mutation , researchers could then , in essence , run the clock backward to find the point where the different sub - types were the same .
That common ancestor would represent the first appearance of the virus in humans before it mutated .
“ The HIV virus evolves incredibly quickly , ” said geneticist Bette Korber of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico , who did an analysis in 2000 .
“ Those mutations get passed on to the next individual .
So we have that evolutionary pace to enable a look backward . ”
Korber ’s analysis compared the 1959 blood sample and modern samples .
She traced their common ancestor to roughly 1931 .
The new analysis , published in the journal Nature on Wednesday , added lymph node tissue from a woman who died in 1960 in the Belgian Congo .
The tissue specimen was one of more than 800 preserved in ice - cube - size blocks of paraffin at the University of Kinshasa .

The researchers compared that sample with modern strains to determine its mutation rate .
Then they matched that rate with the 1959 sample , tracing their common ancestor to between 1884 and 1924 .
“ I ’ve been trying to track down old samples like this for quite a few years now , ” Worobey said .
“ As soon as you have that one other sequence from that same time period , it really snaps the whole evolutionary picture into sharp focus . ”
The researchers surmised that the creation of colonial cities around the turn of the century was the catalyst that allowed the virus to take hold .
Dr. Steven M. Wolinsky , a co-author of the study , said that colonial cities meant not just more potential hosts for viruses living in closer quarters , but also prostitution and other high - risk behaviors for transmitting the virus .

“ Urbanization was probably the main trigger , ” said Wolinsky , an infectious diseases specialist at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago .
Jim Moore , an anthropologist at UC San Diego who was not associated with the study , said the fact that the virus could have spread unnoticed for decades is no surprise , given the mortality rates in Africa during the colonial period .
“ The conditions then were horrendous in terms of how Africans were treated , ” he said .
“ People dying of AIDS would have been part of the background . ”

Happy Left Handers Day ..
P/s :
A friend of mine , Fish found out something interesting and had shared it in the class during in her public speaking .
Guess what ?
She has discovered that , 13th August is a special date for all the left - handed .
Really ?
There is Left - Handed Day ?OMG !
I can't believe it because for all this while , I personally feel that left - handed people are being discriminated ( by the right - handed ) ..
Hmph !
Let me shout this loudly in my blog :
So , let me tell you some of the unfairness which I 've discovered in these 20 ++ years .
I remember how my mum trying to stop me from being a left - handed when I was in elementary school .
Whenever I tried to grab a pencil , a crayon or an eraser using my left hand ... So , having the perception that using left hand is wrong , I shifted to the right .
I did , but just for a short period .
I would use my left hand to write and draw whenever my mum was not around .
I guess , I 've been using my left - hand for quite a long period before my mum found out again .
She did try to stop me but failed .
Obviously , she knew it was too late since my muscles on my left hand are stronger than my right .
What can she do ?
Well , .. Hehe ... And this is how I save myself from being a left - handed girl .
Bravo !
Well , the question is , why most of the parents especially mothers do n't like their children to be a left - handed ?
I 've heard several stories from my friends and relatives about how theirs mother force them to write using right hand .
I 've been wanting to voice out my dissatisfaction here .
Why mothers especially in Asian countries want to stop their children from being a left - handed ?
Why why and why ?
Secondly , I am really disappointed and unsatisfied with the table chairs which are used in some classes .
It is specially made for the right - handed and not left - handed .
Uuh ...
Why no one even care to make a few chairs ( at least ) for the left - handed users ?
Are n't we deserve the attention too ?
Honestly , it 's hard to write during in the class under an uncomfortable posture in which we 've to turn at least 20 - 45 degrees to the right .
Unlike the right handed users , they can sit comfortably facing the lecturer while jotting down all the important notes .
As a result , I will sometimes encounter back pain and neck pain at the end of the class !:( Sometimes , cultures and costums do discriminate the left - handed people .
For example , you should only use your right hand for hand shaking and handing things .
If you use your left hand , that 's mean you 're rude .
Why ?
One of the reason is because of , majority of the people will use the left hand for cleaning oneself with water after defecating while the right hand is use for eating .
So , if you use your left hand , it means ..
RUDE !RUDE !Why ?
Is it left hand means dirty ?
Sad ..
Try to search for the meaning of right and left in the dictionary , what will you find out ?
Let me help you in this using dictionary .com
What I 'm trying to show you here is , why the word " right " have more positive meaning than the word " left " .
Do n't you agree with me ?
Shall I explain it any further as you can read it by yourself ..
Sigh ... sakitnya hati ( heart broken ) .. Some of the musical instruments are made for the right - handed .
Again , I feel sad .
For example , most of the string instruments like violin , viola and guitar ( not a string instruments ) are mostly made for the right - handed users .
I do n't play violin ( tried it before ) nor viola but I play guitar .
So , I still remember how suffer I was when I 'd to force myself to use my right hand pressing the strings for the chords .
But then , I told my sir and was allowed to change .
Hehe ...
Luckily the type of guitar which I bought is for ' universal ' - both right and left handed .:) Forcing myself to use the mouse with my right hand .
Yes .
Ever since I started using the computer at the age of 12 , I am forced to use the mouse using my right hand .
I felt odd at first , but after being conditioned by the culture , I 've used to it .
Not a problem for me ...
In fact , I can click super - duper fast !
Haha ... And the list go on .....
I know there are still quite a number of complaints I wanna make but I shall leave this to you - my other left - handed readers .
You can treat this as a place to voice your opinions , comments and suggestions .
We deserve the attention right ?
Hmph !
Why not ?
By the way , do let me know if you 're a left handed .
Leave your name and blog address ( if you have ) .
I wish to know the number of left - handed readers ( blogger and non-bloggers ) in this blogosphere .
Lol ... How I celebrate my Left Handers Day ??
I bought a RM2 chochate cake for myself ... : PBesides , I blogged about this .
Hehe ...
James Lockhart before the Senate .
Every day ( or close to it ) until November 4 , a series of writers and thinkers will discuss the election over instant messenger for nymag.com .
Today , Rolling Stone ’s Matt Taibbi and National Review ’s Byron
York argue over the headwinds facing McCain , what Phil Gramm had to do with the financial crisis , and the importance of credit default swaps .
M.T. : So how are you feeling about McCain ’s chances today ?
B.Y. : I ’ve just finished an article for National Review — the actual magazine — about the headwinds McCain faces .
I was going to look at three , and then I started to list them .
I stopped at ten .
New Gallup numbers out today show that George W. Bush ’s job approval rating remains at 25 percent , while his disapproval rating has ticked up to 71 percent .
How hard is it to succeed a two - term president of your own party who is at 25 - 71 ?
We do n’t know because it ’s never been done .
M.T. : Yeah , that ’s a damned shame , too .
I feel really badly for the guy .
I suppose you think the media coverage is also a headwind ?
B.Y. : Actually , I did not list media coverage among the headwinds .
I listed the succeed - a- two - term - president problem , the right - track / wrong - track problem , the Republican - Democrat - enthusiasm gap problem , the Republican - Democrat - I.D. - gap problem , the financial meltdown , Iraq , Republican gloom on Capitol Hill , Obama ’s fund - raising advantage , and McCain ’s historical problems with the GOP base .
M.T. : But all of those “ headwinds , ” or almost all of them , are the direct result of McCain having supported policies that are now unpopular .
There is absolute justice in his facing a “ headwind ” from the financial meltdown , from the unpopularity of the Iraq war , and so on .
How is that a “ headwind ” ?
That ’s just self - created unpopularity .
I mean , his onetime campaign co-chair and top economic adviser , Phil Gramm , basically created the credit - default - swap market back in 2000 .
Why should n’t he get hammered on the financial crisis ?
B.Y. : Did I suggest that headwinds are unfair ?
But on the financial meltdown in particular , if you ’re suggesting that that is a Republican creation , or even more specifically a McCain creation , I think you ’re on pretty shaky ground .
M.T. : You do n’t think the unregulated CDS market was a major factor in the current crisis ?
Were you watching when AIG almost went under ?
Were you watching the Lehman collapse ?
B.Y. : I think that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were also major factors .
And I believe that many of the problems in the mortgage area can be attributed to the confluence of Democratic and Republican priorities : the Democrats ’ desire to give mortgages to people , particularly minorities , who could not afford them , and the Republicans ’ desire to achieve an “ ownership society , ” in part by giving mortgages to people who could not afford them .
Again , I believe that if you are suggesting that the financial crisis is a Republican creation , or even more specifically a McCain creation , I think you ’re on pretty shaky ground .
M.T. : Oh , come on .
Tell me you ’re not ashamed to put this gigantic international financial Krakatoa at the feet of a bunch of poor black people who missed their mortgage payments .
The CDS market , this market for credit default swaps that was created in 2000 by Phil Gramm ’s Commodities Future Modernization
Act , this is now a $ 62 trillion market , up from $ 900 billion in 2000 .
That ’s like five times the size of the holdings in the NYSE .
And it ’s all speculation by Wall Street traders .
It ’s a classic bubble / Ponzi scheme .
The effort of people like you to pin this whole thing on minorities , when in fact this whole thing has been caused by greedy traders dealing in unregulated markets , is despicable .
B.Y. : I was struck by the recent Senate testimony of James Lockhart , who is head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency , about the sheer recklessness of Fannie in recent years .
Despite “ repeated warnings about credit risk , ” Lockhart testified , Fannie became more reckless in 2006 and 2007 than they had been in the scandal - ridden tenure of Franklin Raines ( who departed in 2004 ) .
In 2005 , Lockhart said , 14 percent of Fannie ’s new business was in risky loans .
In the first half of 2007 , it was 33 percent .
So something terribly wrong was going on there , and it became a significant part of the present problem .
M.T. : What a surprise that you mention Franklin Raines .
Do you even know how a CDS works ?
Can you explain your conception of how these derivatives work ?
Because I get the feeling you do n’t understand .
Or do you actually think that it was a few tiny homeowner defaults that sank gigantic companies like AIG and Lehman and Bear Stearns ?
Explain to me how these default swaps work , I ’m interested to hear .
Because what we ’re talking about here is the difference between one homeowner defaulting and forty , four hundred , four thousand traders betting back and forth on the viability of his loan .
Which do you think has a bigger effect on the economy ?
B.Y. : Are you suggesting that critics of Fannie and Freddie are talking about the default of a single homeowner ?
M.T. : No .
That is what you call a figure of speech .
I ’m saying that you ’re talking about individual homeowners defaulting .
But these massive companies are n’t going under because of individual homeowner defaults .
They ’re going under because of the myriad derivatives trades that go on in connection with each piece of debt , whether it be a homeowner loan or a corporate bond .
I ’m still waiting to hear what your idea is of how these trades work .
I ’m guessing you ’ve never even heard of them .
I mean really .
You honestly think a company like AIG tanks because a bunch of minorities could n’t pay off their mortgages ?
B.Y. : When you refer to “ Phil Gramm ’s Commodities Future Modernization Act , ” are you referring to S.3283 , co-sponsored by Gramm , along with Senators Tom Harkin and Tim Johnson ?
M.T. : In point of fact I ’m talking about the 262 - page amendment Gramm tacked on to that bill that deregulated the trade of credit default swaps .
Tick tick tick .
Hilarious sitting here while you frantically search the Internet to learn about the cause of the financial crisis — in the middle of a live chat interview .
B.Y. : Look , you can keep trying to make this a specifically partisan and specifically Gramm - McCain thing , but it simply is n’t .
We ’ve gone on for fifteen minutes longer than scheduled , and that ’s enough .
Thanks .
M.T. : Thanks .
Note , folks , that the esteemed representative of the New Republic has no idea what the hell a credit default swap is .
But he sure knows what a minority homeowner looks like .
B.Y. : It ’s National Review .

Michael Idov and Matt Taibbi on Obama ’s Foregone Historic Win , and the Morass It Will Land In
For a complete and regularly updated guide to presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain — from First Love to Most Embarrassing Gaffe — read the 2008 Electopedia .
In college , there are history classes , English classes , art classes , math classes , and astronomy classes .
Whatever your major , you will take enlightening general education classes as well exciting major - specific classes that inspire and motivate you .
But what many people forget to take is the First Aid / CPR class .
Why is this important ?
Because one day you might use it to save a life .
While most colleges offer First Aid/ CPR courses as regular classes , you can also find them listed as enrichment or extension classes and as courses offered by your local fire department .
Wherever you can find these courses , take them .
It ’s good knowledge for anyone to have , whether you ’re into sports , are starting a family , or are just a person who wants to be able to help .
The courses are often just a few hours in length .
You gather together with other classmates , watch a video , perform First Aid and CPR on manikins , and then you are certified to help if someone has a heart attack , chokes , is involved in a car accident , or experiences injuries of any other kind .
You ’ll be surprised at how easy the steps are to save a person ’s life , and you ’ll also be surprised by the fact that so few people know what to do during an emergency .
You should n’t be one of them .
So next time you have a few hours to spare during regular class time , consider taking a class that could save your best friend , or your father , or your child .

A friendly reminder from the Enlightened of how much more profound their respect for the rule of law is than yours , to be filed away for the next time one of them deigns to lecture you about Bush ’s constitutional apostasy .
During his acceptance speech last night at the Republican National Convention in Minnesota , John McCain told the audience , “ We believe in a strong defense , work , faith , service , a culture of life , personal responsibility , the rule of law , and judges who dispense justice impartially and do n’t legislate from the bench . ”
Most American voters ( 60 % ) agrees and says the Supreme Court should make decisions based on what is written in the constitution , while 30 % say rulings should be guided on the judge ’s sense of fairness and justice .
The number who agree with McCain is up from 55 % in August .
While 82 % of voters who support McCain believe the justices should rule on what is in the Constitution , just 29 % of Barack Obama ’s supporters agree .
Just 11 % of McCain supporters say judges should rule based on the judge ’s sense of fairness , while nearly half ( 49 % ) of Obama supporters agree .
Better yet , file this away for the next time some conservative asks you why he should turn out to vote for a guy who supports amnesty .
So alarming is it that even TNR ’s wringing its hands : “ Now , since it seems unlikely that many Americans spend much time weighing the relative merits of different methods of judicial decisionmaking , it ’s a fairly safe bet that voters are largely reflecting the rhetoric they hear from political elites … ”
Exit question :
What rhetoric from The One could his disciples possibly be “ reflecting ” here ?
Update : Headlines comments imported .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Americans are much more likely to believe that Barack Obama understands the problems Americans face in their daily lives than to believe John McCain does .
These results , based on an Oct. 10 - 12 USA
Today / Gallup poll , suggest Obama has a significant perceptual advantage in a presidential election campaign in which Americans overwhelmingly name the economy as the most important problem facing the country .
Throughout the campaign , Obama has been viewed as a candidate who understands the public 's problems , but the 73 % who say this about him in the current poll is the high for the year .
Meanwhile , Americans are somewhat less convinced today than they were in March that McCain understands Americans ' problems .
The public not only gives Obama credit for understanding its problems , but also for having a plan to solve them .
While neither candidate scores particularly well when the public is asked whether the candidates have " a clear plan for solving the country 's problems , " Americans are much more likely to say Obama does ( 51 % ) than to say this about McCain ( 35 % ) .
Americans have become increasingly likely to think Obama has a plan to solve the country 's problems since this was last measured in the spring .
Much of this increase is because of changes in the views of Democrats , who were divided into Hillary Clinton and Obama camps in the spring , but now are mostly united behind Obama .
In March , just 59 % of Democrats thought Obama had a clear plan for solving the nation 's problems , while 82 % do now .
McCain is more competitive with Obama on the other three character dimensions tested in the poll .
McCain and Obama are viewed similarly in terms of their leadership and ability to manage the government .
Sixty - three percent say McCain is a strong and decisive leader , while 61 % say this about Obama .
The two are now essentially tied on this measure , which had been an advantage for McCain earlier this year .
Exactly 55 % of Americans say each candidate can manage the government effectively , which is an improvement for Obama since the spring ( when 48 % said he could ) .
Views of McCain 's management ability have not changed since April , when the question was last asked , but are down slightly from a 60 % reading in March .
At least half of Americans say each candidate shares their values , although more say this about Obama ( 58 % ) than McCain ( 50 % ) .
Both candidates now score slightly more highly on this dimension than they did in the spring .
Implications
In an election in which the economy is the top issue on voters ' minds , Obama is already seen as the candidate who can better handle the issue .
During the campaign , Obama has been able to convince a growing number of Americans that he understands Americans ' problems and has a clear plan for solving them , and now many more believe that he exhibits these qualities than does McCain -- a major plus for Obama 's electoral prospects given voter anxiety about the economy .
Also , Obama has been able to largely erase the advantage McCain had over him on perceptions of their leadership ability .
That does n't leave much important territory where Americans believe that McCain is superior to Obama on character or issues , aside from McCain 's continued advantage for handling matters of international policy .
Thus , in order for McCain to prevail , in the remaining weeks he will either have to convince voters that he is as good as or better than Obama on the economy , or try to shift the agenda so that international matters carry greater weight in voters ' minds .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,269 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Oct. 10 - 12 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
The big threat to growth in the next decade is not oil or food prices , but the rising cost of health care .
The doubling of health insurance premiums since 2000 makes employers choose between cutting benefits and hiring fewer workers .
Rising health costs push total employment costs up and wages and benefits down .
The result is lost profits and lost wages , in addition to pointless risk , insecurity and a flood of personal bankruptcies .
Sustained ...
It ’s not unusual for North Korean leader Kim Jong
Il to disappear from public view .
But his absence Tuesday from a military parade marking a major anniversary coincided with reports that the autocratic Kim may be gravely ill .
Or maybe not .
The lack of solid evidence about the state of Kim ’s health underscores how little the world knows about a country that has detonated a nuclear explosion , frequently berates and threatens its neighbors , and once again may be on the verge of famine .
A U.S. intelligence official said it appeared the 66 - year - old leader “ has suffered a health setback , potentially a stroke . ”
Advertisement
The episode occurred in the last two to three weeks , the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity when discussing intelligence assessments .
He noted that U.S. officials were watching developments closely in one of the world ’s poorest and most reclusive countries because of the far - reaching effects they could have on world affairs .
The communist regime ’s survival relies heavily on a cult of personality around the “ dear leader , ” and Kim ’s passing could usher in a collapse that many analysts believe is years overdue .
Kim ’s prolonged illness or death also could hurt international efforts to rid North Korea of its nuclear arsenal .
The country ’s generals , who are known to oppose surrendering its nuclear weapons , might take control .
Tuesday was the 60th anniversary of the state ’s founding , a date that in Korean tradition is more important than anniversary celebrations five and 10 years earlier that Kim did attend .
Kim normally would have presided at a military parade in Pyongyang , the capital , but foreign diplomats were told several days ago that they could bring cameras , which was taken as an indication that Kim would not be there .
Advertisement
The New China News Agency reported that only Kim Yong Nam , the 80 - year - old second in command , made a public appearance at an anniversary banquet Tuesday evening .
Kim Jong
Il was groomed for decades to succeed his father , North Korea founder Kim Il Sung , who died in 1994 at age 82 .
The younger Kim is visibly overweight , walks with a slight limp and is reported by South Korean intelligence to have diabetes and a heart condition .
He is widely reported to like Western movies and luxury goods such as French cognac and designer watches .
A South Korean newspaper reported that Kim collapsed Aug. 22 , but it also said there did not appear to be a panic over his health in the capital .
Today , the North ’s No. 2 leader , Kim Yong Nam , said there is “ no problem ” with the supreme leader , and a senior diplomat said the reports of ill health are “ not true , ” according to Japan ’s Kyodo News agency .
Advertisement
Some observers , noting there have been repeated reports about Kim ’s health , cautioned against reading too much into the latest batch .
“ He is going to die sooner or later , and eventually one of these reports about his health will be true , but this one is probably much ado about nothing , ” said Andrei Lankov , a respected Pyongyang watcher and a professor at South Korea ’s Kookmin University .
He said the extreme secrecy surrounding the North Korean regime made it unlikely that either the United States or South Korea had reliable intelligence .
Kim ’s last public appearance was Aug. 14 , when he was reported by the state news service to have inspected a military unit .
However , it is not unusual for him to disappear for months at a time .

Sean McCormack , the chief State Department spokesman , said that while it was difficult to interpret the actions of the Kim regime , U.S. officials have noticed recently that the North Koreans have not been moving ahead in talks on ending their nuclear program with representatives of the United States , China , Russia , Japan and South Korea .
Pyongyang and those five countries have been at an impasse over inspections to verify claims North Korea made in a statement in June about the condition and contents of its nuclear arsenal .
Pyongyang last fall began taking apart its aging nuclear reactor at Yongbyon in a deal under which it is to receive aid in exchange for disarmament .
But last month , North Korea said it was considering restoring the plant to operation because the Bush administration had not made good on its pledge to remove North Korea from a list of state sponsors of terrorism .
U.S. officials say that step ca n’t be taken under the deal until North Korea agrees to an inspection program .

North Korea ’s plutonium - based weapons program is believed to have produced the fissile material used in a nuclear blast in October 2006 .
But North Korea also is known to have received parts and plans for developing a uranium - enrichment program from renegade Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan .
Adding to Western concerns , North Korea has in the past been eager to export weaponry .
Kim has three sons , but analysts are skeptical that any of them could replace him .
The sons have spent much of their lives abroad .
The oldest , Kim Jong Nam , 37 , fell into disfavor after he was arrested in 2001 sneaking into Japan to visit Disneyland on a fake passport .
Two other sons are in their 20s .
One possible successor is Chang Sung Taek , 61 , who is married to Kim ’s youngest sister .
Chang was purged in 2004 but has returned to public life in the last two years .
He accompanied Kim on a visit to China in 2006 .

“ When he does die , it will be havoc because there is no mechanism in place for power transfer , ” Lankov said .
“ There will be a lot of contenders for supremacy .
Unless we have somebody who will be charismatic , ruthless and popular , we will probably see open clashes in Pyongyang , maybe shooting . ”
L. Gordon Flake , a Korea watcher and executive director of the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation in Washington , said the military ’s influence would probably grow because it is the only important institution that has not collapsed in famine and economic contraction .
The military is “ the most reactionary , opaque institution in North Korea , particularly in regards to nuclear weapons , ” he said .
One of the major concerns of North Korea watchers is what has happened to the already built nuclear weapons , which are believed to be stashed away in caves .
Advertisement
North Korea ’s immediate neighbors , especially China and South Korea , also worry that the country ’s 22 million people will seek aid across the border .
During the mid-1990s , an estimated 2 million people died of hunger .
The U.N. World Food Program reported recently that food shortages were headed again toward 1990s levels .
Some of the recent speculation about Kim ’s health has been fueled by tabloid reports from Japan , as well as a new book claiming that his public appearances in recent years have been made by look - alikes .
“ There are people in the military who hope to maintain their power and position .
They do n’t want a new leader , ” said Toshimitsu Shigemura , author of the book , “ The True Character of Kim Jong Il , ” which was published last month in Tokyo .
Shigemura said that Kim might already be incapacitated or dead .

Top police marksman awarded £ 5,000 after senior officer calls him ' serial killer ' in jest
Commander Sue Akers introduced herself to a police marksman with the remark , ' I 've always wanted to meet the Met 's very own serial killer '
A police marksman has been awarded £ 5,000 in damages for ' hurt feelings ' after a senior woman officer jokingly called him a ' serial killer ' .
The firearms officer - nicknamed ' Killer ' because of his skill in shooting suspects dead during armed sieges - received the payout after Scotland Yard decided defending the action would be a waste of public money .
Commander Sue Akers , who is in charge of the Metropolitan Police 's fight against gun crime , made the joke as she introduced herself to the officer at a social function .
She told him : ' I 've always wanted to meet the Met 's very own serial killer . '
But the unnamed officer , who is a member of the elite CO19 firearms unit , failed to see the funny side and filed a complaint .
Miss Akers was said to have been mortified by his reaction and made a formal apology .
But after fears he might take legal action , the Met agreed to a payout after calculating that going to an employment tribunal would cost £ 150,000 .
The officer is believed to have retained his job in CO19 .
Scotland Yard confirmed yesterday that the officer had accepted £ 5,000 in settlement at the end of 2006 .
A spokesman said : ' In late 2006 the Metropolitan police settled a threatened civil action by a serving officer in connection with an allegation that inappropriate comments were made to him by a senior officer .
' The matter was settled and no further action was taken . '
Details of the payout have emerged just two months before the inquest into the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes at Stockwell tube station in South London in July 2005 .
The Brazilian electrician was shot dead by firearms officer after being mistaken for a July 21 bomber on the run .
The firearms officers who shot him are to give evidence in public at the inquest for first time , though their identities will be kept secret .
Commander Akers has served in the Met for 32 years and was staff officer to Sir Ian Blair when he was deputy commissioner .
She is held in high esteem by colleagues of all ranks and has a no - nonsense attitude .
In 2003 , the former murder squad detective helped actress Helen Mirren to research her role as Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison in the hit ITV drama Prime Suspect .
Mirren said of the police : ' I do n't know how they do it .
It 's not the difficulty of the actual job ; it 's the environment in which they have to work .
' The police are on the front line of all the mistakes the politicians make .
It 's very , very difficult to see that level of pain and struggle and unpleasantness every day .
' I 'm surprised they do n't all retire at 35 . '
Study :
If we painted every rooftop in 100 major cities white , it would offset the entire planet ’s carbon dioxide emissions for one year .
That ’s nearly 44 metric gigatons .
It makes sense .
We all know white reflects heat ( that ’s why we wear white shirts and dresses on hot days ) , and we even knew that painting rooftops white lessens the need for air conditioning .
But until now , we did n’t know that changing dark–colored surfaces to white would help fight against global warming .
The news broke yesterday at California ’s Climate Change Research Conference .
Hashem Akbari , attending the conference from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , announced that replacing dark shingles on an average - sized household rooftop with a lighter color would offset 10 metric tons of carbon dioxide — comparable to taking two mid-sized cars off the road for a year .
Speaking of roadways , they ’re part of the problem too .
Because of its cheap nature , most roads are paved with black asphalt instead of light grey concrete , which causes roads to absorb an inordinate amount of heat .
Repaving roads with lighter - colored materials would have a similar impact to painting rooftops .
California already mandates that newly - built large buildings have light - colored rooftops , but the law was intended to decrease air conditioning costs .
Akbari hopes to enlist the United Nations in an effort to convince major cities to make their roadways and rooftops more pale .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - House prices fell 1.7 percent in the month of September to post their biggest annual drop since comparable records began in 1991 , the Nationwide building society said on Thursday .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
Interest rate futures rallied as investors speculated the figures increased the chance of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England next week , although analysts cautioned that a cut in itself would do little to halt sliding property values .
“ Even if the Bank of England cuts interest rates as early as next week , as we now expect , this is likely to provide only very limited support to the housing market given that elevated money market rates are exerting upward pressure on fixed rate mortgages , ” said Howard Archer , economist at Global Insight .
Mortgage approvals are already less than a third what they were a year ago and figures from the Bank of England Thursday showed lenders expect to restrict credit even further in the coming months .
A survey of construction , meanwhile , showed the sector contracted for a seventh consecutive month in September as commercial activity fell at the fastest pace since the survey began a decade ago .
Nationwide said house prices in September were 12.4 percent lower than a year earlier .
Before 1991 , Nationwide conducted quarterly house price surveys .
The largest annual fall on that measure was a 10.7 percent drop recorded in the early 1990s .
The 11th consecutive monthly decline highlights the sharp reversal of fortune for the property market since the credit crunch took hold last summer , bringing an end to a decade in which property values almost trebled .
“ Casting back one year there have been some astonishing and unpredictable developments in the housing and financial markets , ” said Fionnuala Earley , Nationwide ’s chief economist .
“ We would need to see a significant shift in consumers ’ sentiment before we begin to see any real recovery in activity and subsequently house prices . ”
September ’s decline pushed the average price of a property to 161,797 pounds , the lowest since February 2006 .
The precipitous drop in house prices both in Britain and overseas has been a key element of the crisis that is rocking the global banking sector and threatening to send many industrialised economies into recession .
A reluctance by banks to lend to each other had led to a sharp increase in wholesale funding costs in recent weeks .
Several mortgage providers have responded by raising their own mortgage rates .
Policymakers are concerned a weakening property market could feed a vicious downward spiral of falling consumer demand and rising unemployment .
Futures markets suggest the Bank of England will cut interest rates to 4.75 percent next week and to 4 percent by this time next year .
A Reuters poll this week showed 45 of 66 economists polled September 29 - October 1 said the BoE would hold rates at 5.0 percent next week .
A cut by the end of the year is now almost a certainty with forecasters in the poll .
Texas megachurch pastor John Hagee has successfully worked with copyright lawyers to get more than 120 videos featuring him removed from YouTube .
The development was reported by The Huffington Post , whose blogger Max Blumenthal discovered that a video he had made at Hagee 's Christians United for Israel conference last year was among those removed from the popular video website .
Juda Engelmayer , a spokesman for Hagee , confirmed that the videos had been removed .
" They were anything that contained clips of sermons , clips of activities happening at CUFI or John Hagee Ministries events , " he said .
Hagee is the outspoken pastor of Cornerstone Church in San Antonio .
After his controversial comments about the Holocaust and Catholics were carried on the Internet , Sen. John McCain rejected Hagee 's endorsement of his presidential race .
Blumenthal criticized the move as " a naked exercise in news suppression . "
Engelmayer would not respond directly to the comments of Huffington Post writers but said the removal of videos followed particular criteria .
" It was n't done on a targeted basis , " he said .
" It was done strictly on a formulaic basis of whether it fit certain criteria . "
He said the removal was not timed to the upcoming annual summit of Christians United for Israel , July 21 - 24 in Washington .
Rather , he said Hagee 's daughter read a story about a studio that had successfully challenged YouTube and had material removed , sparking the work by lawyers several months ago .
Blumenthal wrote in a Huffington Post blog that his " Rapture Ready " mini-documentary " contained no copyrighted material whatsoever . "
Asked about that complaint , Engelmayer said , " I have not studied the video , so I can't speak to his video at all . "

The Article : The Anti-democratic nature of US capitalism is being exposed by Noam Chomsky .
Bretton Woods was the system of global financial management set up at the end of the second World War to ensure the interests of capital did not smother wider social concerns in post - war democracies .
It was hated by the US neoliberals – the very people who created the banking crisis writes Noam Chomsky .
The Text : THE SIMULTANEOUS unfolding of the US presidential campaign and unraveling of the financial markets presents one of those occasions where the political and economic systems starkly reveal their nature .
Passion about the campaign may not be universally shared but almost everybody can feel the anxiety from the foreclosure of a million homes , and concerns about jobs , savings and healthcare at risk .
The initial Bush proposals to deal with the crisis so reeked of totalitarianism that they were quickly modified .
Under intense lobbyist pressure , they were reshaped as “ a clear win for the largest institutions in the system . . . a way of dumping assets without having to fail or close ” , as described by James Rickards , who negotiated the federal bailout for the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management in 1998 , reminding us that we are treading familiar turf .
The immediate origins of the current meltdown lie in the collapse of the housing bubble supervised by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan , which sustained the struggling economy through the Bush years by debt - based consumer spending along with borrowing from abroad .
But the roots are deeper .
In part they lie in the triumph of financial liberalisation in the past 30 years – that is , freeing the markets as much as possible from government regulation .
These steps predictably increased the frequency and depth of severe reversals , which now threaten to bring about the worst crisis since the Great Depression .
Also predictably , the narrow sectors that reaped enormous profits from liberalisation are calling for massive state intervention to rescue collapsing financial institutions .
Such interventionism is a regular feature of state capitalism , though the scale today is unusual .
A study by international economists Winfried Ruigrok and Rob van Tulder 15 years ago found that at least 20 companies in the Fortune 100 would not have survived if they had not been saved by their respective governments , and that many of the rest gained substantially by demanding that governments “ socialise their losses , ” as in today ’s taxpayer - financed bailout .
Such government intervention “ has been the rule rather than the exception over the past two centuries ” , they conclude .
In a functioning democratic society , a political campaign would address such fundamental issues , looking into root causes and cures , and proposing the means by which people suffering the consequences can take effective control .
The financial market “ underprices risk ” and is “ systematically inefficient ” , as economists John Eatwell and Lance Taylor wrote a decade ago , warning of the extreme dangers of financial liberalisation and reviewing the substantial costs already incurred – and proposing solutions , which have been ignored .
One factor is failure to calculate the costs to those who do not participate in transactions .
These “ externalities ” can be huge .
Ignoring systemic risk leads to more risk - taking than would take place in an efficient economy , even by the narrowest measures .
The task of financial institutions is to take risks and , if well - managed , to ensure that potential losses to themselves will be covered .
The emphasis is on “ to themselves ” .
Under state capitalist rules , it is not their business to consider the cost to others – the “ externalities ” of decent survival – if their practices lead to financial crisis , as they regularly do .
Financial liberalisation has effects well beyond the economy .
It has long been understood that it is a powerful weapon against democracy .
Free capital movement creates what some have called a “ virtual parliament ” of investors and lenders , who closely monitor government programmes and “ vote ” against them if they are considered irrational : for the benefit of people , rather than concentrated private power .
Investors and lenders can “ vote ” by capital flight , attacks on currencies and other devices offered by financial liberalisation .
That is one reason why the Bretton Woods system established by the United States and Britain after the second World War instituted capital controls and regulated currencies .*
The Great Depression and the war had aroused powerful radical democratic currents , ranging from the anti-fascist resistance to working class organisation .
These pressures made it necessary to permit social democratic policies .
The Bretton Woods system was designed in part to create a space for government action responding to public will – for some measure of democracy .
John Maynard Keynes , the British negotiator , considered the most important achievement of Bretton Woods to be the establishment of the right of governments to restrict capital movement .
In dramatic contrast , in the neoliberal phase after the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in the 1970s , the US treasury now regards free capital mobility as a “ fundamental right ” , unlike such alleged “ rights ” as those guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights : health , education , decent employment , security and other rights that the Reagan and Bush administrations have dismissed as “ letters to Santa Claus ” , “ preposterous ” , mere “ myths ” .
In earlier years , the public had not been much of a problem .
The reasons are reviewed by Barry Eichengreen in his standard scholarly history of the international monetary system .
He explains that in the 19th century , governments had not yet been “ politicised by universal male suffrage and the rise of trade unionism and parliamentary labour parties ” .
Therefore , the severe costs imposed by the virtual parliament could be transferred to the general population .
But with the radicalisation of the general public during the Great Depression and the anti-fascist war , that luxury was no longer available to private power and wealth .
Hence in the Bretton Woods system , “ limits on capital mobility substituted for limits on democracy as a source of insulation from market pressures ” .
The obvious corollary is that after the dismantling of the postwar system , democracy is restricted .
It has therefore become necessary to control and marginalise the public in some fashion , processes particularly evident in the more business - run societies like the United States .
The management of electoral extravaganzas by the public relations industry is one illustration .
“ Politics is the shadow cast on society by big business , ” concluded America ’s leading 20th century social philosopher John Dewey , and will remain so as long as power resides in “ business for private profit through private control of banking , land , industry , reinforced by command of the press , press agents and other means of publicity and propaganda ” .
The United States effectively has a one - party system , the business party , with two factions , Republicans and Democrats .
There are differences between them .
In his study Unequal Democracy : The Political Economy of the New Gilded Age , Larry Bartels shows that during the past six decades “ real incomes of middle - class families have grown twice as fast under Democrats as they have under Republicans , while the real incomes of working - poor families have grown six times as fast under Democrats as they have under Republicans ” .
Differences can be detected in the current election as well .
Voters should consider them , but without illusions about the political parties , and with the recognition that consistently over the centuries , progressive legislation and social welfare have been won by popular struggles , not gifts from above .
Those struggles follow a cycle of success and setback .
They must be waged every day , not just once every four years , always with the goal of creating a genuinely responsive democratic society , from the voting booth to the workplace .
Notes on the Bretton Woods System :
The Bretton Woods system of global financial management was created by 730 delegates from all 44 Allied second World War nations who attended a UN - hosted Monetary and Financial Conference at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods in New Hampshire in 1944 .
Bretton Woods , which collapsed in 1971 , was the system of rules , institutions , and procedures that regulated the international monetary system , under which were set up the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) ( now one of five institutions in the World Bank Group ) and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , which came into effect in 1945 .
The chief feature of Bretton Woods was an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained the exchange rate of its currency within a fixed value .
The system collapsed when the US suspended convertibility from dollars to gold .
This created the unique situation whereby the US dollar became the “ reserve currency ” for the other countries within Bretton Woods .

This is n't a blog about hamsters , though from to time to time it might be .
This Blog is about anything I want to talk about and that could range from a story on what I did last night to a discussion about the price of eggs in China .
What a strange world it is , the world of " digital rights " activism .
Campaigners pause only to pat each other on the back .
Last week , anti-copyright campaigners Public Knowledge revealed their annual award winners .
The group 's president Gigi B Sohn proudly announced the winners : fellow campaigner Carl Malamud of PublicResource.org , fellow campaigner Ben Scott of FreePress ... and fellow campaigner Fred Von Lohmann of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , the EFF .
Trebles all round , then .
But Sohn was merely returning the favour .
Two years ago , the EFF announced its annual Pioneer Awards - and up stepped Gigi B Sohn of Public Knowledge to collect hers .
In recent years the EFF has found an ingenious solution to the task of finding new pioneers - by simply giving awards to EFF insiders .
In 2005 , we noted , the EFF marked the lifetime 's achievements of one Mitch Kapor .
One of his achievements happened to be ... founding the EFF .
Last year , the EFF cast its net far and wide , scoured every corner of the earth ... and honoured EFF Fellow Cory Doctorow .
And if you 're not in the race to win one of the awards , that could be because you 're judging them .
The EFF 's von Lohmann judged the Public Knowledge awards in 2007 , when one of the winners was Columbia law professor Tim Wu . And Wu was so delighted , he returned the favour this year , as an awards judge honoring von Lohmann .
Is there a more incestuous and self - congratulatory scene anywhere outside the fashion business ?
When the EFF first instituted its Pioneers Awards , it was rewarding people who 'd actually achieved something .
Bob Kahn , Ivan Sutherland and Tom Jennings were recipients in the first two years .
All have left a rather more tangible and lasting mark on the world than ranting on a blog , or issuing a press release .
Meanwhile , we have spotted a gap in the circle jerk merry - go - round .
Soros - backed newcomers FreePress fails to honour campaigners in any kind of annual ceremony .
We trust this omission will be rectified .
Nature abhors a vacuum . ®
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Former “ American Idol ” runner - up Clay Aiken , who has gone onto a singing career , said his “ dear friend , ” music producer Jaymes Foster , gave birth on Friday to a son fathered by Aiken .
Aiken , 29 , wrote on his Web site that his child , named Parker Foster Aiken , was born at a hospital in North Carolina .
“ My dear friend , Jaymes , and I are so excited to announce the birth of Parker Foster Aiken , ” he said .
The singer added that Parker is “ healthy , happy and as loud as his daddy ” and that Foster “ is doing quite well . ”
Aiken was a runner - up on the second season of No. 1 - rated TV talent show “ American Idol ” in 2003 .
In January he debuted in the Broadway musical “ Monty Python ’s Spamalot . ”
It is Iran ’s ability and willingness to contribute to stabilise the Middle East , and the hardcore realpolitik pursued to this end , that compelled the Bush administration to pursue higher level security talks with the Islamic Republic , says the author .
It remains to be seen if the next President in the White House will appreciate these changing realities within the region , or will continue to huff and puff like an exhausted diva forced to share the grand stage ( of world politics ) with others .
( From London ) WHEN IRAN TEST FIRED its Shahab missile arsenal a few weeks ago , many analysts interpreted the move as yet another indicator of Iran ’s intransigent “ defiance ” of the “ international community ” .
Yes , it is true that Iran has build a self - sufficient military - industrial complex , that it is mass producing tanks , fighter jets and long range missiles , and that it has also established a space programme that successfully launched the first Iranian built satellite , Kavoshgar or “ Explorer ” , into orbit earlier this year .
Yet by all current standards none of these programmes poses a real threat to Israel and / or the United States , regardless of how some hysterical commentators in these countries may portray them .
A SUPPOSED THREAT : THE FACTS
Here are some facts from the other side .
According to data compiled by the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) in London , Israel ’s per capita military expenditure is US $ 1,565 , almost 200 times more than Iran ’s , which stands at US $ 81 .
Overall , Israel spends twice as much on its military sector than Iran , amounting to US $ 9.8 billion in 2005 .
Moreover , the Pentagon ’s military budget for 2007 was US$ 456 billion .
Indeed , this year ’s spending on the Iraq war alone , which amounts to US $ 141.7 billion , is over 30 times higher than Iran ’s total military budget .
Incidentally , it is also greater than the combined defence expenditure of China and Russia .
Look at the estimated 200 nuclear weapons that Israel has , and on top of that the thousands that the United States controls , and you can get a sense of the military “ threat ” that Iran poses to these countries .
Indeed , in terms of conventional and non-conventional weaponry and the direct involvement in conflicts , Israel and the United States are among the most militarised countries in the world .
“ What should indeed surprise anyone wary of the activities of the war parties in the United States and Israel is that a whole range of people responsible for the disaster in Iraq ”
And yet , Israeli politicians threaten to attack Iran on an almost daily basis , they widely advertise their Iran - focused war games and the press in the country has adopted an almost hysterical obsession with the self - concocted Iranian “ threat ” .
And as for the United States , Senator John McCain joked about bombing Iran at a campaign appearance in April 2007 and recently expressed his gratitude to the Iranians for continuing to smoke American cigarettes because it may kill them .
Even Senator Hillary Clinton ’s remark that she would “ obliterate ” Iran in its entirety ( i.e. as a nation ) and Barack Obama ’s speech at the AIPAC in which he twice stressed that he would do “ everything in ( his ) power ” to prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon , cease to shock .
What should indeed surprise anyone wary of the activities of the war parties in the United States and Israel is that a whole range of people responsible for the disaster in Iraq continue to indulge in their privileged positions despite their complicity in the fabrication and dissemination of the lies surrounding the invasion of the country in 2003 .
There are individuals such as Con Coughlin of the Daily Telegraph in the United Kingdom , who is an exceptionally talented and adept tale teller .
In the immediate build up to the invasion of Iraq he readily popularised the lie that Saddam Hussein could launch a WMD strike within 45 minutes of an attack on the country .
He also concocted a story linking Mohamed Ata , one of the 9/11 terrorists , to Saddam Hussein ’s intelligence services .
Both myths have been revealed as such by successive American and British intelligence reports , and yet Coughlin continues to merrily type away , linking Iran to all sorts of things , including al - Qaeda , of course .
Alas , the functionaries of war continue to mislead , lie and deceive .
And then there are more hybrid promoters of war such as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
I have written repeatedly about AIPAC ’s complicity in the Iraq war and its role in the continuous confrontation with Iran .
By now the ‘ Israel Lobby ’ , which continuously pushes and shoves American foreign policy towards an uncompromisingly pro-Zionist direction , has been dissected by many scholars , from Stephen Walt and John J. Mearsheimer to new historians of Israel like Ilan Pappe .
All of them have correctly pointed to the fact that AIPAC is rather unrepresentative of its constituency , which is the Jewish community in the United States and Israelis themselves .
In both countries , many polls confirm that the majority favours dialogue over conflict .
And yet , AIPAC continues to manipulate in the name of their constituency , and will continue to spread its virulently anti-Iranian , anti-Arab and anti-Muslim message until there is a viable counter - movement for peace that can balance it out .
THE AMERICAN PLAN BACKFIRES
But I do n’t want to pursue another analysis of how these individuals and institutions attempt to condition us and our politicians to wage the next war that is in their interest and detrimental to ours .
What is more important is that in the aftermath of the disaster in Iraq , they are unsuccessful .
They may be able to sponsor an anti-Iranian resolution here and there , but the grand strategy to reprogram the country ’s foreign policies is bound to fail .
Even long - standing allies of the US in the region , such as Saudi Arabia , Jordan and Egypt , have repeatedly warned the Bush administration that Iran is unlikely to compromise its strategic preferences , even if attacked .
Indeed , the American effort to present Iran as the major threat to the region in order to align the aforementioned states behind Israel has largely backfired .
These states are aware that any overt association with the US , and especially with Israel , threatens their legitimacy .
After the devastation of Iraq ( especially the Abu Ghraib scandal ) , the relentless bombing of Lebanon by Israel in the 2006 war and the continued mistreatment of the Palestinians , Arab and Muslim societies are understandably sensitive about US and Israeli designs for the region .
The days when their governments could mould their opinions and subdue their actions are long gone .
Satellite TV , the Internet and international education have empowered Jordanians , Egyptians , Saudi Arabians , Kuwaitis etc. to express themselves .
They have entered into a dialectical relationship with the state , which is obliged to be attentive to their demands .
“ Iran continues to be in close security dialogue with both the Maliki government in Iraq and Hamid Karzai ’s administration in Kabul ”
Both the emergent constellation in which civil society is rejecting the crumbling monopoly of authoritarian states and the prospect of continuous violence engendered by groups sympathising with al - Qaeda explain why countries such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia are pursuing a rather more forceful regional and international diplomacy .
Both countries have been very active in defusing the stand - off in Lebanon , where the Bush Administration abjectly failed to marginalize Hesbollah in the political scene .
Elsewhere , Turkey acts as an interlocutor between Israel and Syria in their negotiations concerning the Golan Heights , and Egypt has tried to defuse the situation in the Gaza strip by talking to both Hamas and Israel which has yielded a shaky cease fire agreement between the two .
Moreover , Iran continues to be in close security dialogue with both the Maliki government in Iraq and Hamid Karzai ’s administration in Kabul .
Indeed , it is Iran ’s ability and willingness to contribute to stabilise these countries , and the hardcore realpolitik pursued to this end , that compelled the Bush administration to pursue higher level security talks with the Islamic Republic .
It remains to be seen if the next President in the White House will appreciate these changing realities within the region , or will continue to huff and puff like an exhausted diva forced to share the grand stage ( of world politics ) with others .

I was disappointed by the moderator ’s decisions during the first Presidential Debate .
Officially , the debate topic was foreign policy , but Jim Lehrer bowed to the news of the moment and turned the first half of the debate into a discussion about the proposed bailout of the Wall Street financial industry .
That focus crowded out most discussion about two major campaign issues that both have a huge impact on foreign policy – energy and the environment .
Whenever the candidates tried to talk about energy policies , the moderator immediately tried to change the subject .
I am not a single issue voter , but I really want to understand the nuances of the energy policy positions for the two candidates in this particular election .
The last time energy policy was such a major part of the campaign was in 1976 ; the result of that election made a huge difference in our current energy source mix .
It is difficult to understand American foreign policy since 1900 without understanding our dependence on industries fueled by petroleum , coal and natural gas .
The effort to ensure reliable access to those fossil fuels has defined our relationships with a number of key countries and companies .
It is nearly impossible to imagine how to determine where to go from here without discussing a strategy for our energy future .
There are few global issues with more potential impact on long term foreign policy than the coordination of efforts aimed at controlling air and water pollution along with limiting the production and emission of gases that are contributing to global climate change .
Despite the moderator ’s seeming lack of interest in the topic , the candidates made some quick and pointed comments attempting to highlight the differences in their energy policies .
Just hearing or reading the transcript of the debate is not enough to give a full interpretation of the differences , so in the interest of fair use , I produced a little clip of the energy policy exchange , including enough of the moderator ’s redirection to show what I mean when I said he was not terribly interested in the topic .
The photo accompanying this article is an extraction from that clip .
Senator McCain outlined his “ all of the above ” strategy of developing alternative energy sources and off shore oil drilling , with a clear emphasis on the importance of his desire to build 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030 .
He tried to make the case that Senator Obama ’s stance on used nuclear fuel might inhibit that kind of development .
Senator Obama similarly articulated an essentially “ all of the above ” strategy , listing all available options including solar , wind , biodiesel , nuclear , clean coal , and even limited off - shore drilling .
There was some back and forth regarding alternative energy .
Obama stated that McCain had a voting record that did not back up his words ; according to Obama , McCain has voted against alternative energy programs 23 times during his 26 years in the senate .
McCain looked frustrated when Jim Lehrer attempted to move on right after that comment and pushed a chance to respond , starting off with “ Look , no one from Arizona is against solar power . ”
In one of the more contentious periods in the whole debate , McCain said , “ Senator Obama says he is for nuclear but he is against reprocessing and he is against storing .
So , it ’s hard to get there from here . ”
Senator Obama disputed that characterization of his position .
He tried to interrupt several times and finally succeeded stating , “ I just have to correct the record .
I have never said that I object to nuclear waste .
What I said is that we have to store it safely . ”
Please take a look at the presidential debate energy policy focus clip to see for yourself the body language that went along with the spoken words .

Avoiding Ruinous Compromises
“ Twenty - five years ago on September 27 , 1983 , I announced a plan to create a completely free operating system called GNU — for ‘ GNU 's Not Unix ’ .
As part of the 25th anniversary of the GNU system , I have written this article on how our community can avoid ruinous compromises .
In addition to avoiding such compromises , there are many ways you can help GNU and free software .
One basic way is to join the Free Software Foundation as an Associate Member . ” — Richard Stallman
The free software movement aims for a social change : to make all software free so that all software users are free and can be part of a community of cooperation .
Every nonfree program gives its developer unjust power over the users .
Our goal is to put an end to that injustice .
The road to freedom is a long road .
It will take many steps and many years to reach a world in which it is normal for software users to have freedom .
Some of these steps are hard , and require sacrifice .
Some of them become easier if we make compromises with people that have different goals .
Thus , the Free Software Foundation makes compromises — even major ones .
For instance , we made compromises in the patent provisions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL ) so that major companies would contribute to and distribute GPLv3 - covered software and thus bring some patents under the effect of these provisions .
The Lesser GPL 's purpose is a compromise : we use it on certain chosen free libraries to permit their use in nonfree programs because we think that legally prohibiting this would only drive developers to proprietary libraries instead .
We accept and install code in GNU programs to make them work together with common nonfree programs , and we document and publicize this in ways that encourage users of the latter to install the former , but not vice versa .
We support specific campaigns we agree with , even when we do n't fully agree with the groups behind them .
But we reject certain compromises even though many others in our community are willing to make them .
For instance , we endorse only the GNU / Linux distributions that have policies not to include nonfree software or lead users to install it .
To endorse nonfree distributions would be a ruinous compromise .
Compromises are ruinous if they would work against our aims in the long term .
That can occur either at the level of ideas or at the level of actions .
At the level of ideas , ruinous compromises are those that reinforce the premises we seek to change .
Our goal is a world in which software users are free , but as yet most computer users do not even recognize freedom as an issue .
They have taken up “ consumer ” values , which means they judge any program only on practical characteristics such as price and convenience .
Dale Carnegie 's classic self - help book , How to Win Friends and Influence People , advises that the most effective way to persuade someone to do something is to present arguments that appeal to per values .
There are ways we can appeal to the consumer values typical in our society .
For instance , free software obtained gratis can save the user money .
Many free programs are convenient and reliable , too .
Citing those practical benefits has succeeded in persuading many users to adopt various free programs , some of which are now quite successful .
If getting more people to use some free programs is as far as you aim to go , you might decide to keep quiet about the concept of freedom , and focus only on the practical advantages that make sense in terms of consumer values .
That 's what the term “ open source ” and its associated rhetoric do .
That approach can get us only part way to the goal of freedom .
People who use free software only because it is convenient will stick with it only as long as it is more convenient .
And they will see no reason not to use convenient proprietary programs along with it .
The philosophy of open source presupposes and appeals to consumer values , and this affirms and reinforces them .
That 's why we do not advocate open source .
To establish a free community fully and lastingly , we need to do more than get people to use some free software .
We need to spread the idea of judging software ( and other things ) on “ citizen values ” , based on whether it respects users ' freedom and community , not just in terms of convenience .
Then people will not fall into the trap of a proprietary program baited by an attractive , convenient feature .
To promote citizen values , we have to talk about them and show how they are the basis of our actions .
We must reject the Dale Carnegie compromise that would influence their actions by endorsing their consumer values .
This is not to say we cannot cite practical advantage at all — we can and we do .
It becomes a problem only when the practical advantage steals the scene and pushes freedom into the background .
Therefore , when we cite the practical advantages of free software , we reiterate frequently that those are just additional , secondary reasons to prefer it .
It 's not enough to make our words accord with our ideals ; our actions have to accord with them too .
So we must also avoid compromises that involve doing or legitimizing the things we aim to stamp out .
For instance , experience shows that you can attract some users to GNU / Linux if you include some nonfree programs .
This could mean a cute nonfree application that will catch some user 's eye , or a nonfree programming platform such as Java ( formerly ) or the Flash runtime ( still ) , or a nonfree device driver that enables support for certain hardware models .
These compromises are tempting , but they undermine the goal .
If you distribute nonfree software , or steer people towards it , you will find it hard to say , “ Nonfree software is an injustice , a social problem , and we must put an end to it . ”
And even if you do continue to say those words , your actions will undermine them .
The issue here is not whether people should be able or allowed to install nonfree software ; a general - purpose system enables and allows users to do whatever they wish .
The issue is whether we guide users towards nonfree software .
What they do on their own is their responsibility ; what we do for them , and what we direct them towards , is ours .
We must not direct the users towards proprietary software as if it were a solution , because proprietary software is the problem .
A ruinous compromise is not just a bad influence on others .
It can distort your own values , too , through cognitive dissonance .
If you have certain values , but your actions imply other , conflicting values , you are likely to change your values or your actions so as to resolve the contradiction .
Thus , projects that argue only from practical advantages , or direct people toward some nonfree software , nearly always shy away from even suggesting that nonfree software is unethical .
For their participants , as well as for the public , they reinforce consumer values .
We must reject these compromises if we wish to keep our values straight .
If you want to move to free software without compromising the goal of freedom , look at the FSF 's resources area .
It lists hardware and machine configurations that work with free software , totally free GNU / Linux distros to install , and thousands of free software packages that work in a 100 percent free software environment .
If you want to help the community stay on the road to freedom , one important way is to publicly uphold citizen values .
When people are discussing what is good or bad , or what to do , cite the values of freedom and community and argue from them .
A road that lets you go faster is not better if it leads to the wrong place .
Compromise is essential to achieve an ambitious goal , but beware of compromises that lead away from the goal .

What has happened to the common sense of Americans ?
Has it completely gone down the drain with the propaganda of U.S. superiority ?
Do n’t they see the millions and millions of people who have died and are still dying across the world , due to U.S. empire illusions and the firmly established greed and power of the Big Corporations ?
Do n’t they see that the lone superpower as a taken - for - granted is a fiction ?
Yes , the United States was once a powerful nation , and a nation that people in the world looked up to , but it lost all its good points on the aggressive stand all over the world .
Its go - it - alone , we ’re - the - leaders - of - the - world mentality is the way this ‘ superpower ’ has been living it up at least since World War II .
The more it has been crushing and killing , the more it has lost its credibility in the world .
The more its corporations intruded on the sovereignty of other states , the faster did this country lose its favorable standing in the world .
And Americans themselves , how do they see the world at this point ?
From a distance it seems as if they are beginning to open their eyes .
One big BUT however .
The everyday American is not capable of giving up on his deeply indoctrinated faith that the United States is the greatest country in the world .
They ‘ know ’ that they are basically moral , highly civilized , good people who want to confer their way of life to the whole world since the rest of the world is so uncivilized , so poor , living in such precarious conditions .
There is no doubt in their minds that the United States is the foremost democracy in the world .
Since they do n’t know anything about the rest of the world , it ’s easy to propagandize them into believing just about anything you want to make them believe .
And besides , do n’t the every - two - year elections prove that they are the ones who select the leaders and so they have a voice in what ’s being done in their names ?
A majority of U.S. citizens are most certainly taken in by the belief that they participate in the running of the country .
It ’s doubtful if there are many Americans who see the National conventions that have just started as the fool ’s gold that they are .
The most expensive circus that ever was and that the people pay dearly for .
Just another Disney World to fool the people into believing that something important is going on and that they matter .
“ We do n’t have a moment to lose or a vote to spare , ” [ Hillary ] Clinton said .
“ Nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hangs in the balance . ” [ 1 ]
What is hanging in the balance is hard to see since both presidential candidates are saying pretty much the same things , except that their styles are different .
Ok , Obama / Hillary now say Healthcare for all , but that is to be seen once the corporations get into the game .
The arms manufacturers telling the new administration what they ‘ need ’ , the HMO ’s , the pharmaceutical industry , all the corporate giants telling them of their sine qua non .
Nothing so far has indicated in the least that either Hillary or Obama is against privatization or the free market .
Disaster capitalism , as Naomi Klein says , is the name of the system and democracy is the victim .
Regulation is a non-concept .
How can corporations develop and maximize profit if they are being regulated ?
Starve the people but do n’t you ever think of strangling the corporations that are making the world go round .
Profit is king and the people be damned .
So how do Americans see their country ’s criminal aggressions and the callous greed ?
First of all , greed is a good thing in the American credo .
God rewards the hard workers and the ones left behind have no reason to complain .
Socialism is a dirty word and welfare is only good when it ’s for the benefit of the Big Corporations .
Instead of seeing that the United States invades or buys every country that does not agree with their methods of running business , the gullible U.S. citizen is firmly convinced that the U.S. comes to the aid of every country when it is in trouble .
They support the evil dictator and things calm down .
Nobody ever lets them know that what the U.S. is doing is in the interest of its own global hegemony and that the indigenous people are beaten down and suffering even worse after the United States gets in on the side of the dictator .
For every social uprising in Central America , from the CIA - orchestrated coup in 1954 in Guatemala on through the Reagan years , the United States has intervened with an iron fist , bombing and killing , usually through mercenary death squads , until the leftist struggle for justice is totally crushed and the U.S. - supported dictatorship can go on doing the bidding of the Empire .
Inside the United States , the increasing inequality and vanishing civil rights are forcefully backed up by the Big Corporations who see that state of things as the only way of meeting their goal of ever increasing dividends to the shareholders and multi-million bonuses to the CEOs .
Furthermore , this is the way of life that is considered by them as the normal way of running the economy .
Ethics do not exist .
Those who were born to grab from the others will do so no matter what they were taught in Sunday school about doing good to their neighbor .
So why do n’t the U.S. governments try to rein in the greedy corporations ?
Because the corporations are the ones who run the show , who tell the so - called rulers what to do – in all countries more or less , not just in the United States .
The lawmakers and the heads of governments are all puppets dancing on strings , unless the so - called rulers actually have a foot in each camp .
They pretend to run the country but they are actually looking after the corporations they are tied to and their own interests .
In this last administration , this has been the case more than ever before .
It is certainly not in the interest of the ruling elite to give in to demands of fair treatment from the poor sections of society or even from the middle class .
Starving the beast is a prerequisite for controlling the populace , for setting the rules of the game .
A population that is ignorant , apathetic from tiredness and overwork , dumbed down from infotainment and antiseptic television shows – that is exactly what suits the greedy money makers .
No insurgency , since there ’s no energy left for such a thing as a fight for better conditions .
No knowledge about the rest of the world , and so Americans can go on believing that they are the best , no matter what the rest of the world might feel about that unquestioned rule of faith .
So the world does n’t love us any more .
It ’s because of the war in Iraq .
It ’s that simple .
Creeping totalitarianism , the people losing one civil right after the other , and their voices not being heard or paid attention to .
This is what has become of ‘ America the beautiful ’ .
And all the while through non -stop propaganda the citizens are made to believe that they live in a democracy .
In this police state there is no need to make Jews scrub the sidewalks .
There is no need for ostentatiously depriving a section of the population of their freedoms and making them the scapegoats .
Poverty will serve the purpose of creating a marginal group that can be exploited .
No need for arm bands with the star of David .
The poor people and in particular the immigrants have their backs sufficiently bent to serve the ever - existing need of a class to look down on .
In spite of the age - old history of racism in America , this is not a war on race , it ’s a class war , and it ’s getting more and more extreme .
The so - called free trade system , which is far from free , is only benefiting Big Money .
Desperate poverty has been increasing all over the world ever since the organizations that set the rules for the economies of third world countries promised to solve the crisis of hunger and poverty in the world .
In fact , what they were gearing up to do was finish off the plunder of the poor countries that depended on their high - interest loans .
You might well ask yourselves if this neocolonialism is not even more disastrous for the third - world countries than the former kind that was very gradually ended after World War II , at least in a legal sense .
9/11 was a windfall for the neocons since , whoever orchestrated it , it paved the way for the totalitarianism that we are now witnessing .
It made the invention of the ‘ war on terror ’ possible .
A war president can allow himself to commit aggression in the name of the people that would meet with violent protests in a peaceful era .
Fear is the ever efficient means of keeping a population under control .
Little did they see that the ambitions of the neocons went much farther than the invasion and occupation of Iraq and the control of its oil resources .
The aim was much higher .
To begin with they wanted control of the whole Greater Middle East .
Then what was going to follow was clearly control of the planet and possibly outer space .
However , it now seems obvious that their ambitions will be cut short , since other big powers are rearing their heads in different parts of the world .
Also the ‘ war on terror ’ has been proven to be a worn - out cliché , a nonsense word , mainly because all this so - called war is doing is increasing the resistance to the United States and its aggressive march across the world ’s continents .
Even the U.S. citizens are aware of this counter - effect .
So what the neocon regime is now aiming at is a renewal of the cold war .
Russia is going to be the enemy No.1 once again .
They make the people believe that things are calming down in the Middle East .
Iraq is moving towards a democracy , is what they try to make people believe .
What is happening in Afghanistan and Pakistan is hushed up .
They have the media on their side , which has of course been essential in winning the support of the people that they have had so far .
The question is now :
Will le capitalisme sauvage ( as the French say ) win the life or death game or will the people finally gather strength and a voice and manage to throw them out ?
To the corporations it ’s a game , to the people it ’s a matter of sheer survival .
All the ballyhoo about the American dream is just that and as for Bill Clinton ’s words about restor[ing ]
America ’s standing in the world [ 2 ] , that ’s for megalomaniacs and dreamers .
We will be lucky if the planet survives , and it will take the rising up of the people , a forceful attack on the prevailing corporate system by the people all over the world to make that happen .
The world is under attack from U.S. corporatism , ecology , economy , inequality , injustice , and it ’s not just American citizens who have to speak out and act out .
It ’s the people of the world .

Immigration , affirmative action , multilingualism , ethnic diversity -- my state of California pioneered these controversial policies , and it is now pioneering a backlash against them .
A glance into the classrooms of the Los Angeles public schools , where my sons are being educated , fleshes out the abstract debates with the faces of children .
Those pupils speak more than 80 languages in their homes ; English - speaking whites are in the minority .
Every single one of my sons ’ playmates has at least one parent or grandparent who was born outside the United States .
That ’s true of my sons also -- three of their four grandparents were immigrants to this country .
But the diversity that results from such immigration is n’t new to America .
In fact , immigration is simply restoring the diversity that existed here for thousands of years and that diminished only recently ; the area that now makes up the mainland United States , once home to hundreds of Native American tribes and languages , did not come under the control of a single government until the late nineteenth century .
In these respects , ours is a thoroughly normal country .
Like the United States , all but one of the world ’s six most populous nations are melting pots that achieved political unification recently and that still support hundreds of languages and ethnic groups .
Russia , for example , once a small Slavic state centered on Moscow , did not even begin its expansion beyond the Ural Mountains until 1582 .
From then until the late nineteenth century , Russia swallowed up dozens of non-Slavic peoples , many of whom , like the people of Chechnya today , retain their original language and cultural identity .
India , Indonesia , and Brazil are also recent political creations ( or re-creations , in the case of India ) and are home to about 850 , 703 , and 209 languages , respectively .
The great exception to this rule of the recent melting pot is the world ’s most populous nation , China .
Today China appears politically , culturally , and linguistically monolithic .
( For the purposes of this article , I exclude the linguistically and culturally distinct Tibet , which was also politically separate until recently . )
China was already unified politically in 221 B.C. and has remained so for most of the centuries since then .
From the beginnings of literacy in China over 3,000 years ago , it has had only a single writing system , unlike the dozens in use in modern Europe .
Of China ’s billion - plus people , over 700 million speak Mandarin , the language with by far the largest number of native speakers in the world .
Some 250 million other Chinese speak seven languages as similar to Mandarin and to each other as Spanish is to Italian .
Thus , while modern American history is the story of how our continent ’s expanse became American , and Russia ’s history is the story of how Russia became Russian , China ’s history appears to be entirely different .
It seems absurd to ask how China became Chinese .
China has been Chinese almost from the beginning of its recorded history .
We take this unity of China so much for granted that we forget how astonishing it is .
Certainly we should not have expected such unity on the basis of genetics .
While a coarse racial classification of world peoples lumps all Chinese people together as Mongoloids , that category conceals much more variation than is found among such ( equally ill - termed ) Caucasian peoples as Swedes , Italians , and Irish .
Northern and southern Chinese , in particular , are genetically and physically rather different from each other : northerners are most similar to Tibetans and Nepali , southerners to Vietnamese and Filipinos .
My northern and southern Chinese friends can often distinguish each other at a glance : northerners tend to be taller , heavier , paler , with more pointed noses and smaller eyes .
The existence of such differences is hardly surprising : northern and southern China differ in environment and climate , with the north drier and colder .
That such genetic differences arose between the peoples of these two regions simply implies a long history of their moderate isolation from each other .
But if such isolation existed , then how did these peoples end up with such similar languages and cultures ?
China ’s linguistic near - unity is also puzzling in comparison with the linguistic disunity of other parts of the world .
For instance , New Guinea , although it was first settled by humans only about 40,000 years ago , evolved roughly 1,000 languages .
Western Europe has by now about 40 native languages acquired just in the past 6,000 to 8,000 years , including languages as different as English , Finnish , and Russian .
Yet New Guinea ’s peoples are spread over an area less than one - tenth that of China’s .
And fossils attest to human presence in China for hundreds of thousands of years .
By rights , tens of thousands of distinct languages should have arisen in China ’s large area over that long time span ; what has happened to them ?
China too must once have been a melting pot of diversity , as all other populous nations still are .
It differs from them only in having been unified much earlier : in that huge pot , the melting happened long ago .
A glance at a linguistic map is an eye - opener to all of us accustomed to thinking of China as monolithic .
In addition to its eight big languages -- Mandarin and its seven close relatives ( often referred to collectively as Chinese ) , with between 11 million and 700 million speakers each -- China also has some 160 smaller languages , many of them with just a few thousand speakers .
All these languages fall into four families , which differ greatly in their distributions .
At one extreme , Mandarin and its relatives , which constitute the Chinese subfamily of the Sino - Tibetan language family , are distributed continuously from the top of the country to the bottom .
One distinctive feature of all Sino - Tibetan languages is that most words consist of a single syllable , like English it or book ; long , polysyllabic words are unthinkable .
One could walk through China , from Manchuria in the north to the Gulf of Tonkin in the south , without ever stepping off land occupied by native speakers of Chinese .
The other three families have broken distributions , being spoken by islands of people surrounded by a sea of speakers of Chinese and other languages .
The 6 million speakers of the Miao - Yao family are divided among five languages , bearing colorful names derived from the characteristic colors of the speakers ’ clothing : Red Miao , White Miao ( alias Striped Miao ) , Black Miao , Green Miao ( alias Blue Miao ) , and Yao .
Miao - Yao speakers live in dozens of small enclaves scattered over half a million square miles from southern China to Thailand .
The 60 million speakers of languages in the Austroasiatic family , such as Vietnamese and Cambodian , are also scattered across the map , from Vietnam in the east to the Malay Peninsula in the south to northeastern India in the west .
Austroasiatic languages are characterized by an enormous proliferation of vowels , which can be nasal or nonnasal , long or extrashort , creaky , breathy , or normal , produced with the tongue high , medium high , medium low , or low , and with the front , center , or back of the tongue .
All these choices combine to yield up to 41 distinctive vowel sounds per language , in contrast to the mere dozen or so of English .
The 50 million speakers of China ’s fourth language family , Tai- Kadai , are scattered from southern China southward into peninsular Thailand and west to Myanmar ( Burma ) .
In Tai -Kadai languages , as in most Sino - Tibetan languages , a single word may have different meanings depending on its tone , or pitch .
For example , in Thai itself the syllable maa means horse when pronounced at a high pitch , come at a medium pitch , and dog at a rising pitch .
Seen on a map , the current fragmented distribution of these language groups suggests a series of ancient helicopter flights that dropped speakers here and there over the Asian landscape .
But of course nothing like that could have happened , and the actual process was subtractive rather than additive .
Speakers of the now dominant language expanded their territory and displaced original residents or induced them to abandon their native tongues .
The ancestors of modern speakers of Thai and Laotian , and possibly Cambodian and Burmese as well , all moved south from southern China and adjacent areas to their present locations within historical times , successively inundating the settled descendants of previous migrations .
Chinese speakers were especially vigorous in replacing and linguistically converting other ethnic groups , whom they looked down on as primitive and inferior .
The recorded history of China ’s Chou Dynasty , from 1111 B.C. to 256 B.C. , describes the conquest and absorption of most of China ’s non-Chinese - speaking population by Chinese - speaking states .
Before those relatively recent migrations , who spoke what where ?
To reconstruct the linguistic map of the East Asia of several thousand years ago , we can reverse the historically known linguistic expansions of recent millennia .
We can also look for large , continuous areas currently occupied by a single language or related language group ; these areas testify to a geographic expansion of that group so recent that there has not been enough time for it to differentiate into many languages .
Finally , we can reason conversely that modern areas with a high diversity of languages within a given language family lie closer to the early center of distribution of that language family .
Using those three types of reasoning to turn back the linguistic clock , we conclude that speakers of Chinese and other Sino - Tibetan languages originally occupied northern China .
The southern parts of the country were variously inhabited by speakers of Miao - Yao , Austroasiatic , and Tai - Kadai languages -- until they were largely replaced by their Sino - Tibetan - speaking neighbors .
An even more drastic linguistic upheaval appears to have swept over tropical Southeast Asia to the south of China , in Thailand , Myanmar , Laos , Cambodia , Vietnam , and peninsular Malaysia .
It ’s likely that whatever languages were originally spoken there have now become extinct -- most of the modern languages of those countries appear to be recent invaders , mainly from southern China .
We might also guess that if Miao - Yao languages could be so nearly overwhelmed , there must have been still other language families in southern China that left no modern descendants whatsoever .
As we shall see , the Austronesian family ( to which all Philippine and Polynesian languages belong ) was probably once spoken on the Chinese mainland .
We know about it only because it spread to Pacific islands and survived there .
The language replacements in East Asia are reminiscent of the way European languages , especially English and Spanish , spread into the New World .
English , of course , came to replace the hundreds of Native American languages not because it sounded musical to indigenous ears but because English - speaking invaders killed most Native Americans by war , murder , and disease and then pressured the survivors into adopting the new majority language .
The immediate cause of the Europeans ’ success was their relative technological superiority .
That superiority , however , was ultimately the result of a geographic accident that allowed agriculture and herding to develop in Eurasia 10,000 years earlier .
The consequent explosion in population allowed the Europeans to develop complex technologies and social organization , giving their descendants great political and technological advantages over the people they conquered .
Essentially the same processes account for why English replaced aboriginal Australian languages and why Bantu languages replaced subequatorial Africa ’s original Pygmy and Khoisan languages .
East Asia ’s linguistic upheavals thus hint that some Asians enjoyed similar advantages over other Asians .
But to flesh out the details of that story , we must turn from linguistics to archeology .
As everywhere else in the world , the eastern Asian archeological record for most of human history reveals only the debris of hunter - gatherers using unpolished stone tools .
The first eastern Asian evidence for something different comes from China , where crop remains , bones of domestic animals , pottery , and polished stone tools appear by around 7500 B.C.
That ’s no more than a thousand years after the beginnings of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent , the area with the oldest established food production in the world .
In China plant and animal domestication may even have started independently in two or more places .
Besides differences in climate between north and south , there are also ecological differences between the interior uplands ( which are characterized by mountains like our Appalachians ) and the coastal lowlands ( which are flat and threaded with rivers , like the Carolinas ) .
Incipient farmers in each area would have had different wild plants and animals to draw on .
In fact , the earliest identified crops were two drought - resistant species of millet in northern China , but rice in the south .
The same sites that provided us with the earliest evidence of crops also contained bones of domestic pigs , dogs , and chickens -- a livestock trinity that later spread as far as Polynesia .
These animals and crops were gradually joined by China ’s many other domesticates .
Among the animals were water buffalo ( the most important , since they were used for pulling plows ) , as well as silkworms , ducks , and geese .
Familiar later Chinese crops include soybeans , hemp , tea , apricots , pears , peaches , and citrus fruits .
Many of these domesticated animals and crops spread westward in ancient times from China to the Fertile Crescent and Europe ; at the same time , Fertile Crescent domesticates spread eastward to China .
Especially significant western contributions to ancient China ’s economy were wheat and barley , cows and horses , and to a lesser extent , sheep and goats .
As elsewhere in the world , food production in China gradually led to the other hallmarks of civilization .
A superb Chinese tradition of bronze metallurgy arose around 3000 B.C. , allowing China to develop by far the earliest cast iron production in the world by 500 B.C.
The following 1,500 years saw the outpouring of a long list of Chinese inventions : canal lock gates , deep drilling , efficient animal harnesses , gunpowder , kites , magnetic compasses , paper , porcelain , printing , sternpost rudders , and wheelbarrows , to name just a few .
China ’s size and ecological diversity initially spawned many separate local cultures .
In the fourth millennium B.C. those local cultures expanded geographically and began to interact , compete with each other , and coalesce .
Fortified towns appeared in China in the third millennium B.C. , with cemeteries containing luxuriously decorated graves juxtaposed with simpler ones - - a clear sign of emerging class differences .
China became home to stratified societies with rulers who could mobilize a large labor force of commoners , as we can infer from the remains of huge urban defensive walls , palaces , and the Grand Canal -- the longest canal in the world -- linking northern and southern China .
Writing unmistakably ancestral to that of modern China is preserved from the second millennium B.C. , though it probably arose earlier .
The first of China ’s dynasties , the Hsia Dynasty , arose around 2000 B.C.
Thereafter , our archeological knowledge of China ’s emerging cities and states becomes supplemented by written accounts .
Along with rice cultivation and writing , a distinctively Chinese method for reading the future also begins to appear persistently in the archeological record , and it too attests to China ’s cultural coalescence .
In place of crystal balls and Delphic oracles , China turned to scapulimancy -- burning the scapula ( shoulder bone ) or other large bone of an animal , such as a cow , then prophesying from the pattern of cracks in the burned bone .
From the earliest known appearance of oracle bones in northern China , archeologists have traced scapulimancy ’s spread throughout China ’s cultural sphere .
Just as exchanges of domesticates between ecologically diverse regions enriched Chinese food production , exchanges between culturally diverse regions enriched Chinese culture and technology , and fierce competition between warring chiefdoms drove the formation of ever larger and more centralized states .
China ’s long west - east rivers ( the Yellow River in the north , the Yangtze in the south ) allowed crops and technology to spread quickly between inland and coast , while their diffusion north and south was made easy by the broad , relatively gentle terrain north of the Yangtze , which eventually permitted the two river systems to be joined by canals .
All those geographic factors contributed to the early cultural and political unification of China .
In contrast , western Europe , with an area comparable to China ’s but fragmented by mountains such as the Alps , and with a highly indented coastline and no such rivers , has never been unified politically .
Some developments spread from south to north in China , especially iron smelting and rice cultivation .
But the predominant direction of spread seems to have been the other way .
From northern China came bronze technology , Sino - Tibetan languages , and state formation .
The country ’s first three dynasties ( the Hsia , Shang , and Chou ) all arose in the north in the second millennium B.C.
The northern dominance is clearest , however , for writing .
Unlike western Eurasia , with its plethora of early methods for recording language , including Sumerian cuneiform , Egyptian hieroglyphics , Hittite , Minoan , and the Semitic alphabet , China developed just one writing system .
It arose in the north , preempted or replaced any other nascent system , and evolved into the writing used today .
Preserved documents show that already in the first millennium B.C. ethnic Chinese tended to feel culturally superior to non-Chinese barbarians , and northern Chinese considered even southern Chinese barbarians .
For example , a late Chou Dynasty writer described China ’s other peoples as follows :
The people of those five regions -- the Middle states and the Jung , Yi , and other wild tribes around them -- had all their several natures , which they could not be made to alter .
The tribes on the east were called Yi . They had their hair unbound , and tattooed their bodies .
Some of them ate their food without its being cooked by fire .
The author went on to describe wild tribes to the south , west , and north indulging in equally barbaric practices , such as turning their feet inward , tattooing their foreheads , wearing skins , living in caves , not eating cereals , and , again , eating their food raw .
States modeled on the Chou Dynasty were organized in southern China during the first millennium B.C. , culminating in China ’s political unification under the Chin Dynasty in 221 B.C. China ’s cultural unification accelerated during that same period , as literate civilized Chinese states absorbed or were copied by the preliterate barbarians .
Some of that cultural unification was ferocious : for instance , the first Chin emperor condemned all previously written historical books as worthless and ordered them burned , much to the detriment of our understanding of early Chinese history .
That and other draconian measures must have helped spread northern China ’s Sino - Tibetan languages over most of China .
Chinese innovations contributed heavily to developments in neighboring regions as well .
For instance , until roughly 4000 B.C. most of tropical Southeast Asia was still occupied by hunter - gatherers making pebble and flake stone tools .
Thereafter , Chinese - derived crops , polished stone tools , village living , and pottery spread into the area , probably accompanied by southern Chinese language families .
The southward expansions from southern China of Laotians , Thai , and Vietnamese , and probably Burmese and Cambodians also , completed the Sinification of tropical Southeast Asia .
All those modern peoples appear to be recent offshoots of their southern Chinese cousins .
So overwhelming was this Chinese steamroller that the former peoples of the region have left behind few traces in the modern populations .
Just three relict groups of hunter - gatherers -- the Semang Negritos of the Malay Peninsula , the Andaman Islanders , and the Veddoid Negritos of Sri Lanka - - remain to give us any clue as to what those peoples were like .
They suggest that tropical Southeast Asia ’s former inhabitants may have had dark skin and curly hair , like modern New Guineans and unlike southern Chinese and modern tropical Southeast Asians .
Those people may also be the last survivors of the source population from which New Guinea and aboriginal Australia were colonized .
As to their speech , only on the remote Andaman Islands do languages unrelated to the southern Chinese language families persist -- perhaps the last linguistic survivors of what may have been hundreds of now extinct aboriginal Southeast Asian languages .
While one prong of the Chinese expansion thus headed southwest into Indochina and Myanmar , another headed southeast into the Pacific Ocean .
Part of the evidence suggesting this scenario comes from genetics and linguistics : the modern inhabitants of Indonesia and the Philippines are fairly homogeneous in their genes and appearance and resemble southern Chinese .
Their languages are also homogeneous , almost all belonging to a closely knit family called Austronesian , possibly related to Tai - Kadai .
But just as in tropical Southeast Asia , the archeological record in the Pacific shows more direct evidence of the Chinese steamroller .
Until 6,000 years ago , Indonesia and the Philippines were sparsely occupied by hunter - gatherers .
Beginning in the fourth or fifth millennium B.C. , pottery and stone tools of unmistakably southern Chinese origins appear on the island of Taiwan , which is in the straits between the southern Chinese coast and the Philippines .
Around 3000 B.C. that same combination of technological advances spread as a wave to the Philippines , then throughout the islands of Indonesia , accompanied by gardening and by China ’s livestock trinity ( pigs , chickens , and dogs ) .
Around 1600 B.C. the wave reached the islands north of New Guinea , then spread eastward through the previously uninhabited islands of Polynesia .
By 500 A.D. the Polynesians , an Austronesian - speaking people of ultimately Chinese origin , had reached Easter Island , 10,000 miles from the Chinese coast .
With Polynesian settlement of Hawaii and New Zealand around the same time or soon thereafter , ancient China ’s occupation of the Pacific was complete .
Throughout most of Indonesia and the Philippines , the Austronesian expansion obliterated the region ’s former inhabitants .
Scattered bands of hunter - gatherers were no match for the tools , weapons , numbers , subsistence methods , and probably also germs carried by the invading Austronesian farmers .
Only the Negrito Pygmies in the mountains of Luzon and some other Philippine islands appear to represent survivors of those former hunter - gatherers , but they too lost their original tongues and adopted Austronesian languages from their new neighbors .
However , on New Guinea and adjacent islands , indigenous people had already developed agriculture and built up numbers sufficient to keep out the Austronesian invaders .
Their languages , genes , and faces live on in modern New Guineans and Melanesians .
Even Korea and Japan were heavily influenced by China , although their geographic isolation from the mainland saved them from losing their languages or physical and genetic distinctness .
Korea and Japan adopted rice from China in the second millennium B.C. , bronze metallurgy in the first millennium B.C. , and writing in the first or early second millennium A.D .
Not all cultural advances in East Asia stemmed from China , of course , nor were Koreans , Japanese , and tropical Southeast Asians noninventive barbarians who contributed nothing .
The ancient Japanese developed pottery at least as early as the Chinese did , and they settled in villages subsisting on Japan ’s rich seafood resources long before the arrival of agriculture .
Some crops were probably domesticated initially or independently in Japan , Korea , and tropical Southeast Asia .
But China ’s role was still disproportionately large .
Indeed , the influence of Chinese culture is still so great that Japan has no thought of discarding its Chinese - derived writing system despite its disadvantages for representing Japanese speech , while Korea is only now replacing its clumsy Chinese - derived writing with its wonderful indigenous Hangul alphabet .
The persistence of Chinese writing in Japan and Korea is a vivid twentieth - century legacy of plant and animal domestication that began in China 10,000 years ago .
From those achievements of East Asia ’s first farmers , China became Chinese , and peoples from Thailand to Easter Island became their cousins .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
On the day of the first public discussion between lawmakers and the administration about the Treasury 's $ 700 billion financial rescue proposal , the debate is being framed by a few key issues .
Lawmakers from both parties , while acknowledging the urgency of the moment , nevertheless object to giving what they characterize as a " blank check " to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to buy troubled assets from financial institutions .
They want provisions that would explicitly protect taxpayers .
" We do n't have a lot of time .
We want to act but we want to act responsibly , " said Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd , D - Conn . , at a press briefing Monday afternoon .
Dodd 's committee will hold a hearing on the bailout on Tuesday morning .
The House Financial Services Committee will do the same on Wednesday .
Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke are scheduled to testify at both hearings .
Many lawmakers seem to be on board with giving Paulson the authority he seeks , but they want to add a few provisions .
Senate Democrats circulated a counter proposal on Monday that would require the government to receive an ownership stake in the companies it helps .
The proposal , offered up by Dodd , would require companies who sell assets to Uncle Sam to give the government shares in the company , according to a draft obtained by CNN .
The Senate Democrats ' proposal would also require the government to come up with " a systematic approach for preventing foreclosures and ensuring long - term , sustainable homeownership through loan modifications and use of the HOPE for Homeowners Program " on the mortgages it buys in the bailout .
The Dodd proposal calls for curbs on executive compensation and a change to federal law so that judges can modify a bankruptcy filer 's primary residence mortgage .
Under current law , judges may only modify loans on second homes .
The lending industry has strongly opposed such a provision .
Lastly , the Dodd proposal would terminate Treasury 's special authority to buy up troubled assets by Dec. 31 , 2009 .
By contrast , the Treasury 's proposal calls for termination two years from the date of enactment .
In a briefing with reporters on Monday , House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank , D - Mass . , said he is finalizing a counter - proposal and that his plan is " very close " to Dodd's .
Meanwhile , the Bush administration is pushing for a " clean " bill to be passed quickly and not be loaded up with provisions that would deter companies from participating .
" [ T ] he whole world is watching to see if we can act quickly to shore up our markets and prevent damage to our capital markets , businesses , our housing sector , and retirement accounts , " President Bush said .
At the same time that congressional leaders are seeking provisions to protect taxpayers and troubled borrowers , financial institutions are weighing in with what they want in the bill .
On Sunday , the Financial Services Roundtable - a lobbying group representing the nation 's banks - called on Congress to make the plan " broad enough to include different types of assets . "
The Treasury has amended its original request to give it authority to buy up not just troubled mortgage assets , but troubled assets period .
" Removing troubled assets will begin to restore the strength of our financial system so it can again finance economic growth , " according to a statement on the Treasury Web site .
Historically significant time
The proposals being debated are the centerpiece of what would be the most sweeping economic intervention by the government since the Great Depression .
Paulson , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and other officials have said in recent days that the lack of easy credit between banks and other financial institutions threatens to inflict serious damage on the economy if not addressed immediately .
The plan would allow the Treasury to buy up troubled assets from U.S. - based companies and foreign firms with big U.S. operations .
The aim is for the government to buy the securities at a discount , hold onto them and then sell them for a profit .
Experts liken the Treasury 's plan to the Home Owners ' Loan Corp. , put in place in 1933 to stem foreclosures and help refinance defaulting mortgages and boost banks ' liquidity .
The mortgage plan is part of an extraordinary effort by the federal government to contain a financial crisis that has forced a major realignment on Wall Street and has started rippling out to Main Street .
Given the magnitude of the Treasury 's request and its long - term ramifications , lawmakers want to spend at least a little time debating the issues .
And one key lawmaker , Richard Shelby , R - Ala. , the top- ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , indicated in a statement Monday that he's not going to be pressured into passing something that he fundamentally disagrees with .
" In my judgment , " Shelby said , " it would be foolish to waste massive sums of taxpayer funds testing an idea that has been hastily crafted , and may actually cause the government to revert to an inadequate strategy of ad hoc bailouts . "
- CNN producers Deirdre Walsh , Ted Barrett and Steve Turnham contributed to this report .
The Amarok team is proud to announce the second alpha version of Amarok 2 , codenamed Aulanerk .
We have spent many sleepless nights resolving issues and polishing features since the first alpha was released .
It was n't just for fun though ;-)
We want the 2.0 release to be the best ever .
A big thank you to everyone who helped us by reporting bugs , sending patches and giving useful feedback .
Without you we would not have come this far in the short time since the first alpha !
Keep it coming .
It is also nice to see that many people enjoy the result of our work already and can see where we want to go with Amarok 2 .
Thanks for all the kind reviews of alpha 1 .
It 's always a pleasure to read something like that .
One of the most frustrating things in this election campaign has been the constant stream of totally false smears against Obama .
Even more frustrating is when those smears end up being believed by members of your own own family .
My mother has forwarded several e-mails to me about Obama , including the one claiming that Obama refuses to say the Pledge of Allegiance ( which is laughable , seeing as he has led the pledge in the Senate several times ) , and others claiming he is Muslim and a " Manchurian candidate . "
On each occasion , I have presented the facts and refuted the lies .
Last night , she forwarded this e-mail to me :
Chris ,
Please check this out and let me know if he really did vote against the live abortion birth bill .

The video accuses Obama of supporting " infanticide " because of votes he cast as an Illinois state senator .
The woman in the video is Jill Stanek , a nurse in the Chicago area who was a main proponent of the federal " born alive " measure and writes an anti-abortion blog .
She is also the person who claimed that babies born alive in botched abortions were being thrown into a " soiled utility closet " and left to die at the hospital where she worked .
To me , this is the worst smear that has been levied against Obama , or any presidential candidate in any election in the history of the country .
Karl Rove 's disgusting " John McCain fathered an illegitimate black baby " smear can't even compare to this .
Not even close .
I love my mom .
She is a decent , kind human being and a good mother who has overcome more than her share of hardships .
I was happy to see that instead of believing this nonsense right away , she wrote to me in the hope that I might be able to find out the truth behind the smear .
But I suspect that many of us are in the position of having to refute the lies that members of our families have been told .
It 's a difficult thing to do when there are so many lies out there , and the same lies are repeated by so many different sources .
Most of the time , their belief that the lies are true is n't really even due to any fault of their own , because they are backed up by plenty of falsified " evidence , " like the picture of Barack Obama in a turban , or standing on a stage without his hand over his heart .
What can we do to defeat these despicable lies by unprincipled , and many times racist rumor mongers without alienating the people we love , and know to be good people , but who have been fed a steady diet of internet lies and mainstream " news " falsehoods ?
Below is my letter to my mother :
Mom ,
It 's just another baseless smear by the same people that still insist that he 's Muslim ; that he was born in another country ; that his birth certificate is a forgery ; that he wo n't say the Pledge of Allegiance ; that he hates the American flag ; that he hates Americans and America itself , and he even hates Americans who hate America because Americans hate the American flag -- in America .
Here 's what really happened :
When Obama was an Illinois state senator , a bill was introduced by Republicans that included language protecting infants who were " born alive . "
Of course Obama believes , just like you and I , that those infants should be protected .
But the bill went further than that , and included other restrictions that would seriously undermine Roe v. Wade .
There were many Illinois state legislators who opposed the bill because " the legislation amounted to an illegal end run around Roe v. Wade . "
Even the Illinois State Medical society opposed the bill , as reported by the New York Times :
The Illinois State Medical Society , which also fought the legislation and was cited by Mr. Obama on Saturday in his defense of his position , said in a statement that it opposed the package of bills , first introduced in 2001 , “ because they interfered negatively with the physician - patient relationship , attempted to dictate the practice of medicine for neonatal care and greatly expanded civil liability for physicians . ”

Campaigns shout it out
So much for nuance , or elevating the dialogue .
Locked in a political death match with 52 days to live , the presidential campaigns went nuclear on what looked to be a quiet Saturday , with stumping curtailed because of Hurricane Ike 's catastrophic overnight hit on Houston .

Sen . Barack Obama 's national press secretary , Bill Burton , accused Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) of " cynically running the sleaziest and least honorable campaign in modern presidential campaign history .
His discredited ads with disgusting lies are running all over the country today .
He runs a campaign not worthy of the office he is seeking . "
That was prompted by a McCain campaign statement about remarks Obama ( D - Ill. ) made in Manchester , N.H. , on Saturday morning .
McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds thundered by e-mail : " During the event , Barack Obama showed zero restraint in the ferocity of his attacks despite the wreckage in the gulf and his running mate ’s cancellation in reaction to it .
" It says a lot about Barack Obama ’s judgment that while his campaign canceled his appearance on ' Saturday Night Live ' and his running mate stayed home , Obama went ahead and delivered a series of scathing personal attacks .
Today ’s attacks mark a new low from Barack Obama . ”
These people truly are the dumbest of the dumb .
The man produced a bottle of beer and smashed her hand with it three times before Mr Fawcett managed to intervene and he ran off saying he was going to get a sword to kill them .
Wuala
Scatter brains
IF YOU have lots of unused storage space on your hard disk , then why not share it with others on the internet ?
The benefit could be distributed storage for your own files , making them available any time via the web , even if you are nowhere near your computer — indeed , even if your computer is switched off .
That desideratum is what a Zurich - based firm called Caleido is aiming to provide , with a free online storage service known as Wuala that was recently introduced to the public .
Though the idea underlying it is simple , Wuala requires some nifty technology to make its distributed system work reliably .
In particular , its developers , Dominik Grolimund and Luzius Meisser , have used a clever mathematical trick to compensate for the fact that the participating computers will come and go from the internet in an unpredictable way .
The challenge is how to minimise the number of copies of the same file that have to be distributed .
Copying costs participants both storage space and bandwidth .
Yet there have to be enough copies to ensure that there is at least one available most of the time .
If , for example , each computer is online 25 % of the time , then a quick calculation shows that you would have to copy each file to 100 different computers to ensure that 999,999 times out of a million there is at least one copy available when a user looks .
But copying every file a hundred times is hugely inefficient .
Instead , Mr Grolimund and Mr Meisser plan to break each file into chunks , which can be scattered liberally around the hard disks of participating computers , and then to use a mathematical trick to reconstruct the original file from those chunks .
This trick , known as Reed - Solomon error correction , is employed routinely to interpret the data on DVDs , but it has not been used before in the volatile world of private computers on the internet .
The first step is to convert the file ( which is , regardless of what it represents , simply a long string of ones and zeros ) into a mathematical function called a polynomial .
This is done by splitting it into 100 fragments , which are smaller binary numbers .
It is these numbers that are used to define the polynomial .
One of the characteristics of a polynomial is that a few numbers can nail it down precisely .
If a simple polynomial is plotted out on a graph it forms a line .
A straight line ( the simplest type of polynomial ) is defined by any two points on its length .
A parabola can be defined by three points .
The polynomials that Wuala generates can be defined by 100 points — though , because the polynomials used are not simple ones , these points are complex mathematical constructs , rather than straightforward numbers .
All you have to do now , therefore , is select a suitable number of points from along the polynomial ( these need not be the original ones ) and convert their values into the appropriate mathematical constructs .
Scatter these around the host computers and , when someone wants to look at the file , he need recover only 100 of them to have enough data to reconstruct the file from scratch .
To have 100 points available 999,999 times out of a million it turns out that you need to scatter a total of 600 of them around .
That is an amount of data equivalent to six versions of the original file , rather than the 100 that would be needed to achieve the same level of reliability if whole files were being stored .
Moreover , the system needs the computers linked to it to be available for only 17 % of the time , rather than 25 % , for this to apply .
Online storage is a growing market , especially for backing up data , where reliability is a big concern .
Most commercial online - storage services use centralised servers .
Although these are generally reliable , they do sometimes fail .
And when they do , the results are embarrassing — as Amazon , an online shopping company , learnt on two occasions this year when the servers for its commercial data - storage system went down for several hours at a time .
Though some people may feel squeamish about scattering their data over hundreds of other computers ( even though it will be encrypted ) , or storing unknown file fragments on their own , Mr Grolimund is adamant that Caleido has learnt from other “ peer - to - peer ” file - sharing systems , and that Wuala is built to handle concerns about the illegal distribution of copyrighted or “ inappropriate ” content .
If he is right , Wuala may prove that , for online data storage , it is as good to give as it is to receive .
As Think Progress reported yesterday , the full blown descent into McCarthyism within the Republican Party continues .
This time , it 's Rep. Robin Hayes of North Carolina .
At a McCain event , trying to energize the crowd , Hayes dug deep into his blackened soul and said the following :
Representative Robin Hayes , who prefaced his comments by saying it was important to “ make sure we do n’t say something stupid , make sure we do n’t say something we do n’t mean . ”
Republicans , he reminded the crowd , were kind people .
Plus , he added , the liberal media had shown itself eager to distort such remarks .
With the crowd duly chastened and put on best behavior , he accused Obama of “ inciting class warfare ” and said that “ liberals hate real Americans that work and achieve and believe in God . ”
Good to know he was trying to keep from saying something stupid .
Of course , when confronted , Hayes denied it .
Gosh , I guess that makes having the audio a little troublesome for such a bald - faced liar .
By the way , this is n't the first time Robin Hayes has said some monumentally stupid things .
He 's the representative that was still insisting as late as 2005 that Saddam Hussein had something to do with 9/11 and that the best thing we could do in Iraq to ensure " victory " is to convert them all Muslims to Christianity .
Blue America candidate Larry Kissell is running against Robin Hayes .

Diablo 3 Color Controversy Revisited , See Diablo 3 Desaturated in Action
In Blizzard 's previous judgments of darker fan renderings , Diablo III designer Jay Wilson stressed that desaturated color made it more difficult to identify on - screen objects and therefore reduced the ease of play .
The author of the video below feels that he addresses these concerns while still giving the game a " darker " ambiance .
Wilson also noted that some other fan renderings sported effects that certainly looked pretty , but are n't possible in the current engine .

Steve 's
Take :
At this point it is really just getting painful , but for all the nerds in a huff over this stuff , finally seeing the game in motion with these alleged color " improvements " was worth a look .
Diablo 2 , which came out about a decade ago , actually has gamma and brightness controls within the video menus .
So you can tell even back then Blizzard was dealing with color issues with the franchise .
Probably more due to inconsistency in color reproduction of CRTs back then , but they were aware of it and addressed it .
It really would n't be terribly surprising to see one or two other video options in Diablo 3 .
Yesterday , the Department of Justice delivered a letter to Senators Specter and Leahy , blasting S.3325 , the " Enforcement of Intellectual Property Right Act of 2008 . "
In the letter , the DoJ echoes , almost exactly , the concerns that EFF and other public interest groups have had for months :
We strongly oppose Title I of the bill , which not only authorizes the Attorney General to pursue civil remedies for copyright infringement , but to secure " restitution " damages and remit them to the private owners of infringed copyrights .
First , civil copyright enforcement has always been the responsibility and prerogative of private copyright holders , and U.S. law already provides them with effective legal tools to protect their rights ....
Second , Title 1's departure from the settled framework above could result in Department of Justice prosecutors serving as pro bono lawyers for private copyright holders regardless of their resources .
In effect , taxpayer - supported Department lawyers would pursue lawsuits for copyright holders , with monetary recovery going to industry .
Third , the Department of Justice has limited resources to dedicate to particular issues , and civil enforcement actions would occur at the expense of criminal actions , which only the Department of Justice may bring .
In an era of fiscal responsibility , the resources of the Department of Justice should be used for the public benefit , not on behalf of particular industries that can avail themselves of the existing civil enforcement provisions .
Unfortunately , pressed by the entertainment industry , the Judiciary Committee has already approved S.3325 , and the measure has been " hotlined " for speedy passage by unanimous consent .
Let 's hope that Congress , even if it wo n't listen to the public interest community , will listen when the Department of Justice itself says this is bad legislation .
UPDATE : Congress listens !
At the request of Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon , the civil enforcement provisions have been stripped out of S.3325 :
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) - General Motors Corp. shares , already reeling from the widening credit crisis that has crippled Wall Street , fell as much as 33 % on Thursday , dropping to levels last seen in the springtime of 1950 .
To put the current price tag in perspective , the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % , of which GM GM , - 2.37 % is a component , was trading at a mere 210 points back then .
In fact , the last time GM traded at around $ 4.65 a share , a typical car sold for just over $ 3,000 , gasoline cost 20 cents a gallon , a six - pack of Coke could be yours for 37 cents , and houses went for $ 16,000 .
GM finally finished down $ 2.15 at $ 4.76 while rival Ford Motor Co. F , - 1.34 % fared only slightly better , off 22 % at $ 2.08 .
David Healy , an analyst at Burnham securities , said that the stock has been overreacting to the all the negative headlines lately .
" Things will get worse before they get better , " he said .
" But this company will get through a few more bad years and survive .
This is not a stock for widows and orphans . "
The latest bit of bearish news comes from one area of the company that had been a silver lining at a time of sluggish sales in GM 's home market .
“ " We are facing an unprecedented set of economic challenges due to the global economic crisis . " ” — Carl - Peter Forster , president of GM Europe
GM 's total European sales volume fell 1.9 % to 1.62 million cars and trucks through the first three quarters of the year .
A strong showing in Eastern Europe , paced by record results from the Chevy brand , was offset by a 10.7 % drop in Western Europe .
The same factors that have slammed GM's U.S. sales are now stinging results in Western Europe , where a weakening economy , high gas prices and soaring raw material costs have made for an extremely difficult time to sell cars and turn profits .
" We are facing an unprecedented set of economic challenges due to the global economic crisis , " Carl - Peter Forster , president of GM Europe , said in a statement .
" The credit crisis and inflation from surging oil and commodities prices have seriously hurt consumer confidence . "
Still , the biggest challenges clearly remain in the core U.S. market , as potential car buyers continue to grapple with slumping home prices and the inability to tap credit .
GM vehicle sales fell 15.6 % to 282,806 cars and trucks in September , which was actually better than most thanks to aggressive incentive spending .
The overall industry endured a 26 % drop a year ago , making for the eleventh straight month of declines and the first time since February 1993 that the total number dropped below one million .
See full story .
J.D. Power and Associates fanned the selling flames on Thursday when it forecast total new light - vehicle sales in the U.S. of 13.6 million cars and trucks , down 16 % from 16.1 million a year ago .
The firm now sees 2009 sales dropping to 13.2 million vehicles .
" Buyers are both voluntarily and involuntarily exiting the U.S. new - vehicle market , " analyst Jeff Schuster said in a note .
The pain will move outside the U.S. as well , he added , explaining that the global auto market " may experience an outright collapse " in 2009 .
Separately , Standard & Poor 's Ratings Services placed GM 's debt on CreditWatch with negative implications , meaning the automaker 's credit , which is already in junk territory , could face another downgrade .
The move " reflects the rapidly weakening state of most global automotive markets , along with capital market conditions that will remain a serious challenge for the foreseeable future , " credit analyst Robert Schulz said .
We often get emails at Libertarian Party headquarters asking what exactly are the differences between the Libertarian Party and the Constitution Party .
The confusion is understandable , especially for party outsiders who are just beginning to look at either as a new political home .
On the surface , the LP and the CP appear to be quite similar .
The very name of the Constitution Party appeals to the libertarian - leaning voter looking for a political party dedicated towards returning to a government strictly bound by the Constitution –as the Libertarian Party wishes for also .
Additionally , the LP and the CP are very close on issues like foreign policy , Second Amendment rights , economic policy and health care .
However , beyond their initial similarities on the surface , a more in - depth look at the two parties shows profound differences in both platform and ideology .
The most acute difference between the two parties , and one that will explain much of the content in this article , can be found in the preambles of the two parties .
Constitution Party :
The Constitution Party gratefully acknowledges the blessing of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ as Creator , Preserver and Ruler of the Universe and of these United States .
We hereby appeal to Him for mercy , aid , comfort , guidance and the protection of His Providence as we work to restore and preserve these United States .
This great nation was founded , not by religionists , but by Christians ; not on religions but on the Gospel of Jesus Christ .
For this very reason peoples of other faiths have been and are afforded asylum , prosperity , and freedom of worship here .
The goal of the Constitution Party is to restore American jurisprudence to its Biblical foundations and to limit the federal government to its Constitutional boundaries .
Libertarian Party :
As Libertarians , we seek a world of liberty ; a world in which all individuals are sovereign over their own lives and no one is forced to sacrifice his or her values for the benefit of others .
We believe that respect for individual rights is the essential precondition for a free and prosperous world , that force and fraud must be banished from human relationships , and that only through freedom can peace and prosperity be realized .
Consequently , we defend each person ’s right to engage in any activity that is peaceful and honest , and welcome the diversity that freedom brings .
The world we seek to build is one where individuals are free to follow their own dreams in their own ways , without interference from government or any authoritarian power .
From the get - go , the differences of the two parties are quite obvious .
At its very roots , the Constitution Party is unabashedly a party of Christian philosophy and spirituality , where as the Libertarian Party remains much more secular in its composition and values .
The best example of this can be found in objectives of the CP and LP , which are " to restore American jurisprudence to its Biblical foundations " and " to build [ a world ] where individuals are free to follow their own dreams in their own ways , without interference from government or any authoritarian power , " respectively .
Though the Constitution Party has a very real and intense dedication to Constitutional provisions –made clear by the fact that they support many of their platform planks with citations from both the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence –their raison d’etre is to essentially establish a " Christian " nation , and somehow maintain religious tolerance ( though this latter portion is never explained ) .
Take for instance the CP ’s views on gambling : " Gambling promotes an increase in crime , destruction of family values , and a decline in the moral fiber of our country . "
To their credit , the CP does not say that government should outlaw this behavior although their rhetoric strongly suggests they ’d like to see it abolished .
Instead , the Constitution Party calls for government to refrain from officially participating in gambling –for apparent moral reasons–by eliminating lotteries and ceasing to subsidize " Indian casinos in the name of economic development . "
Other issues like pornography ( " Pornography , at best , is a distortion of the true nature of sex created by God… We call on our local , state and federal governments to uphold our cherished First Amendment right to free speech by vigorously enforcing our laws against obscenity to maintain a degree of separation between that which is truly speech and that which only seeks to distort and destroy " ) and the judiciary ( " We particularly support all the legislation which would remove from Federal appellate review jurisdiction matters involving acknowledgement of God as the sovereign source of law , liberty , or government ) diverge quite distinctly from the LP philosophy .
However , the biggest difference between the two parties , and one that is the best manifestation of the diametric difference of philosophies on the role of government in society , relates to the issue of gay rights .
The Constitution Party , in pursuit of their goal to " restore American jurisprudence to its Biblical foundations , " takes a very different approach towards homosexuality than that of the Libertarian Party .
The platform of the CP states that " the law of our Creator defines marriage as the union between one man and one woman , " and " no government may legitimately authorize or define marriage or family relations contrary to what God has instituted . "
The CP also does not believe the government should recognize civil unions for gay couples .
While Libertarians hold many different views on the issue of gay marriage , with some believing marriage , both straight and gay , should not be an issue for government and others believing that gay marriage should be recognized so long as straight marriage is recognized –Libertarians believe " government does not have the authority to define , license or restrict personal relationships . "
One might remember the saying in grade - school geometry that " all squares are rectangles , but not all rectangles are squares . "
Well , the same can be said of libertarians and Constitution Party members .
Many Constitution
Party members are libertarians , in some way , shape or form .
However , there are very few Libertarians–if any at all –that would comfortably identify themselves as ascribing to the Constitution Party platform .
There is a simple explanation for this : Christian members of the Libertarian Party recognize that the basis of their religion is the idea of free will and volition , and that their morality does not need to be reinforced or supported by government laws or coercion .
The Constitution Party , for whatever reason , finds that government should be a model for morality –that is , Christian morality–and all semblances of behavior and lifestyles contrary to this behavioral model should be eliminated through " Constitutional " government methods , with the end goal of establishing a Christian nation .
Perhaps the Constitution Party has more optimism for the functionality of a quasi - theocracy in regards to respect for the Constitution and the freedom to live , but seeing the corruption of the " Christian right " in the Republican Party , their optimism seems far too romanticized .
While it is in the Christian ideology that followers of this faith should be testaments to the power of the message and should evangelize to all people of the earth , none ( at least those who believe in a libertarian - element to the religion ) believe this call to evangelize can be
replaced by a call to legislate .
This , indeed , is the tragic fallacy of most Christians in politics , and one that poisons the Constitution Party ’s platform .
For a party that believes so strongly in the Constitution and preserving its authority , it is puzzling that the CP takes the position that God ’s law is supreme to Constitutional authority in the government .
Many Christians , including myself , do believe that God ’s law always is supreme to the law of man when the two conflict ; however , the difference is that this belief is made at a personal level , and would not expect the same to apply to government .
In order for the authority of the Constitution to remain intact , there can be nothing in government that undermines its supremacy .
It was this very problem that sparked the beginnings of the American Revolution .
When the British Constitution no longer was supreme , and parliament could pass laws that trumped the laws of this ( unwritten ) Constitution , the authority of that document was destroyed .
This is one logical incongruity that the Constitution Party fails to answer when it comes to both religious freedom and the people ’s right to be free in their lives from government .
The problem is only amplified by the Constitution Party ’s lack of positions on privacy issues as it relates to how citizens live their lives .
It should be said that there is some grounds for what the Constitution Party believes that can be traced back to the founding of the nation .
The role of religion and government together were widely discussed ; however , the general conclusion of our founding fathers may be best encapsulated in this quotation from James Madison :
The experience of the United States is a happy disproof of the error so long rooted in the unenlightened minds of well - meaning Christians , as well as in the corrupt hearts of persecuting usurpers , that without a legal incorporation of religious and civil polity , neither could be supported .
A mutual independence is found most friendly to practical Religion , to social harmony , and to political prosperity .
In order for a society to be free , and a religion to remain uncorrupt , there must be a distinct separation between the two .
While it is a mistake on one side to believe that our politicians must divorce themselves of all their religious and moral beliefs before taking office , it is another to suggest that our political leaders should use their own personal precept of morality as a template for laws that apply to an entire nation .
Thomas Jefferson said that truth would stand on its own regardless of whether it has the support of the government .
Therefore , there is no need for the government to define and establish what this truth is .
The Libertarian Party wants a world where all individual are free to live their lives in peace , without interference from the government or their fellow man .
This entails a tolerance of many other lifestyles , though not approval or acceptance ( a key distinction ) , because it will be recognized that nobody should dictate anything else through law but freedom .
Should society turn into a Christian society through this freedom , then so be it .
It will at least be done through the volition and consent of all others .
There would be no element of coercion , and that is what any true Constitutionalist should strive to achieve .

Author ’s Note : I would like to emphasize that this is not an attempt to distort or misconstrue any belief or position of the Constitution Party .
I have tried my best to remain objective and present their positions exactly how I believe the Party to stand based upon their platform and messaging .
This article is simply to illustrate the ideological differences between two political parties that are often associated together .

The Mongrel Web server can run with a URL prefix , using the –prefix option .
This is useful for running an app in a “ subdirectory ” — say BankDirectr at http://banks.info/directr and BankRobbr at http://banks.info/robbr .
In development you want that same prefix ; this way your stylesheets , images , and other static assets show correctly at the right URL .
For this we had originally modified script / server to always pass –prefix to Mongrel .
Switching to Phusion Passenger has removed one tab from my screen session , and made development faster and easier .
However , getting it to work with a subdirectory took a few minutes .
The basic idea is that Apache handles the static assets , and Passenger handles the rest .
So in your VirtualHost block you need to add an Alias from the prefix to the DocumentRoot .
Like this :
< VirtualHost *:80 > ServerName banks.info DocumentRoot /var/www/robbr
Alias /robbr /var/www/robbr </VirtualHost >
However , in an attempt to ruin our fun , Phusion Passenger ’s documentation says this :
Phusion Passenger conflicts with mod_rewrite and mod_alias .
Those modules may be installed and loaded together with mod_passenger , and they will work fine outside virtual hosts that contain a Rails application , but we recommend you not to use their features inside virtual hosts that contain a Rails application .
Fine .
It works just fine for me using mod_alias , but that ’s only in my development environment and not in production .
Here ’s another solution :

Earlier , a stand - off erupted with reporters who accuse the McCain campaign of shielding his running mate , Sarah Palin , who has not held a press conference in nearly four weeks of campaigning .
The Alaska Governor had her first contact with world leaders yesterday , meeting Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe for about 30 minutes each on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York .
At first , campaign aides told the TV producer and reporters in the press pool that follow Mrs Palin that they would not be admitted , as is normal , along with photographers and a television crew to photo - opportunities before her meetings with Mr Karzai and Mr Uribe .
Under that scenario , Mrs Palin would get a public relations dividend of pictures posing with world leaders , but not have to take , or dodge , shouted questions .
Later , the McCain campaign backed down , amid suggestions the TV networks would boycott Mrs Palin 's talks .
Reporters were allowed to accompany photographers into her later sessions with Mr Uribe and former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger , with whom , her senior foreign policy adviser Stephen Biegun said , she discussed some of America 's most sensitive international relationships .
In the brief moments when Mrs Palin was visible to the press  her aides allowed a single print journalist to watch the first minute of her afternoon sessions  she sought to forge a personal bond with Mr Karzai .
He told Mrs Palin about his son , who was born in January 2007 .
With both of them smiling , and with Mrs Palin patting her heart , Mr Karzai told her his son's name was " Mirwais , which means ' The Light of the House ' " .

If you were watching the Republican convention last night , you probably noticed that not a single speaker mentioned the economy .
Barack Obama noticed , and blasted the Republicans today for ignoring the economy at their convention .
While campaigning in Ohio today , Obama said , “ Which probably explains why last night when they were speaking , all these speakers ( at the Republican National Convention ) came up , you did n’t hear a single word about the economy .
Not once did people mention the hardships that people are going through .
I guess I do n’t blame them , because if you do n’t have any issues to run on , you want it all to be about personality .
If you have got George Bush ’s track record and John McCain voting 90 percent of the time in agreement with George Bush , then you probably you do n’t want to talk about issues either . ”
The McCain campaign has made a conscious decision that this convention is going to be about playing up McCain ’s bio , and demonizing Barack Obama .
They are going to ignore all of the other issues except national security and Iraq .
It seems like the selection of Joe Biden by Obama has even taken foreign policy off of the table .
Although , they are still trying to play up the experience angle , they have been hamstrung by the perception that very few people outside of the Republican Party actually believe that Sarah Palin is qualified to be president .

While people sitting at home watching this convention want to hear what John McCain is going to do about the number one issue in this election , they are getting hours of hearing about what a hero McCain is combined with what a risk it would be not to elect him .
It is almost like the McCain campaign is trying to hold the worst convention possible .
From an atmosphere that is funeral like at best , to a convention hall that is mostly empty , this is not a made for television event that is putting their candidate ’s best foot forward .
Obama should be attacking McCain and the Republicans on the economy every single day .
It is an issue that McCain wants to avoid , but it is on everyone ’s minds .
Obama needs to be reminding voters that McCain does n’t know much about the economy , and he has picked a running mate that knows even less .
I remember the Ronald Reagan conventions of the 1980’s .
They were filled with youth , optimism , and an economic message , kind of like Denver was for Obama .
In contrast , the McCain convention has been stale , old , and soul less , kind of like the man it will formally nominate on Thursday .

Simran Sethi and Sarah Smarsh are writing a series on the impacts of everyday things .
They will be posting previews on Green Options before launching the posts on Huffington Post .
Here ’s the low - down on how we ’re quenching our thirst .
We ’ve been seduced by the beverage industry into believing only they can quench our thirst with colored , caffeinated , vitaminized , electrolyted water .
We have become so parched that we can’t walk down the street without toting a single - use plastic bottle touting the magical effects of its water source .
Apparently , Kabbalah Water will heal us and Bling Water will define us .
At the Bling H20 website , Bling Water “ creator ” Kevin Boyd describes noticing on Hollywood studio lots that “ you could tell a lot about a person by the bottled water they carried . ”
First of all , did n’t god create water ?
Secondly , the water is bottled in Dandridge , Tennessee – since when is Southern Tennessee a spring of L.A. status ?
Yes , Dandrige ’s water ranks very highly on EPA ’s water quality index , but why are we spending so much money ( $ 40 for Bling ’s “ Go Green ” 750 ml bottle ) on cross-continental water instead of cleaning up our local waterways ?
Tinseltown ’s water is so polluted with run-off and industrial contamination that perhaps water by way of Tennessee does make sense .
Here ’s what the less blingy among us do :
Work to identify problems at the source , pushing for the protection of wetlands .
Reduce the amount of toxic junk we flush down and rinse away ( including pharmaceuticals ) .
Lobby our local officials to protect our source water .
Use it sparingly : in the yard , in the house , everywhere Carry our own bottles ( Coated aluminum is Siman ’s preference , Sarah goes with BPA - free plastic ) and proudly fill up at water fountains and taps .
Read more at the Huffington Post .
Thanks to the University of Kansas School of Journalism and Lacey Johnston for research assistance .
And he ’s right .
It ’s bad enough watching the other failed executives walk away with money in light of the extraordinary actions by the US taxpayer .
The idea of two complete failures , who pushed out numbers to make a bad situation appear better , walking away with a few dozen million dollars while everyone else is picking up the tab is sickening .
( Whoever updated that contract in July to guarantee more money also deserves to be sacked immediately . )
Mr. Obama , the Democratic presidential nominee , asked that any “ inappropriate windfall payments ” to the chief executives and senior managers of those agencies be voided , in a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency , the new regulator for Fannie and Freddie .
Together , Daniel H. Mudd of Fannie Mae and Richard F. Syron of Freddie Mac are eligible for as much as $ 24 million in severance , retirement benefits and deferred compensation .
“ Under no circumstances should the executives of these institutions earn a windfall at a time when the U.S. Treasury has taken unprecedented steps to rescue these companies with taxpayer resources , ” Mr. Obama wrote .

BOSTON 
For many , summer in New England would not be complete without throwing on a bib and cracking open a freshly boiled lobster .
This year , however , fewer people are ordering the region ’s signature dish , driving down lobster prices and making times harder for lobster fishermen already reeling from the high cost of fuel and bait .
“ Lobster is a luxury item , and when things are tight , people do n’t buy lobster , ” said Peter Eaton , a lobsterman from Kennebunkport , Me. , who is getting about $ 3.75 per lobster off the boat , a quarter less than three months ago and about a dollar less than last summer .
While price and demand have hit their lowest point in years , lobster fishermen are hauling in larger catches than ever .
Restaurants in New England have been running lobster specials all summer , trying to pass on the lower prices and move lobsters from the tank to the table .
The US is to give Georgia $ 1bn ( £ 500 m ) in aid to help it rebuild after last month 's war with Russia over its separatist enclaves .
The aid package , which will be announced later today by Condoleezza Rice , coincides with the start of trip by the vice - president , Dick Cheney , to the former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan , Georgia and Ukraine .
The trip is designed to show US support for its allies in the region .
" President Bush has sent me here with a clear and simple message for the people of Azerbaijan and this entire region :
The United States has deep and abiding interests in your wellbeing and security , " Cheney said today on his arrival in Azerbaijan .
Moscow sent tanks and troops into Georgia last month after the Georgian government attempted to reassert control over South Ossetia by force .
The scale of Russia 's reaction , and its subsequent recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , another breakaway Georgian region , as independent states has drawn condemnation from the west .
The aid package is expected to total just more than $ 1bn for reconstruction , staggered over two years .
The US will specify that a significant proportion will be devoted to budget support , as well as to rebuild housing , transportation and other infrastructure destroyed in the conflict .
Sources said the White House plans to approach the campaigns of the Democratic presidential nominee , Barack Obama , and his Republican counterpart , John McCain , to get a guarantee the financial assistance will continue after President Bush leaves office in January .
The Bush administration is also considering moves to punish Moscow for the Georgian intervention , such as possibly scrapping a lucrative civil nuclear deal .
The EU has criticised Russia for its military offensive but has so far stopped short of imposing sanctions .
Cheney will head to Georgia after visiting Azerbaijan , before visiting Ukraine , which , like Tbilisi , is also seeking membership of the Nato security alliance .
He will also be promoting the need for former Soviet states to export their oil and gas reserves using routes that bypass Russia .
" The United States strongly believes that together with the nations of Europe , including Turkey , we must work with Azerbaijan and other countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia on additional routes for energy exports that ensure the free flow of resources , " Cheney said .
The US aid offer comes on top of a loan of $ 750 m from the International Monetary Fund .
The loan is intended " to help mitigate the adverse economic and financial consequences of the recent conflict " , the IMF said .
Sure ,
Wii is great and all , but we 're guessing a man in China who tried to extort $ 1,400 from his parents by " kidnapping " himself and demanding a ransom after they refused to buy him a " Nintendo computer " was probably a little too infatuated with Ninety 's white box .
The man -- who we 're hoping is more of a " boy " -- apparently hired two men to kidnap him , and was arrested after he withdrew his own ransom from an ATM .
Genius .
Quick tip , kids : real tennis , bowling , golf , and boxing are almost as much fun as Wii Sports , believe it or not -- and they involve just slightly less jail time .

The tips and techniques explained may be outdated .
A design destined for print requires setting up to certain specifications to ensure that the work is printed correctly by industrial lithographic or digital print firms .
This often starts with the initial document upon which the design is to be created by adding the correct bleed area and crop marks .
Let ’s take a look at what crops and bleed actually are , why they are required and how to set them up in your favourite Adobe package .
Baffling Bleed
Let ’s start with the term bleed , this is the area of artwork that is extended beyond the actual dimensions of the document .
It is used to avoid strips of white paper showing on the edges of your print should the batch be misaligned when cut to size .
Any objects in your artwork that touch the edges of the document require bleed , for instance a background colour or image should spread to cover the entire bleed area as should any objects that creep in from the side of the page .
In the UK at least , bleed of 3 mm is commonly required .
This 3 mm accounts for each of the four sides of the page , therefore you should add 6 mm to the width and height of the document , for example :
A4 Paper = 210 mm x 297mm
210 mm + 6 mm = 216mm
297 mm + 6 mm = 303mm
Total Document Size = 216 mm x 303mm
In addition to bleed , you should also add a margin to the edges of the document to avoid having your objects look as if they are about to fall of the page or even worse actually get cropped off when the document is trimmed !
The amount of margin is personal preference , but 3 mm , 5 mm or 10 mm is usually used depending on the size of the overall design .
Setting Bleed in Photoshop
When creating your document , simply make the calculations to the artwork size as above and enter them into the Width and Height boxes .
It is always useful to place in some guides to remind you where the trimmed document size lies , I usually do this by heading to Select >
All , then Select > Transform Selection .
Right click on the W and H options and change the measurements to MM , then enter the normal document size .
Drag guides to the borders of the new selection .
Let ’s not forget to add our margin , in this case we ’ll say 5 mm per side .
Use the same technique to create guides another 10 mm smaller ( 5 mm x 2 ) .
Setting Bleed in Illustrator
In Photoshop we altered the overall size of the document to accommodate bleed , however in Illustrator try and keep the document correct to the desired finish size .
Remember any objects spanning to the edge of the artboard will require bleed , run these out an extra 3 mm per side .
Using a temporary rectangle or margins at the overall bleed size can help align the objects .
Drag margins and snap them to the artboard .
Right click on the artboard and unlock the guides , select each guide in turn and press the Enter key to move it .
Enter your desired margin figures into the X and Y boxes to move the guides into position .
Setting Bleed in InDesign
With InDesign being primarily a desktop publishing application it has the most options for setting up a document for print .
Under the New Document menu you will notice individual options for Page Size , Margin and Bleed , simply enter in your figures and let InDesign setup the document for you !
Confusing Crops
Crop marks are the little lines that sit around the edge of the document showing where the area of bleed ends and the proper document area begins , they work alongside bleed to tell the print worker where the paper needs trimming .
Crop marks are usually hairline or 0.25pt in thickness and are set in Registration Black .
Setting Crops in Illustrator
There are a couple of ways to set crop marks in Illustrator , the first is to go to Object Crop Area >
Make .
This will create a set of uneditable crop marks directly around the document edges .
A second method is to create a rectangle the size of the document , then go to Filter > Create > Crop Marks .
This will create a set of editable crop marks according to the area specified .
A benefit of this method is that they crops can then be shortened if needed , Illustrator tends to produce huge crop marks that can sometimes be a little overkill for designs such as small business cards .
Editing the points to shorten the crops down to say 3 or 5 mm is sometimes a little more efficient .
Another advantage of this type of crop is that multiple areas can be created , particularly useful if you are laying out a sheet of multiple designs .
Setting Crops in InDesign
InDesign automatically adds crops when exporting the document to PDF , under the Marks and Bleed settings simply check the printers marks required in the dialog box .
What Happened to Photoshop ?
While I 'm sure crop marks could be manually drawn in Photoshop , it probably is n't worth it considering the time it would take to simply import into Illustrator or InDesign and create the print file accordingly !

Whoa , Nellie !
You may need to be sitting down for this one .
Check out this video from a meeting of the Alaskan Independence Party .
The guy in the beard and suspenders is Vice Chairman of the AIP , Dexter Clark .
Partial transcript is below , but you may want to sit and really listen to the whole thing .
It ’s like being a fly on the wall at the crazy uncle / secessionist convention !
The AIP now has over 13,000 registered members , and added 300 this year .
The basic argument of the Alaskan Independence Party has always been the number one plank in our platform – the question of our vote to become a state .
So … the most blaring disparity in that vote was the definition of an eligible voter .
Among those qualified to cast a ballot were 41,000 American soldiers and 36,000 dependants .
Now , to the native population of Alaska , to me , these were occupation troops !
And they were made eligible and , in fact encouraged to vote .
There were educational meetings held on the military bases .
I ca n’t imagine them telling anyone that anything but that statehood would be very good for the military – in fact they still have 6 , 7 big bases and numerous smaller holdings in the state .
Statehood would be good for the military .
Now can you imagine the international uproar if American troops had all went and got their purple fingers in Iraq ?
After his discussion of the American ‘ occupying troops ’ getting the right to vote ( purple finger analogy ) , he goes on to say that instead of having the options to vote to either remain a territory , become a commonwealth , become a state or become an independent nation , that voters were only given the option – Statehood ?
Yes or No .
And also , under the Voter Rights
Act of the time , you had to be able to read and write English to vote , which disenfranchised much of the Alaska Native population .
There ’s the rationale for taking the vote we never got to take .
Now , we get to the good part , just before 6:00 on the video .
“ Our current governor , we mentioned at the last conference , the one we were hoping would get elected , Sarah Palin , did get elected .
There ’s a joke , she ’s a pretty good looking gal , there ’s a joke goes around we ’re the coldest state with the hottest governor .
( laughter )
And there was a lot of talk about her moving up .
She was an AIP member before she got the job as a mayor of a small town — that was a non-partisan job .
But to get along and go along — she eventually joined the Republican Party , where she had all kinds of problems with their ethics , and well , I wo n’t go into that .
She also had about an 80 % approval rating , and is pretty well sympathetic to her former membership . “
So…basically what he ’s saying here , is that Palin ’s philosophical loyalties lie with the Alaska Independence Party , but in order to get elected , she had to distance herself from the AIP and infiltrate the Republican Party , because they ’re the only ones who can ever actually get voted into office .
But do n’t worry boys and girls , her heart is still with us , and her sympathies are with the agenda of the Alaskan Independence Party , namely , independence .
Then he begins to discuss the the oil industry , how it breeds corruption , and how Alaskans are n’t making enough money from it .
He also talks about Republican Senator Ted Stevens and Republican Congressman Don Young being under investigation .
( Young is still under investigation , and Stevens is indicted on seven felony counts of non-disclosure of gifts totalling over $ 250,000 from an oil service company ) .
He goes on :
If there is ever a time that is right for change , this is it .
In our own situation , we discussed several options .
Do we try and get our case into the International Court of Justice , or to the World Court ?
Several Native Alaskan organizations are taking that route , independent of us .
They want to do it on their own terms .
They have n’t realized , in my mind , the potential of their own political party .
The pitfalls of an organized political party – you do n’t have any control over who joins that party .
They put the X next to it on the registration form , and if they join the — go into the primary , and win that primary , they ’re your candidate , like it or not .
I think Ron Paul has kind of proven that .
He ’s a dyed - in - the - wool Libertarian .
He came to Alaska and spoke as a Libertarian .
And he put the Republican label on to get elected .
That ’s all there is to it .
And any one of your organizations should be using that same tactic to infiltrate .
I know that Christian Exodus is in favor of it , I know that the Free State Movement is in favor of it .
I do n’t know that they even care which party it is .
Which ever party you see where you can get something done , get into that political party , even though it does have it ’s problems .
Right now that is one of the only avenues .
If you can get a few people on the city council , or a town board , you can have some effect .
Wow .
Another plot twist in our drama .
So , despite the claims that Palin has been a member of the Republican Party since 1982 , this would appear to contradict that pretty strongly .
Dexter is implying that Palin ‘ marked the box ’ Republican , but is n’t one .
Let ’s indulge in a little mind movie for a moment .
Suppose , if you will , a video surfaced of a local Islamic mullah talking in a mosque about how Barack Obama , in order to get elected , had infiltrated a Christian church , and was planning to take over the country with an Islamic agenda .
How would that play in Peoria ?
So , the Alaskan Independence Party has 13,000 registered members , but how many others are out there ??? …. They walk among us …
UPDATE : Oops … forgot my Quote of the Day from Alaskan Independence Party founder Joe Voegler :
“ The fires of Hell are frozen glaciers compared to my hatred for the American government , and I wo n’t be buried under their damn flag ! ”
Happy Monday !

I believe I remember vividly that I wrote at the beginning of this decade around 2002 or 2003 that it would be under President George Bush�s watch that the financial collapse would begin in earnest .
It is a historical fact that the few years following 1929 witnessed the addition of 10,000 or so new millionaires in the US .
I suppose these were those out of debt and who had prepared for the events of those days .
Those days are now repeating themselves once again in our humble generation .
Our nation today is definitely hurtin� for certain .
And the blood is running in the streets !
� Gold posted a record two - day rally , topping $ US900 an ounce , on surging investor demand for a haven from credit - market turmoil . �
� Central banks in the US , Europe and Japan led a global plan to pump $ US247 million into auctions to ease the worst crisis facing financial markets since the 1920s . �
'' The world 's financial system is under assault .
It 's going to take a long time to repair .
People are full of Treasuries , and gold looks like another logical place to go . ''
'' There 's been a shift in market psychology , ' said Ralph Preston , a futures analyst at Heritage West Futures .
'' This is pure momentum buying .
We 'll see gold at $ US1000 next week . ''
� Since the second quarter of 2007 , banks worldwide have posted $ US518.1 billion in losses and write downs related to investments in subprime mortgages .
The Federal Reserve has orchestrated takeovers for Bear Stearns , American International Group and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy this week .�
businessday.com , September 19 , 2008 Remember the story of Yertle the Turtle ?
Of course you do .
An old Dr. Seuss classic .
In the story this one little turtle in his small little pond made the decision that he would become the richest turtle of all .
Not content with merely catching flies with his tongue and enjoying the cool and clear water .
� It 's a shame that greed and stupidity are n't illegal �
Voices.kansascity.com , 9-19-2008
Most other turtles in the pond were happy but that greed from ole �
King Turtle was infectious .
And who were those first little turtles who first began to bear the pain ?
� Six months behind on their mortgage , Dave Evans and his wife , Suzie , packed the contents of their modest blue house here into a rented truck one day in July .
The move came after weeks spent alternately crying and searching in a frenzy for somewhere to go .
" At the end , it was so close we could have wound up on the streets , " Dave Evans says . � usatoday.com
Generally , the folks at the very bottom of the food chain are those who begin to hurt first .
And the poor middle class turtles at the very bottom of the stack carrying the greatest weight on their backs are the first to cry out .
�� Yertle ( banks & financial institutions ) , the king of them all , decided the kingdom he ruled was too small .�
Dr. Seuss
Now you tell me if the above line doesn�t sound like the banker and financial elite of the past 20 years ?
And the mentality of today�s financial market makers ?
Already wealthy as King Midas yet they are still not content .
They want more .
Much , much more .
They want the world and beyond .
Greed , greed , greed �
� President Bush asked Congress on Saturday for the authority to spend as much as $ 700 billion to purchase troubled mortgage assets and contain the financial crisis . � ��would be the most sweeping economic intervention by the government since the Great Depression� � ccn.com , 9-20-2008 Wow !
This crisis sounds for real !
How about a further and real dramatization of the real time events of this past week or so .
� SLAM .
Slam .
Slam .
Slam .
Like a scene from a gathering of Mafia dons , the doors of 30 black Lincolns slammed shut as their besuited occupants stepped out into a Manhattan downpour � and into a global financial storm . �
� That storm broke yesterday , with stock markets tumbling around the world .�
� The collapse effectively began at 6 pm last Friday .
The place : the offices of the New York Federal Reserve .
The occasion : an emergency meeting of the most powerful figures in American banking and finance aimed at staving off a massive bank collapse . �
� Cookies and coffee arrived .
Then ghoulish crowds began to gather , reminiscent of those that had assembled in Wall Street 80 years ago as the stock market crashed .�
� The United States is now in the throes of its biggest banking crisis in 70 years , stirring terrible memories of panics , bank failures , bankruptcies and mass unemployment .
First Bear Stearns had to be rescued .
Then the government had to take over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two largest US mortgage providers .
Now Lehman Brothers .�
� Indeed , just ahead of the market collapse , Lehman underwrote more mortgage - backed securities than any other firm . �
� They may have driven their banks � and their shareholders � into enormous losses .
But the former Masters of the Universe will never know what it 's like to live in a subprime home . �
" I think the least we are going to have to learn from this is that the whole of the financial sector simply cannot return to where it was before . �
" It is terrible .
Death .
It 's like a massive earthquake .
It 's final .
Everybody is just finishing up . "
thescotsman.scottsman.com , 9-16-2008
And to sum up real well just what has happened this past week or so ?
Ian L. Cooper , Gold World , 9-20-2008 - � �we learn that as much as $ 1 trillion could be needed to avoid an imminent meltdown . �
� Worse , let 's not forget these legendary institutions ... each completely blown out of the water : � Lehman Bros. and Bear Stearns ... gone .
� Freddie and Fannie ... now government - owned .
� Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs ... their legs cut out from under them .
� Washington Mutual ... their grave is being dug at this very moment .
� All in the last 3 weeks ... �
� And if Washington Mutual fails , it 'll need billions from the FDIC to cover depositors .�
Ian L. Cooper , Gold World , 9-20-2008
And as I stated before all of this has centered around greed , greed , and more greed � I �m ruler �of all that I see .
But I don�t see enough .
That �s the trouble with me .�
� If I could see high , how much greater I�d be !
� I�d be ruler of all I could see ! �
Dr. Seuss
So ole �
Yertle commanded all the other turtles in the pond to stand on one another�s back with Yrtle on top .
� Turtles !
More turtles !�
He bellowed and brayed .
And the turtles �way down in the pond were afraid .
They trembled .
They shook .
But they came .
They obeyed .�
Dr. Seuss
And what is happening to the majority of these poor ol� turtles who seem caught squarely in this massive financial mousetrap ?
" It 's all hands on deck , " says Richard Yamarone , director of economic research at Argus Research .
" Any and every entity , Treasury , the Fed and all central banks around the world are being summoned to right the potentially sinking ship .
It 's in everyone 's interest that the financial , banking system is kept afloat . "
Usatoday.com
And all these castles made of sand with the first drop of a gentle ocean surf and returning tide begin to fade away back into the sea .
� Came a groan from that plain little turtle named Mack . �
� Your majesty , please � I don�t like to complain , but down here below , we are feeling great pain . �
� That plain little turtle below in the stack .
That plain little turtle whose name was just Mack , decided he�d taken enough .
And he had .
And that plain little lad got a little bit mad .
And that plain little Mack did a plain little thing .
He burped !�
� And his burp shook the throne of the king ( banking industry ) . �
Dr. Seuss
And what is becoming the final outcome of many of these financial and banking institutions who watch as their kingdoms grind in the dust ?
They become ��king of the Mud. � Dr. Seuss � Stock markets around the globe plummeted again Wednesday after the U.S. government 's surprise US $ 85 - billion bailout of the world 's largest insurer reignited fears of further fallout that could deepen what is being called the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression . �
� As investors bailed out of stocks on Wednesday , they put money into safe havens including cash , gold and treasuries .

SQUINT hard , and textbook publishers can look a lot like drug makers .
They both make money from doing obvious good  healing , educating  and they both have customers who may be willing to sacrifice their last pennies to buy what these companies are selling .
It is that fact that can suddenly turn the good guys into bad guys , especially when the prices they charge are compared with generic drugs or ordinary books .
A final similarity , in the words of R. Preston McAfee , an economics professor at Cal Tech , is that both textbook publishers and drug makers benefit from the problem of “ moral hazards ”  that is , the doctor who prescribes medication and the professor who requires a textbook do n’t have to bear the cost and thus usually do n’t think twice about it .
“ The person who pays for the book , the parent or the student , does n’t choose it , ” he said .
“ There is this sort of creep .
It ’s always O.K. to add $ 5 . ”
In protest of what he says are textbooks ’ intolerably high prices  and the dumbing down of their content to appeal to the widest possible market  Professor McAfee has put his introductory economics textbook online free .
He says he most likely could have earned a $ 100,000 advance on the book had he gone the traditional publishing route , and it would have had a list price approaching $ 200 .

This ain't a scene , it 's an equality race
by Jeremy Hooper
Maybe it was Rosh Hashanah or maybe it was something else , but for some reason we completely missed the news this week that the band Fall Out Boy has given $ 50 k to fight the cruel , discriminatory , intellectually bankrupt , un-American measure known as Proposition 8 :
Fall Out Boy gives $ 50,000 !
[ CA Ripple Effect ]
So you heard 'em , kids --
When it 's fall out , boy is it a good time of the year to go to the polls and reject anti-gay measures !
And if you do n't , Pete Wentz is gonna make you watch his wife 's cringe - worthy " SNL " screwup on a continuous loop .
:: shudder ::
Your thoughts
Oh , PeteWentz , why must you be so damn lovable ?

and this from Corvino !
Want a good investment strategy this month ??
Invest in your future .. invest to win in all 3 amendment states :
What they need , very badly , is money .
Understandably , the California fight has received the most attention and the most support .
But Arizona is important .
The amendment ’s failure would be a powerful statement that when voters reject homophobia , they really mean it .
Its passage , on the other hand , could encourage right - wing opponents in other states to keep trying even after losing ballot battles .
We can win all three battles if we fund them .
That ’s why I ’m urging you to visit the campaign websites opposing these initiatives — today — and to give as you are able .
And do n’t just visit their websites .
If the prospect of legal protection for our relationships fails to inspire you to send money , try visiting our opponents ’ campaign websites .
There you will find pretty pictures of heterosexual couples and families , along with the insidious message that we gays harm them .
That we weaken their families .
That we threaten their children .
THAT MESSAGE IS POISONOUS , AND IT HURTS ALL OF US IN EVERY STATE ..( caps mine , Lorion ) .
If you care about justice for gays and lesbians , invest in stopping these amendments .
For more information , check the campaign websites .
Note that Florida and Arizona each have two groups working in tandem to defeat the amendment .
California :

Yes : http://www.protectmarriage.com/
Florida :

Well now I do n't feel as silly for buying their last 2 albums .
Bet this will again piss off that pig of a mother who called FOB 's concert a " liberal homosexual rally " ; she 's probably been breathing in a paper bag for hours already .

Scientists can now predict memory of an event before it even happens .
A team at UCL ( University College London ) can now tell how well memory will serve us before we have seen what we will remember .
Scans of brain activity , published online in the journal Nature Neuroscience , indicate that the brain can actually get into the ' right frame of mind ' to store new information and that we perform at our best if the brain is active not only at the moment we get new information but also in the seconds before .
Dr Leun Otten from UCL Psychology and the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience , who led the research project , said : " It sounds a bit like clairvoyance in the sense that we 're able to predict whether someone will remember a word before they even see it .
That 's really new - scientists knew that brain activity changes as you store things into memory but now we have found brain activity that tells how well your memory will work in advance . "
Two experiments were conducted to tap into long - term memory and arrive at the results .
In the first , a symbol was presented on screen a few seconds before each word , telling the subjects what kind of decision to make about the following word .
Participants either had to decide whether the word referred to something living , or whether the first and last letters of the word were in alphabetical order .
In the second experiment , the subjects had to imagine what the item looked like to decide whether it was taller than wide or vice versa .
The cue before each word in this experiment told people whether the following word would be seen or heard .
These tests were designed to make the subject think about different aspects of a word , including its meaning .
The participants ' brains were scanned using an EEG ( electroencephalogram ) scanner which looks like a swimming cap covered with electrodes and records electrical brain activity on the scalp .
The scanners , popular since the 1960s , are used in hospitals to detect epilepsy in people and are an important tool to show not just what bits of the brain are lighting up but also what triggers it to light up and when .
In this test , the important thing was to find out whether brain activity before an event has an impact on memory or whether , as was previously thought , it 's just brain activity after an event that is important for memory .
Without the timeline given by an EEG scanner such an analysis would not be possible .
Tests showed that the brain 's electrical activity differed after the cue question and before the word was presented and this was linked to whether the subject would remember or forget the word in a later unexpected memory test .
If the electrical activity maintained a high level over frontal parts of the scalp just before the word was shown , then it was likely that the subject would remember the word up to 50 minutes later - and after doing a series of other word tests .
On the other hand , if the voltage was lower , the subjects were less likely to remember the word .
Dr Otten said : " It would be nice to know what brain regions are involved in this preparatory activity , and whether it can be used to help people who have difficulties remembering things .
Unfortunately we are n't at that stage yet !
What we do know though is that it might have something to do with trying to get into the right frame of mind to make a decision about a word 's meaning .
Staying alert between the cue and the word also appears to help .
We are currently trying to find out more about this kind of brain activity and how it helps long - term memory . "
