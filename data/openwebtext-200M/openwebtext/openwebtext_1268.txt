China was under intense diplomatic pressure last night to abandon key demands which risk scuppering an international treaty on climate change in Copenhagen .
Today President Barack Obama is due to arrive in the Danish capital after Hillary Clinton electrified the faltering conference by announcing that America would back the setting - up of a climate fund for poor countries which would have $ 100 bn to give away annually by 2020 .
But at the same time she issued a blunt challenge to China , which has now overtaken the US as the world 's biggest emitter of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change , to allow its promised emissions cuts to be internationally verified – something the Chinese have been stubbornly resisting .

For the Chinese not to accept " transparency " – independent verification – was a " deal breaker " for the US , Mrs Clinton openly said , which would see the $ 100 bn offer disappear .
All eyes are now on China to see if it will allow itself to be cast in the role of the villain who prevented a new international climate deal and deprived the world 's poorest people of the chance to get substantial new aid to tackle the effects of global warming which are now inevitable .
The initial reaction of the Chinese at Copenhagen last night was defensive and appeared to show no real movement .
He Yafei , Vice - Minister for Foreign Affairs , said that his country would increase reporting on emissions under domestic law , but would not accept verification that was " intrusive " or infringed on Chinese sovereignty .
However , that may change today when the US President , Barack Obama , arrives – on a remarkable day trip to Copenhagen – to complete the unique assembly of nearly 120 world leaders who have travelled to the Danish capital to try to " seal the deal " of a new climate agreement .
With Gordon Brown prominent among them , the heads of state and government from around the globe spent yesterday in an intense round of one - to - one meetings – among many others , Mr Brown saw the Chinese Premier , Wen Jiabao – and last night they came together for the biggest VIP dinner in history , hosted by Denmark 's Queen Magarethe in Copenhagen 's Christiansborg Palace .
Before the dinner , an upbeat Mr Brown said he thought conditions for a global climate deal were now in place , and that the US offer went more than halfway to securing agreement – although talks were expected to continue through the night and well into today , when President Obama jets in at 8 am , before jetting out again at 4 pm .
But although the President 's appearance may be what finally secures a deal , there is no doubt that it was the intervention of his Secretary of State that loosened what seemed to be a hopeless logjam in the talks .
It was unforgettable political theatre .
Like a poker player with a sudden new bet , the power - dressed Mrs Clinton changed the game instantly as she pulled her gigantic sum out of the US back pocket and slammed it down on the negotiating table .
She was not saying that America would provide $ 100bn on its own account .
She was not even saying how the money would be raised .
But in giving open and unambiguous US backing to the figure , which was first suggested by Gordon Brown last June , she turned the idea of a colossal new Climate Fund into reality – something which will have an enormous attraction to many of the poorer African countries , whose distrust of the rich nations has been one of the factors which has bedevilled negotiations over the past fortnight .
Mrs Clinton said : " In the context of a strong accord , in which all major economies stand behind meaningful [ emission cuts ] and provide full transparency as to their implementation , the United States is prepared to work with other countries towards a goal of jointly mobilising $ 100 bn a year by 2020 , to address the climate change needs of developing countries . "
The time was at hand , she said , " for all countries to reach for common ground and take a historic step which we can all be proud of . "
In words which could not show a greater contrast with the attitude of the previous administration , she went on : " I am deeply concerned about the consequences [ of global warming ] for developing countries , from Bangladesh to the Maldives , from the Caribbean to West Africa , and the Pacific Islands .
If we can not secure the kind of strong accord I have described today , we know what the consequences will be .
We must try to overcome the obstacles that remain .
We must now seize this moment to raise our oars and row in the same direction towards our common destination and destiny . "
But despite the optimism engendered by her démarche , Britain 's lead negotiator , the Energy and Climate Change Secretary , Ed Miliband , warned that the talks may still founder : " It 's a race against the clock , " he said .
The state of play :
Where the US stands
What the United States is giving :
* Emissions The US promised to cut 2005 emissions by 17 per cent by 2020 .
This amounts to about 3 per cent below 1990 levels , the benchmark used in the Kyoto Protocol .
The US also said it would extend cuts to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025 , and 83 per cent by 2050 .
* Finance Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the US will work with other countries towards a goal of jointly mobilising $ 100bn a year by 2020 to address the climate change needs of developing countries .
* The US pledged $ 1bn as part of a $ 3.5 bn scheme as initial financing towards slowing deforestation .
What the United States wants :
* Mrs Clinton made clear China must be transparent over CO2 emissions .
* President Obama wants an accord in Copenhagen that covers all issues with " immediate operational effect " .
Chromosomes have telomeres at the end of each strand Physical or emotional abuse during childhood could speed up the body 's ageing process , US research suggests .
A team from Brown University focused on telomeres , the protective caps on the chromosomes that keep a cell 's DNA stable but shorten with age .
They found the telomeres of 31 people who had reported abuse as children tended to shorten more rapidly , speeding up cells ' ageing process .
Experts cautioned that the study needed to be replicated on a larger scale .
The study is featured in Biological Psychiatry .
Lead researcher Dr Audrey Tyrka said : " It gives us a hint that early developmental experiences may have profound effects on biology that can influence cellular mechanisms at a very basic level . "
Telomeres are relatively short sections of specialised DNA that sit at the ends of all our chromosomes .
They have been compared to the plastic tips at the ends of shoelaces that prevent the laces from unravelling .
Shorter telomere lengths are linked to ageing and certain diseases , so it is possible that this is a mechanism of risk for illness following childhood abuse
Dr Audrey Tyrka
Brown University
Each time a cell divides , its telomeres shorten and the cell becomes more susceptible to dying .
Previous research has found that telomeres shorten at an accelerated rate when exposed to toxins such as radiation and cigarette smoke .
There has also been work suggesting that psychiatric problems and stress could have a similar effect .
The latest study suggests psychological trauma early in life could store up similar problems for the future .
The researchers concentrated on people who although reporting abuse in childhood were otherwise healthy and had no signs of current or past psychiatric disorders .
Dr Tyrka said more work was needed to pin down the exact impact of childhood stress on cellular ageing .
The study and resulting theory is plausible as researchers have found previous telomere links with chronic stress
Professor Tim Spector
King 's College London
She said : " We do n't know what the full implications of this are yet .
" Shorter telomere lengths are linked to ageing and certain diseases , so it is possible that this is a mechanism of risk for illness following childhood abuse .
" But the precise role of telomeres in this process remains to be determined . "
Shorter telomere lengths have been linked to a variety of ageing - related medical conditions , including cardiovascular disease and cancer .
For this study , the scientists looked at 22 women and nine men .
Some subjects reported happy childhoods , while others reported emotional , physical or sexual abuse or neglect .
Professor Tim Spector , an expert on telomeres and ageing based at King 's College London , said : " The study and resulting theory is plausible as researchers have found previous telomere links with chronic stress .
" However , many different adverse environments are known to reduce telomeres - such as cigarette smoking , obesity , lack of exercise and social class as well as genes .
" In such a small sample such as this - any of these could actually be responsible rather than the abuse - so it needs replication on a much bigger scale . "

Epic Games has announced a free PC edition of the Unreal Development Kit , also allowing non-commercial Unreal Engine 3 games to be released for free and detailing new royalty - based engine licensing .
The free tools , which Epic call the Unreal Development Kit , is available to anyone with interest in exploring 3D game technology , from professionals to students and hobbyists .
Those users will also have access to documentation and resources on an official website -- which also offers information on how to license UE3 commercially .
Developers can now release UE3 - powered games for free , which will be particularly popular with non-commercial mod projects .
However , creators will still need to obtain an official licensing agreement to develop a commercial project using UE3 ; according to the new licensing terms , Epic receives twenty - five percent of revenue after the first $ 5,000 is made , with a per- seat yearly fee also potentially applying if the project is solely used internally .
Currently , the free kit is only offered to PC users , although Epic says console support is " under consideration . "
It 's intended as a tool for experimentation and hands - on learning .
Epic says the UDK is up to date and in step with the commercial version of Unreal Engine 3 , including all its latest upgrades and features .
The company promises to continue to support UDK users by offering ongoing , updated builds for free .
According to the company , Unreal development technology is already in use at over 100 schools where game development - related courses are taught , and other universities , like the Art Institutes , DeVry University and the University of Pennsylvania , among others , plan to incorporate the tech into their curricula .
" I 'm excited about the possibilities the Unreal Development Kit opens to those who are looking to get into the game business but do n't otherwise have the means to acquire world - class technology and tools like ours , " says Epic VP Mark Rein .
" UDK is Unreal Engine 3 , which has been used to create games in a wide range of genres , as well as military simulations , 3D architectural walkthroughs , animated movies and more .
Users are only limited by their imaginations .
Go ahead make something Unreal ! " : Information on new Unreal Engine licensing structure added . ]
New research confirms what consumers have long known  most breakfast cereals advertised to children are full of sugar .
Cereals marketed to kids have 85 percent more sugar , 65 percent less fiber and 60 percent more sodium than those aimed at adults .
In fact , the least nutritious cereals are often the most heavily marketed to children , such as Reese ’s Puffs , Corn Pops , Lucky Charms , Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Cap ’n Crunch .
Some cereals with the poorest ratings even have health claims on the box .
San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera has written a letter to the CEO of Kelloggs , demanding evidence that Cocoa Krispies really " helps support your child ’s immunity " as it purports to do on the front of the box .
Cocoa Krispies are 40 percent sugar by weight .
A Kellogg ’s company spokesperson , Susanne Norwitz , argued that Kellogg ’s Krispies cereals provide consumers with 25 percent of their daily value of vitamins A , C , and E .
Kellogg began making the immunity claims about Cocoa Krispies in May , however as of November 4 said they re pulling the claim from the box .
Meanwhile , the average preschooler sees 642 cereal ads a year on TV .
Most are for types with the worst nutrition ratings .
According to Cereal FACTS ( Food Advertising to Children and Teens Score ) , which was developed based on the best available science , in consultation with a steering committee of experts in nutrition , marketing , and public health , the 10 worst breakfast cereals based on nutrition score are :
1. Kellogg  Corn Pops ( or Pops )  Chocolate Peanut Butter 2 . Quaker  Cap ’n Crunch  w/ Crunchberries 3 . Kellogg  Special K  Chocolatey Delight 4 . Kellogg  Special K  Blueberry 5 . General Mills  Reese ’s Puffs 6 . General Mills  Fiber One  Caramel Delight 7 . Kellogg  Cocoa Krispies  Choconilla 8 . General Mills  Golden Grahams 9 . General Mills  Cinnamon Toast Crunch 10 .
Kellogg  Corn Pops

Dr. Mercola ’s Comments :
How can Kelloggs Cocoa Krispies , which is one of the 10 worst breakfast cereals out there , get away with putting a giant slogan across the front of their cereal boxes claiming this sugar - laden nutritional disaster will help support your childs immunity ?
The cereal is 40 percent sugar by weight and sugar can suppress your immune system and impair your defenses against infectious disease .
Telling parents that they are doing their childs health a favor by allowing them to eat this , or practically any childrens cereal , is akin to letting them sit down to a plate full of Twinkies and Oreos and calling it a balanced meal .
Fortunately , Kellogg has been receiving criticism from parent groups and nutritionists alike ever since it launched the far - fetched claim , and as of November 4 said they are pulling it from their cereal boxes .
Kellogg was criticized for playing up the cereals imaginary immunity benefits in response to the H1N1 flu craze , which the company denied .
Yet , rather than admitting the claim was way beyond a stretch of the truth , Kellogg has said its pulling the claim given the public attention on H1N1 . 
But immunity claims or not , if you really want to look out for your child , one of the first steps would be to immediately get rid of any cereal , particularly if it has a cartoon character on the box , as childrens cereals are notoriously bad for childrens health .
Childrens Cereals Are Nutritional Disasters
Breakfast cereals , which were initially developed to increase convenience , have mostly morphed into nothing more than highly processed sweetened grains sprinkled with synthetic vitamins .
They are a mere fantasy of a healthy food , and I dont recommend you eat any cereal for breakfast on a regular basis  including those that are marketed as healthy fiber sources !

But you should know , whether you have children or you secretly keep a stash of Cap ’n Crunch in your pantry , that cereals that are aggressively marketed to kids have the worst nutritional quality of all cereals , according to an analysis of 161 brands conducted last year .
The analysis , published in the Journal of American Dietetic Association , found that childrens cereals have more sugar , sodium , carbohydrates , and calories per gram than cereals not marketed to kids .
They also have less protein and fiber .
On average , sugar accounts for more than one - third of the weight of children 's cereals compared to less than one - quarter of adult cereals .
But parents continue to shell out for these nutritional disasters because the food industry spends about $ 229 million annually advertising them to children .
Colorful cartoons and other cheery tricks stimulate your child into wanting these fun foods , but the damage they can do to your childs health is no laughing matter .
In the last two decades , the prevalence of overweight adolescents has nearly tripled , and current statistics show 16 percent of children are overweight or obese .
An excess of sugar and carbohydrates are two culprits contributing to this growing problem .
Cereal Is Not a Healthy Breakfast
According to the analysis of 161 cereal brands noted above , one serving of cereal equated to 11 percent of the daily limit of added sugar for active boys , aged 14 to 18 years old , and an astounding 92 percent of the daily sugar intake for sedentary girls aged 9 to 13 .
The problem with feeding your child foods high in added sugar is twofold  they contain little in terms of vitamins and minerals , and the calories they contain are not made up of important micronutrients needed for health and growth .
Reducing sugar intake should be on the top of your list regardless of whether your child is currently overweight or not , because its been proven over and over that sugar increases insulin levels , which can lead to :
High blood pressure and high cholesterol
Heart disease
Diabetes
Weight gain
Premature aging , and more
In fact , sugar is bad for your health in so many ways , Ive compiled an entire list outlining 76 Ways in Which Sugar Can Damage Your Health !
But even if you re not eating a childrens cereal  lets say you re eating a more adult oriented cereal that s high in fiber and low in sugar  it is still not a healthy breakfast choice .
Why ?
Because cereal is mostly grain , and grains rapidly break down to sugar in your body , stimulating insulin production .
So , if you :
Are overweight
Have high cholesterol
Have high blood pressure
Have diabetes
… then you are best served avoiding cereal for breakfast .
If your nutritional type is carbohydrate oriented and you dont have any of the above problems , then grains are a possible option for you .
But , rest assured , if you indulge in grains to excess you are heading for one of the above diseases .
Further , to keep your energy up and feel satisfied , you should really strive to include a healthy source of protein and fat , according to your nutritional type , with your breakfast .
That is really what my nutrition plan is all about  AVOIDING grains , such as bagels , cereal and pancakes , and replacing them with high - quality proteins ( such as eggs ) , healthy fats ( INCLUDING saturated fat ) and low - glycemic complex carbs , mostly from veggies .
What Is a Healthier Breakfast Option for Kids ( and for You ) ?
It is very important that you start your day off with a healthy breakfast , as studies have shown that eating breakfast can have beneficial effects on :
Appetite
Insulin resistance
Energy metabolism
One study even found that obesity and insulin resistance syndrome rates were 35 percent to 50 percent lower among people who ate breakfast every day , compared to those who frequently skipped it .
But theres more to it than simply not skipping the meal .
You need to give your body high - quality fuel to run off of for the day .
And sugary breakfast cereals do not qualify .
So what is an example of a healthy breakfast that will keep you feeling energized and at the top of your game for hours ?
My primary recommendation for Carb and Mixed nutritional types is to prepare and consume fresh vegetable juice , making sure to also eat the pulp .
( It s loaded with so many valuable phytonutrients , it would be unwise to discard it . )
Generation XL : Raising ... Joseph Mercola , Ben Le ... Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 8.00 ( as of 10:15 EST - Details )
Veggie juice is a really simple breakfast alternative , and suitable even for your youngest ones .
If you want to add some protein and fat , try adding some raw cream , raw kefir or a raw egg or two .
Juicing may not be the best option for Protein types ( like me ) , however , so if your child is a Protein type , youd want to limit them to 10 ounces or less of raw juice each day , and restrict the vegetables to lower potassium varieties such as spinach and celery .
Prior to understanding Nutritional Typing I used to juice vegetables , but now my breakfast contains far more fat .
I typically make a porridge with several ounces of fresh raw coconut cream ( which I obtain locally as its not available commercially ) .
Then I mix in 23 raw organic free - range eggs , some rice bran , and some raw organic nuts , ground organic hemp seeds and coconut milk .
That typically keeps me going strong until lunch .
So please give some serious thoughts to what types of foods your child is eating for breakfast .
Proper childhood nutrition is so important if you want to set the stage for lifelong health that I wrote an entire book on the subject called Generation XL : Raising Healthy , Intelligent Kids in a High - Tech , Junk - Food World .
It even includes 74 pages of kid- approved recipes , brimming with all - natural , healthy choices that will satisfy even your picky eaters .
So if you re looking for even more options to wean your kids off breakfast cereal , this book is an excellent place to find them .

A lot of people are rightfully making the point that you can not generalize about millions of Muslims in this country based on two guys .
Just as you cannot generalize about all right - leaning white Christians ( let alone all Christians in their entirety ) based on what domestic terrorists like Tim McVeigh did , or Terry Nichols , or Eric Rudolph , or Scott Roeder or ...
But there is a more important point here .
Muslims Americans do n't have to prove a damn thing to you .
They are Americans just like anyone else , whether right - wing clowns like it or not .
They are not 80 % American .
They are not 90 % as American as you are .
You do n't get to judge how American they are .
Here is the inalterable fact that the right - wing of this country has to get used to - Muslim - Americans are 100 % American .
There are no degrees of how American you are .
They have the same exact rights , privileges and responsibilities as any other American does .
They do n't have to answer to you .
I 'm agnostic now , but I was born Muslim .
My whole family is Muslim .
They 're all Americans .
Not one of them is one percent less of an American than any other race or religion in this country .
My family became American by becoming naturalized .
If anything , that shows that we are even more loyal to this country .
Our citizenship is not an accident of birth , we chose America .
If someone challenges how American I am based on my race , ethnicity or religion ( or lack thereof ) , thems fightin ' words .
These colors do n't run .
There is no one in the country more American than I am .
And at least I understand the whole point of the country .
We are all created equal .
We all have the same rights .
We do not judge people based on their race or religion .
That is part and parcel of what America is all about .
And if you do n't understand that , I question how American you are .

There is karma to everything that we say .
This means that our words have consequences .
They can bring inspiration and joy to others but they can also bring sadness and pain .
For these reasons I suggest that we become more mindful of the things we say .
All too often we speak with haste , not considering whether or not what we say has value , and not reflecting on the outcome of what has been said .
Here are a few tips to sharpen our ability to say the right thing at the right time , without all the fluff and idle chatter .
Pause And Think Before You Speak
One of the most common reasons we say the wrong things is because we do n’t take the time to pause and think before we speak .
Our words become more powerful when we put in this extra effort .
From now on take the extra seconds to replay what you say in your head before you utter the words , especially when you are having a particularly meaningful conversation with a friend or loved one .
Ask Yourself “ Does What I Say Have Value ? ”
Are you saying something to achieve a purpose or do you just like hearing the sound of your voice ?
Sometimes we are saying something only to make ourselves feel good , but if what we say has no value to the other person then why say it at all .
Maybe it is because we are speaking to a confidant in order to get some negative feelings off our chest .
This is understandable , but more often than not we should make our words valuable to the other person .
If others do n’t see any value in speaking to us then it is likely that the person wo n’t value talking to us again in the future .
This is not necessarily a good way of building lasting relationships .
Add value to your conversation – even if it is only to provide simple pleasures like humor or joy .
Consider Who You Are Speaking To
Choosing the right words often depends on who it is you are talking to .
You would probably use a different range of vocabulary around your college buddies then you would around your grandparents .
But sometimes the differences become more subtle .
Some of your friends may be interested in politics , others may hate the thought of it .
It is important to choose the subject of the conversation depending on who you are speaking to .
Be aware of when someone is losing interest and then change the thread of the conversation .
Consider The Environment
Everything has a time and place .
Be sensitive to your environment and be aware that some topics of conversation are more friendly during certain times than others .
Nightclubs are rarely a good place to talk about the philosophy behind God .
Your wedding is not a good time to share your favorite “ getting drunk ” stories .
Again – some of these are obvious and other differences can be subtle .
Consider the mood of the environment , the types of people around you , and the appropriateness of what you want to say .
Do n’t Be Afraid To Reflect Back On Your Words
The time to reflect back on your words is not directly after you say them but once you are alone after the fact .
The reason for this is because you do n’t want to get stuck in your head during a conversation .
Therefore there is no point in analyzing words until you have some time to yourself .
The point of this process of reflecting is to catch something that you may have been previously unaware of during the conversation .
In retrospect you may find that you did n’t choose the best words to describe your feelings or thoughts .
Do n’t beat yourself up over it – just learn to be more mindful of these things in the future – and try to apply what you learned into future conversations .
Pay Attention To How Others Speak
This is an effective method for two reasons .
First , by paying close attention to the words others use you will have a better idea on the way they think and which particular words are most meaningful to them .
This is a great way to get into the mind of another person .
You can then use these words in your own pattern of speech and create a stronger connection .
The second way this tip becomes useful is when you are listening to a conversation between two other individuals in a group setting or on a TV interview .
You may find that someone has a great way of explaining a certain situation or feeling .
Maybe they told a really great joke you would like to borrow or they use a particular word you find really effective .
You can use your listening skills and later apply what you learned into your own daily speech .
Conclusion
I hope you found these tips useful .
One of the principle teachings in Buddha ’s Eightfold Path is Right Speech and I have used the Buddha ’s lessons in mindfulness and karma to improve my own intentions when I speak .
The list above is really nothing but a collection of intentions one can have when conversing with others .
Following this advice will lead to more purposeful and effective speech .

The leaked emails from the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) at the University of East Anglia could not have come at a better time for the Global Warming Policy Foundation , a " cross - party political think - tank " set up last week to counter the supposed lies and distortions of the climate science community .
Chaired by Lord Lawson , who was Chancellor of the Exchequer under Margaret Thatcher , the foundation 's stated aim is to " help restore balance and trust in the climate debate that is frequently distorted by prejudice and exaggeration " .
" Our main purpose is to bring reason , integrity and balance to a debate that has become seriously unbalanced , irrationally alarmist , and all too often depressingly intolerant , " said the foundation , which has half - a - dozen peers , a bishop , a banker and an economist as trustees .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In a newspaper article , Lord Lawson said the leaked emails from the CRU appear " at first blush " to show that scientists have been manipulating the raw temperature figures " to show a relentlessly rising global warming trend " .
The foundation 's own logo emphasises the point by showing that global mean temperatures for the 21st century have not in fact been rising , but , if anything , getting cooler .
" It is curious that , whereas their models predicted an acceleration in global warming this century ... so far this century there has been no further warming at all , " Lord Lawson said .
But for an organisation set up to expose such data manipulation , it was indeed unfortunate that the logo was itself a travesty of the truth .
For a start , it contained at least one obvious error , spotted by Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment .
The original logo depicted 2003 as having the highest global temperature of that highly selective series of years , which was not the case .
Benny Peiser , the director of the new foundation and a social anthropologist at Liverpool John Moores University , admitted that there had been a " small error by our graphical designer " .
Mr Ward also points out that the data used in the logo comes from a dataset compiled by the Met Office and the very same Climatic Research Unit that the foundation criticises for data manipulation .
Even the amended version of the logo appears to show that 2006 and 2007 were warmer years than 2004 , which is not the case .
" I am surprised that the members of the foundation 's academic advisory council have not been scrutinising the information on the website to ensure it is correct , " Mr Ward said .
It is also odd that the foundation chose to represent just eight years of data , from 2001 to 2008 .
If it had included 2000 , and the latest data on what is known of 2009 , then the shape of the logo would look very different – even more so if the past 150 years of data were included .
Dec. 11 , 2009  --
For millions of travelers who visit foreign countries , it 's not just their passports , but their fingerprints , that they need to hand over at the border .
Because fingerprints are unique to each individual , fingerprint scanning at airports and other ports of entry helps security officials quickly identify criminals , terrorists , immigration violators and others .
While not foolproof , for some countries , the system is the first line of defense against enemies of the state and other unwanted visitors .
But , earlier this month , Japanese officials arrested a Chinese woman who took a particularly extreme measure to evade detection .
She paid a plastic surgeon to surgically alter her fingerprints .
Lin Rong , 27 , was originally arrested Dec. 5 for faking a marriage license after she 'd already entered the country , Japanese officials said .
That ' s when police saw scars on her hands and realized that she might have been guilty of more .
Surgeon Swapped Fingerprints From Woman 's Right and Left Hands
" During the course of the investigation , police found that she passed through the checkpoint using fake fingerprints , " said Nobuyuki Kawai , director of the International Crime Office of Japan 's National Police Agency .
He said Rong had previously been deported but sneaked back into the country to work in a restaurant or a bar .
Although local reports said she paid about $ 15,000 for the fingerprint transplant surgery , Kawai said Rong told officers she paid roughly $ 1,500 for the procedure that swapped fingerprints from her right and left hands .
Patches of skin from her thumbs and index fingers were reportedly removed and then grafted on to the ends of fingers on the opposite hand .
As a result , Rong 's identity was not detected when she re-entered Japan illegally .
Japanese Official : Immigration Officers Tightening Security
Since Japan started checking the fingerprints of foreign visitors in 2007 , Kawai said , immigration officials have caught eight other people who tried to alter their fingerprints through various techniques .
But , he said , this was the first time officials had identified an illegal immigrant who used surgery to fake fingerprints .
" This is the first case , " Kawai said .
" But please keep in mind that we do n't know if there are any other cases .
You never know unless you catch the person . "
Rong , who is still in custody , could either serve time in a prison or be immediately deported , he said .
And Kawai added that the immigration department is tightening security at airport checkpoints .
" We are sure they are trying to be more careful at border control , " he said .
" So we hope we can prevent similar cases in the future . "
Could Fingerprint Fraudsters Sneak Into the U.S. ?
But should this example raise a warning flag for the United States and other countries that use fingerprint scanning and other biometric security systems ?
Although Rong 's method of deception was especially drastic , she was not the first to figure out how to fool a fingerprint scanner .
In January of this year , it was reported that a South Korean woman blocked from entering Japan apparently slipped past the screening system by placing special tape over her fingerprints .
The silicon covering foiled the scanning device and did n't alert officials that she had been deported in 2007 for overstaying and was barred from re-entry for five years .
Immigration officials later found her inside the country .
Bruce Schneier , a security technologist and author , said he was familiar with techniques that could defeat fingerprint scanners in the lab , but was surprised to hear that someone had actually succeeded at the airport .
" I 'm not surprised that it 's possible but that someone did it , " he said .
" The real - time , high - stress environment of an immigration line is a little different . "
Security Expert : Criminals Must Defeat Technology and Social System
Criminals have tried for decades to fool fingerprint scanners , he said , but what works in an isolated context does n't necessarily work in the real world .
" It 's not just defeating the technology , " he said .
" You need to defeat the social system around it . "
Although officials with the Department of Homeland Security declined to speak on the record , they told ABCNews.com that immigration officers at airport checkpoints are trained to detect and thwart techniques biometric fraudsters might use .
They also said that as opposed to Japan 's fingerprint scanner , which only scans two fingers , scanners at U.S. airports scan up to 10 fingers of foreign visitors .
" What happens because of the way our system works , the officers are right there when the fingers are scanned , " one DHS official said .
" If any question comes up , they can look at the person 's hand . "
At any one time , about 5 million people are on the country 's biometric watch list , for crimes , drug offenses , immigration violations and other reasons , a DHS official said .
Homeland Security : Officers Trained to Detect and Catch Fraud at the Border
Although they could n't disclose a precise number , the officials said that since the U.S. implemented its fingerprint scanning system in 2004 , several people had attempted to evade detection through various kinds of fingerprint alteration and mutilation .
Some attempted deliberate scarring , others used acid to burn their fingers .

The Shell Game – How The Federal Reserve Is Monetizing Debt
Sunday , August 2 , 2009
Executive Summary
The Federal Reserve and the federal government are attempting to “ plug the gap ” caused by a slowdown of private credit / debt creation .
Non-US demand for the dollar must remain high , or the dollar will fall .
Demand for US assets is in negative territory for 2009
The TIC report and Federal Reserve Custody Account are reviewed and compared
The Federal Reserve has effectively been monetizing US government debt by cleverly enabling foreign central banks to swap their Agency debt for Treasury debt .
The shell game that the Fed is currently playing obscures the fact that money is being printed out of thin air and used to buy US government debt .
The Federal Reserve is monetizing US Treasury debt and is doing so openly , both through its $ 300 billion commitment to buy Treasuries and by engaging in a sleight of hand maneuver that would make a street hustler from Brooklyn blush .
This report will wade through some technical details in order to illuminate a complicated issue , but you should take the time to learn about this because it is essential to understanding what the future may hold .
One of the most important questions of the day concerns how the dollar will fare in the coming months and years .
If you are working for a wage , it is essential to know whether you should save or spend that money .
If you have assets to protect , where you place those monies is vitally important and could make the difference between a relatively pleasant future and a difficult one .
If you have any interest at all in where interest rates are headed , you ’ll want to understand this story .
There are three major tripwires strung across our landscape , any of which could rather suddenly change the game , if triggered .
One is a sudden rush into material goods and commodities , that might occur if ( or when ) the truly wealthy ever catch on that paper wealth is a doomed concept .
A second would occur if ( or when ) the largest and most dangerous bubble of them all , government debt , finally bursts .
And the third concerns the dollar itself .
In this report , we will explore the relationship between those last two tripwires , government debt and the dollar .
Replacing private credit with public credit
Our entire monetary system , and by extension our economy , is a Ponzi economy in the sense that it really only operates well when in expansion mode .
Even a slight regression triggers massive panics and disruptions that seem wholly inconsistent with the relative change , unless one understands that expansion is more or less a requirement of our type of monetary and economic system .
Without expansion , the system first labors and then destroys wealth far our of proportion to the decline itself .
What fuels expansion in a debt - based money system ?
Why , new debt ( or credit ) , of course !
So one of the things we keep a very close eye on over here at Martenson Central , as they do at the Federal Reserve , is the rate of debt creation .
One of the big themes in the current credit bubble collapse is the extent to which private credit has been collapsing and the corresponding degree to which the Federal Reserve has been purchasing debt and the federal government has stepped up its borrowing .
In essence , public debt purchases and new borrowing has attempted to plug the gap left by a shortfall in private debt purchases and borrowing .
That ’s the scheme right now – the Federal Reserve is creating new money out of thin air to buy debt , while the US government is creating new debt at the most fantastic pace ever seen .
The attempt here is to keep aggregate debt growing fast enough to prevent the system from completely seizing up .
How are they doing ?
The debt gap
One of the great perks of living in a relatively open society is that we generally get access to pretty good information .
The Federal Reserve routinely publishes a document called “ Monetary Trends , ” where they collapse all their points of interest into a nice , tidy collection , and then make it available for all to see .
Here ’s what caught my eye in the most recent one :
What we see here is federal debt ( bottom chart ) exploding at a nearly 30 % yr/ yr rate of change in response to a collapse in corporate and consumer borrowing ( top charts ) .
This raises a most interesting question : “ Who is lending the money to accommodate all that federal borrowing ? ”
Here ’s where the story gets interesting .
Treasury International Capital ( TIC ) flows
Lately , a number of observers have made note of a troubling decline in foreign demand for US paper assets , notably bonds .
Worse , it ’s even turned into outright selling which will ultimately translate into dollar weakness .
The relative demand for the dollar “ out there ” in the international Foreign Exchange ( or “ Forex ” ) market directly impacts the dollar ’s strength .
If there are more sellers then its value will fall ; if there are more buyers , then its value will rise .
One way to assess this delicate balance is to ask , “ In total , are foreigners buying or selling US assets and what are they doing with those proceeds ? ”
Luckily for us , the exact answer to this very question is released in a monthly report put out by the Treasury Department , called the Treasury International Capital Flows report , or TIC report for short .
The recent TIC reports have been quite alarming , because they not only reveal the most sudden deceleration in flows in history , but also that they have been negative for some time now .
This chart is from the Federal Reserve :
What we see here is that from the early 1990 ’s onward until 2007 , foreigners bought progressively more and more US assets and did so by bringing their money to the US and leaving it there .
It is only over the past seven months , out of decades , where that process has reversed and become negative .
This is a significant event , to say the least .
On the surface , the above chart hints at a potential disaster for a country that is embarking on the largest - ever federal debt binge in history .
After all , if US assets are being shunned by foreigners , how will we find enough buyers ?
And what will happen to the dollar ?
The answers are : “ We won ’t ” and “ Nothing good . ”
Digging in
If we dig into deeper into the detail of the report , we find something even more interesting .
While the overall flows have been negative , there is an enormous difference between the behaviors of foreign central banks and private investors .
Fortunately the TIC report distinguishes between these two broad classes of buyers .
Since the start of 2009 and continuing through the month of May , private investors sold $ 364 billion dollars worth of US assets , while central banks purchased $ 50 billion dollars worth ( source is a .csv file available here from the Treasury ) .
Added up , some $ 314 billion dollars of foreign money has left the country since the start of the year .
What this demonstrates is the utter reliance of the entire house of cards upon the continued purchase of US financial assets by foreign central banks .
Without the continued cooperation of the foreign central banks in accumulating US assets , suffice it to say that the dollar will fall a lot lower than it already has .
The dollar
Not surprisingly , the dollar recently put in a new closing low for the year ( YTD 2009 ) and is approaching a major area of support and resistance .
If it breaks through , we could be looking at a rapid game - changer here .
Of course , I ’ve said all this before , and every time we seem to get close , there ’s been an upside surprise in store .
The forces aligned to prevent a dollar collapse are numerous .
But the same risk remains , and the fundamental picture concerning the dollar has not changed since I first became wary of its fortunes in 2002 .
In fact , it ’s grown worse .
Federal deficits are higher than I ever imagined possible ( 13 % of GDP ! ) , and now the TIC flows are negative .
The only somewhat bright ( er ) spot is that the trade deficit has shrunk quite a bit .
However , it , too , remains solidly in negative territory , meaning it continues to apply pressure to the value of the dollar by increasing the total number of dollars that need to find a quiet resting place outside of the country .
Treasury auctions
During this past business week ( July 27th – 31st , 2009 ) , the US Treasury auctioned off more than $ 243 billion worth of various Treasury bills and bonds .
“ Indirect bidders , ” assumed to be mainly central banks , took an astonishing 39 % of the total , or nearly $ 95 billion worth .
With the exception of the 5 - year auction , which mysteriously stank up the joint with a worrisome bid - to - cover ratio well below 2.0 ( the bond market behaved poorly upon the release of that news item ) , the story here is that foreign central banks are buying up vast quantities of Treasury offerings .
Wait a minute , hold on there …
I thought we just talked about how the TIC report said that foreign central banks have only bought $ 50 billion in total US paper assets through May – and now they are said to be buying $ 95 billion during a single week in July alone ?
Something is not adding up here .
To understand what , and to get to the essence of the shell game , we need to visit one more source of information – something called the Federal Reserve Custody Account .
The Federal Reserve Custody Account
It turns out that when China ’s central bank ( or any other foreign central bank ) decides to buy either US agency or Treasury bonds , they do not walk up to some window somewhere , hand over a pile of cash , and then take some nice looking bonds home with them in a suitcase .
Instead , what happens is that the Federal Reserve actually holds the bonds ( or rather an electronic entry representing the bonds ) in a special account for these various central banks .
This is called the “ Custody Account ” and it holds US debt ‘ in custody ’ for various central banks .
Think of it as a magnificently vast brokerage / checking account , run by the Federal Reserve for central banks , and you ’ll have the right image .
Although the TIC report shows flows of capital into and out of the country , it does not show you what is going on with those funds that are already in the country .
If you look again at the first chart in this report , and behold the vast flows of money that came into the US between 1995 and 2008 , you can get a sense of how much money got sent to the US and mostly remains parked there .
The custody account currently stands at $ 2.787 trillion ( with a “ t ” ) dollars .
It has increased by over $ 430 billion the past 12 months and by more than $ 275 billion in 2009 alone ( through July 29 ) .
These are truly shocking numbers , and they tell us that foreign central banks have been accumulating US debt instruments throughout the crisis .
As we can see in the chart below , there has been absolutely no deflection in the growth of the custody account as a consequence of the financial crisis , bottoming trade , or the local needs of the countries involved .
It ’s almost as if the custody account is completely disconnected from the world around it .
If you can spot the credit bubble crisis on this chart , you have sharper eyes than me .
What does such a chart imply ?
We might wonder what sorts of distortions are created by having such a massive monetary spigot aimed from several central banks towards a single country .
We also might question just how sustainable such an arrangement really is .
It is a complete mystery how such a chart can display nary a wiggle , despite all that has recently transpired .
This next table showing the yearly changes in the custody account actually surprises me quite a bit .
Despite everything that ’s been going on , the custody account is on track to grow by the largest dollar amount on record this year , nearly $ 500 billion dollars ( if the current pace continues ) .
Where is all this money coming from and for how much longer ?
Understanding the gap between the TIC and the Custody numbers
One thing you might have noticed is that the TIC report only shows $ 50 billion in foreign bank inflows for 2009 , while the custody account grew by $ 277 billion .
How is it possible for the TIC report to show smaller inflows than growth in the custody account ?
We can see that clearly in this table , which compares the two .
( Note : These are 12 monthly yr/ yr changes , so the numbers will be different than the YTD numbers I just cited ) :
One explanation is that the custody account , at some $ 2.7 trillion dollars , is accumulating a lot of interest .
If those interest payments are not “ sent home ” and remain in the account , then the account will grow by enough to more or less explain the difference .
For example , the $ 135 billion difference shown above could be generated by a 5 % return to the custody account , which is not an unthinkable rate of interest for that account .
International check kiting
Some people view the custody account as nothing more than an elaborate version of check kiting , played at the central banking level .
Check kiting
An illegal scheme whereby a false line of credit is established by the exchanging of worthless checks between two banks .
For instance , a “ check kiter ” might have empty checking accounts at two different banks , A and B .
The kiter writes a check for $ 50,000 on the Bank A account and deposits it in the Bank B account .
If the kiter has good credit at Bank B , he will be able to draw funds against the deposited check before it clears , i.e. , is forwarded to Bank A for payment and paid by Bank A .
Since the clearing process usually takes a few days , the kiter can use the $ 50,000 for a few days , and then deposit it in the Bank A account before the $ 50,000 check drawn on that account clears .
In this game , Central Bank A prints up a bunch of money and buys the debt of Country B .
Then the central bank of Country B prints up a bunch of money and buys the debt of Country A .
Both enjoy the appearance of strong demand for their debt , both governments get money to use , and nobody is the wiser .
Except that the world ’s total stock of central bank reserves keep on growing and growing and growing , as reflected in the custody account , which will someday result in thoroughly unserviceable amounts of debt , an unmanageable flood of money , or both .
If this strikes you as a scam , congratulations ; you get it .
If that was all there was to the story , then it would be far less interesting than it actually is .
When we dig into the custody account data , we find that the total picture is hiding something quite extraordinary .
Even as the total custody account has been growing steadily and faithfully , the composition of that account has been changing dramatically .
Here we note that agency bonds peaked in October of 2008 at nearly a trillion dollars but have declined by $ 178 billion since then .
Treasuries , on the other hand , have increased by over $ 500 billion over that same span of time .
A half a trillion dollars !
If you were wondering how the US bond auctions have managed to go so smoothly , here ’s part of your answer .
What is going on here ?
How is it possible that central banks are buying so many Treasury bonds , at the fastest rate of accumulation on record ?
It would appear that foreign central banks have been swapping agency bonds for Treasury bonds , but that ’s not how the markets work .
First , they would have to sell those bonds , before they could use the proceeds to buy government debt .
So to whom did they sell those Agency bonds in order to afford the Treasury bonds ?
Here we might recall that the Federal Reserve has been buying agency bonds by the hundreds of billions .
The shell game
Have you ever seen a sidewalk magician run the shell game , where a pea under a shell is magically shuffled around – now you see it under this shell , now you see it under that shell , now it disappears completely – or does it ?
The more it moves around , the more confused you get .
If you can only figure out which shell the pea is hidden under , you win !
But where is the pea ?
The point of the game , from the perspective of the street hustler , is to use complexity of motion to confuse the mark .
These are the three critical points to remember as you read further :
The US government has record amounts of Treasuries to sell .
Foreign central banks , which have a big pile of agency bonds in their custody account , would like to help but want to keep things somewhat under the radar to avoid scaring the debt markets .
The Federal Reserve does not want to be seen directly buying US government debt at auctions ( and in fact is not permitted to , but many rules have been ‘ bent ’ worse during this crisis ) , because that could upset the whole illusion that there is unlimited demand for US government paper , but it also desperately wants to avoid a failed auction .
For various reasons , the Federal Reserve cannot just up and start buying all the Treasury paper that becomes available in record amounts , week after week , month after month .
Instead , it uses this three - step shell game to hide what it is doing under a layer of complexity :
Shell # 1 : Foreign central banks sell agency debt out of the custody account .
Shell # 2 : The Federal Reserve buys those agency bonds with money created out of thin air .
Shell # 3 : Foreign central banks use that very same money to buy Treasuries at the next government auction .
Shuffle , shuffle , shuffle , shuffle , shuffle , SHUFFLE , shuffle !
Confused yet ?
Do n’t be .
If we remove the extraneous motion from this strange act , we find that the Federal Reserve is effectively buying government debt at auction .
This is exactly , precisely what Zimbabwe did , but with one more step involved , introducing just enough complexity to keep the entire game mostly , but not completely , hidden from sight .
They can scramble the shells all they want , but the pea is still there somewhere – the pea being the fact that the Fed is creating money to fund the purchase of US debt .
At the time , the Federal Reserve program to purchase agency bonds was described like this :
Fed to Pump $ 1.2 Trillion Into Markets Greatly Expanded Purchases Are Designed to Lower Interest Rates , Stimulate Borrowing The Federal Reserve yesterday escalated its massive campaign to stabilize the economy , saying it would flood the financial system with an additional $ 1.2 trillion .
In its statement yesterday , the Fed said it will increase its purchases of mortgage - backed securities by $ 750 billion , on top of $ 500 billion previously announced , and double , to $ 200 billion , its purchases of [ Agency ] debt in housing - finance firms such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
While “ stimulating borrowing , ” “ stabilizing the economy , ” and “ lowering interest rates ” are laudable goals , the primary goal of the program seems to have been something else entirely – to assure plentiful funds for the massive US Treasury auctions coming due .
I saw nothing in any article I read about this program that even suggested that one of the goals was to allow foreign central banks to effectively swap their agency debt for US government debt using money printed from thin air .
But that ’s clearly one of the outcomes .
The Federal Reserve , for its part , has been quite open about these purchases of Agency debt .
It even provides an excellent website with nice graphics , allowing us to track the purchase program .
( Source )
However , this openness only extends to the amounts themselves , not the source (s ) of those Agency bonds .
This is , in my mind , yet another reason the Fed desperately wishes to avoid an audit .
The results would expose the game for what it is .
As we can see in the above chart , the Fed has purchased more than $ 640 billion of Agency bonds , and has promised to buy more in the near future .
As we now know , at least some of that money has been recycled into US government debt , where “ indirect bidders ” have been snapping up an unusually high proportion of the recent offerings .
( Note : The way Indirect bidders are calculated has recently changed , and I am not entirely clear on how much this influences the numbers we now see… .
I ’m working on it ) .
A fair question to ask here is , “ If there are green shoots everywhere and the stock market is racing off to new yearly highs , why is the Fed continuing to pump money into the system at these mind - boggling rates ? ”
One answer could be , “ Because things might not be as rosy as they seem . ”
Conclusion
The Federal Reserve has effectively been monetizing far more US government debt than has openly been revealed , by cleverly enabling foreign central banks to swap their agency debt for Treasury debt .
This is not a sign of strength and reveals a pattern of trading temporary relief for future difficulties .
This is very nearly the same path that Zimbabwe took , resulting in the complete abandonment of the Zimbabwe dollar as a unit of currency .
The difference is in the complexity of the game being played , not the substance of the actions themselves .
When the full scope of this program is more widely recognized , ever more pressure will fall upon the dollar , as more and more private investors shun the dollar and all dollar - denominated instruments as stores of value and wealth .
This will further burden the efforts of the various central banks around the world as they endeavor to meet the vast borrowing desires of the US government .
One possible result of the abandonment of these efforts is a wholesale flight out of the dollar and into other assets .
To US residents , this will be experienced as rapidly rising import costs and increasing costs for all internationally - traded basic commodities , especially food items .
For the rest of the world , the results will range from discomforting to disastrous , depending on their degree of dollar linkage .
Under these circumstances , “ inflation vs. deflation ” is not the right frame of reference for understanding the potential impacts .
For example , it would be possible for most of the world to experience falling prices , even as the US experiences rapidly rising prices ( and hikes in interest rates ) as a consequence of a falling dollar .
Is this inflation or deflation ?
Both , or neither ?
Instead , we might properly view it as a currency crisis , with prices along for the ride .
Further , all efforts to supplant private debt creation with public debts should be met with skepticism , because gigantic programs are no substitute for the collective decisions of tens of millions of individuals and cannot realistically meet millions of individual needs in a timely or appropriate manner .
The shell game that the Fed is currently playing does not change the basic equation :
Money is being printed out of thin air so that it can be used to buy US government debt .
My advice is to keep these potential issues and insights in sharp focus , make what moves you can to diversify out of dollars , and be ready to move rapidly with the rest .
This game is far from over .
Ads and more where black people were clearly inserted or removed digitally .
For some reason , black people and white people still do n’t seem to like taking photographs together .
Which makes it awfully difficult when a magazine , newspaper or brochure wants to demonstrate diversity .
I dug around the Internet for the best pictures I could find where a black person was either blatantly Photoshopped in or out .
Here are the 11 funniest and most absurd ones I found .
( Huge , preemptive dap goes out to the brilliant blog Photoshop Disasters , who pointed me to almost half of these . )
1 | Photoshopped diversity in Toronto
Our first entry is the most recent one … this comes from a summer fun guide that Toronto published last month .
A spokesman said they “ superimposed the African - Canadian person onto the family … [ with ] the goal to depict the diversity of Toronto . ”
They made the change because of a new policy in Toronto where the city manager mandated the staff always try to represent the cultural mix of residents .
And , according to Kevin Sack , Toronto ’s director of strategic communications , awkwardly plopping a miscellaneous black guy into a photo is sometimes an acceptable substitute for , ya know , actually having races mingle .
Sack told reporters , “ The policy does n’t say Photoshop , the policy says ‘ show diversity ’ … [ but ] when you ’re publishing something with deadlines and you do n’t have the right photo , the objective is to communicate the service . ”
2 | Curves cereal
If you ’re an overweight black woman , listen up :
Not only does Curves cereal help you lose your belly … it turns it white !
( And belly button - less , like Kyle XY . )
3 | That ’s not New Orleans
This one ’s brilliant .
In 2006 , Kimberly Williamson Butler , was a mayoral candidate in New Orleans .
And she wanted a photo of herself standing in the city for her website .
Instead of going out to actually take said picture , she had her staff Photoshop one together .
Only problem :
They accidentally Photoshopped her into New Orleans Square in Disneyland .
You can even see the Disneyland garbage can in the background of the photo .
When the Internet caught word of Butler ’s monumental blunder , they made a huge deal so her staff responded by … leaving the photo up on her website , but Photoshopping out that garbage can .
Needless to say , Butler only got one percent of the vote in the primary , which was n’t surprising … the Disneyland photo aside , she was pretty much done from the start when she announced her candidacy just after turning herself in on a contempt of court arrest warrant .
4 | Photoshopped diversity at at University of Texas , Arlington
I ’m not sure what makes it clearer that the black girl was Photoshopped in at the last second — the completely incorrect light and shadow on her face … or the fact that the person doing the Photoshop failed to get rid of the black background on her right arm and left shoulder AND some of the tan background behind her hair .
Either way , they picked an awful photo to insert her into .
The other girls look like best friends , and she ’s not their Lisa Turtle .
At best she ’s portrayed as their Lando Calrissian .
5 | The mystery of the black Olympic hand
I do n’t know who owns those three mysterious black fingers on Olympic swimmer Maritza Correia ’s shoulder .
All I know is that he most certainly did not get milk .
6 | The white ghost in the machine
One of two things happened with this photo .
Either the black girl was Photoshopped in with this laptop on the Towson University campus … or there ’s a ghostly white girl in the machine who ’s haunting her .
And quite frankly , both options are equally likely .
7 | One black guy on the boat is enough
This is from last year .
Prince William , as part of his duty in the Royal Navy , was in the Caribbean practicing hurricane rescue drills .
One British newspaper ( The Sun ) ran a photo of the staged rescue … and decided to edit out one of the black locals from the boat .
And they might have gotten away with it ( although the Photoshop job is horrible , leaving the shadow and the knee in there ) … but their rival , The Metro , ran the picture unedited .
8 | Photoshopped diversity in a Lebanon refugee camp
In the summer of 2006 , this photo ran in the New York Times and is a very important lesson about photojournalism .
If you ’re going to Photoshop a black guy into a Lebanese refugee camp for one of the world ’s most respected newspapers , at least take the time to really smooth out the edges around his head .
9 | Company Bistro ’s head transplant
I ’m sure , at some point , after this went to print , some executive ( at the Luxor , where this restaurant is ) said , “ Oh shit , we forgot to also change the color of the girl ’s arms and legs . ”
And another responded , “ Well , maybe people will just think it ’s a shadow . ”
And even though shadow does n’t work that way , I still support their Photoshopping decision .
If I ’m going to have a model cleaving off fish heads , I want her to be as white and blond as possible .
10 | Even Oprah ’s not immune
Something looks strange with this old TV Guide .
Maybe it ’s Oprah ’s head looking huge , or maybe it ’s the fact that she never got that slim … but something looks strange .
And it is .
Turns out TV Guide crudely put Oprah ’s head on Ann - Margret ’s body .
( The pile of cash is more proportional .
Arguably more offensive . )
11 | Photoshopped diversity at the University of Wisconsin , Madison
I ’m just surprised they did n’t try to Photoshop a black person ’s head over the girl in the white sweatshirt … she ’s already making the black power salute , no one would ’ve suspected a thing .

If your car is n't working as well as it should , the next logical step would be to take it to a mechanic , right ?
And if that mechanic tells you he can fix it with a simple , inexpensive repair , most people would get the repair — not junk it and buy a new car !
Unfortunately , that 's exactly what our Democrat - led Congress is doing in its efforts to " reform " our nation 's health - care system .
It is true that many Americans cannot find affordable health coverage .
However , it is the government - imposed barriers that make coverage expensive , especially for the working poor in America .
Fixing these problems would cost the taxpayer absolutely nothing , yet congressional Democrats refuse to consider these no -cost solutions .
The already high cost of insurance is often increased by excessive state regulations .
States have passed more than 1,800 benefit mandates , requiring insurance companies to cover services from hair prostheses ( wigs ) to infertility treatments to acupuncturists to massage therapists .
These state mandates raise the cost of insurance , which , in turn , increases the number of Americans who are priced out of the health - insurance market .
You may be thinking , what if I do n't need a hair prosthesis or infertility treatments ?
Tough luck .
Instead of having a choice in coverage you do need , you 'll likely be paying for health insurance at an exorbitant cost to cover things you may never use or desire .
The solution : Allow American families to purchase health coverage across state lines .
According to a study by the University of Minnesota , 12 million more Americans would be able to buy coverage if this simple solution were enacted into law .
When I began teaching at McMaster University on July 1 , 2001 , I had a pretty unique experience as a new professor .
I was the first person hired into the Communication Studies Program at McMaster University .
The program was so new that it did n’t even exist .
In fact , the program only officially took existence with our first enrolled program students who all had to have taken the two first year courses in 2001 to be able to enroll in 2002 !
I taught the Introduction to Communication , and we were joined by Dr. Laurence Mussio , a successful communications consultant in Toronto , who taught the other first year course in the History of Communication .
That was it .
We were the program .
The newness of our program made my experience as a newly - minted tenure - track faculty member completely atypical .
Graham Knight and I built the program from the ground up .
I have had the opportunity to sit on every hiring committee since the program ’s inception .
I remember the lean days , when we truly offering the program on a shoe string .
It was exciting .
We had hundreds of students , starting in our first year .
Our first graduating class was in 2004 .
It was composed of 17 students – all of whom had already begun in other programs and transferred into communication studies .
The next year we graduated over 60 .
Now we graduate a steady state of about 125 students in our honours and combined honours BA programs .
We have about 5 tenured and tenure - track faculty in communication studies .
This year , we began our Master of Arts in Communication and New Media .
We ’ve been growing constantly .
The ride up to now has been exciting .
It ’s been a story of constant change and growth .
But our situation is stabilising .
We are now beginning to face the challenges of a mature department .
What this has meant for me personally is that I am now getting a sense of what faculty and students in other mature departments have been feeling all along during the last 10 years .
We are n’t atypical anymore .
Faculty and students feel frustration at the fact that classes are so big .
This is not a case of fat cat professors complaining because they have to mark a few more papers .
Rather , this frustration is born of the fact that professors see the future of Canada through a lens that many Canadians do n’t get to peer through .
Professors see that students – especially those who do n’t come from families where parents are not university - educated – need the mentorship of committed , permanent faculty to help them make sense of the university system , the job market and the confusing world of media , politics and money that they are stepping into .
Large classes put up huge barriers to building these mentorship relationships .
Let me take a moment to talk about the larger institutional context .
The Faculty of Humanities at McMaster has been very intelligently managed .
Starting in the late 90s , the faculty has completely revisioned and redefined itself .
It has become very lean , fiscally .
All faculty teach their share of classes .
Research productivity is higher than it has ever been .
Almost every department has reflected deeply on its mandate and mission .
Many have completely re-defined themselves : the French department ( to which I am proudly jointly appointed ) adopted “ Francophonie and Diversity ” as its theme , English added “ Cultural Studies and Critical Theory ” to its program offerings , music and linguistics have redefined themselves along cognitive science lines , and , of course , a new department – Communication Studies and Multimedia – was formed .
At the same time , all the fat was cut .
I sat on the McMaster University Planning and Budget Committees for three years ( 2006 - 08 ) and I can say that , from what I saw and read , there is nothing non-essential to cut in Humanities .
There is no fat .
There are no frills .
There are simply basic needs that are being met : base operating costs , the cost of maintaining a basically safe physical plant and the basic cost of supporting faculty research costs .
No more food at meetings .
No free lunches .
Any budgetary issues in Humanities now are – quite simply – problems of basic income .
That income , however , is not market - based .
We do n’t charge students the full cost of their education .
We rely on government .
Since the Harrris government , there has been a chronic underfunding of higher education .
No subsequent government has restored funding to higher education .
And the underfunding is reaching crisis proportions .
Ontario is 10th among Canadian provinces in its per student investment in higher education .
Roger Martin reports in , “ Who killed Canada ’s Education Advantage ? ” , in the November edition of The Walrus , that faculty - student ratios have risen from 18.8 students per permanent faculty member in 1993 to 24.4 students per faculty member in 2005 .
The greatest education is when students spend some quality time discussing ideas with faculty that were touched upon in class .
When they feel comfortable enough with ideas to chat about them over coffee with one another in spaces that are conducive to such conversations .
The problem is that unless you come from a family background in which such conversations about ideas , culture , science and future plans are common and normal – chances are excellent that you do n’t know how to have them .
They are outside of your ken .
Learning how to converse about your life in a considered way is one of the greatest pleasures and benefits of post - secondary education .
The problem is that this requires time and opportunity .
The opportunity to make the personal contact .
The time to have the conversation .
Both time and opportunity are becoming scarce commodities in the current higher education system .
In our Faculty of Humanities , the one I know best , any cuts now will mean dropping successful programs with high enrollments .
Cuts will mean even bigger classes .
Cuts will mean fewer meaningful conversations between faculty and students .
There are no more “ savings ” to be had .
At risk is our future as a Canadian civil society that encourages social mobility through education .
In fact , we may be graduating young people who are not as well - equipped as previous generations to understand the complicated world they will step into and eventually be in charge of .
This is a terrifying and disheartening prospect that will affect our productivity , our international competitiveness and – most importantly – the health of our democracy and the strength of our social cohesion .
A society that does n’t allow its citizens the time or opportunity to reflect upon itself will crumble under the weight of individual self - interest and short - term thinking .
Governments must invest in higher education .
Ontario parents and students should demand it .
Our future depends on it .

The Shoddy Statistics of Super Freakonomics
Super Freakonomics is getting a lot of flak for its flip contrarianism on climate change , most of which seems based on incorrectly believing solar panels are black ( they 're blue , and this has surprisingly large energy implications ) and misquoting important climate scientists .
But before people begin believing that the problem with Super Freakonomics is that it annoys environmentalists , let 's be clear :
The problem with Super Freakonomics is it prefers an interesting story to an accurate one .
This is evident from the very first story on the very first page of the book .
Under the heading " putting the freak in economics , " the book lays out its premise : Decisions that appear easy are actually hard .
Take , for example , a night of drinking at a friend 's house .
At the end of the night , you decide against driving home .
This decision , the book says , seems " really , really easy . "
As you might have guessed , we 're about to learn that it 's not so easy .
At least if you mangle your statistics .
The next few pages purport to prove that drunk walking is eight times more dangerous than drunk driving .
Here 's how they do it : Surveys show that one out of every 140 miles driven is driven drunk .
" There are some 237 million Americans sixteen and older ; all told , that 's 43 billion miles walked each year by people of driving age .
If we assume that 1 out of every 140 of those miles are walked drunk -- the same proportion of miles that are driven drunk -- then 307 million miles are walked drunk each year . "
" If we assume . "
But why should we assume that ?
As the initial example demonstrates , a lot of people walk drunk when they would otherwise drive drunk .
That substitution alone suggests that a higher proportion of walking miles are drunk miles .
Other people walk , or take transit , when they know they 'll be drinking later .
That 's why they 're walking and not driving .
That skews the numbers and makes it impossible to simply " assume " parity .
Then there 's the implicit assumption that the two types of drunk miles are the same .
But there are a number of reasons to question this presumption .
For one , the miles walked drunk are probably disproportionately urban , while the miles driven drunk are probably disproportionately rural and suburban .
But driving an urban mile drunk is probably a lot more dangerous than driving a rural mile drunk , just as walking an urban mile drunk is probably much more dangerous than walking a rural mile drunk .
For another , the levels of drunkenness probably differ .
A lot of those miles driven drunk are probably miles driven by someone who 's had a couple of glasses of wine and still feels competent to drive , even though their blood alcohol level is a shade above 0.8 .
That is to say , a lot of those miles are driven by someone who 's not very drunk .
A lot of those miles walked drunk are probably walked by someone who is so wrecked that his friends would n't let him drive , or he never would imagine trying .
It is , of course , safer to be less drunk than more drunk when you 're around vehicles , whether you 're walking near them or driving by them .
You can go on and on in this vein .
It 's terrifically shoddy statistical work .
You 'd get dinged for this in a college class .
But it 's in a book written by a celebrated economist and a leading journalist .
Moreover , the topic is n't whether people prefer chocolate or vanilla , but whether people should drive drunk .
It is shoddy statistical work , in other words , that allows people to conclude that respected authorities believe it is safer for them to drive home drunk than walk home drunk .
It 's shoddy statistical work that could literally kill somebody .
That makes it more than bad statistics .
It makes it irresponsible .
But hey , it makes for a fun and unexpected opener .
Robert Buelteman photographs the plant life while sending electricity through them .
The result shows roses , petunias , and even cannabis in astonishing detail .
It has taken the award - winning 55 - year - old 10 years to produce just 80 photos .
Working in complete darkness , he begins by placing his chosen plant onto a metal board which he then passes the electrical surge through .
He can even pinpoint areas where he wants to focus the charge using a wand and a simple car battery .
As his subject lights up with the current , and emits radiation invisible to the naked eye , intuitive Buelteman captured the moments by passing a fibre optic cable back - and - forth over the plant .
The cable emits a beam of white light that is just the size of a human hair and whatever the miniscule torch - beam touches , transfers the image onto film .

If you consider yourself a geek or a nerd or whatever the term du jour is , you should n't just sit behind the computer all day .
You should get up and do something every once in a while .
Here are some projects that every geek ( or nerd ) should complete before they die ...
Build a MAME Cabinet http://www.flickr.com/photos/jennerosity/
/ CC BY 2.0 Sure , a Xbox 360 or PS3 let you play the latest games on your big screen TV , but sometimes you want to go old school and play some of the arcade classic in their original form .
That 's where the multi-arcade machine emulator ( MAME ) cabinet comes in .
Now you can buy one of these cabinets pre-fabricated with games already properly licensed and loaded , but where 's the geek challenge in that ?
Plenty of sites provide plans , components and tips for building your own cabinet .
Since , you 've probably got enough spare parts to build the guts of the machine laying around already , it should n't be too expensive of a project .
If you 're not handy with power tools , it 's probably better to get a little help with your cabinet than to end up with something like this .
Internet Controlled Something
Who keeps turning off the lights ?
http://www.flickr.com/photos/evilerin/
/ CC BY 2.0
It does n't matter if it 's your lights , dishwasher , security cam or what , but you should experience the madness of giving control of something electronic in your house to random people on the Internet .
This guy lets people control the Christmas lights and decorations around his house ( warning bad design and sound ) .
Use your imagination and some home automation tools to experience Big Brother with the bonus of being to pull the plug if you want .
DIY Tesla Coil
What goes better together with geeks than high voltage ?
Not only can this project help you learn about electricity and one of the greatest geeks of all time ( Nikola Tesla ) , but it can kill you too !
You should probably start off with building a smaller one first , before you graduate to the big ones .
Then you can start making music with it .
Geek Costume
Once in your life you need to make an authentic costume of a video game , sci - fi , fantasy , comic character to wow people on Halloween or at the convention .
It may seem completely dorky , but tell me that this guy does n't get the ladies ...
http://www.flickr.com/photos/renpytom/ / CC BY 2.0 Build a Rube Goldberg Machine
It may be frustrating to build , but once it works , it 'll be one of the most satisfying experiences in your life .
So get out your dominos and your bowling balls and get to work .
Here 's a video of one just for inspiration .

Here we go !
NOTE : Please keep in mind that since Sonic 3 was originally planned to be one game , and as such , the music from S&K was also on Sonic 3 when it was released .
Therefore , saying that Howard Drossin composed all the S&K music is ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE .
Within the context of S&K by itself , he can only be credible for the composition of the five new tracks that are completely exclusive to it [ i.e. not found in Sonic 3's Sound Test ] : S&K Title Music , S&K Knuckles '
Theme , S&K 1 - Up , S&K Invincibility / Power Up , and S&K All Clear .*
* The beginning of S&K's Credits is excluded for the following reason :
Sonic 3 Credits :
Michael Jackson with assistance from Brad Buxer , Bobby Brooks , Darryl Ross , Geoff Grace , and Doug Grigsby III ( See link below ) : Carnival Night Zone ( 1 and 2 ) { Jam} , Ice Cap Zone ( 1 and 2 ) { Who is it ?} , Launch Base Zone ( 1 and 2 ) { Bad} , S3 Credits { Stranger in Moscow} , S3 Act 1 Boss { In the Closet} , S3 Knuckles Theme { In the Closet} , Competition Menu { You Rock My World} --->
All featured voice samples / glass breaking ( except Competition Menu - which had NONE *) ; all except S3 Act 1 Boss replaced in S&K Collection for PC * , as S&K Act 1 Boss [ already in Sonic 3 Sound Test unlike the other replacement themes ] completely masked over it just like the original did in regular S3&K .
* Clear - cut indicator of MJ et al. tracks
** Brad Buxer = Keyboardist , orchestrations , and synthesizer programming and sound design for some of MJ 's work ( i.e. HIStory ) , and possibly the " Come on " in Sonic 3's Act 1 Boss .
Bobby Brooks ( Robert Green Brooks ) = Engineer / Programmer and synthesizer programming and sound design for some of MJ 's music ( i.e. HIStory ) (
Darryl Ross = Synthesizer programming and sound design for some of MJ 's music ( i.e. HIStory )
Geoff Grace = Orchestrations in some of MJ 's work ( i.e. HIStory )
Doug Grigsby III = Synthesizer and drum programming and keyboards for some of MJ 's work ( i.e. HIStory / Ghosts )
HIStory reference :
HIStory / Ghosts reference :
Sachio Ogawa : Hydrocity Zone ( Acts 1 and 2 ) -->
Has a groove / vibe the others simply do n't have ; it uses a keyboard in Act 1 and a unique synthesizer in Act 2 [ though it 's extremely low in Act 1 ]
C. Cirocco Jones ( Scirocco ) : Cues for the original versions of Hydrocity and Marble Garden .
Because they were made for MJ and not Sega , it is most likely that they were all trashed , as they were not replaced in S&K Collection .
-" Message to everyone .
This [ Hydrocity ] was not composed by either Michael Jackson nor Howard Drossin .
It was allegedly composed by Scirocco and Brad Buxer , according to a couple sites i had checked ﻿ out .... Brad﻿ and Ciroco did Hydrocity and Marble Garden " - DihDin

Sega Sound Team
** It was Roger Hector , the President at ' ' SEGA Technical Institute ' ' who said that Michael 's original soundtrack never made it into the final game and the employee was Howard Drossin with the help of Jun Senoue and the SEGA Sound Team who replaced most of the music in Sonic 3 .**
Tokuhiko Uwabo ( Bo ) : Most likely non-music related .
Sachio Ogawa :
Yoshiaki Kashima ( Milpo ) : NOT the same person as Yukifumi Makino . (
- Direct contact and the 10th Anniversary CD both confirm that Special Stage is his .
Masaru Setsumaru : Data Select ( via Sonic Jam credits and in - game music similarities ) ; S3 All Clear , Balloon Park , Credits ( S&K ) [ First part ] , 1 - Up ( S&K ) , Power Up ( S&K ) , and All Clear ( S&K ) ( arrangment differences from Nagao and Drossin [ see below ] ) ; Sound Effects
- The use of Continue and 1 - Up ( S&K ) in Sonic 3D Blast are proof of Setsumaru 's association with those tracks .
Furthermore , the arrangement of 1 - Up ( S&K ) is similar to that of Power Up ( S&K ) and All Clear ( S&K ) , the latter of which is similar to both All Clear ( S3 ) and Credits ( S&K ) [ First part ] .
Balloon Park is also credited to him because of its similarities to Continue .
- Later Sonic games where he is credited for SE : Sonic the Hedgehog CD [ Special Thanks ; near top ; nobody else from this list is in game aside from Naofumi ; below Takenobu Mitsuyoshi ] , Sonic 3D Blast ( GEN ) , Sonic Adventure [ on top ] , Sonic Adventure 2 [ only one of them there ] , Sonic ' 06 [ towards the bottom ] , Sonic and the Secret Rings [ towards the bottom ] , Sonic World Adventure / Unleashed [ top ] , Sega Superstars Tennis [ Special Thanks with Naofumi Hataya ] , Sonic and the Black Knight [ on top ] , Sonic & Sega All - Stars Racing [ Towards top with Naofumi and Jun ]
Tatsuyuki Maeda :
- Later Sonic games where he is credited for SE : Sonic 3D Blast ( GEN ) ( and / or BGM ? ) , Sonic Adventure [ below Masaru ] , Sonic Heroes [ very bottom ; below Tomonori ] , Sonic and the Secret Rings [ very bottom ( as " Tatsuya " Maeda ) ] , Sonic World Adventure / Unleashed [ last of two returning names on list ; below Masaru ] , Sonic and the Black Knight [ near bottom ]
- Most common person tied to SE after Masaru ; most likely Sound Effects , but could have also done BGM .
Tomonori Sawada :
- Later Sonic games where he is credited for SE : Sonic Heroes , Sonic Riders and Sonic Riders : Shooting Star Story / Zero Gravity [ no others ] , Sonic and the Secret Rings [ near top ]
- Seems to have the lowest grip on classic Sonic SE .
More likely a BGM composer here .
- Sonic 10th Anniversary implies that he did Sky Sanctuary Zone
Masayuki Nagao :
- Linked to Act 2 Boss and Power Up ( S3 ) ( via Sonic Drift 2 ) --->
Extends to Title ( S3 ) and 1 - Up ( S3 ) ---->
More BGM - based at the time .
* Was previously a Sound Assistant in Sonic 2 , and yet is separated from Ogawa and Milpo , indicating role differences this time around .
- Is most likely to have done BGM for this game based on the fact that he is never credited for Sound Effects in the future , unlike Setsumaru and Maeda .
Jun Senoue : Act Clear , Game Over ( according to someone named Dihdin [ see link below ] )
-" I read in an interview that he only did 2 tracks [ in Sonic 3 ] and those were only the Round Clear and Game Over themes , which were also used in Sonic 3D Blast .
I believe you in a way [ about Angel Island Zone ] , it does sound like his style , but he said himself he did 2 songs , [ so ] I 'm confused . "
- DihDin
http://www.youtube.com/comment_servl...%3DsC-d-AM0gCM
- Later Sonic games where he is credited for SE : Knuckles Chaotix [ Special Thanks ] ( for SE ? ) , Sonic Heroes [ at top ] , Shadow the Hedgehog [ at top ; none of the others are present ] , Sonic Rivals [ Sound Advisor ] , Sonic & Sega All - Stars Racing [ Towards top with Naofumi and Masaru ]
- Composition of Act Clear would not be surprising , given it 's constant reuse in later games , especially those with Jun in them .
- EDIT : Both confirmed by ICEKnight 's hack , as well as Continue and Bonus Stage ( Gumball Machine )
- A previously asked question to Senoue also makes it very clear that he did Bonus Stage ( Magnetic Orbs ) , and it is implied that he also did Bonus Stage ( Slot Machine )
Yukifumi Makino : Timer , Chaos Emerald * Uncredited in - game *
- Arranged ( S3 ) version of Chaos Emerald present in ICEKnight 's hack of Sonic 3D Blast ( GEN ) .
Both composition and arrangement are credited to Makino .
Due to its sound and prevalence in relation to Timer / Drowning , I have to agree with it , especially since Timer / Drowning was confirmed to be Makino 's composition in the Sonic Colors OST .
* Sound Special Thanks *
Howard Drossin : Title ( S&K ) , Knuckles '
Theme ( S&K )
- Lava Reef Zone ( Presence in Sonic 3 credits [ Sound Special Thanks ] implies that he did at least one track found in the S3 Sound Test , as it was before the S&K Title and Knuckles themes were produced [ see Sound Test ] .
Furthermore , Howard 's Sound Special
Thanks credit is removed in S&K , replaced by his Music Composer credit [ which in turn kicked out MJ & Crew ]
- Evidence points toward Lava Reef ( both acts ) , which includes the little booms in the background that were also used in S& K's Knuckles '
Theme and the same drums and guitar between both acts *.
- The S&K main theme ( which extends to S&K Power Up , S&K 1 - Up , and S&K All Clear ) and Knuckles ' S&K theme are both confirmed to be Drossin 's via Sega Tunes : Virtual Sonic 's Sonic and Knuckles Theme (
* Howard claimed in the interview that he only made " single versions " of each track , meaning that none of his tracks were mixed in such a way that they became , say , two different yet similar versions based on the original that were used for 2 acts of a zone .
Lava Reef , however , is the exception because its second act is a completely new composition , with only the melody from the first half or so of the first act remaining in the second act .
Therefore , it is quite possible that Drossin did Hidden Palace as well .
Furthermore , the arrangements of 1 - Up ( S&K ) , Power Up ( S&K ) , and All Clear ( S&K ) are different than that of Title
From what I can gather , the SST credits are listed as such : Advisors [ Director and 2 assistants ] , then SE [ Programmer and 1 or 2 Creators ] , then BGM [ 2 or 3 creators ] .

Athens University rector Christos Kittas was rushed to hospital after protesters broke into the university ’s central Athens offices to occupy them , a police source said .
Media reports said his injuries were light .

In the northern city of Thessaloniki , a Starbucks branch was set on fire and clashes also broke out between protesters and riot police on the sidelines of another large demonstration in 15 - year - old Alexis Grigoropoulos ’ memory .
Around 40 people were detained during the Athens protest , during which a number of shops and banks had their windows smashed .
Police had hoped to avoid a repeat of riots that followed the death of Grigoropoulos last year and caused millions of euros in damages , making dozens of arrests on the eve of the Sunday protest .
Thousands of protesters marched in Athens on Sunday to mark the anniversary .
The demonstration , one of a series planned in the capital and main Greek cities , followed dozens of arrests on Saturday night in a raid on a suspected anarchist hideout and mop -up operations in the capital .

Over 6,000 police were on duty in Athens alone .
Another 3,000 were mobilised in Thessaloniki , local police said .
A family memorial service for the teenager was held early Sunday in the cemetery of Palio Faliro .
His mother appealed for demonstrations in his memory to remain peaceful , media reports said .
Greece ’s recently - elected socialist government , mindful that the 2008 riots that caused millions of euros in damages badly discredited its conservative predecessors , had warned protesters against resorting to violence .

On Saturday , police carried out a series of raids in Athens and detained more than 130 people after two cars were set on fire in the central district of Exarchia , where Grigoropoulos was gunned down last year .
Twelve people , including five Italians and three Albanians , were arrested over the torching of the cars and another 41 people were arrested in the western district of Keratsini after briefly occupying the local town hall .

In a separate raid in the same area , police arrested a further 22 people in what they said was an anarchist hideout .
Officers found two petrol cannisters , sledgehammers and 13 gas masks on the premises , police said
“ The search confirmed prior information that this location was used to create explosives and launch attacks , ” a police statement said .
Around 500 people took part in protest marches in the northern city of Thessaloniki on Saturday night , local police said .
Ten people were arrested after the demonstration , though police said two were for reasons unrelated to the demonstrations .

Another demonstration by students and school pupils will be held on Monday .
Students have occupied dozens of universities and schools to mark the teenager ’s killing , according to staff unions .
Grigoropoulos was shot dead by a police officer who claimed he fired into the air whilst under attack from youths .
A few dozen foreign demonstrators are also believed to have travelled to Greece for the commemoration , a police source said .

The policeman accused of the teenager ’s death is due to go on trial on January 20 charged with homicide .
The trial was originally scheduled to be held this month but judicial authorities postponed it and relocated the proceedings to Amfissa , a town some 185 kilometres ( 115 miles ) northwest of Athens .
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner extends TARP .
WASHINGTON ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The controversial $ 700 billion federal bailout program will be extended through Oct. 3 , 2010 , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said Wednesday .
The Troubled Asset Relief Program will be scaled back and spending limited to newer programs aimed at stopping foreclosures , making loans to small businesses and propping up the credit markets to make loans more available .
" History suggests that exiting prematurely from policies designed to contain a financial crisis can significantly prolong an economic downturn , " Geithner wrote in a letter to congressional leaders .
" We must not waver in our resolve to ensure the stability of the financial system and to support the nascent recovery that the administration and the Congress have worked so hard to achieve . "
Under the TARP law , the bailout program would have expired at the end of December if Geithner had not decided to extend it .
Geithner said that in the end he does not expect to spend more than $ 550 billion and that $ 175 billion will be repaid by the end of 2010 .
His letter also includes a current accounting of TARP :
The government expects to lose $ 42 billion of the $ 364 billion it disbursed in the 2009 fiscal year , which ended on Sept. 30 .
While most observers had expected Geithner to extend the bailout , Republicans have been calling for it to be shut down and have filed legislation to end it .
" The Obama administration just can't seem to let go of the $ 700 billion in ' walking around money ' taxpayers were forced to put on the line to bailout Wall Street last year , " Rep. Jeb Hensarling , R - Texas , said in a statement Wednesday .
" What was supposed to be an emergency capital injection to thaw frozen credit markets has morphed into a revolving bailout fund . "
TARP was enacted in October 2008 after a few tight votes in Congress , including a House rejection that sparked the biggest one - day decline ever in the Dow Jones industrial average .
Its signature provision allowed Treasury to pump capital into big and small banks in an effort to spur lending .
In a report released Wednesday , the bailout watchdog Congressional Oversight Panel said that TARP did prevent financial collapse but has not achieved other goals aimed at helping Main Street , like making loans more available or stemming foreclosures .
Geithner , in his letter , highlights programs that have been turned off or are being shut down .
Among them : a program that backstopped money market funds and another that allowed Treasury to make direct investments in banks .
Of course , Geithner also said that Treasury reserves the right to spend new bailout funds in the event of another financial system emergency .
" As a nation we must maintain capacity to respond to such a threat , " he wrote .
Even President Obama acknowledged that TARP has struggled to win public confidence , in a speech on Tuesday , while calling for the unexpected savings from TARP to free up dollars to pay for new job - growth programs .
" There has rarely been a less loved or more necessary emergency program than TARP , " Obama said .
" Launched hastily under the last administration , the TARP program was flawed , and we have worked hard to correct those flaws and manage it properly . "

Few things life can scare a man as much as losing his hair .
No matter how brave the individual might consider himself to be the thoughts of losing his precious locks is enough to strike fear into the hearts of all men .
The reality is that well over 85 % of men will experience some degree of hairloss during their lifetime .
Indeed 90 % of all men are destined to experience actual baldness – it ’s only a matter of time .
Why do men fear losing their hair so much ?
After all is it really that important ?
That comes down to your own point of view .
There ’s so much emphasis put on hair as a status symbol .
From characters in books to musicians and movie stars .
Those with the thickest hair are always portrayed as the most popular / sexiest / richest guy around .
Conversely if we look at popular entertainment like The Simpsons where the ultimate goofball is a bald guy called Homer .
Bald men are seen as something to be ridiculed more so than anything else .
Or are they ?
How much of the stigma attached to male pattern baldness has to do with the feelings of the person involved versus the prejudice of society .
Does this prejudice even exist ?
It may have but this type of social stigma is becoming historical fact as our society evolves and grows in its understanding and acceptance of all types of people and situations .
Baldness has become not only acceptable but very chic and fashionable in many places .
Bald men are no longer seen as lacking virilty – actually quite the opposite .
Bald is in and seems set to stay that way for a long time to come .
So if baldness is now fashionable why do so many men continue to hide themselves under truly terrible hairpieces ?
Why do many men suffer the excrutiating pain of botched hair transplants ?
Again this comes down to the individuals perception of their own self - worth .
If a man has grown up believing ( or being led to believe ) that his hair is more important than his kindness , ability to love or contribute to society in any great way then when his hair does start falling out he loses all faith in himself .
This is simply because he ’s been ‘ brainwashed ’ into believing that he is nothing without his hair .
This is how the hairloss industry profits from the misery of others .
For anyone reading this who is going through the pain of losing his hair then realize this .
It ’s just hair .
The whole is far more important than the sum of its parts and your hair is just a very small part of you .
Will losing your hair affect your ability to work ?
No .
Will losing your hair make you less desirable ?
No .
Will losing your hair make you less capable of achieving all your dreams ?
Absolutely not .

Mike Tyson will reportedly return to WWE RAW almost eleven years to the day of his first RAW appearance .
Iron Mike will Guest Host RAW and attempt to give the WWE the punching power it will need in a head to head battle for ratings with the Ultimate Fighting Championship on January 11 .
The UFC will be taking their shot at the WWE on January 11 as it will broadcast its first live television special of the year on Spike TV .
The UFC Fight Night is n’t very star - heavy , yet will assuredly cut into the WWE audience .
While most pro wrestling fans have been raving about the Monday Night War on January 04 between the WWE and TNA Wrestling , it is the UFC that will pose the biggest challenge to the WWE in January .
The WWE will answer their challenge with one of the most historical figures of the original Monday Night Wars , Iron Mike Tyson .
Mike Tyson made his first appearance on WWE RAW at the height of the original Monday Night Wars between the WWE and WCW .
Tyson ’s appearance that night has become legendary .
I do n’t think there is a WCW moment that anyone could name from the January 19 , 1998 show , yet most wrestling fans will never forget the moment that “ Stone Cold ” Steve Austin gave Mike Tyson two middle - fingers and the two had to be pulled apart in a brawl .
The moment has become so memorable and pivotal to the WWE ’s success , it was named by WWE.com as the fifth greatest moment in WWE RAW history .
More importantly on that famous night , the WWE had big success in the ratings .
WWE RAW generated a 4.0 rating as opposed to WCW Nitro ’s 4.5 .
While the WWE did lose the battle that night , the event is credited as helping turn around the war .
It was the first rating above a 3.6 in close to six months .
It was less than three months later that the WWE finally beat WCW on a Monday night in the ratings .
This moment was also critical to elevating Steve Austin and garnering mainstream interest for the WWE .
All in all this one of a handful of moments that helped turn the corner and the fortunes of World Wrestling Entertainment and Vince McMahon around .
The move also signifies how seriously the WWE is taking UFC ’s threat on January 11 .
Let ’s be honest .
Bringing back a former WWE star including
The Rock will bring back wrestling fans , but probably would n’t chip into the UFC ’s audience that night .
However , Mike Tyson is someone that a non-WWE fan who watches the UFC may still have some interest in .
Sports fans are still generally fascinated about what Iron Mike could do on live television .
Hell , Mike Tyson attended UFC 98 and the place went nuts when he was put on camera .
I give the WWE a lot of credit .
This was a very astute strategic move from the Vince McMahon playbook .
I do n’t know if Tyson would impact the WWE in 2010 the same way he did in 1998 .
After all Tyson was still boxing , just a few years out of jail , and more importantly less than a year removed from the Evander Holyfield fight where Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfield ’s ear .
I highly doubt that Tyson has that same mainstream intrigue in 2010 , but he could be the perfect cross-over star that the WWE needs to counter the UFC and Dana White ’s Monday night effort .
The last time Tyson was on WWE RAW , it resulted in him participating in WrestleMania as a special guest referee .
I would n’t be surprised if this appearance is the beginning of Tyson ’s involvement in WrestleMania 26 .
Overall , professional athletes have generally been the best non-pro wrestling WWE Guest Hosts .
There have been some misses like Johnny Damon this past week .
However , most fans seem to agree that the WWE RAW episode hosted by Shaquille O’Neal was the most exciting WWE RAW of 2009 .
Tyson is a huge pro wrestling fan and reportedly had a lot of fun the last time he worked with the WWE .
I have talked to several ex-WWE stars who worked with him during that time that have raved about how nice of a guy he was and how easy he was to work with back then .
Tyson follows Floyd Mayweather , Jr. and Ricky Hatton as the third pro boxer to Guest Host WWE RAW since the concept began over the summer .
As of today , the WWE looks to be red hot entering 2010 .
If the rumors are true of Bret Hart hosting January 04 followed by Mike Tyson guest hosting on the 11th , then the WWE will have a ton of momentum coming into the new year .
If this is a sign of things to come , 2010 is going to be one hell of a year for the WWE and WWE fans .
It is quite possible that TNA and the UFC woke up a sleeping giant that has been thirsting for competition for over eight years .
Then again , Jon Heder and Don Johnson will be Guest Hosts on January 18 .
Enjoy the fun while it lasts WWE fans .
Update : WWE.com has updated their website and currently lists Mike Tyson as the Guest Host on January 11 , 2010 .

Update : The leaked European Commission memo is now online .
Negotiations on the highly controversial Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement start in a few hours in Seoul , South Korea .
This week 's closed negotiations will focus on " enforcement in the digital environment . "
Negotiators will be discussing the Internet provisions drafted by the US government .
No text has been officially released but as Professor Michael Geist and IDG are reporting , leaks have surfaced .
The leaks confirm everything that we feared about the secret ACTA negotiations .
The Internet provisions have nothing to do with addressing counterfeit products , but are all about imposing a set of copyright industry demands on the global Internet , including obligations on ISPs to adopt Three Strikes Internet disconnection policies , and a global expansion of DMCA - style TPM laws .
As expected , the Internet provisions will go beyond existing international treaty obligations and follow the language of Article 18.10.30 of the recent U.S. – South Korea Free Trade Agreement .
We see three points of concern .
First , according to the leaks , ACTA member countries will be required to provide for third - party ( Internet Intermediary ) liability .
This is not required by any of the major international IP treaties – not by the 1994 Trade Related Aspects of IP agreement , nor the WIPO Copyright and WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty .
However , US copyright owners have long sought this .
( For instance , see page 19 of the Industry Functional Advisory Committee report on the 2003 US - Singapore Free Trade Agreement noting the need for introducing a system of ISP liability ) .
( Previously available at http://www.ustr.gov/new/fta/Singapore/advisor_reports.htm.)
Second and more importantly , ACTA will include some limitations on Internet Intermediary liability .
Many ACTA negotiating countries already have these regimes in place : the US , EU , Australia , Japan , South Korea .
To get the benefit of the ACTA safe harbors , Internet intermediaries will need to follow notice and takedown regimes , and put in place policies to deter unauthorized storage and transmission of allegedly copyright infringing content .
However , contrary to current US law and practice , the US text apparently conditions the safe harbors on Internet intermediaries adopting a Graduated Response or Three Strikes policy .
IDG reports that :
" The U.S. wants ACTA to force ISPs to " put in place policies to deter unauthorized storage and transmission of IP infringing content ( for example clauses in customers ' contracts allowing a graduated response ) , " according to the [ leaked European ] Commission memo . "
Let 's reflect on what this means :
First , the US government appears to be pushing for Three Strikes to be part of the new global IP enforcement regime which ACTA is intended to create – despite the fact that it has been categorically rejected by the European Parliament and by national policymakers in several ACTA negotiating countries , and has never been proposed by US legislators .
Second , US negotiators are seeking policies that will harm the US technology industry and citizens across the globe .
Three Strikes / Graduated Response is the top priority of the entertainment industry .
The content industry has sought this since the European office of the Motion Picture Association began touting Three Strikes as ISP " best practice " in 2005 .
Indeed , the MPAA and the RIAA expressly asked for ACTA to include obligations on ISPs to adopt Three Strikes policies in their 2008 submissions to the USTR .
The USTR apparently listened and agreed , disregarding the concerns raised by both the US 's major technology and telecom companies and industry associations ( who dwarf the US entertainment industry ) , and public interest groups and libraries .
How does this fit with the oft - repeated statement of the USTR that ACTA will not change US law , which justified the decision to negotiate ACTA as an Executive Agreement outside of regular US Congressional oversight measures ?
That remains to be seen .
The safe harbors in the US Copyright law require ISPs to adopt and reasonably implement a policy for termination of " repeat infringers " " in appropriate circumstances " .
US law currently gives ISPs considerable flexibility to determine what are " appropriate circumstances " justifying the termination of a customer 's Internet account .
If the leak reports are correct , this would no longer be true .
Instead , ISPs would be required to automatically terminate a customer upon a rightsholders ' repeat allegation of copyright infringement at a particular IP address .
Could the USTR be relying on the somewhat specious distinction between a Three Strikes law , and its implementation by a policy adopted by ISPs as part of a gun - to - the - head self regulation regime ?
According to IDG , the leaked European Commission memo also states that the US Internet chapter is " sensitive due to the different points of view regarding the internet chapter both within the Administration , with Congress and among stakeholders ( content providers on one side , supporters of internet freedom on the other ) . "
That 's hardly surprising , given that the ACTA text appears to leave the door open for major changes to the existing national Internet intermediary liability regimes that have been the global status quo since the mid 1990s , and which have underpinned both tremendous Internet innovation , and citizens ' online freedom of expression and the rich world of user generated content that we take for granted today .
European citizens should also be concerned and indignant .
As reported , the ACTA Internet provisions would also appear to be inconsistent with the EU eCommerce Directive and existing national law , as Joe McNamee , the European Affairs Coordinator of EDRi notes :
" The Commission appears to be opening up ISPs to third party liability , even though the European Parliament has expressly said this must n't happen , " McNamee said , adding that ACTA looks likely to erode European citizens ' civil liberties . "
Last , but by no means least .
ACTA signatories will be required to adopt both civil and criminal legal sanctions for copyright owners ' technological protection measures , in line with the US - Korea ( and previous ) FTA obligations .
They will also be required to include a ban on the act of circumvention of technological protection measures , and a ban on the manufacture , import and distribution of circumvention tools .
This will reduce the flexibility otherwise available to countries drafting these sort of laws under the WIPO Copyright Treaty and WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty .
The majority of WIPO 's Member States rejected the circumvention device ban sought by the US delegation in the draft Basic Proposal for the 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty .
Because ACTA is intended to create new global international IP enforcement standards , including these provisions will allow US negotiators to achieve what they have not been able to do to date – ensuring that the US 's overbroad implementation of the WIPO Internet Treaty TPM obligations becomes the global standard .
This should give all citizens - and the ACTA countries negotiating in their names - pause for thought .
Also great coverage of what this means for other countries : Cory Doctorow at Boing Boing ; Michael Geist ( Canada ) ; Kim Weatherall at LawFont here and here and Electronic Frontiers Australia ( Australia ) ; and InternetNZ ( New Zealand ) .
Minority Leader John Boehner , to Politico :
" I 'm still trying to find the first American to talk to who 's in favor of the public option , other than a member of Congress or the administration " said Boehner , whose sole recent foray into a public discussion of health care reform was a tea - party - style event in Ohio a few weeks back .
" I 've not talked to one and I get to a lot of places , " he told reporters at his weekly press availability .
" I 've not had anyone come up to me -- I know I 'm inviting them -- and lobby for the public option . "
Just ponder for a moment about what it means if John Boehner is n't lying -- because as we know , it 's wrong for politicians to lie and they almost never , ever do -- but that he really , honestly has never met anyone who was in favor of the public option during this entire debate .
Let us all pause to reflect the sheer magnitude of the insular , self - inflating bubble that would be required of Boehner to never meet or talk to a single American that thought that way , when 2 /3rds of the country do , and the majority of people in his own state do .
He must roll to and from work in a giant , government - provided hamster ball .
A MAN celebrating his 70th birthday with a parachute jump died from a heart attack as he leapt from the plane on the Gold Coast today .
The Courier - Mail reports the man was doing a tandem jump with Gold Coast Sky Dives when he died about 10.15 am .
It is understood the shock of leaping from the plane caused the heart attack .
He landed at North Kirra Beach with his family watching on .
His buddy jumper and lifeguards tried to revive him but he was pronounced dead at the scene .
When it emerged earlier this year that Obama 's science tsar John Holdren had once , back in 1977 , co-authored a textbook discussing possible methods of population control , among them sterilisation , America 's rightwing fury machine triumphantly seized upon it , dubbing him Obama 's " science fiction tsar " .
Yet with the climate change conference in Copenhagen approaching , how fictitious is the need for population control ?
As Alex Renton noted in November 's Prospect magazine , if the world 's population continues to grow at present rate , by 2050 the globe will need the resources of a second Earth to sustain it .
And if you throw in the projected effects of a warming planet , the problem starts to look as apocalyptic as it did to Holdren , and many others , back in the 1970s .
However world leaders might try to spin this problem , nearly all the ways of tackling climate change involve taking rights away from people – be it their right to fly , to drive , or to heat their patios .
The one thing that would do the opposite , that would empower human beings , would be to give women across the world control over their own bodies .
Plenty of them want it : according to the UN , there are currently more than 200 million women worldwide wanting but unable to get contraception .
So forget ghoulish 1970s notions of compulsory abortions – as Michelle Goldberg points out , feminism has already vanquished these – we can start " controlling " population simply by providing women with basic rights .
In short , population control , and by extension climate change , are feminist issues .
Wherever women have adequate access to contraception , education , the right to work , equality before the law , the birth rate plummets .
And this is where western liberal proclivities towards cultural relativism start to break down .
However much we might want to respect other cultures , those that deny women these rights are directly harming all of us , even if our own society is an equitable , gender - blind utopia .
Unless we want a world ravaged by droughts and floods , we are going to have to start demanding women be treated as equal citizens – everywhere .
In fact , you do n't even have to call it feminism .
You could call it calculated self - interest .
Population control is not something the " developing world " alone needs to wise up to , either .
Quite the opposite .
The one - child policy of China , the world 's fastest developing country , is infamous , yet as a result we already have 300 - 400 m fewer people on the planet .
( Interestingly , China is doing a lot more on climate change in other areas than we assume too ) .
That 's not to suggest that we import China 's birth control policies wholesale – the People 's Republic , after all , is not widely known for its regard for anyone 's rights , female or otherwise .
But we have to do something : one British child pollutes more than 30 children in sub-Saharan Africa do .
And , unlike in Britain , there are pressing economic reasons why women in sub-Saharan Africa need children .
True , many women in rich countries already choose to limit their families ; Britain 's average birth rate per family is a modest 1.97 , roughly average for the developed world .
But this means a vast number of women are still having more than three children and , given the disproportionate bulk of their carbon footprint , they need to be persuaded not to .
This does n't have to take the shape of draconian legislation , but rather positive incentives .
We should not deny women autonomy over their own bodies ( as many pro-life campaigns seek to ) , but we could make child benefits for smaller families much more generous .
We could also offer middle - class families generous tax breaks if they have two children or less .
This is n't taking away people 's rights , it 's just weighting the options differently – and , in turn , better protecting the rights of others who share this planet .
You do n't even have to believe in global warming to come to this conclusion ; you can still have your head firmly in the sand about the fact that humans are having an effect on the temperature of this planet .
The population question exists outside this issue .
It 's simply a matter of maths : the Earth can only host a finite number of people .
And surely educating and bettering the lives of the world 's women , for whatever purpose , is no bad thing ?

O.K. , can we all agree that Barack Obama has finally accomplished something in his presidency ?
Yesterday , his Justice Department issued a memorandum to federal prosecutors in the 14 states that have approved the use of medical marijuana , instructing them not to go after patients and doctors who are following the laws of their states .
“ It will not be a priority to use federal resources to prosecute patients with serious illnesses or their caregivers who are complying with state laws on medical marijuana , ” said Attorney General Eric Holder Jr .
The move brought praise from a wide range of opinionland commenters .
“ After several false starts , the Obama administration is making all the right noises on federal medical marijuana policy , ” says Nick Gillespe at Reason .
“ The devil is in the details , of course , and how the policy is enforced ( or not ) .
But it represents the most compassionate and sensible policy to come out of Washington in a very long time . ”
“ This is an extraordinary victory for sensible federalism ( not to mention for a sane drug policy ) , ” writes Rick Hills at Prawfsblawg .
“ This is one of those rare instances of unadulterated good news from Washington , ” writes Glen Greenwald .
Criminalizing cancer and AIDS patients for using a substance that is ( a ) prescribed by their doctors and ( b ) legal under the laws of their state has always been abominable .
The Obama administration deserves major credit not only for ceasing this practice , but for memorializing it formally in writing .
Just as is true for Jim Webb ’s brave crusade to radically revise the nation ’s criminal justice and drug laws , there is little political gain — and some political risk — in adopting a policy that can be depicted as “ soft on drugs ” or even “ pro-marijuana . ”
It ’s a change that has concrete benefits for many people who are sick and for those who provide them with treatments that benefit them .
So credit where it ’s due to the Obama DOJ , for fulfilling a long - standing commitment on this issue .
Not everyone is thrilled with the president ’s move .
At National Review , Wesley J. Smith says “ it is subversive of the rule of law for a president to refuse to enforce the law , and particularly to announce that unenforcement will be administration policy . ”
The correct answer to the medical - marijuana issue is for Congress to take it out of Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances
Act ( no legitimate medical use ) and put it into a different schedule , which would allow the FDA to approve cannabis for prescribing , as is done with stronger drugs such as morphine and cocaine .
Once presidents get to pick and choose which laws they will enforce , we have ceased to be a nation of laws .
Smith ’s colleague Rick Brookhiser counters , “ A policy as sensible , humane and badly needed as this should simply be saluted . ”
Fourteen states allow some use of medical marijuana .
They include every shade of blue and red , green and red meat : From Barack ’s Hawaii to Sarah ’s Alaska , from libertarian Nevada to Ben & Jerry ’s Vermont .
They also include California , the largest state in the nation .
Most of these laws were passed by popular referendums , as the people took a legally sanctioned end - run around their more stolid representatives .
The Supreme Court has ruled , rightly as a matter of law , that federal law takes precedence over these state measures .
But Washington now ackowledges , rightly as a matter of prudence and practical justice , that the will of the people of 14 states should be taken into account .
I have always argued that medical - marijuana laws are not an exception to my conservative credo , but a natural item .
Law and order is not served by passing laws that bring the system into contempt ; liberty is not served by inserting the state between patients and their doctors ; and morality is not served by withholding help from the sick .
I am sorry that the honor of this change belongs to a liberal Democrat ; glad , for the sake of the law and for the sick , that the change has come .
At the League of Ordinary Gentlemen , E. D. Kain also praised the president ’s move “ in terms of states ’ rights , patient rights , and just sane , rational domestic policy , ” and noted that Obama is “ joining the rest of the United States in an upward trend toward support for legalization .
In fact , Americans now favor legalization at 44 percent – a new U.S. high . ”
Kain is referencing a new Gallup survey released yesterday , which showed continued growth in the number of Americans supporting legalization .
“ U.S. public support for legalizing marijuana was fixed in the 25 percent range from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s , ” reported Gallup , “ but acceptance jumped to 31 percent in 2000 and has continued to grow throughout this decade . ”
At Hot Air , Allapundit says do n’t get too excited , just yet anyway .
The overall pro-pot percentage is continuing to rise , but the regional and party breakdowns in the Gallup data are “ actually pretty discouraging . ”
Only 28 percent of Republicans support legalization , and regionally , only in the west does it enjoy majority approval .
( In the midwest , which looks set to have an outsized role in presidential elections in 2012 and going forward , it ’s at 42 percent . )
I was thinking this morning that the positive bipartisan buzz
The One ’s getting for the DOJ ’s new federalist policy on medical marijuana might tempt him to consider a broader legalization effort — which he once kinda sorta supported — but these numbers make it unlikely .
Even with support at an all - time high he ’s still 10 points in the hole , and with ObamaCare on his plate and the looming meltdown of Medicare and Social Security , ai n’t no way no chance no how either side ’s going to further antagonize high - turnout seniors by defending the demon weed .
Exit question : 72 percent of conservatives oppose legalization ?
Pathetic .
If it ’s still wait - and - see for the country as a whole , Robert Cruickshank says the moment of legalization is fast approaching in California .
“ This week California is witnessing a fundamental shift in marijuana policy , where for perhaps the first time it really is a question of ‘ when , ’ and not ‘ if , ’ the sale and use of marijuana will become legal in California . ”
When an April Field Poll found 56 percent of Californians back marijuana legalization , it became only a matter of time before the topic became a fully mainstream subject , deemed appropriate for “ serious ” conversation at everything from public policy summits to the dinner table .
. . .
The biggest news comes from the federal government , where Attorney General Eric Holder has followed through on his early signals and announced the Justice Department will no longer prosecute people for using medical marijuana in accordance with their state ’s laws .
. . .
Whether the Obama Administration intends it or not , the new policy will be further evidence that a strict federal “ War on Drugs ” is no longer desirable or viable .
Here in California , more fundamental changes are under way .
As a judge rules LA DA Steve Cooley ’s attack on dispensaries to be invalid , the movement for full legalization is well under way .
Tom Ammiano ’s bill to legalize , regulate , and tax marijuana , AB 390 , will get its first hearing in the Assembly next week .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , speaking at a bill signing ceremony in Merced yesterday , said he is “ basically opposed ” to legalization but believes it ’s time to have a debate about the issue .
In Arnold - speak that says he does n’t see legalization as a political loser , even if he ’s not quite willing to go there himself .
His comments show that legalization has gone from being a sensible idea on the fringes of our political discourse to something we can debate as easily and naturally as , say , water policy .
Noting the progress toward legalization and ending the War on Drugs , Al Giordano wants to make a point about how we got here , one that “ is worth study by all who clamor for progress on many fronts : from bringing about national health care to ending the U.S. embargo of Cuba to immigration reform to overhauling an entire economic system . ”
That lesson is community organizing , one step at a time , change from below .
In the mid-1990s , some forward - thinking advocates of drug policy reform concluded that the big , central matter — whether recreational drugs should be legalized or not — was simply too big and confusing a matter for so much of the public to tackle all at once .
Even the matter of legalizing relatively harmless marijuana was overwhelming in terms of public opinion .
As the Gallup poll graph above recounts , in 1996 only 25 percent of Americans favored legalizing marijuana , with 73 percent opposed .
Any organizing strategy under such overwhelming negative numbers that chose polarization over organizing was doomed to fail .
And so some pioneering voices and organizers set about on a path of incremental change .
They chose to hit hard upon a brittle crack in the drug war artifice : that even if three - quarters of Americans did not then want cannabis legalized for everyone , a critical mass had grave misgivings about policies that persecuted people who were ill — with glaucoma , cancer , AIDS , MS and other ailments – and needed the plant as medicine .
The debates today over health care and other matters seamlessly echo those that took place among drug policy reform advocates in the mid-90s .
Those who embarked on a strategy of incremental change were often vilified by natural allies who said that such a step - by - step path did not move fast or far enough .
In some cases , entire organizations were shattered and splinter groups formed in their place , competing for the same supporters and funding .
We all know how that story goes .
Friendships in that milieu of drug policy reform , too , were lost in the divisions , egos and hard feelings .
There have always been , and perhaps always will be , those who argue that by urging incremental change a movement abandons its core principles .
But in the end , history moves one step at a time , and more often than not it is those who walk rather than sprint that emerge triumphant .
. . .
The history textbooks will note forevermore , when looking back at how the United States repealed pot prohibition ( something that will likely now come in most of our lifetimes ) that it was the strategy of incremental change that opened the floodgates to fundamental change .
The same will be said of how the US embargo of Cuba was ended ( granting Cuban - Americans the right to travel there inexorably will extend that freedom to all US citizens ) .
The same will be written of immigration policy .
And — if you can weed through the griping about whether this year ’s health care reform goes far enough or not – I think a similar path of incremental steps to change will provoke a very similar dynamic toward wholesale change .
Short of revolutions – which happen when incremental change is made impossible by the authoritarian nature of regimes – that is how change usually happens .
In the meantime , Andrew Sullivan would like everyone to please realize this is a serious issue , and cut out all the lame pot jokes .
“ I really wish we could get past the stoner humor aspect of medical marijuana . ”

The net birth / death model component figures are unique to each month and exhibit a seasonal pattern that can result in negative adjustments in some months .
These models do not attempt to correct for any other potential error sources in the CES estimates such as sampling error or design limitations .
Note that the net birth / death figures are not seasonally adjusted , and are applied to not seasonally adjusted monthly employment links to determine the final estimate .
The most significant potential drawback to this or any model - based approach is that time series modeling assumes a predictable continuation of historical patterns and relationships and therefore is likely to have some difficulty producing reliable estimates at economic turning points or during periods when there are sudden changes in trend .
Household Data
In October , the number of unemployed persons increased by 558,000 to 15.7 million .
The unemployment rate rose by 0.4 percentage point to 10.2 percent , the highest rate since April 1983 .
Since the start of the recession in December 2007 , the number of unemployed persons has risen by 8.2 million , and the unemployment rate has grown by 5.3 percentage points .
Among the major worker groups , the unemployment rates for adult men ( 10.7 percent ) and whites ( 9.5 percent ) rose in October .
The jobless rates for adult women ( 8.1 percent ) , teenagers ( 27.6 percent ) , blacks ( 15.7 percent ) , and Hispanics ( 13.1 percent ) were little changed over the month .
The civilian labor force participation rate was little changed over the month at 65.1 percent .
The employment - population ratio continued to decline in October , falling to 58.5 percent .
The number of persons working part time for economic reasons ( sometimes referred to as involuntary part - time workers ) was little changed in October at 9.3 million .
These individuals were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full - time job .
Persons Not in the Labor Force
About 2.4 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force in October , reflecting an increase of 736,000 from a year earlier .
( The data are not seasonally adjusted . )
These individuals were not in the labor force , wanted and were available for work , and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months .
They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey .
Among the marginally attached , there were 808,000 discouraged workers in October , up from 484,000 a year earlier .
( The data are not seasonally adjusted . )
Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them .
The other 1.6 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in October had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities .

I consider these job losses to be depression level totals .

Rosetta 's observations during the third Earth swingby
10 November 2009
Rosetta is currently on its inbound trajectory towards Earth for the mission 's final gravity assist manoeuvre .
On 13 November , at about 7:46 UT , the spacecraft will swing by Earth at an altitude of 2481 km .
Approximately 8 hours later , as Rosetta continues on its outbound trajectory it will pass the Moon at a distance of about 233 000 km ( the average distance between the Earth and Moon is 384 400 km ) .
This swingby is crucial to the mission and therefore spacecraft operations take top priority during the gravity assist manoeuvre .
However , several instruments on the Rosetta spacecraft will be active during the swingby .
Between 8 and 18 November , when not conflicting with the swingby mission operations , the spacecraft will regularly perform slews to adjust its attitude and allow pointed observations of the Earth and Moon with the Rosetta instrument suite .
Instruments and objectives
The instruments that are active during the Earth swingby will perform both science observations and calibration measurements .
These measurements are used to characterise the performance of the various instruments and to prepare for the science observations scheduled for later in the mission , specifically those planned during the encounter with asteroid Lutetia and , ultimately , with comet 67P / Churyumov - Gerasimenko .
The calibration measurements consist mainly of obtaining reference images and spectra as well as flat field measurements , both for the science observations made during the swingby and for absolute instrument calibration .
In addition , two parts of a boresight campaign are scheduled for 8 and 18 November to determine the relative boresights of the four remote sensing instruments : ALICE , MIRO , OSIRIS and VIRTIS .
The active instruments and their main science objectives are listed in the table below .
Instruments which are active during the Earth swingby ALICE Ultraviolet imaging spectrometer - Gather Earth aurora data - Measure high energy electrons in magnetosphere - Study lunar atmosphere with stellar occultation MIRO Microwave instrument for detecting continuum emission and obtaining spectra - Look for water in the Moon 's spectrum OSIRIS Dual camera instrument for imaging at optical , near infrared and near ultraviolet wavelengths - Gather Earth aurora data - Search for lunar sodium and OH tail , during lunar straylight calibration - Imaging of the Earth and Moon ( also for calibration ) RPC
Set of 5 instruments to study the local plasma environment - Monitor the Earth 's plasma environment and perform magnetospheric studies for a period of one week around closest approach VIRTIS Visible and infrared thermal imaging spectrometer - Study Earth 's atmosphere ( non-LTE emission , and oxygen airglow )
The four remote sensing instruments ( ALICE , MIRO , OSIRIS and VIRTIS ) will make pointed observations of the Earth and the Moon .
The RPC suite of instruments requires an attitude within a certain solar aspect angle range for its in - situ measurements during the swingby .
This attitude will be fulfilled whenever it does not conflict with the requirements for the remote sensing instruments .
In addition to the scientific instruments , the spacecraft 's standard radiation environment monitor ( SREM ) will be on during the entire swingby .
It will be used to determine the spatial distribution of the Earth 's radiation belts along Rosetta 's trajectory as the spacecraft passes the Earth .
Instrument tests
Some observations made during the swingby serve to perform specific instrument tests .
These include observations with OSIRIS ( Moon tracking as a test for the comet observations ) , RPC ( interference test ) , and with the navigation camera NAVCAM ( test of asteroid flyby mode for the Lutetia flyby in July 2010 - verify NAVCAM 's ability to track Lutetia at its maximum angular diameter ) .

Regular data transfer from Rosetta
During the Earth swingby operations , several ground stations are used to monitor and track the spacecraft .
The regular passes over these stations will also be used to receive the data obtained during the observations made by the Rosetta instruments .
The majority of the passes are over the ESA ground station in New Norcia , with additional passes over the ESA ground station in Kourou , and two NASA DSN stations : Goldstone and Madrid .
Within the Consolider HOPE project ( projects funded by the Ministry of Innovation and Science ) , a group of scientists at Universidad Pablo de Olavide ( UPO ) , headed by Juan Antonio Anta , are working on the optimisation of a type of photovoltaic cell ( Grätzel cell ) that artificially mimics photosynthesis .
Grätzel cells are photovoltaic devices that take advantage of the interaction of a structured semiconductor less than nanometre in size and an organic dye that acts as a solar collector .
According to Elena Guillén , member of UPO 's Coloides y Celdas Solares Nanoestructuradas ( Nanostructured Colloids and Solar Cells ) Group , this dye can be either synthetic or natural and can even enable the use of chlorophyll for this type of cell .
Thus , researchers at UPO have begun a study with which they hope to increase the efficiency of these eosin or mercurochrome - based organic components by incorporating ionic salts , known as green solvents , with a view to preventing evaporation of the liquid compounds and the consequent reduction in efficiency .
Previous studies show that ionic salts are less volatile and it is this characteristic that the group headed by Professor Anta seeks to exploit .
" Notwithstanding its liquid state , these types of solvents have high viscosity levels and , therefore , during the coming months we will continue our study , working on different alternatives within ionic liquids , their synthesis , etc. , " comments Elena Guillén .
The pros and cons of the new generation
Although there are already some third generation cells on the market ( for example , for recharging mobile phones ) , according to the researchers their practical use is anecdotal .
However , due to their properties of flexibility and variety of colours and shapes , the future of these cells lies in new market niches such as decoration or use in coloured windows that not only allow light through but use this light to generate electricity .
On the other hand , apart from the rapid amortisation of energy production costs - estimated in one year 's use - , there is also the low cost of the materials .
" Organic materials are usually cheaper , " affirms the researcher , despite which the search continues for an alternative organic dye to the one currently used , derived from ruthenium .
" The paradox lies in the fact that if one uses these cells because their competitive edge is that they are cheaper and more readily available , and then one uses a dye based on a precious metal , what is the advantage ? " points out Elena Guillén .
On the other hand , the researchers are aware that it is a relatively new technology - this type of cell was invented in 1991 - that still need to be greatly developed .
Furthermore , the maximum efficiency obtained in laboratory is only 11 % , which is competitive but it drops when extrapolated to an industrial scale .
The main technological challenge is currently the problem of cell degradation .
" If you use an organic dye , it can be degraded by the action of sunlight , with the consequent reduction in useful life compared to silicon cells .
On the other hand , " the researcher highlights , " our group is working on one of the key aspect for improving cell stability - elimination of the need to use liquids that can present problems with evaporation , etc. and for which , as already mentioned , our focus is on the use of ionic salts . "

Superorganism
It 's impossible to talk about The Superorganism without first mentioning Bert Hölldobler and E. O. Wilson 's most famous collaboration - a book called simply The Ants .
I 've been fascinated with ants since childhood , and The Ants is one of my favourite books - deep enough to be intellectually satisfying on almost any detail , and broad enough to be one of those rare books that summarizes nearly everything to be said about its subject .
It 's hard to avoid platitudes like " authoritative " and " magisterial " when talking about a book like this , so I will resort to a simple computer science analogy :
The Ants is to the study of ants what The Art of Computer Programming is to the study of algorithms .
Only more so , because unlike Knuth , Hölldobler and Wilson actually completed their survey in 1990 .
It should be no surprise then , that I had The Superorganism on pre-order as soon as I heard that Hölldobler and Wilson were publishing their first new book in almost two decades .
The Superorganism expands on a theme that also lies at the heart of The Ants - the workings of insect societies .
The Superorganism paints with a broader brush than its predecessor , touching frequently on the other great families of eusocial insects - termites , bees and wasps .
Atta cephalotes , Costa Rica
If you have n't delved into the world of social insects before , you 're in for a treat .
The range and complexity of social insect behaviour can be weirder and more wonderful than anything found in science fiction .
Consider , for example , the lives of what the authors call the " ultimate superorganism " : the Attine leafcutter ants .
The remarkable fact about the leafcutters is that they are farmers , cultivating vast fungal gardens that provide them with essential nutrients .
These fungal gardens are grown on a substrate of leaf - matter , and leafcutters get their name from the fact that colonies cut up enormous quantities of leaves to transport back to their nests - one mature colony was estimated to harvest a leaf area of 4550 square meters per year .
The fungus gardens are the lifeblood of the leafcutter colony , and they are tended with endless patience and skill .
Leaves brought back to the nest are snipped up , molded into pellets , and carefully planted with fungal hyphae taken from elsewhere in the garden .
Workers patrol the fungal gardens ceaselessly , weeding out foreign fungal strains and other contaminants .
The ants secrete antibiotics that inhibit the growth of other fungi , and produce growth hormones that enhances the growth of their own strain .
They wage an endless battle against Escovopsis , a parasitic species of fungus that specialises in invading Attine leafcutter gardens .
Remarkably , an important part of their arsenal is a second symbiont : a bacterium that only occurs on the cuticle of leafcutter ants , which produces powerful antibiotics specific to the fungal pest .
The ants grow these bacterial weapons on special patches of cuticle , modified specifically to house them .
There is also a degree of communication between the ants and their garden fungus .
Leafcutter ants are sensitive to the chemicals signals released by distressed fungus , and learn to avoid food that harms their gardens .
When a new queen leaves the nest to mate and establish a colony of her own , she carries a sample of the fungus from her parent colony in a cavity next to her oesophagus .
Once she has found a likely nesting spot , she spits out the fungal sample , and tends the growing cultivar as closely as she does her own offspring , feeding it with secreted fluid , while she herself subsists off her own bodyfat .
Once the first brood of workers have been raised , the queen assumes her proper position as the egg - laying machine at the center of the colony , feeding on unfertilized eggs laid by her workers .
If her colony is successful , she will produce about 20 eggs a minute , 24 hours a day , resulting in between 150 and 200 million offspring during her life .
The colony can consist of several million ants at any one time .
This population is housed in a colossal nest - one typical example had 1920 chambers with 238 fungus gardens .
To build it , the ants had to shift 40 tonnes of soil .
The nest itself is designed to provide optimal ventilation and humidity for the fungal gardens , and is continually adjusted by the ants to achieve the right conditions .
Stretching out from the nest is a set of foraging tunnels that surface into a web of trunk routes along which leaf material is brought back to the nest .
Trunk routes are meticulously maintained , with " road workers " clearing debris and encroaching vegetation .
Within the ant population there are a range of physical castes , each adapted to a specific set of jobs .
The smallest workers maintain and patrol the fungal gardens .
The largest are gigantic supersoldiers that specialise in deterring vertebrate predators .
Underpinning all of this is a sophisticated chemical communication system , involving a huge array of pheromones , and an incredibly sensitive sensory system .
Hölldobler and Wilson cite research that shows that one milligram of the trail pheromone of Atta texana is enough to lead a worker 60 times around the Earth .
Ponder for a moment the immense behavioural complexity required to sustain a sophisticated insect civilization like this .
There are an extraordinary number of behaviours that need to be optimized , many of which read like they are straight from the pages of a programming competition .
Foraging strategies need to be devised to efficiently discover food sources .
Once a food source is discovered , its value needs to be estimated , and the right fraction of the colony 's labour pool needs to be allocated to exploit it .
Throughput needs to be optimised by selecting the right leaf fragment size , while minimizing the significant energetic cost of cutting leaves up smaller than necessary .
The cost of constructing and maintaining the web of trunk routes needs to be weighed against the efficiency benefits gained ( it turns out that they can improve foraging speed tenfold ) .
There are many , many other interesting sub- problems like these , and the colony solves them all admirably .
The entire system reminds one of a super - complicated real - time strategy game , and we can be forgiven for suspecting that there must be some hyper - intelligent controller micromanaging a Zerg - like expansion of the nest .
Here , however , we come to perhaps the most remarkable fact about social insects : their colonies are leaderless .
There is no central strategist at all - their entire range of sophisticated behaviour is emergent , arising from the aggregate actions of many small simple units with only local information .
And yet , millions of ants can act with such apparent coherence and purpose that biologists like Hölldobler and Wilson have started thinking of colonies as organisms in themselves - " superorganisms " that compete , mate , and strive for survival .
Humanity has not yet learned how to cross the chasm that separates the individual ant from the superorganism .
We 've seen the early glimmers of technologically produced distributed systems - one thinks of things like the Internet , peer - to - peer networks , and maybe some nebulous social constructs like " the blogosphere " .
The fact is , however , that we are simply incapable of designing distributed systems that even begin to approach the robustness and intricacy of insect colonies .
$! superorg ! $ is certainly not a manual for applying insectiod principles of distributed engineering to technological problems .
It is , however , the best available overview of the best distributed systems we know of , and for that reason alone should be on every intellectually curious computer scientist 's bookshelf .
Bees : resource allocation , peer - to - peer communication and tiered architectures
The essential form of the honeybee waggle dance , p. 170 of The Superorganism .
Reproduced here with the kind permission of its creator , Margaret Nelson
That 's all very exciting , but it 's not very concrete .
So , for the second part of this review , I 'll look at one example of distributed problem solving covered in $ ! superorg ! $ , and explore its fascinating parallels with computer science .
The best - studied insect society is surely that of Apis mellifera , the honeybee .
In 1947 Karl von Frisch famously decoded part of the " dance language " of the honeybee , showing that the bee waggle dance was used to convey precise information about the distance , direction and quality of a food source to nearby bees .
The amazing discovery that bees conveyed complex abstract notions of this type to each other gave us an early insight into the wonder of social insect communication .
Over the years since von Frisch 's discovery , it has gradually emerged that the waggle dance is just one of a complex set of signals used to implement a distributed resource allocation strategy inside the bee colony .
The bees in a hive are loosely specialised into " foragers " , who go out of the hive to gather food , and " nectar processors " , who remain in the hive to receive nectar from incoming foragers for processing and storage .
When a forager returns to the nest laden with pollen and nectar , it searches until it finds a free processor to accept its cargo .
The first optimisation problem the hive faces is to balance these two populations of specialists , minimising the waiting time for foragers dropping off their cargos as well as idle time for processors waiting to accept them .
The second optimisation problem arises from the fact that the supply of nectar sources is not constant - if a new grove of flowers in bloom is discovered , the hive has to divert resources to exploit it as quickly as possible , adjusting the number of foragers and processors to match .
This is complicated by the fact that not all nectar sources are equal : some might be particularly rich , and therefore require more foragers to exploit .
A particular bee hive might be extracting nectar from a number of flower patches at the same time , and foragers need to be allocated optimally , and continually re-balanced .
Remarkably , the bee colony accomplishes these goals without any central co-ordination , using an entirely distributed algorithm .
To see how they do this , we need to flesh out the bee dance language somewhat .
Hölldobler and Wilson describe three basic bee dances :
Waggle dance :
The famous dance discovered by von Frisch , which directs forager bees to a specific resource with precise information on the location and distance .
: The famous dance discovered by von Frisch , which directs forager bees to a specific resource with precise information on the location and distance .
Shaking dance : Recruits more bees to foraging , sending them to the dance floor to look for waggle dancers .
: Recruits more bees to foraging , sending them to the dance floor to look for waggle dancers .
Tremble dance : Induces waggle dancers to stop dancing , and recruits bees to nectar processing .
These dances are signals that provide the communications framework for the " bee algorithm " , sketched out by Hölldobler and Wilson in the following set of decision rules :
1 | Not enough nectar collectors in the field ?
If yes , and you also have immediate knowledge of a producing flower patch , perform the waggle dance .
2 | Is the flower patch rich or the weather fine or the day early or does the colony need substantially more food ?
Perform the dance with appropriately greater vivacity and persistence .
3 | Not enough active foragers to send into the field ?
Perform the shaking maneuver .
4 | Not enough nectar processors in the hive to handle the nectar inflow ?
Perform the tremble dance .
So , how do bees decide if there are too many foragers or too many nectar processors , using purely local information ?
The answer is simple and elegant : if a returning forager experiences a wait time of 20 seconds or less before finding a nectar processor , they assume that there is a surplus of processors and recruit more bees to foraging through the waggling dance .
If they experience a wait time of 50 seconds or more , they assume that there are too many foragers , and use the tremble dance to both reduce the number foragers and increase the number of processors .
Notice that all the signals used in this system are " peer to peer " - bees only communicate with nearby bees that are in the hive at the moment of communication .
The system described above is clear enough to implement easily , and there is a rich range of parallels with computer science .
It 's not surprising , therefore , that a a bit of searching through the literature shows that a number of computer scientists have started mining the bee resource allocation algorithm for ideas .
One nice example comes from Sunil Nakrani and Craig Tovey , who have successfully applied a subset of the behaviour outlined above in a paper called On Honey Bees and Dynamic Allocation in an Internet Server Colony .
Consider a hypothetical data center of servers used to implement a hosted application environment .
Each application is backed by a dynamic pool of virtual servers , and servers can be added to or removed from the pools transparently .
There is , however , a switching cost to moving resources about - re-allocating a virtual server involves server downtime and therefore lost revenue .
Application load varies unpredictably - one day an application might be getting three hits a day , and the next it might crop up on Reddit and have a massive load spike .
The hosting company is paid based on usage - say , per HTTP request served - and faces the complex problem of optimally allocating its server resources to minimize downtime and maximize revenue .
Nakrani and Tovey approach this problem by mapping the bee resource allocation system onto the server allocation problem .
In this mapping , foraging bees are the servers , and flower patches are the applications .
In nature , the bee recruitment signal - the waggle dance described above - is triggered if a flower patch is sufficiently " profitable " .
The more profitable the nectar source , the greater the " vivacity and persistence " of the recruitment signal .
Nakrani and Tovey simulated a system where servers used a central advertboard to post recruitment adverts .
In broad terms , Nakrani and Tovey 's servers were more likely to read a random advert from the advertboard , and switch to a different application , when their current application was less profitable .
On the other hand , a server was more likely to post an advert to recruit more servers to its application , if its application was more profitable .
The result is a distributed algorithm that performs within about 11.5 % of an omniscient resource allocator with complete knowledge of all future HTTP requests .
Interestingly , Nakrani and Tovey also had something to teach entomologists .
They found that while the bee recruitment algorithm performed superbly when there was a lot of variability in application load , it was outperformed by much simpler algorithms when load was relatively static .
Their simulation therefore seems to indicate that the bee recruitment algorithm is an adaptation to variability in nectar sources .
While this blog post focuses on what computer scientists can learn from insects , the possibility that information might flow the other way is a fascinating one .
When I first read about the loose specialisation in the beehive , with foragers handing over their load to processors , my immediate thought was that this described a tiered architecture .
Now , there are a number of sound non-architectural reasons why a colony would want to have some bees specialise in foraging .
Foragers tend to be the older bees in the colony , and this makes complete sense .
Foraging is a hazardous activity , and bees have a limited lifespan .
Sending out bees that are approaching the end of their lives anyway is good economics .
Hölldobler and Wilson write that this specialisation
... causes a problem for the honeybee colony :
How can the rate of food collection , particularly of nectar , and the rate of food processing be kept in balance ?
The computer scientist in me suspects that there may be a different way to look at this aspect of bee behaviour .
In computing we produce tiered architectures with independent layers because they improve efficiency and flexibility in various ways .
I can't help but wonder if a similar benefit might support this aspect of bee behaviour .
Postscript
One last note before I 'm done .
Karl von Frisch once said that
... the life of bees is like a magic well .
The more you draw from it , the more there is to draw .
There are some 20,000 species of bee in the world , ranging from solitary species to the great super - societies of domestic honeybees .
There are 14,000 species of ants , 4,000 species of termite , and more than 100,000 species of wasp .
Each of these species is a unique product of evolution 's boundless ingenuity , and each has its own suite of solutions to the problems of survival .
When one of these species disappears - and they are doing so at a terrifying rate - the tragedy is not simply that something beautiful is irretrievably gone from the world , but also that we have lost another irreplaceable magic well to study , learn from , and emulate .
E. O. Wilson has devoted much of the latter years of his life to the great cause of preserving our biological legacy - if you are interested in this urgent issue ( and you should be ) I recommend his 2002 book The Future of Life .
[ Everett ] is at it again with Prometheus , an arm mounted flame thrower .
This is the third generation of the project and makes some huge advances over the second generation we saw last year .
We ’d say he ’s reached cinema / stage - performance quality with his design .
The self - contained system is completely arm mounted with a fuel reservoir mounting behind the elbow .
The new version adds an adjustable flow valve actuated by a servo motor to regulate the flame size .
An arc generator has been incorporated to replace the lighter from the last version .
A microcontroller measures wrist angle and takes care of creating the arc and regulating the fuel supply .
Prometheus is small , controllable , and frightening .
See a full demonstration as well as some video of the prototyping process after the break .
Does this make you wonder how much burn cream [ Evertt ’s ] needed over the years ?

Freedom - seekers in New Zealand must still wear protective gear
Two young men caught cycling with no clothes on have escaped charges of offensive behaviour , but received a warning to wear protective headgear .
Local policewoman Cathy Duder was unfazed when she came across the two nude men , both in their early 20s .
" They were more shocked than I was , trying to cover up their bits and pieces with their hands , " she said .
The men were riding around the Coromandel seaside resort of Whangamata on the north - east coast of New Zealand .
When asked for an explanation , the pair replied that " they wanted to experience total freedom " .
Strangely sober
" And I said to them ' the way you 're heading , you 're going to experience total confinement ' , " the officer said , laughing .
She said the men appeared decidedly sober .
" They did n't seem drunk at all .
That 's what worried me , " she joked .
Ms Duder issued them with a stern warning for not wearing helmets and then sent them directly home .
She told the Associated Press news agency that she did not see them again during her shift , and it was not known if they donned helmets and resumed their ride .
Public nudity can attract a charge of offensive behaviour in New Zealand , but Ms Duder said she let the two men go free .
" It was dark and there was no - one else around .
They were jovial young men who had not intended to cause offence , " she said .
A court in Norway on Friday rejected calls from the entertainment industry to force communications giant Telenor to block its customers from accessing popular file sharing website The Pirate Bay .
A court in Norway on Friday rejected calls from the entertainment industry to force communications giant Telenor to block its customers from accessing popular file sharing website The Pirate Bay .
It ruled Telenor and other Internet service providers in Norway cannot be held liable for copyright violations that arise from illegal downloads and that a decision to block websites is better taken by the Norwegian authorities .
If courts forced providers to shut access , " Telenor and other Internet providers , including private companies , may have to do an evaluation on whether an Internet page or service shall be blocked or not , " according to an excerpt of the judgement released by the Norwegian telecoms firm .
" This is an evaluation normally assigned to the authorities , and in the court 's view , today 's situation makes it unnatural to assign such responsibility to private companies , " the court said .
Last year , the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) convinced judges in Denmark to force Tele 2 , an Internet service provider , to shut access to The Pirate Bay .
But Telenor argued that Norwegian legislation could not be applied in the same way as Danish law .
" You can not sue a ladder manufacturer because someone used one of his ladders to commit a burglary , " Atle Lessum , a spokesman for Telenor , told the newspaper Verdens Gang before the hearing .
" We therefore we reject imposed censorship like this , " he added .
Founded in 2003 , The Pirate Bay makes it possible to skirt copyright fees and share music , film and computer game files using bit torrent technology , or peer - to - peer links offered on the site .
None of the material can be found on The Pirate Bay server itself .
The Pirate Bay claims to have some 22 million users worldwide .

Background ( for those who do n't know ) :
E-mail messages obtained by The New York Times show that the lobbyists drafted one statement for Democrats and another for Republicans .
Statements by more than a dozen lawmakers were ghostwritten , in whole or in part , by Washington lobbyists working for Genentech , one of the world ’s largest biotechnology companies .
In the official record of the historic House debate on overhauling health care , the speeches of many lawmakers echo with similarities .
Often , that was no accident .
Ridiculous , right ?
How bad is it ...
“ I oppose this bill but love the appropriate balance it gives to monopolistic biologics ”
Joe Wilson
I have criticized many of the provisions of this bill ( H.R. 3962 ) and rightfully so .
But in fairness , I do believe the sections relating to the creation of a market for biosimilar products is one area of the bill that strikes the appropriate balance in providing lower cost options to consumers without destroying a healthy and functioning industry in this country .
Jerry Moran
Mr. Speaker , after reviewing H.R. 3962 , the Affordable Health Care for America Act , listening to the concerns of Kansans , and visiting Kansas hospitals to speak with doctors , nurses , patients , and administrators , I have concluded that this bill will be harmful to Kansas and I strongly oppose it .
However , I do believe the sections relating to the creation of a market for biosimilar products is one area of the bill that strikes the appropriate balance in providing lower cost options to patients without destroying a healthy and functioning industry in this country .
Kay Granger
Mr. Speaker , I have criticized the majority of the provisions in H.R. 3962 , the Affordable Health Care for America Act , and I will vote against it .
However , I am pleased that H.R. 3962 , as well as the Republican Substitute Amendment that I support , both include language relating to biosimilar products .
Lee Terry
Mr. Speaker , I have criticized many of the provisions of this bill and rightfully so .
But in fairness , I do believe the sections relating to the creation of a market for biosimilar products is one area of the bill that strikes the appropriate balance in providing lower cost options to consumers without destroying a healthy and functioning industry in this country .
Ted Poe
I am strongly against H.R. 3962 , and I will vote against it should it come to a vote on the House floor .
However , I do believe the sections relating to the creation of a market for biosimilar products is one area of the bill that strikes the appropriate balance in providing lower cost options to consumers without destroying a healthy and functioning industry in this country .
Blaine Luetkemeyer
Mr. Speaker , I have criticized many of the provisions of this bill and rightfully so .
However , one bi-partisan area that strikes the appropriate balance in providing lower - cost options to consumers without destroying a healthy and functioning industry in this country that is included in both the underlying bill , which I strongly oppose , and the Republican substitute , which I intend to support , are the sections relating to the creation of a market for biosimilar products .
Lynn Jenkins
Mr. Speaker , I have criticized many of the provisions of this bill and rightfully so .
However , I do believe the sections relating to the creation of a market for biosimilar products is one area of the bill that strikes the appropriate balance in providing lower cost options to consumers without destroying a healthy and functioning industry in this country .
Mike Conaway
Mr. Speaker , I have criticized many of the provisions of H.R. 3962 , the Affordable Health Care for America Act , and with good reason .
However , I believe that the creation of a market for biosimilar products is one area of the bill that strikes the appropriate balance in providing lower cost options to consumers without destroying a healthy and functioning industry in this country .
Darrell Issa
Despite this bill ’s many faults , I support the bill ’s language establishing a market for biosimilars which balances the desire to provide cheaper biologics with the need to continue incentivizing investment in research and development .
Kevin McCarthy
These are some of the many concerns I have with H.R. 3962 , which is why I instead support the Republican health care alternative .
The alternative excludes the unnecessary and burdensome excise tax in H.R. 3962 , and also includes a responsible pathway for follow - on biologics by including provisions from the Pathways for Biosimilars Act , which I am a proud cosponsor of . [ snip ]
But we need solutions that strike a balance in reducing health care costs , strengthening health care access , and allowing health innovators , like our biotech industry , to continue to research and improve therapies for patients .

Drugs widely prescribed to treat facial paralysis in Bell 's palsy are ineffective and are based on false notions of the cause of the condition , according to Cochrane Researchers .
They say research must now focus on discovering other potential causes and treatments .
Between 11 and 40 people in every 100,000 are affected by the condition , which causes paralysis on one side of the face .
Paralysis is usually temporary , but a third of people suffer ongoing problems including facial disfigurement , pain and psychological difficulties .
Antiviral medications are widely prescribed to treat the condition , because studies have indicated that Bell 's palsy may be associated with the same virus that causes cold sores ( herpes simplex ) .
Previous Cochrane Systematic
Reviews did not find sufficient evidence to determine whether or not antiviral medications are effective .
In the current review , the researchers considered data from seven trials that together include 1,987 people .
Antivirals were no more effective than placebo .
Antivirals were also significantly less effective than steroid drugs called corticosteroids which will be the subject of another Cochrane Review in progress .
" The evidence from this review shows that antivirals used for herpes simplex offer no benefit for people with Bell 's palsy .
These results cast doubt on research that suggests herpes simplex causes the condition , " said Pauline Lockhart , who is based at the Centre for Primary Care and Population Research at the University of Dundee .
" In view of this , further research should be aimed at discovering alternative causes and treatments . "
" It is worth pointing out that a 10 day course of the antivirals often prescribed for Bell 's palsy can cost in excess of £ 10 in the UK .
Obviously widespread prescription of drugs that we know do not work is a waste of resources . "
Alex Jones is a husky man with short sandy hair , weary eyes , baby cheeks , and the kind of deep , gravelly voice made for horror - movie trailers .
And it ’s horror he has in mind .
“ Your New World Order will fall ! ” he screams through a megaphone at the shiny façade of a nondescript office building .
“ Humanity will defeat you ! ”
A syndicated radio host , filmmaker , and all - around countercultural icon based in Austin , Texas , Jones has long been one of the country ’s most significant purveyors of paranoia .
His 2007 documentary Endgame : Blueprint for Global Enslavement , in which the megaphone scene takes place , purports to reveal a eugenics - obsessed global elite bent on eliminating most of the earth ’s population and enslaving the rest .
Members of a Satanic international network , Jones explains in an ominous voiceover , have been “ steering planetary affairs for hundreds of years .
Now , in the final stage , they prepare for open world government . ”
And , in a line that would later echo among tea party protesters nationwide , he says , “ The answer to 1984 is 1776 ! ”
Though Jones has always had impassioned fans , until recently , he has remained a quintessentially marginal figure .
A leader of the 9/11 Truth movement -- he ’s listed as an executive producer on the final cut of Loose Change , a documentary at the movement ’s center -- Jones claims to have uncovered the interconnected plots behind the JFK assassination , water fluoridation , and the recent economic crisis .
He has accused the Illuminati of putting its symbols in the Starbucks logo as a taunting show of strength .
Ron Paul is a frequent guest on his radio show , and Jones , who also runs a website called RonPaulWarRoom.com , has been a major supporter of the Ron Paul movement .
One of his highest - profile guests was Lou Dobbs -- Jones calls him one of his “ idols ” -- who appeared on the show in March 2008 ; the two discussed ostensible plans to merge the United States into a supranational “ North American Union ” with Mexico and Canada .
But it ’s really only since Barack Obama ’s election , when Jones turned the full force of his apocalyptic imagination toward the new president , that his ideas have found purchase in the conservative mainstream .
Several Republican officeholders , from state representatives to congressmen , have appeared on his program to trade wild theories about Obama .
Glenn Beck has brought his fear - mongering about the New World Order to network television , and an online Fox News show collaborated with him on a joint broadcast .
To be sure , sundry leftists , as well as some Hollywood types , appear on Jones ’s show , as well .
Dennis Kucinich and Noam Chomsky have both been on .
It ’s where actor Charlie Sheen goes to spout his 9/11 Truth theories .
But left - wing craziness tends to stay sequestered on the fringes of politics , while the right - wing fringe increasingly is the Republican mainstream .
According to a recent Public Policy Polling survey , only 37 percent of Republicans believe that Obama was born in the United States .
Jones has become politically salient because much of the right is as unhinged as he is .
Last Thursday , with wounds still raw from a contentious budget vote the day before , Mayor Daley used the ribbon - cutting ceremony for an upscale indoor market in the West Loop to rebuke rogue aldermen and other critics of his tax increment financing program .
The Chicago French Market , in the Ogilvie Transportation Center , is what the TIF program is all about , the mayor said .
If the city had n't kicked in $ 8 million in taxpayer - funded subsidies , the market would n't have been built and an economic opportunity would have been missed .
" The city had to put some skin in the game and that 's what it did , " Daley said .
The mayor was right — the market is an excellent example of what the TIF program is all about .
But it 's not a good example of what it 's supposed to be about .
Daley has claimed for years that the program is the city 's chief tool for bringing economic development and infrastructure investment to neighborhoods that could n't otherwise attract them .
" Most of [ the TIF money ] is pledged for economic development in depressed areas , to bring jobs back or keep jobs there , " the mayor said on WBEZ last month .
In the case of the market , the City Council , at Daley 's urging , voted in 2006 to spend a total of $ 12 million in taxpayer money on construction of a new shopping area in the Ogilvie Transportation Center ; $ 8 million of that sum went to the French Market .
The project happens to be headed by a well - to - do , politically connected developer who 's contributed thousands of dollars to the mayor 's campaign coffers .
And the city plans to spend another $ 23 million in the River West TIF district through 2011 .
By contrast Roseland , one of the poorest neighborhoods in town , will get just $ 5 million to spend through 2011 .
That 's typical of how the TIF program works citywide , according to the Daley administration 's own budget for the program — a document that the Reader obtained through a series of Freedom of Information Act requests and posted at chicagoreader.com last Friday .
This is the document we 've been referring to as the " shadow budget " because the city puts it together behind closed doors and had previously refused to release it publicly , even though it maps out the use of about half a billion dollars a year in taxpayer money .
An analysis of the budget , which lays out proposed and approved expenditures for 152 active TIF districts from 2009 through 2011 , shows that the program has generated a huge kitty that primarily funds improvement projects in thriving neighborhoods .
Though most TIF districts are on the south and west sides , those in the city center
generate — and therefore get to spend — most of the money .
Eight of the ten districts set to receive the most TIF - funded investment through 2011 are in prosperous neighborhoods near downtown , such as the South Loop and West Loop , while the districts that will receive the least investment are concentrated on the south and west sides .
The biggest winner is the Near South TIF , roughly bounded by Michigan , Van Buren , State , and 21st Street : the TIF budget indicates that about $ 118 million will be spent there through 2011 on things like streetscaping on Congress , facade work on the Harold Washington Library , a rehab of the Blackstone Hotel , and construction of a new Jones High School .
That 's more than the total TIF spending planned for 82 districts on the other end of the spectrum in the same period .
Moreover , what qualifies as an " economic development " project is so loosely defined that the Daley administration can — and does — justify spending TIF money on just about anything .
Among the hundreds of projects slated to receive funding are public housing redevelopments , new sidewalks and speed humps , CTA station reconstruction , ornamental street lighting , and subsidies for corporations , a bakery , a Jewel , and a theater troupe .
Most , like public infrastructure and maintenance spending , are not subject to consideration by the City Council even though comparable expenditures in the regular budget are ; others , such as the subsidies , benefit for - profit companies operating in already prosperous business districts .
In 2008 , Chicago 's TIF program took in $ 570 million , according to the administration .
The city started 2009 with about $ 825 million in the bank , the TIF budget shows , and from 2009 through 2011 it plans to spend more than $ 1.3 billion .
For context , the city 's regular budget for 2010 is about $ 6.1 billion , and the Daley administration plans to cover a $ 500 million deficit by raiding the so - called rainy - day fund generated by the parking meter lease deal .
" TIFs are a useful economic development tool , " says 38th Ward alderman Tom Allen , who 's emerged as one of the mayor 's chief critics on budget matters .
" But when you are in an emergency financial situation , then you have to adjust your thinking .
You can't continue to have blinders on about how this program works . "
The nature of the TIF program practically guarantees that wealthier areas rake in more money .
The amount each property owner pays in property taxes is determined by multiplying the tax rate by a property 's assessed value .
The tax rate is the same citywide , so it 's the differences in property values that determine how much property owners pay .
The higher the value , the more the owner owes .
When the City Council creates a TIF district — which is almost always done at the mayor 's behest — it freezes for up to 24 years the value of the property in that district that can be taxed by the schools , parks , and other bodies .
Assuming property values rise , the owners still pay higher taxes accordingly — but all those extra tax dollars go into the TIF account .
The more property values rise , the more money the TIF collects .
TIFs are n't just a tool for economic development .
They 're a tool for consolidating power .
The mayor ultimately controls these accounts , which gives him leverage over every public entity , from the City Council to the public schools to the Park District .
As we 've previously reported , at least half a dozen aldermen have told us that mayoral aides pressure them on key votes — such as the ordinances for funding the Olympics or moving the Children 's Museum to Grant Park — by either promising to give their wards more TIF dollars or threatening to take TIF dollars away .
The more TIF districts are created , the more money goes into the TIF accounts and the more powerful the mayor becomes .
Back in the 1980s , in the early days of Chicago 's TIF program , Mayor Harold Washington said he would limit TIF districts to paying for specific projects in blighted communities that truly needed them .
But the program has expanded over the years , and the administration and City Council have held almost no discussion of its evolving goals ; now virtually any project in any community can qualify for subsidies .
According to a TIF primer city officials distributed to aldermen this fall , TIF money can be used for program administration costs , property acquisition , rehabs of existing public or private buildings , construction of " public works or improvements , " job training , business relocation and financing subsidies , planning studies , marketing , building demolition , and the services of architects , engineers , lawyers , and financial planners .
Many aldermen have come to like the program because it provides funding for their wards on top of what 's designated in the regular budget — but without the same scrutiny .
They 're happy to take credit for the projects TIF money buys when they go before their voters at election time .
The specifics of how the city spends TIF money have always been kept from the public , even when Mayor Daley and his top aides craft a budget for it .
When city officials shared small pieces of such a budget with individual aldermen this fall , several passed theirs on to us .
On September 21 we submitted a request under the state Freedom of Information Act for the complete TIF budget .
On October 14 we got a letter from the Department of Community Development , which administers the program , informing us that our request had been denied on the grounds that " the information contained in it is comprised of staff - determined estimates .
. . .
They are not final or official projections . "

We appealed that decision .
In a letter to the city 's chief FOIA officer , Jennifer Hoyle , we argued that the budget involved both projections and allocations and was no more preliminary than the city 's regular budget , which is similarly based on estimates of the next year 's revenues and spending .
We also noted that the state FOIA specifies that " all information in any account , voucher , or contract dealing with the receipt or expenditure of public or other funds of public bodies " is considered public and open to inspection .
Meanwhile , a story we wrote about the " shadow budget " hit the street just as the City Council was beginning debate on how to deal with a $ 500 million hole in the city 's regular 2010 budget .
Calls for TIF reform came from the public , the daily papers , and even aldermen , putting the administration on the defensive .
Mayor Daley told reporters the city merely needed to do a better job of publicizing the program .
" If you look at TIFs , and we give you the complete breakdown of what it 's accomplished in each community , it 's amazing , " he said on WBEZ .
The Tribune gave the city 's chief financial officer , Gene Saffold , space to reiterate the usual half - truths about the program .
( For Ben Joravsky 's breakdown of the doublespeak , see tiny.cc/6lqI6 . )
And city planning officials met with aldermen to persuade them that ( according to a briefing packet they distributed ) without the TIF program the city would be without funding for new libraries , parks , or street resurfacing .
On November 24
Hoyle e-mailed us saying she would grant our appeal .
She said she 'd send us the budget once Community Development had redacted the names of companies with which the city was still actively negotiating .
We finally got it on the afternoon of December 4 , two days after the council , despite a barrage of criticism of the administration 's financial management , had voted 38 - 12 to approve Mayor Daley 's budget .
( We 've posted the complete original file at tiny .
cc/TIFPDF and created a sortable , searchable spreadsheet from it at tiny.cc/TIFXLS .)
Allen , one of the nay votes , attacked the administration for its " stubborn and obstinate refusal or failure to address TIF reform . "
Administration allies fired back .
Alderman Bernard Stone ( 50th ) argued that TIF funds pay for community improvements that in turn generate more taxes that can be used to make the community still better .
" We invest taxes to improve our communities , our local communities , " he said .
" That is a TIF .
It 's a tool .
It 's not something you put in your budget . "
But Stone and the administration are ignoring two key issues : the program 's lack of transparency and its severe inequities .
By keeping the TIF budget secret , the administration was able to conceal the fact that the program actually produces far more money for capital projects in the Loop and surrounding neighborhoods than it does in the outlying wards .
The 16 TIF districts in what the city classifies as the central part of Chicago had a balance of about $ 309 million at the beginning of 2009 , the budget document shows .
That 's an average of $ 19 million per district .
In contrast , the 56 districts on the south side had just $ 175 million available , or an average of $ 3 million apiece .
That means that in tough budget times like these , downtown neighborhoods have millions more dollars a year available for new curbs , new CTA stations , business development , and whatever else the administration deems worthy — an gourmet market , for instance .
The River West TIF , the one that helped fund the French Market , was created in 2001 to spur development just west of the Loop .
It 's now one of the richest TIF districts in town .
Up through 2009 it 's collected about $ 49.3 million in property taxes , according to county clerk David Orr .
The budget shows that it had a balance of about $ 17 million at the beginning of this year .
In the next couple years , according to the budget , the city plans to use River West TIF funds to subsidize the redevelopment of the office building at 540 W. Madison , the Blommer Chocolate factory at 600 W. Kinzie , and the Ogilvie Transportation Center at 500 W. Madison .
The French Market in the Ogilvie Center was developed by MetraMarket , a joint venture of Bensidoun USA Inc. , a French - owned grocery chain , and U.S. Equities , one of the biggest developers in town .
The chairman and CEO of U.S. Equities is Robert A. Wislow , who was appointed by Mayor Daley to sit on Metra 's board of directors .
Over the last ten years Wislow and his wife , Susan , have contributed at least $ 4,000 to Mayor Daley 's election fund , as well as $ 2,000 to the coffers of Alderman Ed Burke , chairman of the City Council 's finance committee , which oversees TIF deals with private companies , and $ 2,150 to the campaign of Illinois Supreme Court justice Anne Burke , Alderman Burke 's wife .
U.S. Equities gave another $ 4,000 to Daley and $ 10,000 to Ed Burke .
Nancy Pacher , the president of U.S. Equities Realty , is a member of the Chicago Plan Commission , the body of mayoral appointees that approves major development deals , including the controversial proposal to move the Children 's Museum into Grant Park .
Meanwhile Roseland and Englewood , two neighborhoods so deprived of resources and services that researchers consider them " food deserts , " will together have spent less than $ 12 million in TIF funding in 2009 , according to the budget .
When critics have pointed out the TIF program 's inequities in the past , Mayor Daley 's black and Hispanic political allies have come to its defense .
For instance , in 2007 Governor Rod Blagojevich called in county board commissioner Mike Quigley , then the city 's most prominent TIF reformer , to talk about the program to a group of key legislators , including Illinois house speaker Michael Madigan .
Daley shrewdly countered by sending in two Hispanic aldermen , George Cardenas and Ray Suarez , and two African - American aldermen , Latasha Thomas and Carrie Austin .
When Quigley noted that several academic studies had shown that TIFs actually benefit wealthier communities over poor ones , Austin cut him off , saying : " Professors never built nothin ' . "
And so ended that debate .
With the city facing a gaping budget crisis , though , the movement for reform may be picking up steam .
Alderman Allen proposes radically changing the TIF program to remedy the inequity and the transparency problem .
As he envisions it , the city would replace dozens of individual TIF districts — each with its own budget — with one large economic - development fund , paid for with property tax dollars and itemized in the regular city budget .
" That way we can actually see who 's getting how much of what , " says Allen .
" And we can decide , do we want to spend , you know , $ 20 million on this big project downtown ?
Or would we rather spend it somewhere else ? "
This would push TIF funding out of the shadows .
Of course , the more light is shed on the TIFs , the less power Mayor Daley holds .
If Allen actually brings his scheme to the council , expect a nasty political fight .
" I know that 's a pretty radical proposal , " says Allen .
" But these are desperate times . "

Harry Reid to present $ 849 billion health care bill
Sun Coverage Sun politics coverage
WASHINGTON - Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has convened a late - evening meeting tonight of the Democratic caucus to present to fellow senators the $ 849 billion health care reform bill he has been crafting behind closed doors for weeks .
After an intense day of talks , including a huddle with Vice President Joseph Biden , Reid emerged from the east doors of the Senate chamber at 5 p.m. for the short walk across the hall to the room where senators were assembling .
A giant monitor was set for Reid 's power - point presentation .
An aide said the $ 849 billion bill Reid had crafted would reduce the federal deficit by $ 127 billion in 10 years , and would ensure 94 percent of Americans would be covered by insurance at that time .
The bill 's price tag is less than the nearly $ 1.1 trillion bill passed by the House earlier this month .
Expecting a unified wall of Republican opposition , Reid must secure the vote of all 60 senators from the Democratic caucus to move the bill forward and open debate .
The vote on advancing the bill could come as soon as Friday , but possibly Saturday .
If approved , the floor vote is expected to last several weeks and include many amendments .
About an hour later , Reid stood with his leqadership team upbeat :
" The finish line is really in sight . "
John Dietsch was n't scared – then or now .
While working in the engine room of World War II Allied warships in the North Atlantic , he faced the threat of Nazi mines , warships and U - boats .
" You would hear the guns go off above us .
You could feel it all around you , " said the 84 - year - old .
" There really was n't time to be scared . "
It was the same on Thursday afternoon , when a gunman stormed into a Royal Canadian Legion in Scarborough , demanding thousands in poppy donations .
Dietsch and three others had just finished counting through $ 10,000 at Oakridge Legion , Branch 73 , near Danforth and Warden Aves .
" At first , I did n't see the gun .
I said , ` What are you doing here ? '
He said he wanted all the bills , " said Dietsch .
" But nobody was going to get that money we had worked so hard to collect .
It 's for the veterans and the widows and the community . "
When the gunman lunged for the cash , Dietsch grabbed his arm , pushing away the gun .
They struggled and Dietsch fell to the floor .
The startled attacker , who looked to be in his 20s , ran to the door empty - handed .
Legion volunteer Earl Gray , 64 , followed and tackled the gunman outside the accounting room .
Gray pinned him to the floor briefly , but the man escaped out a side door .
It had happened in minutes , just after noon .
After the robbery attempt , Gray and a few others took the money to the bank .
Dietsch got back to sorting the poppy boxes .
By 2 p.m. , news of the troubling attack began to spread .
Throngs of media found the veteran quietly nursing a bottle of beer at the back of the Legion 's basement bar .
" Looking back , it was probably a stupid thing to do , " said Dietsch , fidgeting with his 60th anniversary Legion membership ring .
Police encouraged Dietsch , who hurt his elbow , to go to a doctor .
" No , no , no .
It was just a little scratch , " he said .
Gray , who chased the gunman down the street and then attempted to track him by car , called his friend a " brave man " and a hero .
" I 'm just really thankful that no one was hurt , " said Gray , whose bravery was also praised .
Pat Shone , 65 , who runs the poppy drive at Branch 73 , was also in the room .
" I was very surprised , " he said .
" I think it 's just disgusting .
What kind of a person would do such a thing ?
" This is money for war veterans and widows .
And not just from previous wars , the veterans and widows of today 's wars . "

Scientists at the University of Bonn , Germany , have discovered a previously unknown fruit fly gene that controls the metabolism of fat .
Larvae in which this gene is defective lose their entire fat reserves .
Therefore the researchers called the gene ' schlank ' ( German for ' slim ' ) .
Mammals carry a group of genes that are structurally very similar to ' schlank ' .
They possibly take on a similar function in the energy metabolism .
The scientists therefore have hopes in new medicines with which obesity could be fought .
Their research bas been published in The EMBO Journal .
If scientists decipher the function of a gene , they are allowed to name it .
With the fruit fly Drosophila there is a rather paradox convention .
The names always indicate what the fly looks like if the respective gene is defective .
That is also the case with the schlank gene .
If it is unimpaired the fly larva can build up fat reserves .
It becomes fat .
' Larvae with a mutation of schlank , however , remain slim , ' Professor Michael Hoch from the University of Bonn explains .
' In extreme cases the defect can even lead to death . '
Together with Dr. Reinhard Bauer and other employees the development biologist has explored what exactly ' schlank ' does .
According to their research the gene contains the instructions of what is known as ceramide synthase .
Ceramides serve as raw materials for the gauzy membranes that enclose all of the cells in the body .
Moreover , schlank also has a regulatory function .
It promotes lipid synthesis and at the same time inhibits the mobilisation of fat from the fat reserves .
Mouse gene saves fly larvae
There is a chance that this is not only the case in fruit flies .
Humans also produce ceramide synthases however not just one as Drosophila does but rather as many as six different ones .
For this purpose humans rely on a group of genes so - called Lass genes .
Ceramide synthases are extremely important for animals .
Mutations in the corresponding genes lead to severe metabolic disorders and to malfunctions of organ systems .
That is why our Lass genes look surprisingly similar to the schlank gene of fruit flies .
This resemblance is so striking that Lass genes from mice can partially compensate for the defect schlank gene in mutant flies .
' We introduced a mouse Lass gene in mutant Drosophila larvae , ' Michael Hoch says .
' Normally the larvae died immediately after hatching .
Thanks to the Lass gene they resumed building up body fat and survived until the next development stage . '
Up to now , the Lass genes of mammals have not been connected with the regulation of the lipid metabolism .
' But due to the strong parallels with schlank we think such a function is very probable , ' Professor Hoch presumes .
' If this is the case they would be a promising approach for new medications for obesity . '

I spent nearly five years , from mid-1996 to the beginning of 2001 , homeless , or as I liked to call it with a distributed household .
I had storage , shelter , mailbox , telephone , shower , bathroom facilities , cooking equipment , and transportation , even access to television , radio , computer equipment , and ac power .
I had the essence of a home .
It was simply more geographically scattered than is traditional in our culture .
I 'm not the first to do what I did , to live homeless well .
I 'm not the first to find advantage in homelessness .
It is a well kept secret that homelessness can be freedom and comfort can attend it .
The secret is well kept because revealing that you are homeless in this society is dangerous .
There is stigma .
There are even laws prohibiting it .
Imagine that .
There are laws against being homeless .
Let me say that one more time .
There are laws against being homeless .
There are laws against sleeping in public , in your car , on the beach , anywhere in the public view .
It is the only law that I know that prohibits a behavior that is involuntary .
You must sleep .
There is no choice .
You must do it .
If you do not sleep for approximately one third of your life , you will suffer .
The less sleep you get , the more physical and psychological symptoms you will suffer , until your mental faculties break down , your grasp of reality disintegrates , your self - control disappears .
Your body will make you sleep , and if you use stimulants to avoid it , you will rapidly begin to become psychotic , with unpredictable mood swings , displays of aggression , and hallucinations .
Nevertheless , the law in nearly every municipality forbids sleeping unless you are rich enough to afford a house or hotel to do it in .
It 's a human rights violation , but I will get back to that .
I 've been thinking about writing this book , a guide to living well , for years .
People think it will be easy to be homeless , that it is a lazy choice .
Nothing could be further from true .
Homelessness is very hard work .
Homelessness can be very uncomfortable until you solve some basic problems .
It is vital , for instance , to have a place of concealment .
It is vital to assure that you will be warm , and to provide for safety , and for hygiene , and for communications , and even for a source of income .
If you are newly homeless , you will not be meeting all of these basic needs , and to the extent that you do n't , you will pay for that .
This book will teach you to meet those needs effectively and fast .

Look at some more nonsense drawings here .
I originally posted these paper towel drawings about 2 years ago to Flickr and Vox , long before I had this site .
They have since turned up on a number of blogs ( and now tweeted by Ashton Kutcher and Rainn Wilson , and blogged by Urban Outfitters and Alltop ) , so I thought I 'd get in on my own action and post them here .
Oh , and one of these photos appears in Rainn Wilson 's book Soul Pancake .
" They shoot Russians , " the young paratrooper told me .
It was cold .
We had come across his unit , the Soviet 105th Airborne Division , near Charikar , north of Kabul , and he was holding out a bandaged hand .
Blood seeped through , staining the sleeve of his battledress .
He was just a teenager with fair hair and blue eyes .
Beside us a Soviet transport lorry , its rear section blown to pieces by a mine – yes , an " improvised explosive device " , though we did n't call it that yet – lay upended in a ditch .
In pain , the young man raised his hand to the mountain - tops where a Soviet helicopter was circling .
Could I ever have imagined that Messers Bush and Blair would have landed us in the same sepulchre of armies almost three decades later ?
Or that a young black American president would do exactly what the Russians did all those years ago ?
Within weeks , we would see the Soviet Army securing Kabul and the largest cities of Afghanistan , abandoning the vast areas of mountain and desert to the " terrorists " , insisting that they could support a secular , uncorrupt government in the capital and give security to the people .
By the spring of 1980 , I was watching the Soviet military stage a " surge " .
Sound familiar ?
The Russians announced new training for the Afghan army .
Sound familiar ?
Only 60 per cent of the force was following orders at the time .
Yes , it does sound familiar .
Victor Sebestyen , who has researched a book about the fall of the Soviet empire , has written at length of those frozen days after the Russian army stormed into Afghanistan just after Christmas of 1979 .
He quotes General Sergei Akhromeyev , commander of the Soviet armed forces , addressing the Soviet Politburo in 1986 .
" There is no piece of land in Afghanistan that has not been occupied by one of our soldiers at some time or another .
Nevertheless much of the territory stays in the hands of the terrorists .
We control the provincial centres , but we cannot maintain political control over the territory we seize . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
As Sebestyen points out , Gen Akhromeyev demanded extra troops – or the war in Afghanistan would continue " for a very , very long time " .
And how 's this for a quotation from , say , a British or US commander in Helmand today ?
" Our soldiers are not to blame .
They 've fought incredibly bravely in adverse conditions .
But to occupy towns and villages temporarily has little value in such a vast land where the insurgents can just disappear into the hills . "
Yes , of course , this was Gen Akhromeyev in 1986 .
I watched the tragedy play out in those bleak early months of 1980 .
In Kandahar , the people cried " Allahu Akbar " from the rooftops and on the roads outside the city , I met the insurgents – the Taliban of their time – bombing the Soviet convoys .
North of Jalalabad , they even stopped my bus with red roses in the muzzles of their Kalashnikovs , ordering Communist students from the vehicle .
I did n't care to dwell on their fate .
No different , I guess , than that of pro-government Afghan students caught by the Taliban today .
Outside the city , I was told that the " mujahedin " – President Ronald Reagan 's favourite " freedom fighters " – had destroyed a school because it was educating girls .
Too true .
The headmaster and his wife – after they had been burned – were hanging from a tree .
Afghans approached us with strange stories .
Political prisoners were being taken from the country and tortured inside the Soviet Union .
Secret rendition .
In Kandahar , a shopkeeper , an educated man in his fifties who wore both a European sweater and an Afghan turban , approached me in the street .
I still have the notes of my interview .
" Every day the government says that food prices are coming down , " he said .
" Every day we are told that things are getting better thanks to the cooperation of the Soviet Union .
But it is not true .
Do you realise that the government cannot even control the roads ?
Fuck them .
They only hold on to the cities . "
The " mujahedin " infested Helmand province and crossed and recrossed the Pakistani border , just as they do today .
A Soviet Mig fighter - bomber even crossed the frontier in early 1980 to attack the guerrillas .
The Pakistani government – and the United States , of course – condemned this as a flagrant breach of Pakistan 's sovereignty .
Well , tell that to the young Americans who control the unmanned Predators so often crossing the border today to attack the guerrillas .
In Moscow almost a quarter of a century later , I went to meet the former Russian occupiers of Afghanistan .
Some were now addicted to drugs , others suffered from what we call stress disorder .
And on this historic day – when Barack Obama plunges ever deeper into chaos – let us remember the British retreat from Kabul and its destruction in 1842 .
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - For decades , Joachim Fritsch struggled to understand why he was being denied access to higher education and passed over for job promotions again and again .
Files lie on a table in an archive of an authority looking after the archive of the East German Stasi secret police in the eastern German city of Magdeburg in this August 13 , 2007 file hoto .
REUTERS / Arnd Wiegmann
Then he got hold of a 400 - page file East Germany ’s dreaded secret police had compiled on him .
The Stasi had arrested him back in the mid-1950s when he was just 17 years old and branded him a “ provocateur ” for failing to produce his identity card .
The arrest left an indelible mark on his record , leading the Stasi to watch him closely and thwart repeated attempts by Fritsch to get on with his life .
“ I was absolutely overwhelmed when I read my files , ” the 73 - year - old told Reuters , poring over copies of his personal file in his small flat on the 10th floor of an east Berlin high rise .
“ You enter your past hesitantly , step by step . ”
Fritsch is one of hundreds of thousands who have read their Stasi files .
Two decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall , the government agency set up to oversee them is still inundated with requests and has a two - year backlog .
Founded in 1950 , the Stasi was one of the most repressive police organizations in the world .
It infiltrated almost every aspect of life in East Germany , using torture , intimidation and a vast network of informants to crush dissent .
Millions of Germans worked for the Stasi and provided reports on friends , family , colleagues or lovers .
The files , which would stretch for 112 km ( 70 miles ) if laid out flat , were opened up to the public in 1992 , exposing a web of betrayals .
The plan was to keep the Stasi archives open for around 10 years -- enough time , officials thought , for everyone who was spied on to get to their file and close that chapter of history .
But thousands of people , mainly from former East Germany , are still applying every month .
In the first half of 2009 , applications were up nearly 11 percent on 2008 .
“ We have had more applications this year because of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Wall , ” said Martin Boettger , who heads a regional branch of the Stasi archives in Chemnitz , formerly Karl - Marx - Stadt .
“ Many films and books are being made , events are being held , so it is in the public consciousness , ” said Boettger , whose own file contains 3,000 pages , detailing even the most trivial facts of his life and branding him a “ religious fanatic . ”
TIME TO FACE PAST
Many East Germans who suffered persecution by the Stasi preferred initially to let the ghosts of the totalitarian regime rest , but are now more comfortable confronting their past .
“ People were afraid of their past and of being traumatized all over again , ” said Helmut Wippich , who runs a consultancy for people who were persecuted by the regime as students at school .
Wippich says his school teacher denounced him to the Stasi when he was 14 .
Two years later , he was imprisoned for nine months for discussing with a friend ways to flee East Germany .
“ At first I did n’t want to look at my files , because it weighed on me too much , ” said Wippich .
Others were simply too busy rebuilding their lives after the fall of the Wall in November 1989 to delve into a painful past .
Dana Wotschack , 37 , said she had been focused on finding a job and was happy to move on from the regime under which she was brutally interrogated as a 17 - year - old for tearing down a communist election poster .
Recent films about the Stasi , such as the Oscar - winning 2006 hit “ The Lives of Others , ” sparked her curiosity , however .
When a good friend applied to see her own files , Wotschack did too .
Wotschack was disappointed when she received the news that there was no file under her name .
Half of those who apply to see their files do not have one , according to Boettger , although that does not necessarily mean they were not spied on .
The Stasi began shredding files as the East German regime collapsed , and some 15,000 sacks of paper strips still need to be pieced back together .
“ I thought I could have cleared my name if I had found those files , ” said Wotschack , sitting in a cafe on Alexanderplatz , a square in east Berlin still dominated by communist architecture .
“ I would have been happy to be able to draw a line under that period of my life . ”
REHABILITATION
Many people apply in order to prove they were unjustly imprisoned , to clear their criminal record and claim compensation for any time spent in jail .
“ In a dictatorship , you do n’t get any proof of what happened , ” said Fritsch , who was twice imprisoned by the Stasi , and whose family distanced itself from him to escape Stasi persecution .
“ The Stasi archives were the only way we could find the necessary documents to prove we had been arrested , in order to be rehabilitated . ”
The archive is also seen as critical to deciphering the history of East Germany and understanding why millions of people lived under a dictatorship for 40 years without showing much resistance .
“ They worked with fear , spying on everyone , imprisoning masses of people , intimidating people , intervening in their career and preventing them from getting an education , ” said Boettger .
“ The archives enable you to understand these hidden methods of a dictatorship . ”

Boxers are renowned for upping the ante by trading slurs and insults at pre-fight weigh - ins or press conferences - but research by sports psychologists suggests that the role goes beyond showmanship .
If effectively harnessed , venting your anger can actually improve your performance in certain sporting tasks .
Sports psychologists at Bangor University 's School of Sport , Health & Exercise Sciences were interested to find exactly what effect emotion had in sports performance .
Participants who recreated anger improved their performance by up to 25 % - this was the most dramatic result - but was only achieved in actions such as kicking or striking out - activities that reflected a natural expression of anger - as opposed to more complex tasks .
The hope of success also increased the performance of semi professional football players who were recruited in a football related task for the trials .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , happiness was not found to improve performance - as happiness itself suggests contentment with things as they are .
" It has long been established that an individual 's performance will be affected by their emotional state , but little research has been done ; other than in the effect of anxiety on performance , " explains Dr Tim Woodman , lead author of a paper on the subject published in the Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology .
" We found that effort and performance both increased when we induced a sense of hope of success or anger in our participants .
Anger did n't help people perform any better in mental tasks , but was very effective in movements that reflect the natural anger tendency to ' lash - out ' at something .
For anger to be effective as a performance tool , it needs to be harnessed and then released into a high energy task such as kicking or punching . "
" Interestingly we found that only the performance of people with an extrovert personality benefits from expressing their anger in these channelled activities - this may be because they find it easier to express their emotions in public . "

Cellular automata are simulations of cells interacting with each other based on simple rules .
Despite the simplicity , they can exhibit complex behaviour , and have a number of applications in fields such as medicine , biology , mathematics , and more .
As a result , people from a variety of different backgrounds and skill - sets may find cellular automata useful to their work or research .
There exist tools to explore well - known automata , but many require some form of textual programming ability , or do not offer easy and approachable ways to customise automata .
Our software aims to be more accessible for those without backgrounds in programming or cellular automata , to allow users to more easily explore and modify automata .
To achieve this , we have developed a visual programming language , where users can connect components to create their own automata from scratch , without any textual programming .
Where ’s the Chinese Toyota ?
The common perception of China relying on industrial policies to make its economy successful is just an illusion , " says Fan He , assistant director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences .
" If industrial policy works , it ’s mainly at the local level . "
Industrial policy is sometimes shorthanded by its critics as " picking winners " — essentially , it ’s government intervention to build certain industries by offering incentives and shielding them from foreign competition .
Japan ’s industrial policy of the 1970s and 1980s , which was later copied by South Korea and Taiwan , is among the most studied recent examples .
But if the goal of traditional industrial policy is to invest in companies and turn them into global dynamos , China has a long way to go .
More than half of Chinese exports are made by companies with significant foreign investment .
Although Lenovo and Haier have made laudable strides overseas , Beijing has yet to produce a truly international brand along the lines of Japan ’s Sony or Toyota .
And it has struggled to consolidate its automotive , steel , aluminum , and coal - mining industries .
Take cars , for instance .
Although the government has been guiding the development of the automotive sector for at least two decades , more than 80 percent of industry revenues still come from joint ventures where the management expertise and technology is provided by foreign companies such as Shanghai Volkswagen , FAW - Volkswagen , and Shanghai GM , according to Arthur Kroeber , managing director of the consultancy Dragonomics .
Despite government support for state - owned enterprises , the most - aggressive , fastest - growing automotive companies in China are the independents — companies with entrepreneurial leaders like Chery , Geely , Great Wall , and BYD , says Bill Russo , senior advisor at Booz & Co .
It ’s not that Beijing has done everything wrong .
For one , its tight management of the currency has enhanced its global competitiveness , to put it mildly .
The government has also managed to keep costs down for manufacturers by offering cheap capital through the banks and allowing state - run companies to dominate key sectors such as telecommunications and electrical - power generation .
But currency control and cheap capital do not a winning industrial policy make .
Since the 1980s , the overarching goal of Chinese industrial policy has been rapid economic growth through industrialization — a strategy that mirrors those of South Korea and Japan in earlier years .
Like its neighbors once did , China singles out strategic industries , including the automotive , semiconductor , aerospace , oil , and petrochemicals sectors , sets goals for their development , encourages banks to provide financing , and introduces policies to encourage their growth , including those on foreign investment .
These policies essentially send a message to industry :
Here ’s what we want to promote .
" China ’s industrial policies are mainly trying to balance between different sectors , " explains He of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences .
But what sets China apart is the way it has implemented this policy .
Where South Korea and Japan ruled from the top , in China , industrial policy is decentralized and sometimes even chaotic .
Jack Perkowski , a former Yale University offensive lineman who founded an automotive components company in China in 1994 , compares traditional industrial policy with football :
The coach drafts plays , and the players execute them .
Chinese industrial policy is more like soccer : free - flowing .
" It ’s kind of the players on the field that are making up the rules , that are making up how the game is played , not the coach , " he says .
" The coach is staying on the sidelines hoping his team will win . "
China ’s official coaches do more than hope .
The problem for everyone else is , it ’s not always clear who they are .
Unlike with Japan in the 1960s and 1970s , where the leadership of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry was well established and industrial - policy watchers had a good sense of who was pulling the strings , Beijing - watchers are still debating who actually makes Chinese industrial policy , in part because of a lack of transparency in the policymaking process , but also because people in so many parts of the government seem to have a say .
The National Development and Reform Commission , a government agency that is part of the State Council and oversees economic development , obviously plays a role , but other government departments weigh in as well .
What is clear is that foreign direct investment , private entrepreneurs , and local government initiatives , rather than traditional industrial policy , are key drivers of economic growth .
Southern China ’s Pearl River Delta is one good example .
Starting in the 1980s , regional authorities used incentives like preferential tax rates and discounts on land to lure foreign investors , many of them from Hong Kong and Taiwan , to the region , which was then farmland .
Beijing did establish special economic zones to serve as incubators of capitalism , but it also loosened the reins by giving the region more freedom to set its own wages and prices .
Foreign investors provided jobs and technology to local firms through joint ventures .
Other times , local firms illegally copied or reverse - engineered foreign technology .
Wages stayed low because workers were coming in constantly from the countryside and local officials did n’t enforce labor laws consistently .
Private entrepreneurs poured into the region , creating a competitive frenzy that produced prices so unbeatably low they became known simply as " the China price . "
Today , the delta is the world ’s largest consumer electronics production hub , an agglomeration of factory towns to end all other factory towns .
Home to the world ’s largest plant with some 270,000 workers , a prominent electric car producer , and the country ’s largest telecommunications equipment company , it produces a third of China ’s exports .
But the delta ’s success is just one element of China ’s industrial policy .
Elsewhere , China has used foreign investment as a shield to protect domestic companies .
By limiting ownership in car assembly operations to 50 percent , China allowed its companies access to foreign technology while guarding them from the full force of international competition — a strategy Eric Thun , a lecturer at Oxford University , calls " industrial policy on the cheap . "
According to the Chinese government ’s road map , however , the foreign joint - venture partners should have provided their Chinese counterparts the technology and management savvy to produce best - selling cars under their own brands .
So far , that has n’t happened .
But the problem runs even deeper than that : Current industrial policy is n’t making the Chinese economy more balanced , which is precisely what Beijing and the rest of the world want to see happen .
China ’s industrial policy , like Japan ’s over the past three decades , favors people who make things over those who consume them .
The People ’s Bank of China keeps interest rates low to provide financing for producers , at the expense of households , whose effective return on deposits over the past decade has been a measly 0 to 2 percent , according to Daniel Rosen , principal of New York - based consultancy Rhodium Group .
China ’s industrial policy " takes care of borrowers , but what about the people whose money it is in the first place ? "
Rosen asks .
This adds to the imbalances in both the Chinese and global economies by making Chinese consumers worse off , so they ’re more likely to save their money instead of spending it .
By the same token , limited wage growth in areas like the Pearl River Delta enhances China ’s competitive advantage as an exporter , but it , too , hinders growth in consumer spending .
Low interest rates also exacerbate many industries ’ overcapacity problem by making it cheap for manufacturers to borrow .
As Beijing tries to redirect its economy away from labor - intensive exports toward one that relies more on high technology and domestic consumption , it will have to find good answers to questions like Rosen’s .
Going forward , it will be crucial for China to relax its grip over sectors such as health care , education , and telecommunications and channel more loans to private companies .
And perhaps , as Massachusetts Institute of Technology ’s Yasheng Huang and others argue , China needs to allow its currency to appreciate not only to stop distorting its economy and global trade balances , but also to encourage innovation .
As for all those Beijing - watchers falling sway to the current fascination with all things China and contemplating making a little industrial policy of their own , the relevant lesson is clear : Better look under the hood first .
More than one in five borrowers of federal student loans who attend commercial colleges default within three years of beginning repayment , according to new figures being made available on Monday by the Department of Education .
Historically , the government has reported such figures in terms of how many students default within two years  a figure that stands at 6.7 percent of student borrowers over all and about 11 percent at commercial colleges .
But the new three - year numbers , though preliminary , give a clearer picture of whether a student at a particular college will default , and the government will soon begin using them to help decide which colleges qualify for taxpayer - supported student - aid programs .
Currently , colleges with default rates over 25 percent for three straight years can be disqualified , but experts argued that colleges were manipulating the two - year figures .

I love beer , and I love space .
So how could I not love beer from space ?
I 'm not usually one for beer gimmicks , but somehow Sapporo 's Space Barley is an exception .
The beer was made with grains descended from barley that spent five months in the Zvezda Service Module on the International Space Station .
The very limited results , just 250 precious six - packs , will be sold through a lottery for 10,000 yen ( $ 110 ) each .
But only people living in Japan are eligible .
Sigh .
Why are the Russian Academy of Sciences , Okayama University and presumably Russia 's space agency Roscosmos aiding this scheme ?
Well , science of course .
And charity .
" This beer will be sold for charity , to contribute to the promotion of science education for children and the development of space science research in Japan and Russia , through donation of all proceeds to Okayama University , " Sapporo stated in a press release Dec. 3 .
And that sounds nice .
But I think the real reason is : Space Beer !
Also , what will astronauts drink on future extended spaceflight missions ?
They can't take multiple years ' worth of beer with them , so clearly they will have to brew it themselves .
But what about the hops , you say ?
Do n't worry , those were launched into space in August .
Super Space Beer !
Indeed , according to Sapporo , the space - barley research was done for " the purpose of achieving self - sufficiency in food in the space environment . "
Because how self - sufficient could one really be without beer ?

One of the report ’s authors addresses some of the reader comments on the research in a comment on this post .
Corrected the amount of gigabytes in an exabyte .
A report published Wednesday by the University of California , San Diego , calculates that American households collectively consumed 3.6 zettabytes of information in 2008 .
The paper — entitled “ How Much Information ? ” — explores all forms of American communication and consumption and hopes to create a census of the information we consume .
I ’ll be honest : this is the first time I ’ve ever used the word zettabyte .
I ’ve heard of petabytes and even exabytes , but zettabytes are a whole new level of bytes .
If a zettabyte is beyond your comprehension , too , it ’s essentially one billion trillion bytes : a 1 with 21 zeros at the end .
To put that into perspective , one exabyte — which equals 1/1000 of a zettabyte or 1 billion gigabytes — is roughly equivalent to the capacity of 5.1 million computer hard drives , or all the hard drives in Minnesota .
HMI Report / UC San Diego
So where does all this information we consume come from ?
Everywhere , it turns out .
The report suggests the average American consumes 34 gigabytes of content and 100,000 words of information in a single day .
( Leo Tolstoy ’s “ War and Peace ” is only 460,000 words long . )
This does n’t mean we read 100,000 words a day — it means that 100,000 words cross our eyes and ears in a single 24 - hour period .
That information comes through various channels , including the television , radio , the Web , text messages and video games .
The report also describes our voracious appetite for information and entertainment .
In addition to the amount of information we consume , the researchers looked at how much time we devote to each medium .
The study suggests that , on average , most Americans consume 11.8 hours of information a day .
Most of this time is spent in front of some sort of screen watching TV - related content , taking up a little over four and a half hours of our daily information consumption .
Then there ’s the computer , which we interact with for about two hours a day .
There ’s also the phone , radio , music , and print .
Most of these experiences happen simultaneously , too , such as talking on the phone while checking our e-mail , or instant messaging while watching TV .
The report also found a huge increase in the number of bytes we consume related to video games .
Roger Bohn , professor of technology management and co-author of the study , said , “ Gaming saw the biggest leap in the number of bytes we consume and the amount of time devoted to this platform . ”
This is n’t just first - person shooting games but also includes lots of analytical games like Bookworm , Tetris as well as social networking games .
Bohn also told me , “ Print media has declined consistently , but if you add up the amount of time people spend surfing the Web , they are actually reading more than ever . ”
Overall , from 1980 to 2008 , the number of bytes we consume has increased 6 percent each year , the researchers said , adding up to a 350 percent increase over 28 years .
At this rate , it wo n’t be long before we ’re marveling at the next level of bytes : yottabytes .
Funding for the research project came from AT&T , Cisco Systems , I.B.M. , Intel , LSI , Oracle and Seagate Technology , with early support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation .
In 1912 , Jung publishes Transformations and Symbols of the Libido .
The book introduces the concept of the collective unconscious and furthers his position regarding the mytho - poetic nature of the psyche ; in 1912 , ambient trance music has never been heard ; in 1912 , the German pharmaceutical company Merck files a patent that includes an aside about two new molecules that will spawn 100,000 raves , fortify the cult of the “ Burning Man ” celebration , and just possibly be the cure for at least one undeniably debilitating affliction .
The molecules :
3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine ( MDA ) &
3 , 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA )
— also known as the street drug Ecstasy
MDA reached the psychedelic underground in the mid- ’60s .
Nicknamed the love drug , it reportedly induced a feeling of sensuous euphoria .
It was declared useless as medicine and dangerous for citizens , ( though many of those citizens wanted it ) , and made illegal in the United States by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 .
MDMA however remained under the radar until well into the ‘ 80s and underground chemists continued to manufacture and distribute the drug .
In 1978 , Dr. Alexander ( Sasha ) Shulgin ( who had synthesized the drug in 1976 with Dr. David Nichols of Purdue University ) published the first human study of MDMA in the scientific literature .
He described the MDMA experience as “ an easily controlled altered state of consciousness with emotional and sensual overtones . ”
Dr. Shulgin completed his Ph.D in biochemistry from the University of California , Berkeley in 1954 .
He completed his postdoctoral work in the fields of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of California , San Francisco .
It was while working as a senior research scientist with Dow Chemicals that he created the world ’s first biodegradable insecticide and was thus given free range to pursue his own research by the chemical giant .
Highly influenced by that perennial of psychedelic literature , Aldous Huxley ’s Doors of Perception , in which Huxley analyzed and praised the effects of mescaline , a psychoactive alkaloid of the peyote cactus , the young Dow Chemicals scientist decided he too had to experience first hand the wondrous " Heaven and Hell " of psychedelics .
One mescaline trip was enough to transport the chemist on the journey of his life .
His life ’s purpose would be to study , synthesize and experiment with some of the most powerful and intriguing psychoactive molecules on this and probably any other planet .
MDMA , which is structurally similar to both mescaline and to amphetamine , particularly tweaked his interest .
Dr. Shulgin was in contact with many practicing psychotherapists in and around the San Francisco Bay area .
He suggested they try out this new phantastica of personal discovery , a short acting , non-addictive drug with apparently few undesirable side effects that seemed to invoke a most agreeable experience of empathetic understanding and blissful bodily sensations .
An enticing additional effect — Shulgin found that the drug triggered the recall of emotionally charged memories .
The therapists were intrigued and started their own investigations .
They quickly ascertained that the pill did act as the research scientist suggested — it could be used quite handily in relationship therapy , and its ability to facilitate access to traumatic emotional content , when contextualized within the right setting and support , advanced the healing process many fold .
Handled with Care
Though there was excitement about this new drug , the attitude held by the research community was tempered by experience .
Mainstream psychiatry had been seriously burnt when it had embraced psychedelic drugs in the ‘ 60s , as the media broadcasted the remarkable findings with sensational and bizarre but enticing tales that spooked conservatives .
Before Dr. Timothy Leary took centerstage and the youths swallowed up the message to experiment with these powerful substances , psychiatry was making use of them to treat alcoholism and neurosis , to study creativity and to understand how the mind works .
( They also occasionally misused them , as in the criminal behavior of the McGill University hospital in Montreal , where psychiatrist Dr. Ewen Cameron had been pioneering a technique called " psychic driving . ”
Supported with money from the CIA , Cameron experimented on patients , literally driving them insane by dosing them with LSD , confining them to isolation chambers and bombarding them with looped taped suggestions .
Later , Charlie Manson and his crew became the most cogent example of how psychedelics could be used to help fuel the realization of demented , violent fantasies . )
Even mainstream religion tripped to nirvana .
One of the most remarkable documents of the early history ( 1957 ) of psychedelia comes from a monsignor at Vancouver ’s Holy Rosary Cathedral , Vancouver ’s central Catholic church .
He wrote a prayer for those about to embark on a LSD journey : “ We therefore approach the study of these psychedelics and their influence on the mind of man anxious to discover whatever attributes they possess respectfully evaluating their proper place in the Divine Economy .
We humbly ask our Heavenly Mother the Virgin , help of all who call upon her to know and understand the true qualities of these psychedelics , the full capacities of man ’s noblest faculties and according to God ’s laws to use them for the benefit of mankind here and in eternity . ”
MDMA , aka Ecstasy , though considered by some a psychedelic , has singular effects that place it within a subset of that genre of drug , or even within its own completely novel category .
Dr. Ralph Metzner , an elder pioneer of the psychedelic therapy movement and one time student of Dr. Leary , christened MDMA as an “ empathogen ” — a drug that encourages empathy .
Dr. Nichols , considered by many as the foremost psychedelic researcher has called it an “ entactogen ” , — " entactogen " is derived from Greek and Latin roots and means being able to touch within .
Ecstasy might be old news to you , but it is big news to civilization .
Humankind does not come up with a psychoactive drug with unique properties every day .
The rough , addictive depressant alcohol has been in use since at least 10,000 B.C.
People have been stinking up their caves with cannabis from the 3rd millennium BC .
People have been tripping on psilocybin mushrooms at least since the domestication of cattle , And humans were , of course , impatient to start using stimulants , which have been around for just as long .
MAPing the Way to Medicalization
Rick Doblin , a 5 ′ 6 ′ man with the bearing of a guy who wrestled for the high school team , has a doctorate from Harvard ’s Kennedy School of Government and is the founder and director of MAPS , the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies .
MAPS is Rick ’s brain child , the driving force behind a worldwide movement to encourage medical professionals to study the prudent therapeutic application of MDMA with the goal of rescheduling it for medical use — the current tag lines in MAPS publications is “ MAPS : Putting the MD back in MDMA ” .
The only completed study of MDMA assisted psychotherapy for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( which was sponsored by MAPS ) created headlines in 2008 throughout the media landscape , from Dr. Gupta on CNN suggesting that “ people will be amazed at the results ” , to a double spread article in The Economist — “ MDMA assisted patients showed statistically significant improvement of their PTSD symptoms compared with those who received the same day - long therapy sessions with an inactive placebo . ”
A patient under the influence of MDMA , remains calm , centered , and can speak clearly .
Relative to LSD , it is an extraordinarily gentle delving into one ’s own psyche , rather than a wrenching toss into dimensions unknown .
Depression , anxiety and any sense of suffering are usually lifted completely .
The burden of trauma and stress gone — the patient is made profoundly at ease with herself , and the sense of self — rather than being lost or dissolved ( as with the temporary " ego loss " sometimes experienced under other psychedelics ) is made reflective — meditative , calm and loving .
Dr. Julie Holland , of Bellevue Hospital , Faculty , NYU School of Medicine , and editor of Ecstasy : The Complete Guide wrote : “ Any psychiatric disorder that can be ameliorated by psychotherapy can be treated more quickly and more profoundly with MDMA - assisted therapy . ”
The Use and Misuse of this Technology
A profitable way of understanding MDMA and psychedelic drugs is to think of them as technologies .
These technologies are reflectors of self , of the complexity of one ’s own mind — the abstract mind , the rational mind and the emotional mind all twined together permitting us to see our emotional history , and the present state of our psyche , our self .
At the peak of these experiences , the psychedelics can show the world as an unconditioned given , as the world is without firm tags of language , yet it is imminently poetic and symbolic .
Contradictory ?
Sure .
But I would claim that psychedelics provide a glimpse into the soul .
During the late ‘ 70s and early ‘ 80 s the therapists thought it best to keep the lid on .
Not wanting to see a repeat of the clampdown on LSD in the late 1960s , they did not talk to the media about MDMA at all .
The drug underground had other ideas .
MDMA was taken up by countercultural activists and entrepreneurs ( drug dealers , by another name ) .
Quite consciously rebranded as Ecstasy , a black market encouraged casual use and a whole new music culture came into existence .
Overreacting , in 1985 , the state made MDMA Schedule One ( illegal and with no medical use . )
MDMA / Ecstasy is now a demonized substance in the USA , slurred as a narcotic .
It can not be prescribed by a physician , and is prohibited for every application under threat of incarceration .
Prohibition has created a much more dangerous but quite massive underground use and abuse , creating problems with adulterated , sometimes poisonous ‘ product , ’ use of the drug in circumstances that do n’t support the value of the experience , overuse , and use with other drugs .
Meanwhile , the lawful community of therapists and researchers have lost a surpassingly valuable tool .
Professor David Nutt , ( past ) chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs , U.K , wrote in the Journal of Psychopharmacology : ‘ There is not much difference between the dangers of horse - riding and the dangers of ecstasy . ’
Few deaths have been linked to the use of the millions of tabs of MDMA throughout the decades ( 125 tonnes of E is consumed annually world wide according to the UN ) .
But most of those few can be attributed to the setting of specific raves and the miscalculation of users .
Dehydration , overhydration and heat stroke are real dangers , but one does have to put to rest the idea that MDMA was the principal cause of death in most of these cases .
MDMA does increase body temperature ; dancing all night while high without supplying the body with fluids is not a good idea , but neither is drinking water excessively .
There are a few cases of individuals on MDMA who — heeding the advice to keep hydrated –drank an excessive amount of water and died of water intoxication .
In other words , cause of death : water intoxication .
The point is critical ; it brings home the most central dictum of pharmacology , quoting from the father of the science , Paracelsus : “ All things are poison , and nothing is without poison .
For example , every food and drink , if taken beyond its dose is poison ; the result proves it .
I admit that poison is poison ; that it should , however be rejected is impossible . “
The most grievous misuse of MDMA is related to overuse and improper attention to the set and setting of the user while under the influence .
The normal dose is between 100 - 125 mg. , and generally , the dose should not be repeated to extend the length of the trip unless supervised by a therapist .
Also , one trip every three to four months is a reasonable maximum use window , permitting the individual enough time to integrate the knowledge gained by the psyche ’s refocusing ( initiated by the drug ) and permitting the body and brain neurochemistry sufficient time to return to normal baseline functioning .
There is no physical craving for MDMA ; it is not an addictive substance .
MDMA should not be used by anyone with cardiac problems , or with a history of seizures .
Swallowing it every weekend for partying is not at all wise and can prove to be dangerous for long - term mental health .
It ’s also highly ineffective .
The drug provides quickly diminishing returns with repeat use .
The peak engagement is short acting , 3 to 4 hours , as compared to the 8 or more hours of a high dose LSD experience .
Incredibly and importantly , most pain — even chronic pain disappears during an MDMA session .
These effects are consistently reported and observed with the majority of patients .
The Pusher Man
Sales of antidepressant drugs in the United States doubled between 1996 and 2005 , and remains on an upward swing .
In 2008 , sales of these drugs totaled $ 9.6 billion in the US alone .
Direct to consumer advertising for them is about $ 122 million per year .
These pushers are busy , busy , busy ; one company spent $ 34.7 million to pay 2,000 psychiatrists and primary care doctors to deliver 15,000 lectures to market their product to their peers .
These legal , corporate mind drugs are meant to be used on a daily basis for as long as the patient is considered unwell , which could be the rest of his or her life .
That ’s quite a fantastic cash cow , as people return for their prescription refills .
Conversely , in psychedelic therapy , the drugs are used on rare occasions .
They are combined with psychotherapy and — with luck — within a supportive community and there are no patents on the molecules .
No one is going to finance a villa in Venice on magic mushrooms when it can grow in a field strewn with organic sheep manure .
It ’s a long road from prohibited drug , and one with little market value , to a prescribed medicine .
Doblin is confident that MAPS will be able to move forward with the final phase of research — one requiring many more subjects .
Because of the hundreds of millions of dollars spent by the government to investigate the harms that MDMA might cause , there are over 3,000 scientific papers on the subject all in the public domain .
This state sanctioned and financed groundwork will allow MAPS to jump the hurdles of the FDA ’s approval process for about $ 10 million dollars — that ’s a third of what the Ang Lee movie about Woodstock cost and a hell of a lot more true to the heritage of the psychedelic experience .
A monsignor at Vancouver ’s Holy Rosary Cathedral , Vancouver ’s central Catholic church … wrote a prayer for those about to embark on an LSD journey .
Because of ignorance and fear , psychedelic medicines have been left to languish in the underground and are still refused entry into polite society .
No corporation can make a dollar on them .
The patents have expired and they are still taboo .
But prohibition against these non addictive drugs — these mind manifesting enhancers — is a law against our own nature .
We crave — and even desperately need — to feel the fullness of ecstatic mind states ; the disappearance of the bounds that constrict us to our day to day identities , and to fully experience the condition of grace — the condition of being grateful for life .
Our entire society is under constant , ever - increasing stress .
Trauma is prevalent and the old standbys of family and social order are , for many , inadequate .
Civilization is in a chaotic flux .
Only the steady heart of the Self , the emotional self that sees and appreciates our common humanity , in empathy and humility , can right the imbalance .
As we face upsetting economic , social and cultural changes globally and locally , should we not be making use of every technological advancement ?
Oliver Hockenhull is a Vancouver based filmmaker currently producing and directing a documentary essay on the resurgence of psychedelics and psychoactive drugs in therapy ( A PERFECT PILL : FROM NEURONS TO NIRVANA — www.aperfectpill.com)
The years from 2000 to 2009 were unified by fakeness — high - profile charlatans penetrated virtually every area of life ( as Frank Rich also pointed out ) .
From fake celebrities to fake journalists , here 's a top ten of our favourite * frauds .
[* Ed. note : Ravi 's currently writing from London , so we 'll let that slide . ]
Fake journalism : on May 11 , 2003 , the New York Times published a 7,239 word article on the frauds that Jayson Blair , a staff reporter , perpetrated while under their banner .
Here 's how they summed up his misdeeds :
He fabricated comments .
He concocted scenes .
He lifted material from other newspapers and wire services .
He selected details from photographs to create the impression he had been somewhere or seen someone , when he had not .
Those fabrications encompassed the DC sniper story , and the saga of private Jessica Lynch among 600 other pieces he wrote or contributed to .
The scandal went to the top — it led to the resignation of executive editor Howell Raines .
Blair is now a life coach .
Which leads nicely on to :
Fake jobs : ' Life coach ' is a job that can exist only in a decade with not one but two economic bubbles , and the frantic prosperity they led to .
The job — which is basically therapy given by those with no qualifications — garners over 42 million results on Google .
Creative coach gets almost 27 million .
Accountant , to put that in perspective , gets 31 million .
Even those at the top of their fields , like Tony Robbins , who 's even given a TED talk , have wound up in court for misrepresenting the impact of their nice words and quizzes .
This year three people died when self - help ' guru ' James Arthur Ray forced them to sit in a sweltering hot tent as a ' spiritual ceremony ' .
Also : The Secret is bullshit .
If you want something , go out and work for it .
Thinking about it does n't affect the universe .
Thanks .
Fake religion :
It is a small step from there to a full - blown fake religion .
A fact illustrated by the rise , in column inches at least , of Scientology in the last decade — fuelled by celebrity followers like Tom Cruise , Will Smith and John Travolta .
The religion ( or cult , or fraudulent pyramid scheme , depending on your point of view ) is like a satire on a religion .
Sci - fi author L. Ron Hubbard made up a bunch of tenets and a lot of jargon and now vulnerable people like Tom Cruise spend millions on upholding and promoting his ideas .
Here 's the religion in a nutshell : an evil galactic overlord named Xenu flew his followers to earth in DC - 8 aircraft , trapped them in volcanoes and blew them up with hydrogen bombs .
Their spirits now stick to us and are the cause of human problems .
Thus psychology and psychiatry are evil , and the only way to happiness is to spend hundreds of thousands to ' clear ' yourself of these spirits .
Fake .
Fake prosperity : what 's almost more interesting than the multi-billion dollar fraud Bernie Madoff perpetrated are the many other alleged Ponzi - schemers coming out of the woodwork in Indiana ( Tim Durham , pictured above with friend Ludacris ) or Florida or wherever else .
It seems that the idea of living a lifestyle based on nothing but plausibility — nice literature , offices full of Eames chairs and a convincing tone of voice — was a pervasive one .
It 's too easy to use this as a metaphor for the wider economy .
Which is why I 'm going to .
It goes hand in hand with :
Fake celebrity :
We are now so inured to pointless celebrities that this barely seems like a category — it 's more like the definition of celebrity has just been widened .
But a look at some of the biggest figures of the last ten years is a sobering one .
Will we really tell our grandchildren that we were there when Paris Hilton got done for drink driving ?
How will we define her role ?
Heiress ?
Singer ?
Celebrity is the only word that covers it .
And it 's become fake .
Fake television : reality TV is not real .
But the people who are desperate to get on it are , and they perpetrated their own fakeness in an attempt to become fake celebrities in a giant loop of fakeness .
The Heene family captivated the media ( us very much included ) when they pretended their son had been swept aloft in a giant balloon .
The Salahis captivated the media ( us very much included ) when it was revealed that their gatecrashing the White House was the last in a long line of frauds and switches they 'd pulled .
Both sets of people were involved with the murky world of reality TV — and producers vowed to vet their ' characters ' more carefully in future .
We bet they wo n't .
Fake faces : the desire to look young is not new .
But this decade had Botox — its own unique version of the creams , lotions and surgeries that have been around since ancient Man looked at his or her reflection in a still pool and thought ' fuck !
crow 's feet !'.
Directors like Martin Scorsese and Baz Luhrmann , as well as many casting directors , went as far as to publicly say they were sick of actors who could not move their faces .
While there is no evidence that high profile stars like Nicole Kidman have had botox , we have used our ( still expressive ) eyes and come to the following conclusion — Nicole Kidman , a talented actor , can no longer move her face .
She is not alone .
Fake athletes : injections of a different kind plagued sports .
Alex Rodriguez , Barry Bonds and Manny Ramirez succumbed to steroids in baseball .
And persistent rumours of less - detectable HGH use plagued countless more athletes .
Even Tiger Woods ' doctor was found to be involved .
Fake political outrage : do we really care if our politicians sleep around ?
No , we just find their hypocrisy funny .
Is Sarah Palin really mortally wounded every time someone criticizes her ?
Almost certainly not .
Is Fox News actually incensed every time something they do n't like happens ?
No . ( Glenn Beck is , we think being serious , which is worrying in a different way . )
How about , for 2010 — 2020 , we accept that people are flawed and horny , and stop the outrage - fest .
That is not to say that we wo n't continue to laugh at dumb things politicians do .
But to pretend that there 's some higher moral reason for covering these stories , and call for resignations every five minutes , is immoral .
Um , not immoral .
Bad.
Wrong .
Fuck .
It 's hard to stop condemning things .
Fake top tens :
Because no - one reads top nines .
And we like to be meta .
So there 's been a lot of talk about the decline of the dollar over the past year .
Yet , it 's hard to know when you 've really got a problem or just a lot of alarmists speaking in unison .
( Though a lot of alarmists speaking in unison might be its own problem . )
Some news out today might indicate that it 's time to worry .
How bad has the dollar 's slide gotten ?
So bad that Asian central banks are intervening .
The Financial Times reports :
Traders said most of the Asian central banks had been buying US dollars , with the Bank of Korea among the most active following a round of intervention by Seoul earlier in the week .
Other central banks identified by traders as significant buyers of US dollars included Thailand , Malaysia , Taiwan and Singapore , which is a frequent market participant because of its managed currency regime .
In Hong Kong , the Chinese territory 's central bank said it had injected HK $ 8.525bn into the financial system to prevent the currency from rising beyond its fixed trading band against the US dollar .
It is in Asia 's interest to keep the dollar strong , since they export so many goods to the U.S.
With the dollar is down 12 % since March based on the Fed 's currency index , those nations with export - driven economies must be worried .
So worried that they 're taking measures to stop the bleeding .
Marketing and promoting an Indie presents some major challenges .
Like a BASE jumper , we hurled ourselves at the task , armed with Parachutes made from boxer shorts .
Read on for tips and ferrets ...
Posted by sherbethead on Aug 19th , 2009
One day Danny B watched this BASE jumping video featuring some insane jumpers in wingsuits , flying within a nose - hair of a cliff face at 150 m ph .
From that day on , Dejobaan games would never be the same .
We knew it was our duty to enable the world to experience the rush of BASE jumping , but with a Dejobaan twist .
Hence , the concept for Dejobaan 's newest title , AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA !!! --
A Reckless Disregard for Gravity was born .
Our first step was to get the word out to as many gamers as possible to see if our idea appealed to them -- it was simply too crazy to keep locked up in our tiny Watertown , MA location .
But how could we get the word out ?
How could WE , a small indie studio , possibly accomplish that feat ?
Our first challenge : we we sportin ' a bank - busting budget of $ 0.00 for promotion and marketing .
Given our fantastic concept , we had to get an attack ferret to keep the banks at bay .
We set out , ferret in arm , to build awareness for the game , knowing we had to somehow swim above the the sea of ads and PR from AAA studios .
We sent our ferret out to search for contacts at every major and minor gaming press outlet .
Daisy ( that 's our ferret 's adorably threatening name ) came back with a list of email addresses and a hairy arm full of press contacts .
So with this list of email addresses we were ready to start our own Nigerian cash - scam .
Back in reality , we had to find a way to get the press to take notice and actually write about us .
We could n't compete directly with the big studios ' fancy ad campaigns and teams of PR " experts " .
Instead , we had to go 90 or 180 degrees in a different direction .
If they were talking about realistic graphics , we would talk about hyper- unrealistic graphics .
If they were trying to please everyone with a nice PG - 13 message , we were going to be outrageous and get everyone to talk about how much they loved or hated us .
We knew we could n't write a boilerplate , boring press release .
Starting with the title , everything had to be exciting , shock inducing , or just plain insane .
Our goal was to leave the press feeling overjoyed , appalled , incensed , or otherwise compelled to write something about the game .
With that in mind , the Dejobaan team started tossing out names for this future game ...
Low Altitude ?
Blah !
No way .
Deploy Parachute for Hot Chicks ?
It would have opened more doors to put hot chicks in the game , but we were n't moving in that direction at the time .
Falling Toward Earth ?
Too straight forward and boring .
AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA !!!
( Oh # @ ! & I 'm Going to Die ! ) ?
The second half made it seem like that it was impossible to survive .
But that Aaaaa ! part was interesting .
After a few hours and many more beers ... [ drum roll ] ...
AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA !!! -- A Reckless Disregard for Gravity
... was born !
We had two goals for our press release .
First , it had to be just as moving as the name .
Second , the press should be able to just copy and paste our press release and have an exciting story !
The easier we made it for them to write about us , the more we increased the likelihood that they would do so .
With that in mind , we began fabricating a press release that was rich with imagery .
As Founder Ichiro Lambe always says , " Show , do n't tell . "
The first paragraph had to convey the speed , the rush , and the extreme aspect of BASE jumping :
You dive off a skyscraper , relying on quick reflexes to negotiate the intricate tangle of girders that make up the City .
You perform aerial stunts at terminal velocity before parachuting into the arms of your cheering fans .
While other skydivers have it easy , you have to earn the adoration of the crowds by gliding within an eyelash of that glass super skyscraper at 70 miles per hour .
In the second paragraph we went for shock value :
BASE Jumping ( short for Building , Antenna , Span , Earth ) has never been a sport for the masses -- it 's too dangerous , and it 's tough to get permission to jump off of the Burj Dubai .
That all changes when Dejobaan Games brings its own wonderfully twisted take on the sport to the PC .
How late can you deploy your chute before you end up a squishy bag of broken bones ?
How far can you trust your helmet 's proximity meter before you splatter against a window like a bug on a highway ?
Do you believe the game 's developers when they tell you that listening to your Enya CD will relax you and help you coast with more control ... or should you just put on Limp Bizkit and throw caution to the wind ?
Who writes a press release like this ?!
We do .
People liked it .
We then went on to discuss what the gameplay might be like .
The game at the time was a little more than a concept :
As you descend , you toss the spectators a thumbs - up -- or flip them off -- to boost your score .
By suspending reality just a little , this new game makes real - world BASE jumpers look like kids bouncing on a trampoline .
This is AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA !!! , and it 's coming in 2009 .
Check out videos and images from the alpha test at www.dejobaan.com/aaaaa.
Flip off spectators ?
Really ??
This was a random idea that did n't even actually exist in the game at the time , but once we wrote about it , we knew we would have to put it in .
We had managed to get on the press and player 's radars with a name , a few prototype videos on YouTube and only alpha-quality screen shots .
With a budget of $ 0.00 to use on advertising and public relations , and our last title over a year in the past , we had to be memorable .
It 's hard to be an indie studio and grab the press ' attention .
Setting out to " be memorable " and " be different " is hard to quantify , but it is what will get your game noticed by the press .
An interesting concept coupled with your own personal character .
One quote from Destructoid says it best :
Mission Accomplished !

[' Diamond In The Rough ' is a regularly scheduled GameSetWatch - exclusive opinion column by Tom Cross focusing on aspects of games that stand out , for reasons good and bad .
This week , Tom examines the sexual politics behind gamers ' reactions to certain games . ]
It ’s no secret that I am a fan of the most recent Prince of Persia game , and that I find the criticism leveled at that game to be puzzling .
In some ways , the rejection of the game ( and of the Prince especially ) always struck me as incomprehensible .
Recently , while playing Uncharted 2 : Among
Thieves , I was reminded of the Prince , and not just because Nolan North voices both Drake and the Prince .
Specifically , the sexual tension in Among
Thieves reminded me of that less - well developed , much maligned tension in Prince of Persia .
It 's not a secret that a lot of people were annoyed by the Prince ’s voice .
They were annoyed by the way he sounded , and the way he talked , and what he said .
I think that there 's something interesting about what they did n't like about him , and about what they are n't saying when they say they do n't like him .
One especially common knee jerk reaction went as follows : “ The Prince sounds like a callow frat boy , and he has too many muscles . ”
Likewise , people found the sexual nature of some of the Prince and Elika ’s conversations unpleasant or off - putting .
It ’s too sexualized and too plainly stated ( by the main characters ) , they said , it would be better if their changing relationship was implied .
Not Quite " Persian " Enough , Thank You
So what can we learn from these critiques ?
They are angry that he is n't more Orientalized than the game is ( and than the Prince has been historically ) .
Yes , he and Elika travel through a majestic kingdom whose architecture owes a lot to Middle Eastern cultures and their architecture .
Once you play the game , you cannot deny this fact .
What bugs people about the Prince is that he sounds like “ a dude ” .
An American guy .
An American guy very much in the Han Solo / Rogue mold of various popular stories and films .
What 's wrong with that ?
Elika has an American ( or otherwise tonally North American accent .
I 'm not an expert ) accent .
No one ridiculed Elika and maligned her for being too American or too much of an American .
It 's the Prince that bugged them , and specifically , the way Nolan North plays him .
Now , do n't get me wrong , I will be happy when the games industry wakes up and realizes that there is more than one charismatic voice - actor leading man .
Eventually they will realize that there are cowardly , excitable , dour , frightened , and whiny leading men .
Hopefully , by this point , they will realize that there are great female voice actors , who voice lots of different kinds of women ( like Kari Wahlgren , the actress who plays Elika , I 'd argue ) .
They will realize that there are all of these actors , and that those actors are competent and capable !
They are out there , waiting to be offered great roles , working with companies who realize that the actors in their games are assets , not hideous necessities .
I Ain't in This For Your Revolution , Sweetheart
But back to Nolan North .
He plays a variation on his Nathan Drake persona , taking away some charm and adding a few rougher , abrasive edges .
Reviewers ’ reticence toward this one man playing two similar roles is confusing .
Maybe Nolan North can be a little one - note , but it does n't mean he is n't acting .
As the Prince , he is a little more Han Solo / Harrison Ford , and a little more introspective .
He 's less of a " lovable jerk " and more of an " unrepentant jerk . "
I 'm not sure what the difference is precisely ( aside from the dearth of repenting ) , but he is definitely a harder character to like , at first .
He has to earn our ( and Elika 's ) trust and approval .
He may rub us and Elika the wrong way ( more ) at first , but he is stubbornly , boorishly loyal , fearless ( while whining a lot ) , and good for entertaining conversations about choice , theater , and human frailty and fallibility .
Essentially , he is a harder sell .
Nathan Drake is light , flippant , and just plain fun , whereas players actually have to invest time and energy into creating a relationship with the Prince .
This is something gamers are loath to do , even when faced with characters written by grown - ups , characters who have actual character to them .
But that 's not what pissed off all of those journalists .
What pissed them off was that the Prince had the temerity to sound like something other than what they all unthinkingly assumed a " Persian " ( already a hilarious , broken connection , as no Prince in any PoP game has been even tenuously related to the already vague “ Persia ” in gamers ’ heads )
Prince would sound like : an Englishman .
He also had the gall to be well muscled , while we ( apparently ) expect our vaguely ethnic Princes to be lithe young men , full of mysterious , doleful ennui .
A Little British Goes a Long Way
We all know that when it comes to accents and characters , English is code for " foreign , " or " foreign and not white , but almost white . "
It 's how we stomach the ludicrously British cast of Rome , or the original cast of Sands of Time .
Britishness is automatically equated with foreignness .
Here ’s one example of the vitriol engendered by the Prince ’s new style :
“ Having stumbled upon a Princess in peril while out hunting for his wayward donkey , the Americanised Prince falls into a divine battle between the forces of good and evil , and proceeds to wisecrack and Brendan - Fraser his way through an occasionally delicate story of restoring life to a corrupted fantasy world of epic palaces and Skies - of - Arcadian technology .
His antics are almost as destructive to the ambiance as the formerly caged God of Darkness , Ahriman , is to the environment , and his jarring dialogue and delivery persistently overshadow wistful , majestic graphics and his more serious and likeable new female counterpart , who rarely gets a chance to project the character her few monologues attempt to establish .
With an oddly small , immobile head atop bulging musculature , the Prince looks awkward in his own skin , and he certainly feels out of place in his own game . ” *
So there 's one knock against him : he 's only mildly Orientalized ( Ubisoft has taken this series so far in the direction of " mysterious East / West mash up , ” that the Prince and Elika ’s ethnicity is incomprehensible , no matter what metric you use ) , as opposed to the tried - and - true white - face / voice shtick we 're used to .
Here , he has a white voice and a mostly white face .
The idea that this is somehow less “ authentic ” than the hero in Sands of Time is at once highly problematic ( how and why are either of them “ authentic , ” and what does that mean ? ) and almost completely meaningless .
" Nice Guys " and Our Expectations Meet
But that 's just the beginning of it , as shown in the above quote .
People really do n't like the Prince because he 's a dude .
Now , I do n't mean like The Dude .
I do n't mean like Dude Where 's My Car .
I mean he 's the kind of guy who ( when he is n't philosophizing with a princess or being chased buy evil gods ) wants nothing more than money , drink , and companionship of his preferred sex .
And this pisses off a lot of people .
It does n't piss them off because the hero is a heteronormative jerk who spends the first few hours of the game mocking someone who saves his life at regular intervals .
Likewise , no one speaks out about the game ’s simplistically written , stereotypically plotted Concubine , a woman scorned , of course , who takes her revenge in the throatiest voice possible .
Is this what a powerful woman in a game is , especially when compared to the far from reprehensible Elika ?**
This last should not be taken as a statement that the Prince is not an attractive ( potentially ) character to some players .
In fact , to simply say that the Prince is an ass , therefore he is not worthy of the story / Elika / our time is reductive and misleading .
It may be a common , annoying trope that the asshole is really a Nice Guy ( and stems from a problematic assumption about male relationships with perspective female partners ) , but that , again , is not what people find alarming .
If it were , I would understand : the Prince 's " Nice Guy " status has difficulty changing into nice guy ( read : actually good or nice ) status .
He is at best a problematic , dubious hero .
In fact , he 's far more of an anti-hero than most suppose anti-hero bad boys in video games .
Still : this is not what people dislike , not specifically .
We are shown that while the Prince makes bad decisions , he makes them because he is a somewhat deep , multi-faceted character .
His ultimate betrayal of Elika ’s trust and desires is actually quite interesting , if one cares about the complexity ( but not necessarily the quality ! ) of his character : it shows him for the troubled , selfish , not - necessarily good person that he is .
It also asks us to question how he and Elika can be attracted to one another , even if she knows his sense of morals and necessity differs vastly from hers .
The Prince 's Failure is a Good Thing ...
For Us
If one follows the story of the game to its conclusion ( including the Epilogue ) , you ’ll find that Elika , reeling from her “ new ” life , the Prince ’s betrayal , and the burden that has , once more , been placed on her shoulders , abandons him , paying him back for his betrayal .
I like the place where the story ended ( in the Epilogue ) : it made sense for both characters , and I think it completely vindicates the authors ’ choices concerning the Prince ’s deep flaws , the flaws journalists and gamers seem to hate .
They want you to believe that they dislike the Prince because he is a shallow , callow , and stupid lead character , who is n’t interesting or complicated enough .
This is of course , untrue ( as the game ’s writing ably proves , again and again ) .
In fact , I find the writing in this game to be good because it takes a person who acts and sounds like a jerk and shows that he is flawed , but shows that he can create a meaningful relationship with another person .
Furthermore , it tells a story of another person , equally as complex as the Prince , whose feelings grow for him , as his grow in kind .
That flimsy argument regarding the Prince ’s crass , asinine first impression may be why they dislike him publicly .
But I would argue that it partially aggravates them because the Prince and Elika are both sexually aware and unafraid of expressing themselves in a sexual manner , and for some gamers , that can be dangerous , worrisome territory .

If you want to know if a ship is going to sink , watch what the richest passengers do .
iTunes and file sharing killed Tower Records .
The key symptom : the best customers switched .
Of course people who were buying 200 records a year would switch .
They had the most incentive .
The alternatives were cheaper and faster mostly for the heavy users .
Amazon and the Kindle have killed the bookstore .
Why ?
Because people who buy 100 or 300 books a year are gone forever .
The typical American buys just one book a year for pleasure .
Those people are meaningless to a bookstore .
It 's the heavy users that matter , and now officially , as 2009 ends , they have abandoned the bookstore .
It 's over .
When law firms started switching to fax machines , Fedex realized that the cash cow part of their business ( 100 or 1000 or more envelopes per firm per day ) was over and switched fast to packages .
Good for them .
If your ship is sinking , get out now .
By the time the rats start packing , it 's way too late .

I ’ve been first linked the FatELF project in late October by our very own solar ; I wanted to write some commentary about it but I could n’t find the time ; today the news is that the author gave up on it after both Linux kernel and GLIBC developer dissed his idea .
The post where he noted his intention to discontinue the project looks one drama - queen of a post regarding the idea of contributing to other projects …
I say that because , well , it ’s always going to be this way if you think about an idea , do n’t discuss it before implementing , and then feel angry for the rejection when it comes .
I ’m pretty sure that no rejection was personal in this rejection , and I can tell you that what I would have written after reading about it the first time would have been “ Nice Proof of Concept , but it ’s not going to fly ” .
Let ’s first introduce the idea behind the project : to copy Apple ’s “ Universal Binaries ” , that technique that allowed programs to run both on PPC - based Mac as well as the new Intel - based Mac when they decided to make the transaction , this time applying the same principle to the ELF files that are used on basically all modern UNIX and Unix - like systems ( Linux , * BSD , Solaris ) .
There is a strange list of benefits in the project ’s homepage ; I say strange because they really seem straw arguments for creating FatELF , since I rarely have seen this applied in real world .
Let ’s be clear , when Ulrich Drepper ( who ’s definitely not the most charming developer in our community ) says this :
Yes .
It is a “ solution ” which adds costs in many , many places for a problem that does n’t exist .
I do n’t see why people even spend a second thinking about this .
I ’m not agreeing to the fact that nobody should have spent a second thinking about the idea ; toying with ideas , even silly ideas like this one ( because as you ’ll soon see , this is a silly idea ) , is always worth it : it gives you an idea of how stuff works , they might actually lead somewhere , or they might simply give yo the sense of proportion of why they do n’t work .
But there are things to consider when doing stuff like this , and the first is that if there is a status quo , it might be worth discussing the reason of that status quo before going in full sprint and spend a huge amount of time to implement something , as the chance that ’s just not going to work is quite high .
To make an example of another status quo-fiddling idea , you might remember Michael Meeks ’s direct bindings for ELF files ; the idea was definitely interesting , it proven quite fast as well , but it did n’t lead anywhere ; Michael , and others including me , “ wasted ” time in testing it out , even though it was later blocked by Drepper with enough reasons and it ’s no longer worked on .
Let me qualify that “ wasted ” though : it was wasted only from the point of view of that particular feature , which led nowhere , but that particular work was what actually made me learn how the two linkers worked together , and got me interested in problems of visibility and cow as well as finding out one xine bug that would have been absolutely voodoo to me if I did n’t spend time learning about symbol resolution before .
Back to FatELF now : why do I think the idea is silly ?
Why am I agreeing with Drepper about the fact that it ’s a solution with too high costs for the unrequested results ?
Well the first point to make is when Apple made the first step toward universal binaries ; if you think the idea sprouted during the PPC to Intel transition , you ’re wrong .
As Wikipedia notes Apple ’s first fat binary implementation dates back to 1994 .
During the M68 K to PPC transition .
Replicating the same procedure for an architecture change was n’t extremely difficult to them to begin with , even though it was n’t OSX that was used during that particular transition .
The other fact is that the first Intel transition was – for their good or bad – a temporary one .
As you can probably have noted , they are now transitioning from i386 software to x86 - 64 software ( after my post on PIE you can probably guess why that ’s definitely important to them ) .
But it goes much further than that :
Apple has a long history of allowing users to port the content their computer from one to the next with each update , and at the same time they have a lot of third party providing software ; since third parties started upgrading to universal binaries before Intel Macs were released for the users , if users kept up to date with the release , one they got their new Intel Mac they would just had to copy the content from the old to the new system and be done with it .
This is definitely due to the target audience of Apple .
There is another thing to know about Apple and OS X , that you might not know about if you ’ve never used a Mac : applications are distributed in bundles , which are nothing more than a directory structure , inside which the actual binary is hidden ; inside the bundle you find all the resources that are needed for the program to run ( translations , pictures , help files , generic data files , and so on ) .
To copy an application you only have to copy the bundle , to remove almost all applications you just shove the bundle in the trash can .
This forces distributions to happen in bundles as well , which is why Universal Binaries were so important to Apple : the same bundle had to work for all people so that it could still be copied identical between one computer to the other and work , no matter the architecture .
This is also why , comparing the size of bundles built Universal , PPC - only and Intel - only , the first is not as big as the size of the other two : all the external resources are shared .
So back to Linux , and see how this applies : with a single notable exception all the Linux distributions out there use a more or less standard Filesystem Hierarchy Standard compatible layout ( some use LSB - compatible layout , the two are not one and the same , but the whole idea is definitely similar ) .
In such a setup , there are no bundles , and the executable code is already separated from the code that is not architecture - dependent ( /usr / share ) and thus shareable .
So the only parts that cannot be shared , that FatELF would allow to be shared are the executable code parts , like / bin and / lib .
Now let ’s start with understanding where the whole idea is going to be applied : first of all , Linux distributions , by their own design , have a central repository for software , which OS X does not have ; and that central repository can be set up at installation time for getting the correct version of the software , without asking the user to know about the architecture by itself .
The idea of using fat binaries to reduce the size of that repository is moot : the shareable data is already , for most distributions I know , shared in - noarch packages ( arch - independent ) ; the only thing you ’d be able to spare would be the metadata of packages , which I ’m quite sure for most “ big ” applications is not going to be that important .
And on the other hand , the space you ’d be saving on the repository side is going to be wasted by the users on their harddrive ( which is definitely going to be disproportionally smaller ) and by the bandwidth used to push the data around ( hey , if even Google is trying to reduce the downloaded size fatelf is not only going against the status quo but also the technical trend ! ) .
And while I ’m quite sure people are going to say that once again , disk space is cheap nowadays , and thus throwing more disks at the problem is going to fix it , there is one place where it ’s quite difficult to throw more space at it : CDs and DVDs , which is actually one of the things that FatELF is proposing to make easier , probably in light of users not knowing whether their architecture is x86 , amd64 or whatever else .
Well , this is already been tackled by projects such as SysRescueCD that provide two kernels and a single userland for the two architectures , given that x86 - 64 can run x86 code .
The benefits listed in FatELF ’s page seem also to focus somewhat to the transition between one arch and the other , like it ’s now happening between x86 and x86 - 64 ; sure it looks like a big transition and quite a few players in the market are striving to do their best to make the thing as smooth as possible , but either we start thinking of the new x86 - 64 as the arch , and keep x86 as legacy , or we ’re going to get stuck in a transition state forever ; Universal Binaries for Apple played a fundamental role in what has been a temporary transition , and one they actually completed quite fast : Snow Leopard does no longer support PPC systems , and everybody is expected the next iteration ( 10.7 ) to drop support for 32 - bit Intel processors entirely to make the best use of the new 64 - bit capabilities .
Sure there could be some better handling of transitioning between architectures in Linux as well , especially for people migrating from one system to the other , but given the way distributions work , it ’s much easier for a new install to pick up the home directories set up in the older system , import the configuration , and then install the same packages that are installed in the previous one .
After all , FatELF is a trade - off : you trade bigger binaries for almost - universal compatibility .
But is the space the only problem at stake here ?
Not at all ; to support something like FatELF you need changes at a high number of layers ; the same project page shows that changes were needed in the Linux kernel , the C library ( glibc only , but Linux supports uclibc as well ) , binutils , gdb , elfutils and so on .
For interpreted language bindings you also have to count in changing the way Ruby , Python , Java , and the others load their libraries since they now hardcode the architecture information in the path .
Now , let ’s get to the real only speakable benefit in that page :
A download that is largely data and not executable code , such as a large video game , does n’t need to use disproportionate amounts of disk space and bandwidth to supply builds for multiple architectures .
Just supply one , with a slightly larger binary with the otherwise unchanged hundreds of megabytes of data .
You might or might know that icculus.org where the FatELF project is hosted is the home of the Linux port of Quake and other similar games , so this is likely the only real problem that was , up to now , really come up before : having big packages for multiple arches that consists mostly of shareable data .
As said before , distributions already have architecture - independent packages most of the time ; it ’s also not uncommon for games to separate the data from the engine source itself , since the engine is much more likely to change than the data ( and at the same time , if you use the source version you still need the same data as the binary version ) .
The easiest solution is thus to detach the engine from the data and get the two downloaded separately ; I wonder what the issue is with that .
On the other hand , there is a much easier way to handle all this : ship multiple separate ELF binaries in the same binary package , then add a simple sh script that calls the right one for the current host .
This is quite easy to do , and requires no change at any of the previously - noted layers .
Of course , there is another point made on the FatELF project page that this does not work with libraries … but it ’s really not that of an issue , since the script can also set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the correct path for the current architecture as well .
Again , this would solve the same exact problem for vendors without requiring any change at all in the layers of the operating system .
It ’s transparent , it ’s easy , it ’s perfectly feasible .
I hear already people complaining “ but a single FatELF file would be smaller than multiple ELF files ! ” .
Not really .
What you can share between the different ELF objects , in theory , is still metadata only ( and I ’m not convinced by the project page alone that that ’s what it ’s going to do , it seems to me like it ’s a sheer bundling of files together ) : SONAME , NEEDED entries and similar .
Unless you also start bundling different operating systems together – which is what the project also seem to hint at – because in that case you also have no warranty that the metadata is going to be the same : the same code will require different libraries depending on the operating system it ’s built for .
Generally , an ELF file is composed of executable code , data , metadata related to the ELF file itself , and then metadata related to the executable code ( symbol tables , debugging information ) and metadata related to the data ( relocations ) .
You can barely share the file ’s metadata between architectures , you definitely cannot share it between operating systems as stated above ( different SONAME rules , different NEEDED ) .
You could share string data , since that ’s actually the same between different architectures and operating systems most of the time but that ’s not really a good reason ; you cannot share constant data because there are different ordering , different sizes and different paddings across architectures , even two very alike like x86 and x86 - 64 ( which is why it ’s basically impossible to have inter- ABI calls ! ) .
You cannot share debugging information either ( which might be the big part of an ELF file ) because it ’s tied to the offset of the executable code , and the same applies to the symbol tables .
So , bottomline , since there are quite a few strawy benefits on the FatELF project page , here is a list of problems caused by that approach :
introduces a non-trivial amount of new code at various layers of the system ( kernel , loader , linker , compiler , debugger , language interpreters , … ) , it does n’t matter that a lot of that code is already published by now , it has to be maintained long - time as well , and this introduces a huge amount of complexity ;
( kernel , loader , linker , compiler , debugger , language interpreters , … ) , it does n’t matter that a lot of that code is already published by now , it has to be maintained long - time as well , and this introduces a huge amount of complexity ; would increase dramatically the size of downloading packages for the optimistic case ( a single architecture throughout a household or organisation ) since each package would comprise of multiple architectures at once ;
( a single architecture throughout a household or organisation ) since each package would comprise of multiple architectures at once ; would use up more space on disk since each executable and library would then be duplicated entirely multiple times ; note that at the time Universal Binaries started popping up on systems , more than one software was released to strip the other architecture out of them to reduce space to be wasted on already - ported or wo n’t - be - ported systems ; while FatELF obviously comes with the utilities by itself , I ’m pretty sure most tech - savvy users would then decide simply to strip off the architectures that are useless to them ;
since each executable and library would then be duplicated entirely multiple times ; note that at the time Universal Binaries started popping up on systems , more than one software was released to to reduce space to be wasted on already - ported or wo n’t - be - ported systems ; while FatELF obviously comes with the utilities by itself , I ’m pretty sure most tech - savvy users would then decide simply to strip off the architectures that are useless to them ; would require non-trivial cross-compilation from build servers which right now all the distributions , as far as I know , tend to avoid .
In general , distributions will definitely never going to want to use this ; free software projects would probably employ better their time by making sure the software is easily available in distributions ( which often means they should talk to distributors to make sure their software has an usable build system and runtime configuration ) ; proprietary software vendors might be interested in something like that – if they are insane or know nothing about ELF , that is – but even then the whole stack of changes needed is going to be way disproportionate to the advantages /
So I ’m sorry if Ryan feels bad about contributing to other projects now because people turned down his idea , but maybe he should try for once to get out of his little world and see how things work with other projects involved , like discussing stuff first , asking around and proposing : people would have turned him down with probably most of the same arguments I used here today , without him having to spend time writing unused ( and unusable ) code .
It 's time for traditional media companies to stop whining and face the fact that far too many of them , lulled by a lack of competition and years of pre-tax profits of 20 per cent or more , put cash flow above journalism and badly misread the web when it arrived on the scene .
The focus was on consolidation , cost- cutting , and pleasing Wall Street – not modernisation and pleasing their readers .
They were asleep at the wheel , missed the writing on the wall , let the train leave the station , let the ship sail – pick your metaphor – and quickly found themselves on the wrong side of the disruptive innovation the internet and new media represent .
And now they want to call timeout , ask for a do - over , start changing the rules , lobby the government to bail them out , and attack the new media for being ... well , new .
And different .
And transformational .
Suddenly it 's all about thievery and parasites and intestines .
Get real , you guys .
The world has changed .
Did you know that newspaper circulation is down 7 million over the last 25 years while unique readership of online news is up 34 million in the last 5 years ?
Did you know newspaper advertising fell nearly 19 per cent this year while web advertising is up 9 per cent and mobile advertising is up 18 per cent ?
Did you know that more video was uploaded to YouTube in the last 2 months than if ABC , CBS , and NBC had been airing all - new content every minute of every day since 1948 ?
And did you know that we have access to more than one trillion web pages , 100,000 iPhone apps , and send more text messages a day than there are people on the planet ?
And Rupert Murdoch still thinks aggregators are the problem ?
We 're not in Kansas anymore , Toto .
And some things are better while some things , for the moment , are worse in terms of upheaval and especially the painful loss of jobs .
But this is unarguably a Brave New Media World .
And there is no use living in digital denial .
The information superhighway is a busy thoroughfare and there 's going to be some road kill along the way .
But only among those who insist on merging into traffic riding a horse and buggy .

‘ The Liberal Party is currently led by people whose conviction on climate change is that it is ‘ crap ’ and you do n’t need to do anything about it .
Any policy that is announced will simply be a con , an environmental fig leaf to cover a determination to do nothing . ’
– deposed Liberal Party leader Malcolm Turnbull .
With the Liberal Party now taken over by a bunch of conspiracy theorists and global warming deniers , the terrain of the debate around emissions trading has shifted .
Tony Abbott has ridden to victory on a wave of anger from the flat - earthers among Coalition MPs and party members – those who claim the planet is actually cooling , and see climate change as a communist plot .
Nick Minchin , the key power - broker behind Abbott ’s rise , claimed on the 9 November Four Corners program that “ for the extreme left [ climate change ] provides the opportunity to do what they ’ve always wanted to do , to sort of deindustrialise the Western world . ”
He is backed by a string of fanatical right - wing Liberal and National MPs who openly deny that the climate is changing .
One of the loudest of those is Cory Bernardi , who backs his claim that “ the earth is not actually warming ” with the penetrating insight that “ We still have rain falling .
We have crops still growing .
We can go outside and we wo n’t cook . ”
Under the new Liberal leadership the nutbags have found full voice , and they ’re shouting it to the rafters , insistent that they will not co-operate with the government on its Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme ( CPRS ) .
This scheme – which had bipartisan support until the Liberals tore themselves up – involves setting a national greenhouse gas emissions cap and issuing “ emissions units ” to the level of that cap .
Companies will be able to buy and sell these units in order to pay for their pollution .
If a company does n’t hold enough units to cover its pollution it can buy some from another company that has more than it needs .
In theory the market will , through its invisible hand , ensure that emissions are reduced to whatever level the cap dictates .
In reality , it is a giant fraud .
When Labor first put forward the bill it was already a giant gift to polluting industries , offering billions of dollars in subsidies to make sure that they were n’t inconvenienced or irritated by attempts to save the planet .
Big business needed assurances that investment inflows would continue to polluting industries , regardless of the state of the planet .
Yet when the government took it to parliament they decided to negotiate with the Liberals to make it even better for big business and transfer even more cash to the polluters .
The amended legislation notes that “ initial effective rates of assistance will be 94.5 per cent and 66 per cent respectively ” for the biggest trade - exposed polluters .
What this means is that the polluters with the highest CO 2 emissions will receive 94.5 per cent compensation for what they are actually charged .
The rate of assistance will reduce by a paltry 1.3 per cent a year after the initial period .
The power companies are screaming bloody murder about the whole thing .
Yet there is a possibility that they will be given more in assistance than what it actually costs them in penalties .
Recognising this , the bill states that “ recipients of coal - fired generation assistance must subject themselves to a review to minimise the prospect of them receiving a ‘ windfall gain ' ” .
Phew !
Let ’s hope James Packer conducts a similar review to make sure he pays the right amount of tax .
In fact , the power generators will receive almost 230 million emissions units for free over the first 10 years of the operation of the scheme , while any review of windfall gains is postponed until 2018 .
The bill that Rudd ’s Labor is trying to push through contains provisions to move around $ 6 billion in previously allocated compensation to households ( for higher energy prices ) back to compensate the polluters .
Stopping global warming truly is a polluter ’s paradise under this model .
No wonder the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group back the proposal down the line .
The scheme that Rudd and the ex-merchant banker Turnbull came up with is nothing more than “ a con , an environmental fig leaf to cover a determination to do nothing ” .
Yet this still was n’t enough for the sections of capital associated with coal mining and power generation .
Like tobacco companies and lung cancer , they want the whole issue to just disappear .
The Greens have rightly slammed Labor for what they describe as the “ Continue Polluting Regardless Scheme ” .
Labor chose to negotiate with a party that only ever looks out for the interests of big business ( and is full of climate change deniers ) instead of trying to work with a party genuinely committed to taking real action .
The main criticism that the Greens have thus far been levelled at the CPRS is that it rewards polluters and has n’t yet set a cap on emissions , or that when it does , the cap will be far too low .
This fundamentally misses the point that , whatever the cap on emissions , the scheme is unlikely to deliver the needed results .
This sham is not simply the result of failed negotiations but the logical outcome of the scheme ’s design .
Global warming is the direct result of a system which places profit above need , exchange above use .
The CPRS is another market mechanism that relies on the idea that markets are efficient – i.e. that the price of something will reflect its true value .
Yet markets are not efficient .
They are constantly manipulated and distorted through speculation and the conscious intervention of states and companies .
The clearest example of this is the proposed implementation of a price cap on the emissions units over the first five years of the scheme ’s operation .
This cap , according to the legislation “ will take the form of access to an unlimited store of additional emissions units ” .
Under this system , there is a guarantee that the price of carbon emissions permits will not rise to any level that threatens to price dirty coal out of the energy equation .
The market would not have this any other way .
Yet on the flip side , there is no guarantee that prices wo n’t collapse – as they have in Europe , which has a failed carbon trading system .
There , according to Michael Meacher , Britain ’s former environment minister , “ Business has frankly made billions out of artificial reductions of what is called hot air with absolutely no environmental benefit at all . ”
Australia is set to run down this same path – massive government subsidies to polluting industries for little or no environmental gain .
Because the CPRS proposes emissions reductions through the selling and trading of permits , it perpetuates rather than eliminates heavy polluting industries .
Instead of this charade about “ penalising polluters ” , which is just a cover for paying polluters , there should be genuine government intervention to fund alternative energy sources .
When there was market failure in the financial system , governments everywhere showed that they can and will intervene , spending trillions of dollars to save the system .
When it comes to saving the planet , however , there is far more reluctance to act .
This article , by Ben Hillier , first appeared in Socialist Alternative .
Repeating his prediction that the economy faces a threat of a " double - dip " recession and at best a slow - growth U - shaped recovery , Roubini said in a live interview that more banks will fail and residential real estate prices have more room to decline .
Additionally , non-government bonds will face pressure , the securitization market is all but dead , the credit markets are still frozen and consumers will continue to save more rather than spend and boost growth .
" It 's going to be death by a thousand cuts , " said Roubini , chairman of RGE Monitor and economics professor at New York University 's Stern School of Business .
" The financial system is severely damaged , and it 's not just the banks . "
Roubini predicted more than 1,000 financial institutions could fail before all is said and done .
At the same time , he said housing prices are likely to fall another 12 percent in the next year — 40 percent overall since the market began its steep decline — and about half of all homeowners will owe more on their mortgages than their houses are worth .
" The gap between supply and demand is so huge we could stop producing new homes for a year to get rid of all the inventory , " he said .
" This price adjustment , in my opinion , is going to continue for another year . "
In addition to assessing the current problems , Roubini reflected on the year since Lehman Brothers collapsed and its effects on the financial markets .
Roubini was among the most prescient economists in predicting the failure of the financial system , though he has said that aggressive intervention has prevented the worst - case scenario from happening .
Venezuelanalysis.com --
On the question of the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela , Michael Lebowitz is one of the thinkers who has penetrated deepest into our process .
He plunges his scrutinising gaze into its most diverse and conflicting issues , in order to calmly and forcefully reveal its truth with knifelike clarity .
He talks like a peasant or a worker who dips into the reality that they experience , that they suffer and feel .
At the Centro Internacional Miranda , I had a chance to converse with Lebowitz , a professor from the Simon Fraser University in British Columbia ( Canada ) .
Lebowitz is the author of outstanding books such as Socialism does not fall from the sky ( much discussed by President Chávez ) and Build it now : Socialism for the 21st Century .
I do not hesitate to declare that Lebowitz is an essential light for us in the Bolivarian revolutionary process .
Many problems and many concerns were raised in this interview and he responded to them with simple and accurate clarity .
[ For more by Michael Lebowitz , click HERE . ]
José Sant Roz :
We are concerned with the issue of socialism , but there is sometimes a big difference between what is said and what is done in reality .
Michael Lebowitz :
This is always going to be true .
But the first thing we need to do is to create a vision and for this you need the words .
There is an old saying that if you do not know where you want to go , any road will take you there , but no , this is not true ; rather , if you do not know where you want to go , no road will take you there .
And I think that in Venezuela , with the development of the concept of socialism for the 21st century , we know where we want to go .
We do n’t want to move towards a society in which the state directs everything .
It should be a society where people develop themselves through their practice , through their protagonism .
This vision is clear and it is a vision that is very different from the experiences of socialism in the 20th century .
That is the first step , a very important step , but now we come to the crucial step : Understanding how this should be done in practice and how can we establish the institutions that allow people to develop .
This is being developed now through the communal councils , workers ' councils , where people participate in making the decisions that affect them .
The problem , though , is that it ’s not so easy to do that when there are people who want to do everything for others from above .
They say : we are going to create communal councils everywhere , communes everywhere .
And if the people are not ready to develop their communal councils , they say we ’ll do them ourselves .
Part of the problem is impatience that does not respect the process and the time that must elapse for people to develop themselves .
Furthermore , there are people who are totally opposed to the idea that the people themselves make their own decisions .
The clearest case can be seen with workers ' participation .
There are people who believe that workers are unable , that they are not prepared , and that they do n’t have the knowledge to make decisions affecting their work process .
The result of this attitude is reflected in the fact that electricity outages are occurring throughout all of Venezuela .
The workers know what the problems are , but they have not been allowed to implement the solutions , to take the necessary steps to prevent such outages .
Vision is important but it is not enough ; it is not sufficient --- struggle is always necessary .
When you say that there are people who oppose this process are you also referring to people within chavismo ?
Yes , of course , within chavismo .
That 's why , for example , there is no workers ' participation at PDVSA [ the state oil company ] .
Simón Bolívar founded Gran Colombia on December 17 , 1819 , and died on December 17 , 1830 , and then this tremendous work he created with his great strength and will disappeared .
What if Hugo Chavez were to disappear today ?
I think it would be a great loss , not only for Venezuela but for the whole world , because under the leadership of Hugo Chavez the hope that was lost has been restored , the hope that there is an alternative to neoliberalism .
If such a thing occurred at this time it would be more than a loss , it would be a tragedy , because I think the process is not sufficiently developed that it could continue with leadership from below .
Perhaps by 2020 there would be a possibility that the process could continue without Chavez .
But right now , no .
What can be done to ensure that there are substitutes that can take over the struggle from Chavez without much trauma ?
There are people working very close to Chavez , in his circle , who have Chavez 's ideas , his vision , his consciousness , but they lack the charisma of the president to lead .
At the same time there are others that are much better known , but I 'm not sure they share the project that President Chavez is leading .
And today I am speaking very carefully , sometimes I say this very strongly and openly .
With the oil situation , which remains our major export product , and in the face of the new global drama of high food prices , we find ourselves with a situation of abandonment in the countryside : how in a short period of time , could we structure a form of economy different from that of mono - production imposed on us by capitalism ?
Oil is not a problem but a blessing .
There are many countries in the same situation where agriculture has been abandoned or has been more or less marginalised by transnational corporations .
The existence of oil resources allows the Venezuelan state to take a part of this revenue to build infrastructure and create conditions in the countryside so that people feel they want to return to work in the countryside and see that it is possible to have a good life .
With the food crisis it is absolutely essential to encourage people to go to live in the countryside .
With oil revenues these conditions can be created .
Compare this situation with the situation in Cuba where they also have problems with agricultural production , and where people are leaving the countryside , and they do not have the oil revenue to attract people back to the countryside .
What appears to be happening in Cuba is that they are saying we will allow private property in agriculture [ and thus attract people ] and some people will make lots of money producing and selling food at great profit .
In Venezuela it is possible to use part of the oil wealth to create units of agricultural production in the countryside and to attract people , not through high incomes for producers but based on the quality of life that these people can enjoy living in the country .
Agriculture has been an area where all attempts to build socialism have failed .
The Soviet Union ignored agriculture and in some rural areas it was impossible to walk or drive on the roads .
People had to bring products to market by air .
China said that they would not follow the Soviet path , and would develop agriculture , but they did n’t .
They were still extracting resources from the countryside for industry .
So instead of what happened in other places where agriculture served industry , here in Venezuela , you can do the opposite : make oil serve agriculture .
If the countryside is abandoned , it will require a long time to train people who want to do the jobs required by agriculture .
People have changed a lot in the cities and it would be very difficult to convince them to be “ peasant ” farmers .
Yes , it will take time .
This is not going to happen overnight .
But I think that President Chavez understands this problem .
It is no coincidence that there are so many Hello President shows in rural cooperatives , in the new socialist farms .
I think it 's a way of saying to people who are living in the hills and barrios and who are spending a lot of time trying to get to work , to say , look , it 's time for a change .
There is much more you can do .
In Brazil the Movement of Landless Workers [ MST ] has many young people , and when the MST occupies land , they gain land for these families to begin a new life .
In Brazil the stereotype that all farmers are old is not true .
Perhaps what is needed is to launch a campaign aimed at young people to facilitate this process of repopulation of the countryside .
In view of the international situation : we are very threatened ; how should we prepare ourselves to face a more critical situation in northern South America ?
I just finished a book that addresses an issue which is the problem of the old state that progressives have appropriated , and not necessarily by force .
In the long run , socialism requires that the old state is replaced by the new , the state from below .
The immediate situation requires , though , that the two states complement each other .
The new state from below that helps people develop cannot initially have a global vision .
The old state , though , is in the habit of giving orders from above .
What is essential is to develop the interaction between the two states and for a time you have to walk on two legs ; and the same is true when it comes to preparing for a crisis of military intervention .
That implies having a traditional army that can protect people , but we should also arm the people and develop the militias from below .

Elinor Ostrom may arguable be considered the mother of field work in development economics .
She has worked closely investigating water associations in Los Angeles , police departments in Indiana , and irrigation systems in Nepal .
In each of these cases her work has explored how between the atomized individual and the heavy - hand of government there is a range of voluntary , collective associations that over time can evolve efficient and equitable rules for the use of common resources .
With her husband , political scientist Vincent Ostrom , she established the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis in 1973 at Indiana University , an extraordinarily productive and evolving association of students and professors which has produced a wealth of theory , empirical studies and experiments in political science and especially collective action .
The Ostrom 's work bridges political science and economics .
Both are well known at GMU since both have been past presidents of the Public Choice society and both have been influenced by the Buchanan - Tullock program .
You can also see elements of Hayekian thought about the importance of local knowledge in the work of both Ostroms ( here is a good interview ) .
My colleague , Peter Boettke has just published a book on the Ostrom 's and the Bloomington School .
Elinor Ostrom 's work culminated in Governing the Commons : The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action which uses case studies to argue that around the world private associations have often , but not always , managed to avoid the tragedy of the commons and develop efficient uses of resources .
( Ostrom summarizes some of her findings from this research here ) .
Using game theory she provided theoretical underpinnings for these findings and using experimental methods she put these theories to the test in the lab .
For Ostrom it 's not the tragedy of the commons but the opportunity of the commons .
Not only can a commons be well - governed but the rules which help to provide efficiency in resource use are also those that foster community and engagement .
A formally government protected forest , for example , will fail to protect if the local users do not regard the rules as legitimate .
In Hayekian terms legislation is not the same as law .
Ostrom 's work is about understanding how the laws of common resource governance evolve and how we may better conserve resources by making legislation that does not conflict with law .
Hey Secret Agent Man , here ’s Obama , the senator flashing his pearly whites with Randy Jackson , better known as a judge on American Idol .
“ Others pictured are Black Eyed Peas Rock Band ; Tareq Salahi the President of the America ’s Polo Cup ; President Elect Obama , Fergie from Black eyed Peas and Michaele Salahi , posing this time as a former Miss USA and SuperModel . ”
Polo Contacts
Worldwide could make it easy for the investigating Secret Service by brown - enveloping them the picture below :
While the big gun media and American Secret Service are out there investigating “ party crashers ” Tareq and Michaele Salahi , no one ’s telling the truth : Obama knew the Salahis when he was still an Illinois senator .
Interesting little detail for White House gumshoes :
As the above photo was published in June 2005 , Barack Obama was still Senator Obama and not the President Elect .
And with Michaele Salahi yesterday having been caught out — Facebook pompoms notwithstanding — as a bogus cheerleader for the Washington Red Skins and not a model for Victoria ’s Secret as claimed , Canada Free Press ( CFP ) leaves it to FoxNews.com to find out if she ever was a “ former Miss USA ” .
We do know for a fact that among the slew of memberships on charitable boards , Tareq Salahi is a former member of The American Task Force on Palestine ( ATFP ) .
The only way to know for a fact is because even though ATFP scrubbed all references to Salahi as a board member , he can still be found on Google cache .
( Canada Free Press )
Sad that White House Secret Service are looking like Keystone Kops in the aftermath of Obama ’s very first state house dinner in the tent .
While the media is fixated on the hitch in Michaele Salahi ’s git-along , there can be no doubt that these recently minted “ party crashers ” really get around .
We take you back to June 9 , 2005 when Tom Nelson , operating officer of AARP , was summing up the Rock the Vote Awards night .
According to the Washington Post “ everyone from Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama to “ American Idol ” judge Randy Jackson and R&B singer Mya gathered in the National Building Museum ’s Great Hall :
“ You were probably wondering , as you sat down at your table , ‘ What the heck is the AARP doing in a Rock the Vote Event ? ’ ” Nelson noted .
Time would soon tell that the AARP would show up in other fishy places .
And if there is anyone who must know that this weekend ’s party crasher story is a crock it ’s John McCain who was at the Vote Awards Night , and who along with Barack Obama , was honored with the Rock the Nation Award , Obama “ for forming a multiracial coalition in winning his seat ” .
McCain was handed his award for “ his work on campaign finance reform ” .
“ Just call me Funk Master McCain , ” he told the audience of 1,000 in accepting his award . : ( washingtonpost.com , June 9 , 2005 .
Meanwhile , do n’t know why Obama ’s long time associates possibly could be mistaken for party crashers when they came into the tent with a Bravo Reality TV Show “ Real Housewives of DC ” professional camera crew and makeup artist in tow unless he was hoping for a Reality gig for wife Michelle , CBS celebrity Katie Couric or Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel .
Obama could end the “ party crasher ” goose chase for White House Secret Service in a proverbial New York Minute by coming clean on his almost 5 - year - old social / political relationship with Tareq and Michaele Salahi .
It could save money in these recessionary times and put an end to the drama of Washington ’s “ unprecedented ” first state dinner in a tent .
I first met Penny Flame in a high - priced hotel room at the InterContinental , when she was staying in San Francisco , appearing as a star in promotion of her ( then ) new film , Chemistry # 4 .
I recorded a long interview with Penny then met her , Tristan Taormino , Susie Bright and others for a post - appearance dinner .
Flame was hard - edged but funny and kind ; full of stories and humor about her job and the world .
Later , she performed in many more films , becoming a true star and a force to be reckoned with in the world of mainstream porn , and directed a female - centered series of hardcore sex -ed videos .
What I missed was meeting Jennie Ketcham .
That 's Penny Flame 's real name .
Recently , Penny Flame quit porn .
She immediately started a blog , beautifully named Becoming Jennie , and reinvested herself into her life as an artist .
We recently reconnected ; I was on a local porn set last week and one of the photographers started talking with me about Jennie and how excited we all are for her to be entering an exciting and positive new chapter -- but with a sex - positive stance on porn , women and self - defined sexuality .
And most of all , a cool attitude of sexual responsibility .
You'd think this would n't be hard math when it comes to women and their relationship to working in porn , but somehow it has been in the past .
Jennie 's the new wave .
Talking with her last weekend , Jennie sees the women who leave the porn business and try to milk the publicity out of their situation as not only selling a hollow stereotype , but also creating an unsustainable model for their own healthy sexuality :
I hate the common exit strategy , hate that girls join the ' god squad ' or feel ashamed of the choices they made but I understand it .
I can see that it 's much easier to say ' porn did this to me , or that ' but at the end of the day , we are all responsible for the choices we make .
I chose to be a porn star .
Now I 'm choosing not to be .
It 's the beautifully terrible thing about free will : we can do whatever we like but we must be held accountable for whatever we do .
Just because I do n't want to be a porn star today does n't mean that I should feel ashamed to have been one seven months ago .
It 's something I did and I 'm not afraid to say I did it , loved doing it , and just do n't feel like it's what I need to do anymore .
Shame and guilt are useless emotions .
The only way I would feel ashamed is if I 'd decided being a porn star is n't what 's best for me and then continued doing it anyway .
Jennie quit on her own terms , but not after feeling like she was n't in control of her identity anymore : she tells me :
I quit the adult business after entering into rehab for sex addiction .
My intentions when entering were not recovery oriented , in fact , I planned on using ' Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew ' as a springboard , hoping the national coverage would rocket my porn - star persona and career , knowing full well the implications .
A porn star that goes to rehab for sex addiction ?
Is n't she just a workaholic ?
It took three days of the mic guy chasing me around , calling me Jennie , for me to realize that I 've spent my entire adult life developing the identity of a woman I am not .
A woman that exists for the sole purpose of others ' enjoyment .
I realized I have no identity as Jennie Ketcham and that I am incapable of developing sincere and intimate relationships .
I do n't blame this problem on being in pornography , it was something I 've struggled with for a long time , but to continue as an adult performer would just perpetuate the issues .
I quit because I wanted an identity outside of being a porn star .
I wanted to be Jennie again .
There really is no ' how ' ...
Quitting is just something you do .
I went into my agency , thanked the agent for helping me to become the porn star I 'd become , and said I am eternally grateful for all the hard work he 's put into my career .
Then I deleted all the names in my phone that were fake , deleted every person whose real name I did n't know .
Changed my number .
Moved on .
I started a blog called Becoming Jennie to document the struggles of building one 's identity after devoting the early part of my adult life to developing another that I could no longer live .
I 've also quit drinking , using , and am doing the whole " date myself " thing for the first year of becoming Jennie .
It 's actually the best thing I 've ever done .
Because I know it really is just for me .
When performers quit porn , reactions can be devastating .
A support network of friends can become a closed circle that essentially edits you out of their lives , while the industry press gently closes the door and says good night , and former performers become ghosts .
Jennie 's experience was mixed .
" People reacted as they reacted .
Some thought it was a publicity stunt .
Others knew it was for real .
My family and friends have been incredibly supportive , and the main reason this transition has gone so smoothly .
For the most part , people that knew me as Penny prefer me as Jennie , which reinforces every decision I 've made in the past seven months .
Even my old agency supports the decision .
We 've got to move on with life at one point or another , why not now right ? "
I had to ask her , was it hard to just up and quit a persona , a career , the glamour and press , and take the risk ?
She explained , " The most difficult thing , aside from adjusting to a new tax bracket , has been convincing myself that a life outside being a porn star is possible .
I mean , a decision I made at 18 will play out in the rest of my life , undoubtedly , but the obstacles I face are not insurmountable .
That and adjusting to the belief that I can bring something to the table that is more worthwhile than dirty talk , a great rack and a filthy mind .
The notion that my worth revolves around my sexuality is something I struggle with on a daily basis ...
In fact , that 's a big reason of why I entered adult in the first place .
I always knew sex sells , but then I thought it 's all I was capable of selling .
Now , I am becoming more and more convinced that what I have to offer is so much more than something existing between my legs .
Now it 's between my ears . "
Her outlook on her porn past is refreshing and empowering .
Jennie muses , " Looking back , I 'm proud of my career .
I 'm proud to say that I conquered the porn world , best that any freckled 26 - year - old girl can do .
I traveled the world in the name of great sex and amazing adventures , went places I otherwise would n't have been able to .
I met some incredible people and created some friendships that have withstood the test of this transition .
I am grateful to have been where I 've been and seen what I 've seen .
I 've also slept with enough people that this year of not sleeping with anyone is a cakewalk .
I would n't be in the wonderful place I am today if it were not for where I 'd been as a porn star , and Penny Flame . "
" After starting the blog , Becoming Jennie , some amazing things started to happen .
I started selling my paintings .
I hooked up with a literary agent who is representing the memoir I 'm currently writing , I met a producer that is encouraging me to write a script about my life and is ready to option the memoir once it 's finished .
I reconnected with friends from my past , and started building a relationship with my father , a man who 's watched me grow from afar .

Oversharing
The 00s were one big Overshare .
The rise of mobile phones turned the world into your psychiatrist ’s office , while Facebook status updates , celebrity Twitter feeds , and mommy blogs enabled the relentless broadcasting of personal minutia , from the mundane ( “ Buying fresh fennel at Whole Foods ” ) to the shocking ( “ Just got DNA results .
Jason ’s the daddy ! ” ) .
Another source of oversharing ?

Bleep bloop , enjoy that severance !
TV Shows That Are Better Than Any Movie Ever Made
Mainstream film did not exactly enter a new golden age in the early 2000s .
In fact , most high - grossing blockbusters were C.G.I. - glutted behemoths of recycled ideas .
The last people anyone expected to step into the quality - entertainment breach were the nation ’s television producers , but — somehow — they did just that .
Whether you were into the gritty urban realism of The Wire , the hypnotic narratives of Mad Men , or the epic Jersey saga of The Sopranos , it was a fantastic decade for TV — and for AMC , FX , and Showtime , networks previously known for little - seen Tommy Lee Jones films or last - resort soft - core late - night porn .
Gamer Culture
Behold the emergence of Red Bull–quaffing World of Warcraft players , shut - in Second Lifers , and Halo die - hards .
The sheer unbridled geekery of gamer culture , where sophisticated graphics and motion - capture interfaces created a dazzling alternative to boring ol ’ human existence , matured into a nationwide obsession , hastened by user - friendly innovations such as Wii Bowling or Guitar Hero , the latter of which allowed a generation of tipsy Uncle Bobs to unleash their inner Jimmy Page , to the quiet discomfort of all .
Celebutards
In the past , you usually had to do something significant to become famous , like act or sing or play a professional sport .
But this decade , thanks to TMZ and US Weekly , the barrier to entry became absurdly low , as witnessed by the glut of “ celebutards ” : the young , wealthy , spray - tanned , multiple - D.U.I - receiving , brawling - outside - L.A. - nightclubs , underwear - shunning set .

I stopped by EB yesterday to pick up a copy of Deadspace : Extraction .
The store out at the Northgate mall is on my way to work so I popped in there just as they were opening .
I asked for Deadspace and the girl told me that she had sold out of the couple they got and that I should have pre-ordered it .
Being told that I should have pre-ordered a game is like the dentist telling me that I need to floss more .
I ’m not sure how shaming your customers is a good business policy .
I told her this was a big game from a big publisher and I just assumed they would have more than a couple copies .
It ’s not like I went in there asking for some obscure NIS game .
She told me that no one had really pre-ordered it and again explained that I should pre-order the stuff I want .
I ended up going literally across the street to Best Buy in search of the game and had no trouble finding it .
In fact they had a bunch .
Dear EB , this is how a fucking store works .
You go there and you buy the thing you want .
No one gives you shit for not pre-ordering it .
No one asks you to pre-order games you might want six months from now .
They do n’t try and sell you a used copy .
You just walk in and buy what you want .
Also why are all EB ’s staffed by girls now ?
I ’m not complaining , I just think it ’s sort of odd that in all the Eb ’s around me I have n’t seen one guy working the counter .
Is this some sort of new company policy ?

This past weekend , the Senate amended the embattled healthcare bill by replacing the proposed 5 % tax on elective plastic surgery procedures with a proposed 10 % tax on indoor tanning .
The tax would raise an estimated $ 2.7 billion over 10 years .
Baking your body inside a tanning bed has always been detrimental to your skin .
But it may soon also wreak havoc on your wallet .
The so - called " Botax " on elective surgeries raised the ire of the American Medical Assn. , which cried discrimination against women ( as they 're more likely to opt for plastic surgery than men ) .
Apparently , the tanning bed industry does n't pack as much clout -- so weekly trips to the local tanning salon might be significantly more expensive in the future .
Lawmakers love to tax things that are bad for you -- the higher costs are meant to be a further deterrent .
And like smoking a pack of Camels every day , " bronzing " your epidermis regularly has been inextricably linked to cancer .
Nose jobs may be steeped in vanity , but they at least have the power to improve mental states .
So I started thinking about what other societal " ills " could raise a little bread for our hobbled economy ...
* Stiletto heels over 4 inches tall .
Bad for the back , bad for the foot arch -- good for the economy ?
* Vanity dogs .
That pint - sized Pomeranian in the Louis Vuitton case that yaps at you in line at Whole Foods could pitch in for the greater good .
* " Embellished " jeans and T - shirts dripping with tattoo graphics and " crystals . "
OK , so they 're not exactly detrimental to the wearer .
But they 've been making our eyes bleed for some time now .

Catholic churches in Italy are installing automatic holy water dispensers to help reduce the risk of spreading swine flu .
The outbreak of the H1N1 virus has led many churches to suspend the tradition of having holy water in open fonts into which people dip their hands .
The new machine works like an automatic soap dispenser , squirting water when a hand is passed under the tap .
Inventor Luciano Marabese says he is being inundated with enquiries .
About 30 people have died in Italy after catching swine flu .
Father Pierre Angelo Mota , from Capriano Briosco , north of Milan , said squirtable holy water had surprised some of his parishoners at first .
" It has been a bit of a novelty , " he said .
" People initially were a bit shocked by this technological innovation but then they welcomed it with great enthusiasm and joy .
The members of this parish have got used to it , " he added .
Churchgoer Marta Caimmi agreed .
" It 's great , " she said .
" Thanks to this we are not worried about catching swine flu .
It is the right thing for the times . "
' Global interest '
The design of the dispenser is similar to a traditional water font , but with an infra-red light that reads the presence of a hand and squirts holy water onto the person 's fingers .
Mr Marabese says he is receiving hundreds of emails from all over the world requesting information about the product .
" Some people had stopped dipping their hand into the holy water font as they were afraid of infections , " he told Reuters .
" Some people even pretended to touch the water but they just touched the marble edge of the font .
I think that it is a pity to lose our traditions . "
Milan 's cathedral was among the places of worship to officially suspend the use of communal water fonts .
" After the news that some churches - like Milan 's cathedral - are suspending the use of holy water fonts ... demands for my invention rose to the stars , " added Mr Marabese .
Tax Advantages of Having a Mortgage
Image via Wikipedia
Paying taxes is never much fun .
And no matter how you slice it , paying interest — even on a mortgage — is depressing .
This is why it is nice in some cases be able to see tax advantages from having a mortgage .
You can deduct your mortgage interest to lower your taxable income .
This also includes the interest you pay on some second home mortgage loans .
You can also deduct for points you pay , if you are getting a new home mortgage .
It ’s actually fairly straightforward .
In any case , it is a good idea to consider the tax efficiency involved with your mortgage , as well as the deductions available to you through your other assets and even — possibly — some of your losses .
Deducting your mortgage interest
It is important to note that your tax form comes with a standard deduction .
Right now , that standard deduction is as follows :
Single : $ 5,700
Head of Household : $ 8,350
Married Filing Separately : $ 5,700
Married Filing Jointly : $ 11,400
You can only take the mortgage interest rate deduction if you are using Schedule A to itemize your deductions , and forgoing your right to the standard deduction .
This means you need to add up your itemized deductions on Schedule A and make sure that the sum exceeds the amount you are eligible for in terms of a standard deduction .
For example , if you are Married Filing Jointly , and you paid $ 10,000 in mortgage interest , you are still better off taking the standard deduction .
However , if you gave $ 2,000 to charity this year , you can add that $ 2,000 to your $ 10,000 for $ 12,000 .
When you combine your mortgage interest paid with other items on Schedule A , you can increase the amount by which you lower your taxable income .
It is also worth noting that your property taxes and PMI are also tax deductible on Schedule A .
Deducting home mortgage points
Another item that appears on Schedule A is the ability to deduct home mortgage points .
You can deduct your mortgage points , in full , the year they are paid if you meet these following requirements set forth by the IRS :
Your primary residence secures the home mortgage loan .
Your primary residence ( build or purchase ) is the subject of the loan .
Paying points is an established practice in your area .
Points paid did not exceed the average for that area and loan .
You use a cash method of accounting .
The points were not paid for separate items , such as taxes , attorney fees , appraisal fees and other fees that are normally separated out on the settlement sheet .
You did not borrow in order to pay the points .
The points were computed as a percentage of the principal of the mortgage .
The amount of points paid is shown clearly on your settlement statement .
If you meet the above conditions , you can deduct the points paid .
This can actually be a bonus in other ways , since it will lower your interest rate , and save you money in interest fees over the life of your home mortgage loan .
And , have a tax deduction does n’t , hurt , either .
While having a mortgage is unpalatable in many cases ( after all , it is debt ) , you can reduce the negative impact that comes with paying interest .
You can reap a tax advantage with proper planning .
Before you take this advantage , though , it is a good idea to double check with a tax professional , or check with the IRS .
A lot of people out there like me have always dreamed of success in our endeavors when it comes to a home MLM business .
We all start out with the can do attitude that I will not fail , I will do what it takes to be a successful home MLM business owner .
However many of us out there find that we put in our way of success stumbling blocks , excuses .
No matter how many MLM programs we try we just can not seem to get over that hump and make real connections with real like minded people and real money that will make us a success .
It ’s really not a lack of trying or a lack of wanting to succeed it ’s simply the fact we put negatives before anything we do .
We are afraid to step out of the safety net as to what we know and what we think we should know .
We fumble around the idea of being a success because we have never been a success .
In truth if any of us ever succeeded with the things we start it ’s not because we did things right it ’s because we found the right people to get us in the right frame of mind and keep us from giving up .
Now many of you out there in the world have started MLM programs with big dreams .
However you have not put in the sweat and work that those dreams require to make you a success .
You say , well I did not have enough money or I could not buy leads I needed .
That idea first is a huge MLM joke .
If you have a business that is worth salt and has great products you do not have to buy leads .
Those people that are like minded and interested in the product you are offering will come to you naturally .
In Mentoring for free a program started by Michael Dlouhy
We learn that you do not have to sell to people if the product is worth what it claims to be .
It will sell its self !
Second any excuse is a good excuse to fail .
If you truly want to succeed in anything in life you must have the desire to do so no matter what and make it happen point blank .
The only obstacle we have in front of our success is those we put in front of us .
In many to almost all cases people fail because they did not have the desire to truly succeed or they started off with a negative by planning to fail .
Outwardly they want to succeed .
Inwardly they do not think they deserve to succeed .
Many reasons are , they are not around the right people who lift them up and give them helpful positive advice .
They are around people who are what if crowds .
You know who I am talking about those people who have nothing and will never have nothing because they have never succeeded so they feel they have the right to give others their pearls of wisdom as to why they to will fail as well .
What will really get your head thinking is many people believe that thought !
Why is it ?
Because inwardly we are afraid to face adversity down and shout at the storm .
“ Give me your worst and I will give you mine . ”
Imagine if we all just fought back the tide with positive thinking .
What wonders we could create !
I dare say I think our economy would not be in the state it is in .
If we but said in our voice !
“ No more we are worth succeeding and being successful ! ”
The fact is we are told in Mentoring for free that the old saying applies , “ Birds of a feather flock together . ”
What this means is simple if you want to fail and never see success then keep taking the failures advice .
However if you have the true desire to succeed start taking advice from those like minded people who have succeeded and know how to teach you to do the same .
There once was this guy who wanted to be rich and had a chance to make a billion bucks .
Who did he ask advice from to make that money ?
Was it his dry cleaner or a billion dollar company investor .
Who had made the money over and over .
The point is the secret to success is easy it ’s called not giving your self a reason to fail .
If you find an MLM that is positively a winner and has successful people who truly care and want to teach you for free how to succeed .
Where the others who have failed wanting to charge you for their worthless advice .
Then you would be a fool not to take those successful people up on their offer and learn to be a success not just in business but in life as to family and friends and people who are just as in need as you are for that success .

The Senate healthcare bill presents a tricky political challenge to Sens. Ben Nelson ( Neb. ) and Arlen Specter ( Pa. ) , the only two Democrats in the Senate to have signed anti-tax pledges .
Americans for Tax Reform , the group which persuaded Nelson and Specter to sign the pledge , will press both lawmakers on the issue during next month ’s Senate healthcare debate , putting them in an awkward position .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ If they vote for this bill as the written it violates the pledge , ” said Grover Norquist , president of Americans for Tax Reform , in an interview .
The $ 848 billion piece of legislation would extend health insurance coverage to an additional 31 million Americans and would impose new taxes and tax increases .
An analysis by Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee estimates the bill would raise taxes by $ 494 billion .
Senate Majority Leader ( D - Nev. ) appears to need every Democratic senator to support the bill because Democrats have failed to muster any Republican backing .
The measure needs 60 votes to clear the chamber .
Nelson , for one , knows the political risks of abandoning a campaign pledge .
In 1996 , he came under heavy criticism for pursuing a Senate seat while serving as Nebraska ’s governor .
The bid violated a 1994 campaign pledge that he would serve out his full term as governor before seeking another office .
Nelson lost the race despite high approval ratings .
Political analysts said he was hurt by the pledge .
He won a Senate seat in 1998 and is up for re-election in 2012 .
Americans for Tax Reform aired cable ads at the end of October pressing Nelson to “ keep fighting for Nebraska taxpayers ” and to “ keep the pledge .
” The group argues that Nelson violated his anti-tax pledge by voting for procedural motions to begin debate over the bill and would do so again if he votes to bring it to a final vote .
In an op - ed published Wednesday in the Omaha World - Herald , Nelson defended his vote to begin debate .
“ This past Saturday evening , I voted for the Senate to proceed to a full and open debate on healthcare reform with two goals in mind :
The first goal is that the Senate , now able to follow normal parliamentary procedures , will produce a bipartisan bill cutting the cost of healthcare for Nebraskans and all Americans , ” he wrote .
Nelson argued that his second goal was to avoid the prospect of Democratic leaders bringing up healthcare reform under budget reconciliation rules , which would allow them to pass a truncated version of the bill on a fast schedule with only a simple majority .
“ The result of the limits on debate and content could be a convoluted bill passed by only 50 senators , ” Nelson wrote .
“ That is not what the Senate is about .
” Nelson ’s spokesman declined to comment specifically on pressure from Americans for Tax Reform .
Specter , who signed the anti-tax pledge as a Republican , appreciates the power of Americans for Tax Reform .
In his 2004 re-election campaign , when he barely survived a primary challenge from then - Rep. Pat Toomey ( R - Pa. ) , Specter touted the fact that Americans for Tax Reform had given him a “ Hero of the Taxpayer Award . ”
Specter won the award for signing the pledge and receiving an 85 percent rating on the group ’s scorecard .
Norquist said the fact that Specter signed the pledge as a Republican candidate has no significance .
He noted that Sen. Richard Shelby ( R - Ala . ) signed it as a Democratic candidate .
“ That does n’t get you off the hook , ” Norquist said .
Specter was unavailable for comment but an aide said the Pennsylvania lawmaker has repeatedly stated that he is committed to voting for a fiscally responsible bill that does not add to the deficit .
He is up for re-election in 2010 and faces a Democratic primary challenger and a likely rematch with Toomey in the general election .
If Specter votes for the Senate healthcare bill , however , Americans for Tax Reform will press him specifically on the issue of tax increases , more so than deficit spending .
The bill hits individuals and businesses with new taxes and eliminates various deductions .
Individuals would face penalties for failing to purchase insurance and those earning more than $ 200,000 would see their Medicare payroll tax rise from 1.45 percent to 1.95 percent .
The payroll tax rise would hit couples earning $ 250,000 or more .
The measure would also impose a $ 2 billion annual tax on medical devices such as pacemakers ; a broad $ 6.7 billion annual tax on the health insurance industry ; a 5 percent tax on cosmetic surgery ; and would eliminate tax deductions for employer - provided prescription drug coverage in retirement .
An analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation found that in the year 2019 , 77 percent of the cost of the tax increases proposed in the Senate Finance Committee ’s healthcare bill would be carried by families earning less than $ 250,000 a year .
This could also prove a political liability for President , who promised during his presidential campaign not to raise taxes on American families earning less than $ 250,000 .
Many of the tax increases proposed by Finance Committee were included in the healthcare bill slated for floor debate .
Reid made a few tweaks to the tax provisions , such as raising the tax threshold for high - cost insurance plans from $ 8,000 to $ 8,500 for individual plans and from $ 21,000 to $ 23,000 for family plans .
Labor unions have opposed this tax , which funds a substantial portion of the bill , because they argue that it would hit many unionized , working - class families .
The weather bureau has issued Australia 's first " catastrophic " bushfire danger rating for two parts of northern South Australia tomorrow .
The Country Fire Service ( CFS ) says any fires in the North West Pastoral and Flinders districts will be uncontrollable and there is a very high likelihood that people in their path will die .
The weather bureau says there will be a combination of extremely high temperatures , strong winds and low humidity in the two districts .
It is the first time the rating has been used in Australia since a new national warning system was introduced after Victoria 's deadly Black Saturday bushfires in February .
CFS strategic services manager Mick Ayre says residents of the North West Pastoral and Flinders districts must decide whether they will stay or go as soon as possible .
" The best advice we can give you is to think very carefully about whether you can withstand or fight a fire on a day of catastrophic fire ratings , " he said .
" If you 're not comfortable and if you do n't have the equipment and if your property is not prepared , it 's better to go and do something else like to go the beach or the shopping centre than it is to take the risk of defending your property or escaping at the last minute . "
Mr Ayre says if people decide to leave , they must be gone by early tomorrow morning at the latest .
" In a catastrophic fire danger situation , no houses are definitely guaranteed to survive , " he said .
" If you decide to stay you could die in the attempt to save your property ... we always reckon it 's better for people to be safe than sorry . "
Wendy Shirley of the CFS Volunteers Association estimates that about two - thirds of those in bushfire - prone areas have not heard warnings or do not think it affects them .
" It 's those two thirds of people that are not only putting their own , their families ' lives and their neighbours ' lives at risk , but also the lives of our volunteer firefighters , " she said .
Eleven schools and preschools in the two districts will need to close tomorrow as a result of the catastrophic rating .
They include Melrose Primary , where principal Ruth Robertson says parents and teachers are in unchartered waters .
" We 're all learning ... the biggest problem might be if we 're not able to contact some families and we 're relying on phone contact , which means people have either got to be home or have a mobile with them , " she said .
Meanwhile , the CFS says a fire at Craigmore in Adelaide 's north has been contained .
The fire off Yorketown Road was travelling north towards Uley Road , Chapman Drive and Walters Road .
It was posing a risk to public safety and residents were advised to activate their bushfire survival plans .
Arson alert
Police patrols will monitor the movement of known firebugs in high - risk fire areas across South Australia in coming days .
Commissioner Mal Hyde says Operation Nomad is an important preventative measure .
" You can never be certain when you prevent a problem from occurring that you have in fact prevented that , but last summer we put this into effect on quite a number of occasions and we did get through the summer OK , " he said .
" Whilst it 's no guarantee that we will avoid firebugs lighting fires on these days , it 's the best we can do at this stage . "
The official explanation for Obama ’s Nobel Peace Prize is that the Norwegians are using the Nobel as an incentive for the president to fulfill what many see as his bright promise and a kind of prophylactic against a repeat of Bush - era warmongering .
After all , how could a recipient of the Peace Prize engage in the kind of brazen militarism that has characterized U.S. foreign policy in the post - 9/11 era ?
Easy – do it on the sly .
If the Nobel committee was attempting to preemptively block a further escalation of the Afghan war by giving the prize in anticipation of future actions – actions they hoped would be motivated by a desire to live up to the award – they were too late , and their efforts too little .
Because Obama – in addition to the 21,000 combat troops he has already announced he ’s sending to the Afghan front – has quietly added 13,000 more " support " troops to the mix , and there are plenty more where that came from .
For an administration in which virtually every public announcement and initiative involves a careful manipulation of language , this kind of craftiness is a key tool in keeping the public hazy about what exactly is going on in Afghanistan .
The difference between " combat " troops and " support " troops is a slippery one , which the Obamaites have used previously to obscure their real intentions in Iraq .
You ’ll recall that , way back during the presidential campaign , they announced their plans for " withdrawal " in the same breath they proposed a " residual " force of " support " troops that numbered in the tens of thousands .
Not many noticed this bit of legerdemain – but now that he ’s in office , and with the spotlight trained so heavily on every nuance of his Afghan policy , these little details are coming to the fore .
While the pundits and the public have been debating the whys and wherefores of whether Obama ought to give in to his generals and send more troops to the " Af - Pak " battlefield , the escalation is already a fait accompli – a nice Halloween surprise for all those " progressives " who still believe in their Dear Leader .
Never has a political constituency been so willing to be deceived .
That ’s one reason it wo n’t be too hard for the Obamaites to continue their masquerade .
Another is the administration ’s skill at double talk .
Soothing words will emanate from the White House to ameliorate the panic of antiwar progressives , both in Congress and the Democratic grassroots , and the latter will content themselves with gay - rights protests and nightly broadcasts on MSNBC caviling about healthcare " reform . "
We want butter , and you can have your guns .
That ’s what it boils down to in the end .
It ’s the historic compromise of the liberals in the Democratic Party : you can have your " war on poverty , " say the party elders , just let us have our " war on Communism " or , today , the " war on terrorism , " and we ’ll both be happy .
It works every time .
Conveniently diverted from an issue they ’ve been evading ever since Obama took office , by the time the Democratic Party base wakes up and finds it has a burgeoning war to defend it will be too late .
As " centrist " ( i.e. , interventionist ) Democrats bloc with Republicans on the Afghan issue and head off an incipient revolt in Congress , Obama ’s war is being rolled out right on schedule , albeit not fast enough for eager beavers like Dianne Feinstein , Rush Limbaugh , and the laptop bombardiers buzzing around the op - ed page of the Washington Post .
All this praise being heaped on Obama by the Europeans is really a way of complimenting him on his methods of deception .
The Bush administration never made any bones about its militaristic agenda : they openly proclaimed their policy of aggressive ultra-nationalism , and woe unto anyone who stood in their way .
The personality of this policy – its style of implementation – was personified by the volatile John Bolton , Bush ’s ambassador to the United Nations , who once remarked , " I do n’t do carrots . "
Obama , however , specializes in handing out carrots .
We ’ll see how long it takes for them to harden and coalesce into one giant stick .
I give it a year , on the outside .
As our pundit shrikes take flight , shrieking their bloody war cries on the op - ed pages of the nation ’s newspapers , the wolves are howling in the distance and the vultures are circling overhead .
Amid all this cacophony , many of the more thoughtful progressives wonder aloud how the administration can fight two wars and still hope to solve the nation ’s dire economic problems .
With the real unemployment rate hovering somewhere around 20 percent and the banks making those awful creaking noises – as in the moments before a giant edifice collapses – can we really afford to divert money away from jobs and education and healthcare , and send it to Waziristan ?
" Money for jobs , not for war ! "
That ’s the battle cry of the antiwar movement , such as it is , but these protesters miss the point .
The real policy of this administration is money for jobs and for war , with the former to be generated by the latter .
As loyal followers of John Maynard Keynes , the Depression - era economist who believed we could spend our way out of penury , Obama ’s economic brain trust surely recognizes that all government spending is fungible .
You can spend it on building bridges and repairing decayed infrastructure , but this has certain political disadvantages , namely conservative opposition to too much government spending .
One way to get conservatives of both parties on your side , however , is to pour money into the military : that , at least , will get the armaments industry humming and keep many exporters afloat while everyone else is sinking .
It also helps sop up excess labor by ramping up military recruitment efforts , including financial incentives .
This is the chief problem standing in the way of the administration , at this point : the sheer inability [ . pdf ] of the U.S. , given its global military presence , to muster enough troops to really occupy and hold Afghanistan .
Short of half a million combat soldiers – and half as many " support " troops – we are just staving off the inevitable collapse of the Karzai regime and a complete rout of our forces .
How to get up to this number , or a fair approximation , without anyone making too much of a fuss – this is the problem Obama faces .
The administration is playing a deceptive numbers game , first in making a dubious dichotomy between " combat " and " support " troops , and second by failing to level with the American people about either the number of soldiers or the number of years it will take for them to accomplish their mission , whatever that may turn out to be .
Who are our enemies in Afghanistan ?
Are we fighting to eradicate the Taliban , al - Qaeda , the Haqqani network , or our former ally Gulbuddin Hekmatyar ?
Perhaps all of them , in which case our cause is unlikely to succeed , even at the level of public relations .
What is our strategy ?
The Petraeus - McChrystal - CNAS counterinsurgency doctrine [ .pdf ] suggests that anything less than a full - scale nation - building project is fated to fail .
According to " COIN " doctrine , victory requires a long term political - military operation that involves living side - by - side with the people we are supposed to be " protecting , " the Afghans .
In the meantime , the Afghans will be searching for someone to protect them from us – all the while doing their best to convince us they ’re really on our side , so as to qualify for all that generous nation - building aid .
However , American policymakers are making a mistake if they think they can deal with the Taliban the way they dealt with the Sunni Arab " dead- enders " in Iraq .
The Afghans can be rented , but not bought .
What do we want from the peoples of Afghanistan ?
The idea that they must now create a nation - state that keeps out al - Qaeda and makes it impossible for Osama bin Laden and his cohorts to seek a " safe haven " in that country is a scheme much too labor - intensive and downright expensive for a profitable return .
It is like turning the forest into a concrete patio upon discovering that a few wild and possibly dangerous animals inhabit its darkest corners .
In the process , how many other creatures are we turning out of their holes , to turn up later running wild in our streets , preying on small dogs and children ?
Microsoft ’s latest effort to gain relevance in the search wars is about to get a whole lot more interesting .
According to All Things Digital , the company is set to announce deals with both Twitter and Facebook to integrate status updates into its Bing search engine .
Details are expected to be announced later today at the Web 2.0 Summit , but the stage has been building for this for some time .
Microsoft invested $ 240 million in Facebook back in 2007 , and has since signed search and advertising deals with the social network .
Meanwhile , Twitter has been known to be exploring search partnerships for at least the past month , though it 's long been suspected that the company would eventually eye significant revenue in this space .
Although Twitter has been said to be willing to offer a full stream of tweets to search providers on a non-exclusive basis , it would appear that Microsoft has beaten Google to the punch in making it happen .
In All Things Digital 's latest report , both of the leading social sites are said to be talking to Google , so Bing 's advantage may be short lived , though it will be " weeks , if not months " until we see any actual integration go live .
More to come ...

This first piece is a letter I sent to the Australian Financial Review about private equity funds .
The second one is a variation on that theme – a letter I sent to the Australian in response to their teabagger arguments .
John
Dear AFR
As a former Assistant Commissioner of Taxation with Tax Office responsibility for , at one stage , international tax reform matters , I cannot allow your traducing of the ATO over the TPG matter to go unchallenged .
In your editorial ‘ Regulators pose risk to capital ’ ( AFR Opinion Friday 20 November p 58 ) you state that the ATO attempted ‘ to freeze the profits gained by private equity group TGP from the sale of Myer on the basis of no more than a vague suspicion of a vague intent to evade taxes . ’
Your own less emotive reports elsewhere on the matter make clear that this is not the case .
As I argue in my blog piece about private equity funds and the pillaging of Australia , the capital gains tax exemption for foreign residents applies to just that – capital gains .
To assert that rapacious PEFs with short - term gains their sole objective are merely realising capital gains is to seemingly overturn hundreds of years of tax jurisprudence on the distinction between income and capital gains .
The ATO is quite correct to argue that the gains could well be income and so subject to the ordinary income tax provisions and treaty arrangements .
Second , the fact that the US entity invests into Myer via the Cayman islands , Luxembourg and the Netherlands ( tax havens or tax porous countries , two of them with bank secrecy provisions ) suggests to me some tax avoidance purpose worthy of further investigation .
If TPG is so interested in investing in Australia why not do so directly ?
Such arrangements rightly raise the interest of the taxman and the possible application of the general anti-avoidance provisions .
Third , even in the play pen of CGT , the foreign residents ’ exemption does not apply to capital gains on the business assets of an Australian permanent establishment of a foreign resident .
It appears from newspaper reports that TPG had an office ( a permanent establishment ) in Australia .
In my view the ATO is perfectly justified in taking action to protect Australia ’s tax base .
Where it can be criticised is in its seeming inability to inform the community earlier of its position .
This may be because the ATO has a long history of attacking and running down its international tax area and international tax expertise .
On the other hand it is not surprising to me that the ATO was in no rush to tell the world what is the bleeding obvious – the CGT foreign resident exemption only applies to capital gains .
Income gains are not exempt .
That is undergraduate stuff .
I can only assume that TPG had advice that the income / capital distinction might present a real tax ‘ risk ’ for its investment , and that may explain the seeming alacrity with which the money left the country .
If TPG is so sure it has complied with all Australia ’s tax laws then let them as a sign of good faith return half the tax and penalties in dispute to Australia while the courts sort the matter out .
If the AFR wants to defend private equity funds and their apparent pillaging of the Australian economy through get rich quick schemes , and wants to extend the CGT exemption for foreign residents to include income gains , let it do so with something more concrete than an unwarranted attack on the ATO .
Let me add that the seemingly widespread abuse of the exemption makes the case for its repeal , not its extension .
Readers might also like to look at Private equity funds and the pillage of Australia .

Dear Australian
I can agree with your comments in a recent editorial that Private Equity Funds ( PEFs ) ‘ by their nature , … have a strong propensity for short - termism , tricky accounting practices , asset stripping … and tax minimisation .
Often nominally based in tax havens , such companies have no loyalties to any nation , any industry , any established company or any workforce , no matter how productive and experienced .
by focusing on the bottom line they often distort traditional productive capitalism . ’
Yet most of your commentators have adopted positions defending PEFs from the legitimate activity of the Australian Taxation Office in seeking to impose tax on what appears to me to be a simple income gain made by TPG .
Reading your commentators , one would have the impression Australian capitalism is about to implode if the ATO does not back off from imposing income tax on income gains .
The real objective of your teabagging commentators appears to be to pressure the ATO to ignore the law and administratively cut tax on these anti-productive groups to zero .
Equity demands the ATO resist these misguided calls .
As a former Assistant Commissioner of Taxation with Tax Office responsibility for , at one stage , international tax reform matters , let me just say that the capital gains tax exemption for foreign residents applies to just that – capital gains .
To assert that rapacious PEFs whose sole objective is short - term gains are merely realising capital gains is to seemingly overturn hundreds of years of tax jurisprudence on the distinction between income and capital gains .
The ATO is quite correct to argue that the gains could well be income and so subject to the ordinary income tax provisions and treaty arrangements .
Second , the fact that the US entity invests into Myer via the Cayman islands , Luxembourg and the Netherlands ( tax havens or tax porous countries , two of them with bank secrecy provisions ) suggests to me some tax avoidance purpose worthy of further investigation .
If TPG is so interested in investing in Australia why not do so directly ?
Such arrangements rightly raise the interest of the taxman and the possible application of the general anti-avoidance provisions .
Interestingly one of your commentators remarks that Australian residents have invested in TPG .
If so , there can be no truck with such investors avoiding Australian tax through an exemption designed specifically for foreign residents .
Yet apparently that is the logical conclusion of what your cacophonous gaggle of teabaggers is arguing for .
Third , even in the play pen of CGT , the foreign residents ’ exemption does not apply to capital gains on the business assets of an Australian permanent establishment of a foreign resident .
It appears from newspaper reports that TPG had an office ( a permanent establishment ) in Australia .
In my view the ATO is perfectly justified in taking action to protect Australia ’s tax base .
Where it can be criticised is in its seeming inability to inform the community earlier of its position .

Domain Branding Considerations
Domain Name Registration Article Details
Domain branding starts with one thing - your domain name .
Over half of people today directly type in the domain name that they want to go to rather than get there through some other medium such as search engines .
As far as your domain brand is concerned what should you learn from this fact ?
Your domain brand name MUST be easily spelled .
If it is long and complicated , then it will be more difficult for people to link your ' brand ' to your domain name and hence find you on the web .
Your domain brand name MUST be memorable .
If it can not be remembered then it can not be typed into any browser .
If it can not be typed into a browser successfully and often , then your online business withers .
The third thing is that your domain brand name must be relevant to your business .
As we have now got the 3 basic foundations of a good domain brand .
Let ’s explore them in greater detail ...
To make your domain name brand more easily spelled , you must make sure that your brand consists of more commonly used words .
Words that you use every day are more easily spelled .
The next thing to consider is shortness of your domain brand .
Those domain brands that are more easily spelled are those domain brands that are shorter and require fewer characters in them ( less chance of making a typo ) .
Finally , as far as the spelling a domain brand is concerned , is the use of hyphens .
If you have the opportunity to brand your website with or without hyphens , then definitely choose without .
When people type in a domain into their browser they spell it out as they would say it .
Here 's the key '... AS THEY WOULD SAY IT ' .
When you read anything with a hyphen in it , you never say ' hyphen ' do you ?
A good domain brand is one that spells what you read .
For your domain brand to be the easiest to remember , act like your customer online .
What domain brands do you remember more easily than others ?
What makes a domain name a good brand to remember and what makes it a less memorable domain brand ?
The answer is to picture something that is VISUAL in nature ... a good domain brand is something you can associate an image with .
Humans are visual learners and so information is best retained when it is associated in memory to an image of an object rather than to a concept of something that has n’t anything concrete to visualize .
Other things to consider are the common idioms in use for the language you are creating the domain brand for .
As you know , an idiom is defined as a phrase that overall has a different meaning than the individual words in it mean .
Some common idioms in use today are ' What ’s the Beef ? ' , ' Perish the thought ' , ' Hair of the Dog ' .
These can make effective domain brands .
For example , you could use ' Hair of the Dog ' as an online shop to sell alcoholic products ( BTW - hairofthedog.com is currently the name of a brewery in Portland , OR ) .
The third main point to consider with your domain brand , is trying to get something that your business sells or service it performs into the domain name as well so that it has more relevance for Search Engines as well as people .
Having best - doggy - slippers.com is n’t at all useful if you are selling flea collars for cats .
Just as important as concentrating on things that make your domain branding a success , we should also concentrate on what to AVOID when carrying out domain branding for your business .
5 things to AVOID when Domain Name Branding ;
Avoid typos or intentional misspellings of common domain brands .
Just because you have misspelled it does n’t mean that you can dodge a trademark infringement .
Avoid trademarks of other companies entirely , even if they do n’t have a like name web brand in use .
You could spend a lot of time and money building your business around that brand just to have it taken away from you .
Do n’t make plans for a business name until you have your domain brand ' in the bag ' and registered to you .
Do n’t try and get a domain brand with a '.net ' , '.org ' or '. what ' etc if the '.com ' is already registered to a known brand .
It is likely to be contested and you could lose .
Be careful of what your domain brand may actually spell out e.g. ' therapist finder.com ' when you remove the spaces ( domain names cannot have any spaces in them ) , has the exact same domain name spelling as ' the rapist finder.com ' , ' experts exchange.com ' has the exact same domain spelling as ' expert sex change.com ' and a company selling pens online ' pen island.com ' , has the exact same domain spelling as ... well you get the drift .
So when you string your words together ... be careful !
Ballistic Domains offers cheap web hosting services , cheap domain names and backorder domain names !

" James , please ! ...
Now it 's your partner 's turn to speak . "
Along with a short piano piece and the muffled sounds of traffic outside an office in Fresno , California , that line of dialogue is among the first things you 'll hear upon starting my single - player Half - Life 2 mod " Handle With Care . "
It 's spoken by your marriage therapist , who chastises your character , James , for monopolizing the discussion and not allowing your spouse to talk .
It 's partly intended as a joke ; you get the sense that James is loud and overbearing , but in the tradition of the Half - Life series James remains silent for the entire game .
Then there 's the fact that I had neither the time nor the resources to write and record dialogue for James , and I wanted players to read into James ' mind and come up with their own characterizations .
What will players think ?
Well , probably that their spouse needs to shut the hell up .
First , your spouse complains about the hopelessness of communicating with your character , James , but then claims it 's because James does n't listen - which you quickly learn is due to the fact that your spouse simply does n't speak up .
But why bother speaking up when communication is so hopeless ?
And James does n't listen anyway , so why speak up ?
And so on , ad infinitum .
It 's the age - old stereotype of the annoyed husband and the nagging wife , except the therapist clearly does n't say " wife " or " husband . "
She says " partner . "
Other than the use of masculine pronouns for both spouses , the therapist 's utterance of " partner " is the only word in the only line of dialogue in the entire game that directly suggests a gay relationship .
There are no references to rainbows , Stonewall , Lady Gaga , Project Runway , Broadway musicals or how " beer tastes icky . "
Why , if you had happened to miss the word " partner , " you may have missed the fact that " Handle With Care " is about a gay relationship at all .
You might have , as some players did , invented a female persona for your player character and assumed it was the same young " lady " dating Dylan from my previous mod , " Polaris . "
And then you would find out , whether from seeing the name " James " so often or from reading forum posts - that I had managed to " trick " you into playing as a homosexual male .
Perhaps that made you angry enough to go to my website and , with the proud honor of being the first to post a comment on my work , you may have hastily written the following post : " Re relese [ sic ] the game without the GAY ! "
My response , then and still now , is : " Why on Earth would I do that ? "
A homeless man was charged Wednesday with a string of stabbings against women and children as they rode Muni or walked the streets of San Francisco .
Bobby L. Brown Jr. , 30 , faces four counts of attempted murder , four counts of assault with a deadly weapon and seven other felony charges stemming from the unprovoked attacks , including one Monday .
District Attorney Kamala Harris said all four attacks - and two more that are being investigated as potentially involving Brown - appear to be random , targeted at vulnerable people and committed with no motive .
" We are ending tonight this defendant 's reign of terror , " Harris said Wednesday night .
" We 've got our guy , and he 's off the streets . "
Harris said Brown faces 72 years to life in prison if he is convicted .
Rachel " Ty " Brown , 24 , who is not related to the suspect , was stabbed on the J - Church streetcar as she slept on the way to school .
Prosecutors say Bobby Brownattacked her with a corkscrew found in his pocket when he was arrested Tuesday .
Authorities believe he used a knife in the three earlier incidents .
The first occurred on Sept. 1 , when 11 - year - old Hatim Mansori was repeatedly stabbed as he rode home from baseball practice .
Bobby Brown 's mug shot had been in a group of photos the boy was asked to review after leaving the hospital , but he was unable to identify him .
Unable to make a case against Bobby Brown , San Francisco police turned him over to San Mateo County authorities on an outstanding warrant in an indecent exposure case .
The boy 's mother , Laila Elfazouzi , said Wednesday that her son had been asked to assist police in making an identification this week .
She said she was frustrated in how long it took to capture a suspect .
" It takes so long , meanwhile , he hit another victim , the lady , it 's very sad , " she said .
The attacks escalated after Bobby Brown was released from jail in San Mateo County on Nov. 10 , authorities said .
He pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges and was put on probation .
He was later charged with misdemeanor battery of a San Mateo sheriff 's deputy while in custody .
Four days after his release , prosecutors say , on Nov. 14 , Bobby Brown allegedly stabbed a 25 - year - old San Francisco woman at Sutter and Jones streets at 10:40 a.m. after she refused to give him money .
She was stabbed twice in the back and buttocks and was hospitalized .
On Thanksgiving Day , Nov. 26 , he allegedly attacked a 26 - year - old woman in the Tenderloin at Golden Gate and Leavenworth streets in front of her three young children , one of whom she was pushing in a stroller .
Prosecutors said Bobby Brown grabbed the victim for no apparent reason and stabbed her three times in the back .
She was hospitalized for seven hours .
" I feel like there 's been some closure , " said the victim , who asked not to be named .
" I feel utterly grateful that I am alive today .
That guy could have taken my life .
" He 's sick - anyone in this world who would just randomly attack a woman with three small children is sick . "
Police Commander John Loftus said police were able to link the attacks because they were all stabbings , all random , the locations were all clustered in the city 's central neighborhoods and the victims ' and witnesses ' descriptions of the attacker all matched up .
Loftus said two other stabbings are being investigated in connection with Bobby Brown , and that anybody who knows of similar attacks should call the police department 's tip line at ( 415 ) 575-4444 .
Harris said she could not discuss the defendant 's mental state , but that it would not prevent her office from getting a conviction in court .
Harris said an arraignment could be scheduled for as early as this morning .
Authorities said Bobby Brown has been violent before on public transit .
On Dec. 14 , 2004 , he was accused of punching a woman for no reason as she waited for train doors to open at the MacArthur BART Station in Oakland , BART spokesman Linton Johnson said .
Bobby Brown was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor battery , and although no charges were filed , he was sent back to state prison on a parole violation .
Bobby Brown had also been cited twice in 2003 for BART fare evasion .
The most serious crime on his record dates to July 13 , 1999 , when police said he shot at a Noe Valley man who confronted him for knocking on a woman 's window at 11 p.m .
The man told him to leave but Bobby Brown fired at the man and fled , officials said .
Bobby Brown was arrested on attempted murder charges and pleaded guilty to charges of assault with a deadly weapon .
He was given a three - year suspended prison sentence but was later sent to prison for violating his parole .
He has told authorities in San Mateo that he lived at an O'Farrell Street SRO hotel , but a clerk there said this week he had not been staying there for several months .
Bobby Brown 's father , Bobby L. Brown Sr. of Richmond , declined to comment late Wednesday .
The statistics on U.S. math performance are grim .
American eighth - graders ranked 25th out of 30 countries in mathematics achievement on the 2006 Programme for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) , which claims to assess application of the mathematical knowledge and skills needed in adult life through problem - solving test items .
We do better on the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study ( TIMSS ) , whose test items are related to the content of school mathematics curricula .
( Differences in participating countries are n’t significant . )
But according to Mark Schneider , a former commissioner of education statistics at the Department of Education , the United States lags behind too many countries in “ overall mathematics performance and in the performance of our best students . ”
And achievement gaps between different student groups within the United States , Schneider says , are “ about the same size or even bigger than the gap between the United States and the top- performing countries in TIMSS . ”
As part of his education - reform plan , President Obama wants to “ make math and science education a top priority ” and ensure that children have access to strong math and science curricula “ at all grade levels . ”
But the president ’s worthy aims wo n’t be reached so long as assessment experts , technology salesmen , and math educators — the professors , usually with education degrees , who teach prospective teachers of math from K–12 — dominate the development of the content of school curricula and determine the pedagogy used , into which they ’ve brought theories lacking any evidence of success and that emphasize political and social ends , not mastery of mathematics .
The math educators ’ rising influence over the last few decades is reflected in the content of , or response to , two influential national reports .
In 1989 , the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics ( NCTM ) , the chief professional organization for mathematics educators and education faculty , issued Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics .
The document presented standards for grades K–12 , including algebra .
The underlying goals of the standards — never made clear to the general public — were social , not academic .
Some of the report ’s authors , for example , sought to make mathematics “ accessible ” to low - achieving students , yet meant by this not , say , recruiting more talented undergraduates into teaching but instead the employment of trendy , though empirically unsupported , pedagogical and organizational methods that essentially dumb down math content .
Math educators proclaimed a brand - new objective — conveniently indefinable and immeasurable — called “ deep conceptual understanding . ”
At first , the NCTM ’s document drew some public applause for urging K–12 textbook publishers to present math in ways that might better engage student interest .
But concerns quickly arose among mathematicians , who found the high school standards inadequate , including their de-emphasis of computation in algebra and proofs in Euclidean geometry .
They also noted that none of their academic brethren had participated in the standards ’ development .
Mathematically literate parents , too , were troubled , as they began to see the holes in the wholesale changes being made to state curriculum frameworks , math textbooks , and classroom practices .
The ensuing controversy came to be called the “ math wars . ”
To fend off the critics , NCTM issued Principles and Standards for School Mathematics in 2000 .
But this follow - up ignited at least as much censure from mathematicians , scientists , and parents as its predecessor did , even though some mathematicians had participated this time around .
The educational trends that led to the NCTM ’s approach to math have a long pedigree .
During the 1970s and 1980s , educators in reading , English , and history argued that the traditional curriculum needed to be more “ engaging ” and “ relevant ” to an increasingly alienated and unmotivated — or so it was claimed — student body .
Some influential educators sought to dismiss the traditional curriculum altogether , viewing it as a white , Christian , heterosexual - male product that unjustly valorized rational , abstract , and categorical thinking over the associative , experience - based , and emotion - laden thinking supposedly more congenial to females and certain minorities .
Those trying to overthrow the traditional curriculum found mathematics a hard nut to crack , however , because of the sequential nature of its content through the grades and its relationship to high school chemistry and physics .
Nevertheless , education faculty eventually figured out how to reimagine the mathematics curriculum , too , so that it could march under the banner of social justice .
As Alan Schoenfeld , the lead author of the high school standards in the 1989 NCTM report , put it , “ the traditional curriculum was a vehicle for . . . the perpetuation of privilege . ”
The new approach would change all that .
Two theories lie behind the educators ’ new approach to math teaching : “ cultural - historical activity theory ” and “ constructivism . ”
According to cultural - historical activity theory , schooling as it exists today reinforces an illegitimate social order .
Typical of this mindset is Brian Greer , a mathematics educator at Portland State University , who argues “ against the goal of ‘ algebra for all ’ on the grounds that . . . most individuals in our society do not need to have studied algebra . ”
According to Greer , the proper approach to teaching math “ now questions whether mathematics as a school subject should continue to be dominated by mathematics as an academic discipline or should reflect more fully the range of mathematical activities in which humans engage . ”
The primary role of math teachers , constructivists say in turn , should n’t be to explain or otherwise try to “ transfer ” their mathematical knowledge to students ; that would be ineffective .
Instead , they must help the students construct their own understanding of mathematics and find their own math solutions .
Classroom practices follow logically from these theories .
Teacher - directed learning goes out the window , despite its demonstrated benefits for students with learning problems ; instead , schools should embrace “ student - centered ” math classrooms .
High - math - achievement countries teach arithmetic in the elementary grades in a coherent curriculum leading , step by step , to formal algebra and geometry in middle school .
The progressive educators , by contrast , support “ integrated ” approaches to teaching math — that is , teaching topics from all areas of mathematics every year , regardless of logical sequence and student mastery of each step — and they downplay basic arithmetic skills and practice , encouraging kids to use calculators from kindergarten on .
The educators also neglect the teaching of standard algorithms ( mathematical procedures commonly taught everywhere , with only minor variations , because of their general applicability ) , insisting instead on the value of student - developed algorithms — this despite research by cognitive psychologists strongly supporting a curriculum that simultaneously develops conceptual understanding , computational fluency with standard algorithms , and problem - solving skills as the best way to prepare students for algebra .
The heart of the disagreement between progressive math educators and mathematicians is whether students are acquiring a foundation in arithmetic and other aspects of mathematics in the early grades that prepares them for authentic algebra coursework in grades 7 , 8 , and 9 .
If not , they then cannot successfully complete the advanced math courses in high school that will prepare them adequately for freshman college courses using mathematics .
To address these concerns , the president issued an executive order in 2006 forming the National Mathematics Advisory Panel , of which I was a member .
The panel , composed of mathematicians , cognitive psychologists , mathematics educators , and education researchers ( my expertise is in reading research , K–12 standards , and teacher education ) , and appointed by then –secretary of education Margaret Spellings , would examine how best to prepare students for Algebra 1 , the gateway course to higher mathematics and advanced science , based on the “ best evidence available . ”
For the panel , educational equity meant not dumbing down content but enabling most U.S. students to travel the same road together to Algebra 1 — before ninth grade — just as students do in top - achieving countries .
The panel also spelled out the 27 major topics of school algebra that should be taught in every American high school to make us internationally competitive .
The panel found little if any credible evidence supporting the teaching philosophy and practices that math educators have promoted in their ed-school courses and embedded in textbooks for almost two decades .
It did find evidence for the effectiveness of a highly structured approach to teaching computational skills , called Team Assisted Individualization ; of formative assessment , which entails ongoing monitoring of student learning to inform instruction ; of the use of high - quality technology for drilling and practicing ; and of explicit systematic instruction for students with learning disabilities and other learning problems .
Despite the proven effectiveness of these strategies , many math educators view most of them with disdain — most likely because they entail more traditional , structured teaching .
The mathematics educators ’ response to the panel ’s report came as no surprise .
The Montana Mathematics Enthusiast , a journal put out by an NCTM state affiliate , was the first to declare the party line in its July 2008 issue , which featured highly critical essays by five mathematics educators .
Issue editor Greer declared in his overview that the panel ’s report offered nothing useful , since it had “ restricted ” itself to scientific research and ignored the “ rich reflections ” of educators , who , in his judgment , had produced the “ deepest work in the field . ”
These reflections , which progressive educators call “ qualitative ” or “ practitioner ” research , generally consist of educators studying their own classrooms and concluding that , yes , their methods work well .
One expert in this self - serving practice is Eric Gutstein , a mathematics educator at the University of Illinois in Chicago and another contributor to the July issue .
Gutstein proposed that the panel , as an initiative of the “ Bush Administration and US financial / corporate elites , ” sought to bolster “ capital ’s efforts to shore up the US ’s weakening economic global position , ” not to benefit “ the majority of the US people — particularly marginalized and excluded students of color and low - income students . ”
The American Educational Research Association ( AERA ) , the premier research organization in education , brought in heavier cannons to blast the panel ’s report .
Its salvo came in the form of 12 highly critical essays in the December 2008 issue of Educational Researcher , a prestigious AERA - sponsored journal .
Guest editor Anthony Kelley claimed in his introductory essay that the math educators and education researchers whom he ’d invited to comment on the panel ’s report would “ contribute to the current discussion of how methodological approaches are matched to and shaped by questions and objectives . ”
He , too , described the panel ’s report as based on “ a strict and narrow definition of ‘ scientific evidence ’ and an almost exclusive endorsement of quantitative methods at the expense of qualitative approaches . ”
Moreover , with a striking lack of professional courtesy , Kelley chose not to invite any of the panel ’s mathematicians to reply .
( In a follow - up communication , Kelley stated that he had sought responses from three nationally known mathematicians , none of them from the panel , but that each , for different reasons , had declined . )
None of the 12 essays attempted to explain why the panel ’s “ strict ” definitions of scientific evidence revealed no support for progressive pedagogy .
A distinct lack of interest in allowing mathematicians a major voice in determining the content of the high school mathematics curriculum is n’t confined to educational research publications or presentations .
A new effort is under way to develop national math standards for K–12 .
The two organizations running the effort — the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers , with support from both the Department of Education and the National Education Association — have not yet invited a single mathematical or science society to ensure that the high school mathematics standards and “ college - readiness ” standards they propose in fact prepare American high school students for the freshman calculus courses that serve as the basis for undergraduate majors in engineering , science , and mathematics ( as well as other mathematics - dependent majors and technical / occupational programs ) .
The effort , which is being pushed very quickly , seems determined to do an end run around the country ’s mathematical and scientific organizations and the panel ’s recommendations on the major topics for school algebra .
Baseless pedagogical theories mean that the educators ’ long - term captive audience — K– 12 teachers , most drawn from the middle academic tier of our high school population and the bottom third of our undergraduate population — will know even less about authentic mathematics than they do now .
Alas , so will their students .
And even if a new Congress or Secretary of Education were to support the panel ’s recommendations , it will be essentially business as usual in the public schools so long as math educators , joined by assessment experts and technology salesmen , continue to shape the curriculum .
A form of mathematics stripped of much of its intellectual content has obvious repercussions for higher education and the American economy .
Hung - Hsi
Wu , a Berkeley mathematician , expressed the view of many of his peers when he wrote in 1997 that the brand of mathematics purveyed by the NCTM ’s 1989 report “ has the potential to change completely the undergraduate mathematics curriculum and to throttle the normal process of producing a competent corps of scientists , engineers , and mathematicians . ”
And Larry Faulkner , the panel ’s chair and past president of the University of Texas in Austin , warns that if national policy does n’t ensure the development of a large domestic workforce with first - rate technical skills , we risk “ technological surprise to our economic viability and to the foundations of our country ’s security . ”
If the bleak math statistics in the United States do n’t change soon , such “ surprise ” may well be imminent .
The math wars , which started in debates about pedagogy , may end in questions about the long - term prospects for American prosperity .
Thomas Peacock
THE connection between an 18th - century savant called Joseph - Louis Lagrange and the problem of landing safely at Hong Kong International Airport may not , at first , be obvious .
But there is one .
Hong Kong airport is notorious for rocky and sometimes aborted landings caused by the disturbed air flow from nearby mountains .
Though laser technology is deployed alongside its runways to monitor changes in wind speed and thus forewarn pilots , that is often not enough .
What is needed is a better understanding of the theory of the winds themselves .
And this is where Lagrange comes in .
He was a pioneer of the study of moving fluids ( among many other things ) , but his ideas outran the computational tools of his day .
Only now , with supercomputers available to help with the calculations , is it possible to explore those ideas completely .
What is emerging is a picture of fluid dynamics more subtle and more complex than anything dreamed of even a decade ago .
The atmosphere and the ocean are , it seems , dominated by invisible barriers that have come to be known as Lagrangian coherent structures .
They govern the movement of everything from the trajectories of aircraft to the distribution of pollution , the migration of jellyfish and the tracks taken by hurricanes .
They are , as it were , the skeletons of the sea and the air .
To understand what a Lagrangian coherent structure is , it helps to imagine a crowd at a railway terminus , says Thomas Peacock of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who studies the structures .
Some people will be arriving .
Some will be leaving .
And , whichever they are doing , they will be going to and from numerous different platforms .
The result is chaos , but structured chaos .
What emerges is a shifting pattern of borders between groups of people with different goals .
These borders are Lagrangian coherent structures .
They are intangible , immaterial and would be undetectable if the passengers stopped moving .
But they are also real enough to be treated mathematically .
Crucially , they form a barrier to exchange between groups , as anyone who has been caught up in a crowd and pulled inexorably in the wrong direction will know .
Substitute unreasoning air or water molecules for sentient humans and you have a chaotic fluid .
And it turns out to be easier to study the behaviour of such fluids by looking at the barriers than at the bodies of fluid which those barriers separate .
A coherent approach
The theory of Lagrangian coherent structures was started about ten years ago by George Haller , who was then at Brown University , in Rhode Island .
He had been working in the fashionable mathematical field of chaos theory — an explanation in search of a problem — when he came across a suitable problem in the form of mountains of data accumulated by various ocean and atmospheric scientists of his acquaintance .
At the moment Dr Haller , who is now at McGill University in Montreal , is collaborating with Wenbo Tang of Arizona State University and Pak Wai Chan of the Hong Kong Observatory to apply Lagrangian theory to the problem of aircraft taking off and landing in difficult circumstances .
The lasers by the runways act a bit like radars .
They can not see air molecules directly , but they are able to track aerosol particles that are tossed around by the currents .
The Doppler effect ( familiar from the changing pitch of a passing police siren ) gives away the velocities of these particles and Dr Haller 's computers are able to crunch the resulting data in the light of Lagrange 's theories and work out the network of coherent structures that is causing their movements — and the pattern of updraughts and downdraughts that should result .
The initial predictions from the crunching compare well with the actual movement up or down of planes coming in to land at Hong Kong — and , crucially , the system highlights areas of turbulence that traditional methods miss .
If all continues to go well , the results will be plugged into the airport 's air - traffic control system for real within a few months .
Lagrangian coherent structures should also prove useful at sea .
François Lekien of the Free University of Brussels , in Belgium , and his colleagues have used radar measurements to do for the ocean what Dr Haller 's lasers do for the air .
In this case , the purpose is to predict the fate of pollutants .
Dr Lekien 's radars are pointed at the waters of Monterey Bay , in California .
Again , the Doppler shift is the telltale .
It allows him ( or , rather , his computer ) to see the ever - shifting Lagrangian pattern in the bay .
That , in turn , predicts at any given moment which regions of the bay will wash pollutants out to sea and which will confine them to the coast .
This information should help the authorities work out when it is safe to permit operations that risk causing leakage , such as repairs to shore - based oil tanks .
Similar projects are also being carried out near Fort Lauderdale in Florida and close to Brest on the west coast of France — a stretch of coastline that is notoriously dangerous for oil tankers .
Lagrangian analysis might allow the behaviour of spills to be predicted more easily .
Analysing the sea in this way might prove useful , too , in rescuing people whose boats have broken down or in locating the wreckage of aircraft that have crashed in mid-ocean .
It should also please zoologists .
John Dabiri of the California Institute of Technology , for example , has used the technique to study the hunting behaviour of jellyfish .
He has shown how parts of the ocean are temporarily protected from the depredations of these creatures because they cannot cross the invisible barriers imposed by Lagrange .
It sounds esoteric , but America 's Office of Naval Research is using the results to help design better unmanned submarines .
And that is not all .
Lagrangian coherent structures can appear at all sorts of scales .
What goes for an airport or a bay can be scaled up to an ocean , or the air above it , and down to the flow off an aircraft 's wingtip , or a ship 's hull .
As a consequence Jerry Marsden , one of Dr Dabiri 's colleagues at Caltech , thinks the coherent - structure approach might also be used to help predictions of the passage of hurricanes ; they , too , are constrained by the invisible barriers that Lagrange 's theory describes .
Dr Marsden reckons the technique might even improve understanding of how water from melting ice caps will affect ocean currents , including the Gulf Stream .
Dr Peacock , meanwhile , concentrates on what it can say about aerodynamic drag on cars and lift under aircraft wings .
The upshot is that Dr Haller and his disciples have created a powerful new way of looking at the world .
They have shown that the boundaries between things are often as important as the things themselves .
And they have issued a reminder that even the most abstruse and arcane branches of mathematics can sometimes be deeply pragmatic , too .
Alright , this will be my last straw of interviewing this bizarre and " joyful " series .
This will be a joint review , as I will be reviewing " Sladed " and " Jinxed " as their quality , is , I could say similar if you want to put it like that .
Once again , I 'm using Adobe Animate and 2 flash decompilers to review this .
So , then again , sorry if this review is a little bit detailed than the others .
Alright , as per tradition , let 's talk about the contents that are in here .
Sladed : 574 shapes , 15 morph shapes , 12 images , 35 sounds , 1 video , 6 fonts , 35 texts , 292 sprites , 3 buttons , 3929 frames , 4 actions , and 7 miscellaneous tags
Jinxed : 2993 shapes , 15 morph shapes , 37 images , 3 sounds , 5 fonts , 37 texts , 467 sprites , 2 buttons , 6212 frames , 3 actions , and 8 miscellaneous tags .
Now we get that out , let 's talk about the titles .
And to be honest , those are pretty clever titles .
So , great titles to start these animations .
And second , let 's talk about Raven .
I do n't know man , but it seems that Raven always appeared in his hentai series .
I mean , in Tentacles I she got fucked by tentacles , in II she got thrown away and talking that the spell behind the monster is breaking , in Sladed she got fucked by , i do n't know man , and finally , in Jinxed she got fingered while thinking about something joyful .
Oh god ...
But for now , let 's talk about the animation itself .
As always , the animation is very fluid , so great job again .
And best of all , Jinxed does n't even have a video at all .
But if we 're talking about the animation , we have to go much deeper : realism .
Do these animations have the same spirit as Teen Titans or maybe Tentacles ?
No .
In fact , you could compare Tentacles Part 2 and both of these animations at home .
If you feel that the styles look different , well , now you know .
For Sladed , I could give it a sense of forgiveness , but for Jinxed , nope , since it's a newer animation and that he should 've learned more about it .
The story is actually better in Jinxed than the all the others .
Nice to have a great story with double characters being jinxed .
A really good way .
So , let me retell both of those stories , and forgive me for not knowing much about Teen Titans .
So , in Sladed , Raven looks at Cyborg as he 's dead , and an another robot comes in .
Raven tries to use her powers but it failed and the robot knocks her to the floor while complimented her body .
He rips off her clothers and her body is revealed .
Yeah , tell em , it 's better than ripping off someone 's panties .
He fucks her pussy and she tries hard to not to moan .
It went on for almost 1 minute .
Well , that explains the 574 shapes .
After several seconds into the animation , he finally gets his weewee out while the juice is also pouring .
And he makes her body stand upside down while doing anal !
Holy shit !
And he cums , Raven uses her power and it worked , but left her that robot 's gift .
You know it .
Now for Jinxed .
Jinx gets her phone out , I do n't know , then presses a button , and does a blowjob , while fingering her own .
Cyborg refuses but she continues anyway .
And the first Booyah kicked in .
But Cyborg instead wants to get over with it and fucked her instead .
She moans so hard , and after several seconds she is tired after the insides of her filled with ... yogurt .
no , this is intentional .
That was actually caught on a surveillance camera that Raven and Starfire monitored for that time , which somehow does n't surprise Raven .
With out of context measures , Starfire wants to do a fingering and let Raven think of something joyful .
That will continue after Jinx got fucked the second time , this time without clothes , with more Booyahs coming from Cyborg 's mouth with several yoghurts ( oh my god ... ) sprayed into Jinx 's body .
Finally , Starfire gets her finger out from Raven 's pussy , with the juice pouring out , and that has led to one of ZONE 's first trending video : Furry Creatures .
Actually , can we talk about that clip for a moment ?
This was actually the clip that , for who never watched it , left them wondering : what 's in Starfire 's hand ?
Some answered jokingly , like hair gel and jelly , but some gave them the answer head - on :
RaVeN's PuSSy JuICe
Now about the details .
Let me explain : the details are really down , both of them .
If you sometimes remove the weewee ( yes i said it ) , there are only little parts of the pussy exposed modtly the upper part only .
The rest is just an illusion for the eyes .
I understand Tentacles Part 2 detailed the pussy just for the removal of the tentacle fucking her before flipping her body and ripping her panties , but note that he also detailed the second part of the fucking .
I mean , come on ...
At least the insides of both pussies look great , but not as great as the shorter part in Tentacles .
You made an effort on those parts somehow .
Great , now let 's talk about the sound effects .
It 's alright , I guess ...
The sound on Sladed while fucked is like a click from the mouse , and the sound in Jinxed , it 's just overly closed with BOOYAHs and Jinx 's loud moan .
But one thing that I should appreciate is the fingering sound , which sounds a little bit more true - to - life .
And the fingering scene is , I do n't know , the greatest part about both of these animations .
He orchestrated that scene the right way .
The voice swapping technique is nice , just as what I 've come to expect , and the audio is great for its time , and the scenes are fluent .
So far , no more to talk .
But there 's one little problem .
If people played the Flash version , usually , you will be given a warning saying that , these animations are only appropriate for those aged 18 and older .
But for Jinxed , it 's head on without a warning .
Well , it 's either 2 possible answers : either he forgot it or either he thought that age is just a number .
Nah , i'm just joking .
Finally , let 's talk about the storyboards from Adobe Animate .
Welp , of course you can already see that both of these dicks are clearly visible .
And , if you try to convert the SWF file to a FLA file and open it using Animate , welp , the dick wo n't even fuck their pussies .
So , the best way to enjoy that in Adobe Animate is to unlock the SWF and import them to the project , but you lose the sounds in it .
So , this concludes the review of both Sladed and Jinxed , as well as this whole series .
In all ways , it 's not much better than the ones on both of the previous episodes that I have reviewed .
The realism , however , is a key part , and only Tentacles II got the feel right .
But instead , these animations just showcased how " joyful " they are when fucked .
But hey , could we agree that the Furry Creatures really climbed up ZONE 's stardom ?
Even so , it 's 8/10 .
No , i'm not joking .
This is the combined rating of both .
I want to rate exactly at 8.125 , because Sladed is 8/10 and Jinxed is 8.25/10 , but they standardized it .
You know you could do it , but for this time , the efforts do n't really climb up like before .
You have a lot of potentials , but I guess you undermined it .
But still , I want to see the future of your series of Teen Titans .
For some reason , you have made our childhood full of ... yeah ... We should appreciate that almost no independent creators are as good as ZONE 's animation back then .
However , from the most recent animation , you are starting to stick to a longer project , like The Modifuckers with 7 minutes , and XXXtreme Ghostbusters for 16 minutes , which may or may not satisfy people , but that 's a story for another day .
This makes me wondering : will The Lord Dominator get a longer time than both of these .
I know I wanted the revival of this series and making it longer , but , I guess it 's not the time .
I 'm just hoping that The Lord Dominator will be good and longer , with a more intriguing story than all of your previous animations .
So , before I conclude this , I 'm sorry for lots of typos here and there because I was really rushed when reviewing this .
Eh , no problem .
For you reading this , I 'll be back .
REMEMBER .
“ RuBisCo Stars ” and the Riddle of Life
by Joe Davis
We ’ve looked before at the work of MIT biology research affiliate Joe Davis , whose passion is the melding of science and art .
Among his many ideas are the creation of an ‘ infogene , ’ engineering a sign of human intelligence into the genome of bacteria that could be flung into the heavens by the trillion , and a three - masted Gulf Coast tower that would discharge laser beams into the sky .
In 1986 , Davis used MIT ’s Millstone radar to beam a signal to Epsilon Eridani , Tau Ceti and two other stars .
His most recent adventure takes him to the great telescope at Arecibo .
It involves the 35th anniversary of the Drake / Sagan transmission to M13 , a messaging strategy based on molecular biology , and the emergence of the coolest iPhone in the world .
What follows is a narrative describing events that took place just over one week ago :
I traveled from Boston to Puerto Rico on 03 November to deliver a lecture for the University of Puerto Rico ’s Biology Colloquium ( Rio Piedras campus ) in San Juan .
I also planned to meet with Arecibo Observatory interim Director , Dr. Michael C. Nolan to propose a project that would coincide with the 35th anniversary of the famous message for extraterrestrial intelligence that was transmitted into space from Arecibo by astronomers Frank Drake and Carl Sagan in 1974 .
Poetic and philosophical implications underlying the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence ( SETI ) have marked much of my work and career as an artist .
In the 1980s , technical problems associated with the use of radar and spacecraft as message - transmitters inspired me to develop prototype bacterial carriers of generic information that could survive for very long periods of time in the harsh environments of space .
That is how a subject as vast in scope as the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ultimately brought me to the study of molecular biology .

In 1974 , molecular biology was entering its “ golden age ” .
Part of the Sagan Drake message was encrypted with a rudimentary likeness of the DNA double helix .
The hereditary role of DNA was then well known – as were two of the three principal conformations of its molecular structure – but the triplet operation of the genetic code had only recently been unraveled and modern techniques for DNA sequencing were still a few years away .
The first genes ( DNA ) were sequenced in 1977 and the first recombinant organisms were produced in Herbert Boyer ’s laboratory ( UCSF ) in 1978 .
In 1974 , there was no genomic science at all .
While messages were being transmitted to extraterrestrial intelligence no one knew that genetically speaking , human beings are 70 % identical to tomatoes .
In 35 years since the Sagan - Drake transmission from Arecibo , radar antennae all over the world have more or less routinely searched the sky for unambiguous signals from advanced extraterrestrial civilizations .
The SETI@Home project , organized by the Space Sciences laboratory at UC Berkeley has allowed millions of lay enthusiasts to participate in SETI sky surveys by donating processing time on home computers .
Various amateur and commercially motivated transmissions have taken place , but such transmissions have been insufficiently powerful and arbitrarily or naively composed by groups and individuals from outside the formal , scientific community .
No federal funds at all have been allocated for SETI searches and with the possible exception of Poetica Vaginal ( ca. 1986 ) , for almost 35 years , no serious scientific radio messages for extraterrestrial intelligence have been transmitted into space .
In late October of this year , I contacted members of the astronomy community at Cornell University for referrals to scientists and administrators at Arecibo Observatory ( Cornell operates Arecibo Observatory under contract with the National Science Foundation ) .
My objective at Arecibo was to carry out transmission of a new message to extraterrestrial intelligence on or around the 16 November anniversary of the 1974 Sagan - Drake transmission .
To prepare for meetings at Arecibo Observatory , I organized recommendations and letters of support for the project from respected members of the international academic and research communities that were sent to Arecibo ’s director on my behalf .
Among these were recommendations from Dr. Irving Vega of University of Puerto Rico Biology and his Department Chair , Dr. Carmen Maldonado , art historian James Elkins , astronomer and editor , Dr. Roger Malina , CalPoly physics Prof.
Peter Scwartz , University of Washington art historian , Marek Wieczorek , scientists from the biology community here in Massachusetts and abroad , members of the astronomy community at Cornell and others .

The RuBisCo Message
All living things are made of protein and the most abundant protein on Earth is called RuBisCo ( ribulose - 1,5 - bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase ) .
It is actually quite an interesting protein .
To quote Wikipedia , it is “ an enzyme that is used in the Calvin cycle to catalyze the first major step of carbon fixation , a process by which the atoms of atmospheric carbon dioxide are made available to organisms in the form of energy - rich molecules such as sucrose . ”
It is also interesting in that it actively selects against 13C , one of the naturally occurring stable isotopes of atmospheric carbon , in favor of 12C .
The difference of course , is only a single neutron .
In a letter of support sent to Arecibo , Dr. Peter Weigele ( staff scientist at New England Biolabs ) wrote , “ RuBisCo is not only the most abundant protein on earth , it is THE molecule , in all its many forms , that uses the energy supplied by photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide into food .
The choice of this molecule for broadcast communicates the central importance of our sun in sustaining life as well as an implicit understanding of the role of CO2 in our biogeochemical systems .
This is a message that is both timely and timeless– for the Universe and here on Earth ! ”
The Gene for the large RuBisCo subunit is a 1434 - mer DNA molecule :

I pointed out that certain technical shortcomings of the 1974 Sagan - Drake transmission could be avoided with a follow - up transmission .
I also found candidate stars that would be located in the Arecibo “ window ” ( above 20 degrees from the horizon ) in the first weeks of November ( gleaned from online sky maps and SETI Institute Jill Tarter ’s and Margaret Trunbull ’s list of candidate ‘ nearby habitable stellar systems ’ ) .
I established that aspects of the galactic rotation of target stars ( which actually negated the Sagan - Drake effort ) would be inconsequential when targeting stars located less than a few hundred light years away from the sun .
Image credit : Ashley Clark .
My friends at Cornell also suggested that since our best bet at finding ETI would be ones that are already quite sophisticated , targeting infrared sources in our galaxy that have no corresponding optical object should also be considered .
Although I personally remain rather skeptical on this point , these objects could be Dyson Shells or other similar ETI astroengineering projects .
The online data set of the IRAS could be used to identify such sources .
I proposed that a short message containing the RuBisCo sequence could be transmitted during some brief interval between scheduled ongoing use of Arecibo Radar or that it may coincide with periods set aside for checks and maintenance .
I was also advised incidentally , that no special ceremony or event was planned to mark the November 16 anniversary .
I arrived at Arecibo Observatory on Friday , 06 Nov. with several companions who had flown in to participate in the project .
My companions included Jonathan , Pam and Rhode Island School of Design Prof.
Emeritus , Al Wunderlich , film maker Peter Sasowsky , photographer and collaborator Ashley Clark and Belgian art historian , Danielle Hofmans .
Power outages caused by a lightning strike on Friday night postponed any use of Arecibo Radar until power transmission lines were repaired in time for the next night ’s observations .
I am now delighted to report that on Saturday night ( 07 Nov ) we managed to send the RuBisCo gene sequence to three “ nearby ” stars :
1st star : GJ 83.1 ( sent at 23:38:45 on 07 November 2009 )
2nd star : Teagarden ’s star SO 025300.5+165258
3rd star : Kappa Ceti ( G5B )
The amazing thing is , we did it with my iPhone !

Arecibo’s “ coder ” ( a device that interrupts the 2 Megawatt radar signal at precise intervals ) was down .
Use of that component would have been the most obvious way to input data that would be reflected in Arecibo Radar ’s transmitted signal .
Creative solutions were called for .
Inspired in part by techniques I used 25 years ago to interface with Millstone Radar for the Poetica Vaginal transmission , we converted the 1434 - mer RuBisCo sequence into an analog audio file that I recorded on my iPhone .
Then , we actually interfaced my iPhone with Arecibo ’s powerful radar and transmitted from approximately 11:30 p.m. until 12:45 a.m. ( see attached pictures ) .
The duration of each transmission was approximately 5 times longer than the 1974 Sagan - Drake transmission .
Now I have the coolest iPhone in the world .
How best to send out a gene as a coded signal ?
More on that tomorrow , along with a look at ways to add additional information to the original message .
Welcome to Episode 8 .
In this episode , we shall cover an important service that is provided in the Google App Engine .
The service is called Memcache and is used allow applications to manage their data in a cache .
What is a Cache and why do we need one ?
As per the Wikipedia definition , a cache is a temporary storage area where frequently accessed data can be stored for rapid access .
Once the data is stored in the cache , it can be used in the future by accessing the cached copy rather than re-fetching or recomputing the original data .
The decision to use a cache in your application should come after carefully determining which operations would be benefit from it .
Look at the following scenarios :
1 . If you have stored information in a database and which is not updated frequently , then it might make sense to put some of that information in a cache so that if multiple requests come for the same data then you can simply look up the memory cache and retrieve it from there , rather than make repeated database calls that are expensive ( and which may return the same data ) .
2 . If you invoke external web services and you determine that the same data could be requested , then a cache would help here too to avoid expensive network calls .
There is a lot of material available on the use of a cache in software applications and I suggest reading from those sources to arrive at a good caching design in your applications .
We shall keep our discussion here limited to a simple use case of using Memcache , which is a Caching Service provided by Google App Engine and how to implement it quickly in your application .
Before we begin ( Important ! )
We will be introducing MemCache in an existing application that we have written .
This was the Dictionary Service Application that we implemented in Episode 4 .
I strongly urge you to read up that episode and understand what the application was about and have that project ready to make changes accordingly .
To recap , our GAEJ Dictionary application is shown below :
1. Navigate to http://gaejexperiments.appspot.com/dictionary.html.
This will show a page as shown below :
2 . Enter the word that you wish to lookup the definition for in a dictionary and it will return you the result as shown below :
Introducing a Cache
The request / response flow for the above Dictionary application is explained below via the diagram shown :
The steps were as follows :
1 . The user makes a request to the GAEJ Experiments application by sending a request for the word .
2 . The GAEJ Dictionary Service Servlet receives the Request and makes a call to an External Dictionary Service hosted at ( http://services.aonaware.com/DictService/DictService.asmx).
3. The Response from the Dictionary Service i.e. the definition of the word is received by the GAEJ Dictionary Service Servlet .
4 . The Response is sent back to the user application .
The flow is straightforward and typically found in most applications .
Now , what happens if several users make a request for the same word ?
As per the application flow , each request from the user will result in a call to an external service for the definition , irrespective of whether it was the same word or not .
This is wasteful in terms of network resources and the application response too .
Coupled with the fact that the definition of a word is not going to change overnight :-) , it would be nice to return back the definition from the GAEJExperiments application itself , if the word definition had been looked up already .
Enter a cache !
So , what we are introducing in our application flow now is a cache called GAEJ Dictionary Cache and the modified application flow is shown below :
The steps now would be as follows :
1 . The user makes a request to the GAEJ Experiments application by sending a request for the word .
2 . The GAEJ Dictionary Service Servlet receives the Request and checks if the word and its definition is already present in the Cache .
If it is present in the Cache , then we short circuit and go to Step 6 .
Optional Steps ( 3,4,5 )
3 . If the Servlet does not find the definition in the Cache , then it makes a call to the External Dictionary Service hosted at ( http://services.aonaware.com/DictService/DictService.asmx).
4. The Response from the Dictionary Service i.e. the definition of the word is received by the GAEJ Dictionary Service Servlet .
5 . The Servlet puts the word and its definition in the Cache , so that future requests to determine if the word / definition is present in the Cache are fulfilled .
6 . The Response is sent back to the user application .
To summarize , we introduced the Cache that functions as follows :
All word definitions looked up from the External Service are placed in the Cache .
If a word is already present in the Cache , then it is returned from the Cache itself and an external network call is saved .
The Memcache Service API
A cache is typically implemented as a Map .
A Map is a generic data structure that contains a key and its value .
You look up the Cache by specifying the key and if it is found , then the value associated with that key is returned .
What I am describing here is an over simplification of what a Cache is .
There is a lot more to a Cache implementation then just putting a value and getting a value .
But we shall keep it simple here .
The Memcache Service API is simple enough to use and there is good documentation available on it here .
The Memcache Service implements JSR - 107 ( JCache Interface ) .
The JCache classes are present in the javax .
cache package and that it what you will use .
At a high level , all you need to do is follow these steps :
1 . Get a handle to the Cache implementation :
The snippet of code to do that ( reproduced from the Documentation ) is shown here :
import java.util .
Collections ; import javax.cache .
Cache ; import javax.cache.CacheException ; import javax.cache.CacheFactory ; import javax.cache.CacheManager ; Cache cache ; try { CacheFactory cacheFactory = CacheManager.getInstance().getCacheFactory ( ) ; cache = cacheFactory.createCache(Collections.emptyMap( ) ) ; } catch ( CacheException e ) { // ... }
The code is simple .
We get a handle to the CacheFactory instance and then create a Cache .
Notice that we are creating a Map i.e. an empty Map .
Once we have the Map , then all we need to do is play around with the ( key , value ) pairs .
2 . Put a value or get a value from the Cache
Shown below is how we would use the cache in a simple manner .
We invoke the put ( key , value ) method on the javax .
cache .
Cache instance .
Similarly , to extract a value , we need to invoke the cache. get ( key ) value .
It will return us the value if found , which we can then typecast to the appropriate class .
String key ; // The Word String value ; // The Definition of the Word //
Put the value into the cache . cache.put ( key , value ) ; //
Get the value from the cache .
value = ( String ) cache.get ( key ) ;
GAEJDictionaryCache.java
Let us first discuss a utility class that I have written that encapsulates the Caching API .
I have made this class a singleton and it is called GAEJDictionary Cache .
The source code is shown below :
package com.gaejexperiments.networking ; import java.util.
Collections ; import java.util.logging .Level ; import java.util.logging .
Logger ; import javax.cache .
Cache ; import javax.cache.CacheException ; import javax.cache.CacheFactory ; import javax.cache.CacheManager ; public class GAEJDictionaryCache { public static final Logger _log = Logger.getLogger(GAEJDictionaryCache.class.getName( ) ) ; private static GAEJDictionary Cache _instance ; private Cache cache ; private GAEJDictionaryCache ( ) { try { CacheFactory cacheFactory = CacheManager.getInstance().getCacheFactory ( ) ; cache = cacheFactory.createCache(Collections.emptyMap( ) ) ; } catch ( CacheException e ) { // Log stuff _log.log ( Level .WARNING , " Error in creating the Cache " ) ; } } public static synchronized GAEJDictionaryCache getInstance ( ) { if ( _instance==null ) { _instance = new GAEJDictionaryCache( ) ; } return _instance ; } public String findInCache ( String word ) { if ( cache.containsKey ( word ) ) { return ( String ) cache.get ( word ) ; } else { return null ; } } public void putInCache ( String word , String definition ) { cache.put ( word , definition ) ; } }
Let us discuss the key parts of the code :
The Singleton design pattern should be obvious over here and the application needs to use the getInstance ( ) method to obtain a handle to this singleton .
The constructor of this class is private and called only once .
In that an instance of the Cache is created .
There are two utility methods written : findInCache and putInCache .
The application invokes findInCache by providing a key value .
If the key is found , the value is written via the cache. get ( key ) method .
For our dictionary application , the key is the word that you wish to look up the definition for .
If the application wants to put a key , value record into the Cache , then it invokes the putInCache ( … ) method that takes the key and the value .
For our dictionary application , the key is the word and the value is the definition of the word .
By encapsulating the MemCache Service API in this fashion , you can create a reusable class that takes care of Cache API details .
You could then improve upon this class and provide advanced Cache features and APIs and reuse it in all your future GAEJ applications .
Modifying the Original GAEJDictionaryService .java class
All that remains now is for us to modify the existing GAEJDictionary Service .
java class by introducing the appropriate cache usage .
The modified code is shown below and I suggest to look at the comment // MEMCACHE to make it easier for you to see what I have changed .
package com.gaejexperiments.networking ; import java.io.BufferedReader ; import java.io.
IOException ; import java.io.
InputStreamReader ; import java.io.
StringReader ; import java.net .
URL ; import java.util.logging .

Only basic ones i.e. can not be null / empty if ( strWord == null ) throw new Exception ( " Word field cannot be empty . " ) ; // Trim the stuff strWord = strWord.trim ( ) ; if ( strWord.length ( ) == 0 ) throw new Exception ( " Word field cannot be empty . " ) ; //MEMCACHE // First get a handle to the Cache GAEJDictionary Cache _cache = GAEJDictionaryCache.getInstance ( ) ; //Determine if the value is present in the Cache String strWordDefinition = _cache.findInCache(strWord ) ; // If the word / definition is present in the Cache , return that straightaway , no need for external network call if ( strWordDefinition != null ) { // Return the definition _log.info( " Returning the Definition for [ " +strWord + " ] " + " from Cache . " ) ; strCallResult = strWordDefinition ; } else { _log .
info ( " Invoking the External Dictionary Service to get Definition for [ " +strWord + " ] " ) ; // Make the Network Call String strDictionaryServiceCall = " http://services.aonaware.com/DictService/DictService.asmx/Define?word= " ; strDictionaryServiceCall += strWord ; URL url = new URL ( strDictionaryServiceCall ) ; BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader ( new InputStreamReader(url.openStream ( ) ) ) ; StringBuffer response = new StringBuffer ( ) ; String line ; while ( ( line = reader.readLine ( ) ) != null ) { response.append ( line ) ; } reader.close ( ) ; strCallResult = response.toString ( ) ; DocumentBuilderFactory builderFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance ( ) ; DocumentBuilder builder = builderFactory.newDocumentBuilder( ) ; Document doc = builder.parse ( new InputSource ( new StringReader( strCallResult.toString ( ) ) ) ) ; XPathFactory factory = XPathFactory.newInstance ( ) ; XPath xpath = factory.newXPath( ) ; XPathExpression expr = xpath.compile("//Definition[Dictionary [ Id='wn ' ] ] / WordDefinition / text ( ) " ) ;
Object result = expr.evaluate(doc , XPathConstants .
NODESET ) ; NodeList nodes = ( NodeList ) result ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < nodes.getLength ( ) ; i++) { strCallResult = nodes.item(i).getNodeValue ( ) ; } //MEMCACHE // Need to check depending on your logic if the values are good // Currently we will assume they are and put it in the cache // For e.g. if the word is not found , the Dictionary Service gets the word back .
// So you could use that logic if you want .
_cache.putInCache(strWord , strCallResult ) ; } resp.getWriter().println(strCallResult ) ; } catch ( Exception ex ) { strCallResult = " Fail : " + ex.getMessage ( ) ; resp.getWriter().println(strCallResult ) ; } } @ Override public void doPost ( HttpServletRequest req , HttpServletResponse resp ) throws ServletException , IOException { doGet ( req , resp ) ; } }
Let us discuss the modified flow in brief :
We first extract out the word request parameter and do some basic validation to make sure that it is not empty .
We get the handle to the Cache by calling our utility class that we just wrote .
// First get a handle to the Cache GAEJDictionary Cache _cache = GAEJDictionaryCache.getInstance ( ) ;
We check if the word is present in the cache .
The findInCache method will return null if not found .
// Determine if the value is present in the Cache String strWordDefinition = _cache.findInCache(strWord ) ;
If the definition is returned from the cache , then we simply return that and no network call is made .
If the definition is not found , then the network call is made , the response stream is parsed out for the definition .
And the most important step is to put this definition in the cache , so that the findInCache ( … ) method will get the definition , the next time another request for the same word is made .
_cache.putInCache(strWord , strCallResult ) ;
Try it out
You can try out the modified Dictionary Service application at : http://gaejexperiments.appspot.com/dictionary.html.
The first time that you search for a word , it might take some time to get back the definition but once present in the cache , it is returned much faster .
Do note , that if the same word has been looked up by another user , then the word and its definition will be present in the cache .
Cache Design considerations
A cache if implemented well will save your application from repeated resource intensive operations and also improve application response times significantly .
Of course , simply putting in a cache comes with risks .
Some of the factors , you need to take into consideration are :
1. Determine precisely which operations in your application would benefit from a cache .
2 . Analyse if the data that you are putting in a cache changes frequently or not .
If it changes frequently , then it might negate the benefits of a cache .
3 . Control the size of the cache and prevent it from becoming too large or unmanageable .
The way we have implemented it , the cache will keep growing and we are leaving it to the App Engine run time to truncate our cache due to memory limitations if any .
4 . Take into consideration several other factors like what is an interval across which you want to refresh the cache , cache expiration policies , etc .
In short , monitoring the cache and tuning its parameters is required from any production worthy application .

More than 200 people are being detained at the camp US President Barack Obama has for the first time admitted that the US will miss the January 2010 deadline he set for closing the Guantanamo Bay prison .
Mr Obama made the admission in interviews with US TV networks during his tour of Asia .
He said he was " not disappointed " that the deadline had slipped , saying he " knew this was going to be hard " .
Officials are trying to determine what to do with some 215 detainees still held at the US prison in Cuba .
Mr Obama 's announcement follows considerable speculation that the deadline would slip , as the administration wrestles with how to deal with those inmates who cannot either be freed or tried in US courts .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He did not set a specific new deadline for closing the camp , but said it would probably be later in 2010 .
" We had a specific deadline that was missed , " he told NBC .
And he told Fox News : " It 's hard not only because of the politics .
People , I think understandably , are fearful after a lot of years where they were told that Guantanamo was critical to keep terrorists out . "
Closing the facility was " also just technically hard " , he added , and depended on co-operation from Congress .
Domestic opposition Moving to close Guantanamo was one of Mr Obama 's first acts in office .
ANALYSIS Paul Reynolds ,
BBC News website world affairs correspondent President Obama 's admission that he will not close Guantanamo Bay by his target of 22 January is not a surprise given that his senior officials have been hinting at this for some time .
The problems have proved more complex than expected .
Most difficult of all is what to do with those prisoners against whom there is not enough presentable evidence to use either in a civilian or a military court .
The US government is trying to get foreign countries to take them but has had limited success .
There is some domestic opposition to their transfer to the US itself .
A nearly - empty prison in rural Illinois is being considered to house them .
The president 's statement is an acceptance that this will not be resolved in time .
On 22 January 2009 , just two days after inauguration , he set a deadline of a year for closing the heavily - criticised prison .
His administration says it will try some detainees in US courts and repatriate or resettle others not perceived as a threat .
Last week , Attorney General Eric Holder announced the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , and four other defendants would be transferred from Guantanamo to face trial in a New York federal court .
Some lawmakers and relatives of 9/11 victims reacted angrily , arguing that the move put Americans at risk .
Asked about domestic opposition , Mr Obama told NBC that the anger over Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 's civilian trial would disappear " when he 's convicted and when the death penalty is applied to him " .
And in separate comments to CNN , he said that the notion that " terrorists possess some special powers that prevent us from presenting evidence against them , locking them up and exacting swift justice " was a " fundamental mistake " .
In terms of other detainees , five have been ordered to face military commission trials in the US and a number of others , including several Chinese Muslim Uighurs , have been cleared by investigators for release and resettled overseas .
But the issue of detainees assessed as dangerous but who for legal reasons could not be successfully prosecuted in US courts remains unresolved .
The BBC's Jonathan Beale , who is at Guantanamo Bay , says the announcement of the delay to the deadline has come as no surprise .
The question of where to put those detainees who cannot be freed or tried remains a huge political obstacle , he says .

Today ’s version must be put together , and the robots are considerably smaller in stature than their predecessors .
Mr. Walsh speculated that the change is partly a response to retailers ’ desire to cram as much merchandise as possible onto their coveted shelf space .

Then there ’s the ever - growing popularity and educational allure of so - called construction toys , like Legos ; for them , building is supposed to be part of the point and part of the fun .
Many such kits are no longer designed for open - ended , creative building , but rather to construct a precise model based on a licensed movie theme , for example “ Star Wars ” or “ Transformers . ”
If a child ca n’t recreate the spaceship or warrior by following pages of directions , it is up to the parents to do it .
“ They ’ll help in the beginning , but in the end , it ’s me and my husband  and they ’re watching TV , ” said Lori Harasem of Lethbridge , Alberta , referring to her attempts to assemble Transformers robots for her children , ages 11 , 9 and 2 .
“ Often the directions are n’t very clear , and suddenly you ’re disassembling . ”
As she spoke , she was looking out the window at a playhouse she had tried to assemble for her daughter .
One of its walls had fallen down .
Recognizing her customers ’ frustration  and perhaps their mechanical shortcomings 
Ms. Kerman has her staff build some toys , like tricycles , anticipating that customers either wo n’t be able to do it themselves or will do it wrong .
In the case of other toys , like train tables , the store will assemble them for a modest fee of $ 10 or so .
“ My stores cater to a more urban clientele , ” she said .
“ They are not out on the weekends tinkering with their car .
Their handy skills have become less specialized . ”
She added , “ Maybe we ’ve all lost that skill ” of building things by hand .
Still , toy industry observers say that the category of construction toys has experienced phenomenal growth over the last year , perhaps as adults seek to counter children ’s interest in all things electronic .
( This is a category that includes toys like the 330 - plus - piece Marble Mania Extreme construction set , which prompted the following comment on Amazon.com : “ OH MY GOD !
YOU BETTER BE AN ENGINEER TO PUT THIS TOGETHER !! ” )
Plainfield East High School does n’t have a senior class .
But it clearly possesses a new staple of American education : “ sexting . ” I urge a surely chagrined Principal Anthony Manville to buy several large boxes of fig leaves .
A 16 - year - old honors student took a nude photo of herself , used her cellphone to send it to a friend and , bingo , for the last two weeks the photo has made the rounds of the three - year - old school with 1,300 students .
Plainfield police seized some students ’ phones and passed them on to computer forensic experts at the Will County Sheriff ’s Department .
The school is contemplating punishment , the police are interviewing students and James Glasgow , the Will County state ’s attorney , is mulling whether to prosecute anybody under Illinois child pornography statutes .
In the meantime , everybody can spend time off over the holiday cheerfully consuming “ Teens and Sexting , ” a study just completed by the Internet and American Life Project at the Pew Research Center .
Based partly on a survey of 800 teenagers , parents and guardians , it underscores the role of cellphones “ in the sexual lives of teens and young adults . ”
Four percent of the teenagers indicated that had dispatched “ sexually suggestive nude or nearly nude images or videos of themselves ” via text messaging , while 15 percent claimed they had received such images of a person they know .
It is rare when antidiscrimination law is extended to a whole new group of people , but that happened on Saturday , when a federal ban on discriminating on the basis of genetic background took effect .
The new law is an important step in protecting people who have inherited a predisposition to disease .
It removes a significant obstacle to genetic testing , which can help prevent and treat serious illnesses .
Genetic testing can warn people that they have a disposition for diseases like cancer , and it can help doctors adapt courses of treatment to particular patients .
As advances have been made in genetic testing , however , employers and insurance companies have used it to penalize people .
There have been reports of people being denied jobs or being fired because a parent had Huntington ’s disease , or the worker had a BRCA1 gene that predisposed her to breast and ovarian cancer .
People with family histories of certain diseases have had difficulty in buying health insurance .
A woman whose two children carried a gene for a liver deficiency was denied health insurance in 2003 even though , as carriers of the gene , they would not develop the problem themselves .
In a survey , 63 percent of respondents said they would not submit to genetic testing if employers or health insurers could see the results .
China implemented the one - child policy back in 1979 , under which most of the country ’s couples were encouraged , and some would say compelled , to have only one child .
Even though many Chinese parents , as decided by geography or ethnic minority status , were allowed to have more than 1 child , on the average , Chinese families had less than 2 children per woman .
Indeed by 2005 , the fertility rate of mainland Chinese women has fallen to about 1.75 .
But , China ’s population continues to increase even today , as can be seen from Fig : 1 below , courtesy Wikipedia .
Replacement fertility rate of a group is defined as the average number of children a newborn girl needs to give birth to in her life so that the population of her group remains constant .
At first glance , this number seems like it should be around 2 , so that the children born would replace ( at the risk of sounding rather inhumane ) their parents .
But , unfortunately , not all baby girls live long enough to be of childbearing age , which means the Replacement fertiliy rate has to be a little higher than 2 .
Also , as the sex ratio at birth in most places in the world is skewed towards boys , less than half of the children born are girls who will give birth to the next generation .
So , to have the replacement number of girls , the replacement fertility rate has to be a little higher still .
Obviously , since infant / child mortality rates and sex ratio at birth differ widely across the world , the amount by which the Replacement fertility rate is above 2 is different in different countries .
According to Wikipedia , while the number is around 2.1 for most developed countries , it ranges from 2.5 to 3.3 in developing countries .
So , when fertility rate in China is so low , how does population still increase ?
To understand why changes in fertility do n’t immediately translate to changes in population , let ’s see what is the immediate reason for changes in population .
The net - population growth is the difference between the total of births and immigration and the total of deaths and emigration .
Migrations , being independent of fertility , obviously do not affect how fertility rate affects population .
Then , the question is whether replacement fertility during a particular year guarantees equality between total births and deaths .
It is easy to see that it does n’t .
Even after a few years of replacement fertility , the society only guarantees that the number of births is equal to the number of births X years ago , where X is the average childbearing age of women in that society .
But , the number of deaths is different !
It will be the number of births Y years ago , where Y is the life span of the society .
If the society had a growing population in the near past , then X would be greater than Y and so the population will continue to increase despite the achievement of fertility at or below replacement levels .
Similarly , population will continue to fall for a few years in countries like Russia , which has a declining population now , even if they achieve Replacement fertility .
This whole phenomenon where Population lags behind fertility rate trends is called Population Momentum .
It is evident that if fertility rate continues to be low , the Chinese population eventually has to fall .
When will this happen ?
When the one - child policy has continued for long enough that the total number of births in the current year ( in the future ) is less than than the number of births Y years before current , the population will begin to fall .
As births are falling each year and the number of deaths Y years ago increasing each year , that day will come soon .
Of course , Chinese policymakers will find it prudent to reverse the policy , at least partially , much before that day as the dependency ratio in China is rapidly increasing , threatening to curtail economic growth as the average working age Chinese will have to support more and more retired seniors .
Policy - making is intensely intricate and dependent of good data collection and analysis .
Leaving aside for another venue the morality of an overly planned state , one ca n’t but admire how intelligent data analysis can lead to policies that can quickly uplift hundreds of millions from poverty , as seen in China today .
Wikipedia writes : Bagna càuda ( Italian : [ ˈbaɲɲa ˈkauda ] ; Piedmontese : [ ˈbaɲa ˈkɑʊda ] ; Piedmontese for " hot dip " , [ 1 ] alternatively written bagna caôda or bagnacauda , etymologically related to Italian root bagn - , meaning " wet " , and caldo , meaning " hot " ) is a warm dip typical of Piedmont , Italy , but with numerous local variations .
The dish , which is served and consumed in a manner similar to fondue , is made with garlic , anchovies , olive oil , butter , and in some parts of the region cream .
In the past walnut or hazelnut oil would have been used .
[ 2 ]
Sometimes , truffles are used in versions around Alba . [3 ]
The dish is eaten by dipping raw , boiled or roasted vegetables , especially cardoon , carrot , peppers , fennel , [ 3 ] celery , cauliflower , artichokes , and onions .
It is traditionally eaten during the autumn and winter months , particularly at Christmas and New Year 's , and must be served hot , as the name suggests .
Originally , in Piedmont , the Bagna càuda was placed in a big pan ( peila ) in the center of the table for communal sharing .
Now , it is usually served in individual pots ( the fojòt , a type of fondue pot traditionally made of terra cotta ) .

A YEAR after winning America 's presidential election , Barack Obama and the Democrats have suffered two big defeats in governors races in Virginia and New Jersey .
Last year Mr Obama won in Virginia in a particularly sweet moment for his party .
This time the Republican , Bob McDonnell , trounced the Democrat , Creigh Deeds , by 59 % to 41 % .
In northern corners of the state , which form part of Washington 's suburbs and are vital to Democratic chances in statewide contests , the Republican did even better in some places , winning Loudoun county by 61 % to 39 % for example .
In the much deeper - blue state of New Jersey , the loss was narrower for the Democrats .
Chris Christie , the Republican , won with 49 % of the vote , defeating Jon Corzine , the incumbent governor , who picked up around 45 % .
There were also various mayoral contests on Tuesday November 3rd .
In New York Michael Bloomberg won a third term , but by a much narrower margin of victory than had been expected .
Mary Norwood led the field in Atlanta but faces a run-off on December 1st , which if she wins will make her the first female white mayor in the historically black city .
And in Houston Annise Parker picked up 31 % of the vote and faces Gene Locke in a run-off on December 12th , which if Ms Parker wins would make her the first openly gay person to be elected to the mayor 's office in Texas 's largest city .
The biggest drama of the night came from upstate New York where the Democrats won a special election to fill a vacancy in a congressional district .
The election , in a Republican stronghold , attracted attention because of the intervention of national conservative figures , such as Sarah Palin , who urged party members to reject the official Republican candidate , whom they described as too moderate , and instead support a candidate from a rival Conservative party .
The Republican candidate pulled out of the race on October 31st and then backed the Democrat , Bill Owens , who was declared the victor on Tuesday .
The significance , if any , of these off - year elections will now be debated .
The Republican wins will boost party morale and make Mr Obama seem a little bit more mortal .
Mr Obama 's supporters point out that the governors elections were flavoured by distinctly local issues .
Yet in Virginia exit polls indicated that almost a quarter of respondents said they had used their vote to register disapproval with the president ( 18 % voted to express support for Mr Obama ) .
The races clearly show an electoral limit to Mr Obama 's star appeal .
The Democratic loss in Virginia had been predicted for weeks , if not months .
But in New Jersey the race had tightened considerably and Mr Obama attended two rallies for Mr Corzine over the weekend in an attempt to enthuse the Democratic faithful .
His efforts came to naught .
Two broad points have emerged from this election night .
The first is that the Democrats are now considered to own the economy — trying to blame George Bush for the country 's economic ills , as Mr Obama tried to do in New Jersey , will not wash with swing voters .
In Virginia , moderates and independents warmed to Mr McDonnell 's themes of reduced taxes .
The economy will doubtlessly improve before next year 's mid-term elections , but Mr Obama 's ambitions for government spending trouble many centrists .
The other point is that Sarah Palin 's broadside against the Republican candidate in upstate New York has established her beyond doubt as the leading player in Republican politics , much to the chagrin of party grandees .
There is nothing new about conservative insurrection in the party .
The contest in New York is somewhat reminiscent of Pat Buchanan 's rebellion against the party establishment in the New Hampshire primary in 1992 , except that conservatives have ditched their pitchforks for iPhones .
But the danger for the Republicans remains the same now as then ; the pursuit of an ideologically pure conservatism will turn away moderates and independents .
The Republicans lost the 1992 presidential election , and they lost the 23rd congressional district in upstate New York on Tuesday .
It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words , and similarly many reversers would agree that a graph is worth a thousand lists ! 😉
Recently , we added graphing support into IDAPython and now Python scripts can build interactive graphs .
To demonstrate this new addition , we will write a small script that graphs the structured exception handlers of a given process .
Writing the script
The steps needed to write the script :
For each thread in the process : Retrieve the linear address of FS : [ 0 ]
Walk the exception registration record list and save the handler Build the graph : Allocate one node for each unique exception handler address
Add edges between the last exception handler and the current exception handler ( so to create the chain visually )
Display the graph
Walking the exception registration records
In Win32 , a new SEH is installed by filling an EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD entry and linking it to the SEH chain ( at FS : [ 0 ] ) .
typedef struct _EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD
{ struct _EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD
* Prev ; PEXCEPTION_HANDLER
Handler ; } EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD
;
Before walking the exception registration records , we need to get the base address of the FS selector .
Fortunately , each debugger module provides a special callback in its debugger_t structure :
// Get information about the base of a segment register // tid - thread id // sreg_value - value of the segment register // answer - pointer to the answer .
ca n't be NULL .
// 1 - ok , 0 - failed , - 1 - network error int ( idaapi * thread_get_sreg_base ) ( thid_t tid , int sreg_value , ea_t * answer ) ;
To use this callback , we will pass the FS selector value :
def GetFsBase ( tid ) : idc.SelectThread( tid ) return idaapi.dbg_get_thread_sreg_base( tid , cpu.fs )
or in C :
ea_t fs_base ; dbg->thread_get_sreg_base( tid , fs_sel_value , &fs_base ) ;
Now that we have the base , we can compute the linear address of the exception registration record list head by adding the base ( fs_base ) to the offset ( which happens to be zero ) , thus : fs_base + 0
With this knowledge , we can write a small loop to walk this list and extract the handlers :
def GetExceptionChain ( tid ) : fs_base = GetFsBase ( tid ) exc_rr = Dword ( fs_base ) result = [ ] while exc_rr != 0 xffffffff : prev = Dword ( exc_rr ) handler = Dword ( exc_rr + 4 ) exc_rr = prev result.append ( handler ) return result
We do that for each thread :
# Iterate through all function instructions and take only call instructions result = {} for tid in idautils .
Threads ( ) : result [ tid ] = GetExceptionChain ( tid )
Building the graph
Building the graph is even simpler and can be done by subclassing the GraphViewer class and implementing the OnRefresh ( ) and OnGetText ( ) events .
Here ’s the simplified version of the graph building loop :
def OnRefresh ( self ) : self .
Clear ( ) # clear previous nodes addr_id = {} for ( tid , chain ) in self.result.items ( ) : #
Add the thread node id_parent = self .
AddNode ( " Thread % X " % tid ) #
Add each handler for handler in chain : #
Get the node id given the handler address #
We use an addr -> id dictionary # so that similar addresses get similar node id if not addr_id.
has_key ( handler ) : id = self .
AddNode ( hex ( handler ) ) addr_id [ handler ] = id # add this ID else : id = addr_id [ handler ] #
Link handlers to each other self .
AddEdge( id_parent , id ) #
Now the parent node is this handler id_parent = id return True
Putting it all together
The script will display the thread nodes and the handlers in different colors .
Double clicking on a handler node will jump to it in an IDA - View and double clicking on a thread node will display the exception handlers in the message window .
Here are some SEH graphs :
IDA / Graphical version ( idag.exe ) :
Visual Studio 2008 ( devenv.exe ) :
Please download the script from here ( you need IDAPython r242 and above ) .
All comments and suggestions are welcome .
You are also encouraged to share screenshots of interesting SEH graphs you run into .

If you ’ve traded that six - pack for a pony keg , if you ’re now coming equipped with your own spare tire , if 32 is a number that more closely resembles your BMI than your waist , you must shut the hell up .
She ’s noticed your decline .
And she ’s decided to accept it , because she loves you ( presumably ) .
Because she is a woman , and women — those lovely , forgiving creatures — are not as shallow and juvenile as us men .
Lucky for you , Blimpy .
Consider these sobering facts :
Children exposed to both tobacco smoke and lead are 800 percent more likely to develop ADHD .
Childhood exposure to lead can cause permanent brain damage to those genetically susceptible .
No region of the brain is spared .
Adults with an average age of 21 who had been enrolled as infants in the Cincinnati Lead Study had IQ deficiencies as well as histories of juvenile delinquency and criminal arrests .
Baby boys whose mothers used insect repellants in the first three months of pregnancy were at an increased risk of a birth defect called hypospadias ( the urethra , which carries urine from the bladder to the opening of the penis , is shortened ) .
A study of pregnant women by the Washington Toxics Coalition learned that : Every woman tested had been exposed to Bisphenol A ( BPA ) , which is linked to a number of adverse health effects .
BPA has been found in the lining of nearly every kind of food container , baby bottles , dental sealants and composite fillings , among other products .
Every woman tested had been exposed to at least two — and in some cases , to as many as four — perfluorinated chemicals .
Known as Teflon chemicals , these are used in manufacturing nonstick cookware .
Every woman had been exposed to mercury , which is known to harm the development of the brain in the unborn .
Every woman had been exposed to at least four phthalates , which are linked to adverse health effects .
Phthalates are used to make fragrances last longer and also to soften plastic in personal - care products , shower curtains , baby toys , etc .
The Seattle Post Globe published a story about one mother who took part in the Washington Toxics Coalition study .
Trained as a midwife , while pregnant she walked a 3 - mile trail twice a week , swam weekly , took prenatal yoga classes , tried to eat mostly organic foods and avoided any scented lotions or other personal - care products .
And yet , she rated the worst among the women tested for Teflon chemicals .
An advocate of breast - feeding , she now worries that while breast - feeding to insure optimal nutrition for her infant son , she will pass chemicals along to him in her breast milk as she did , unwittingly , through her placenta .
Johns Hopkins University ’s study of cord blood samples from 20 newborns revealed hundreds of chemicals , this from cord blood most of us would expect to be uncontaminated .
With only about 200 of the 80,000 chemicals in our environment having been tested for their effects on humans , the American population is unknowingly taking part in an experiment .
Dr. Phil Landrigan of Mt. Sinai School of Medicine has warned the medical community that 1 in 6 American children is now behavior - or learning - disabled because of exposure to chemicals .
To add to this gloomy picture , studies have shown that genes are turned on or off by environmental factors , so future generations will also be impacted .
All children deserve the best protection we can provide , but the government is failing to shield our most vulnerable population — the unborn — from chemicals in the environment .
About five years ago , Professor Janet Sawicki at the Lankenau Institute in Pennsylvania read an article about nanoparticles developed by MIT ’s Daniel Anderson and Robert Langer for gene therapy , the insertion of genes into living cells for the treatment of disease .
Sawicki was working on treating ovarian cancer by delivering — through viruses — the gene for the diphtheria toxin , which kills tumor cells .
“ I had been working with adenoviruses to deliver DNA , and I was running into some problems with using them , ” says Sawicki .
“ The problem with viruses is that they can produce a serious immune response in the host , which can be lethal . ”
After reading about the nanoparticles , Sawicki contacted Anderson and Langer , an MIT Institute Professor and chemical engineer , to inquire about launching a gene therapy project with the nanoparticles .
“ I thought they would be perfect for what I was trying to do , ” she recalls .
The resulting collaboration has led to a promising potential treatment for ovarian cancer , one of the deadliest forms of cancer .
This summer , the two laboratories reported that the nanoparticle - delivered gene therapy successfully suppressed ovarian tumor growth in mice .
The nanoparticles , made of biodegradable polymers , offer a chance to overcome one of the biggest obstacles to realizing the promise of gene therapy :
The viruses often used to carry genes into the body can endanger patients .
Furthermore , the particles created at MIT now rival viruses ’ efficiency at delivering their DNA payload .
More tests are needed to confirm the particles ’ safety in humans , but because they are synthetic , there is less chance that they will provoke a harmful immune response , says Anderson , a biomedical engineer at the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research .
An artificial virus
There are nearly 1,000 clinical trials under way in the United States involving gene therapy , for diseases including cancer , cardiovascular disease and neurological disorders .
However , no gene therapy treatments have been approved in the United States .
Viruses , the most commonly used gene - delivery vehicle , are a logical choice , since viruses are built to inject their own genetic material into host cells .
However , serious clinical side effects , including the 1999 death of a high school student enrolled in a gene therapy trial at the University of Pennsylvania , have motivated some researchers to develop fully synthetic non-viral carriers .
Anderson started the nanoparticle project in Langer ’s lab about 10 years ago , shortly after finishing his PhD in bacterial DNA repair .
Though Anderson found his thesis topic “ scientifically interesting , it did n’t have a sense of immediate impact for me .
I wanted to see if I could get closer to medicine . ”
Anderson and chemist David Lynn , then a postdoctoral fellow in Langer ’s lab and now a professor at the University of Wisconsin , developed a large collection of different biodegradable polymers ( large molecules composed of repeating subunits ) known as poly ( beta- amino esters ) .
When these synthetic polymers are mixed with DNA , they spontaneously assemble to form nanoparticles .
These nanoparticles can travel through the body to the target cells , where they are taken up by a process known as endocytosis , the equivalent of cellular eating .
Once “ eaten ” by the cells , the nanoparticles release their DNA payload inside of the cell , where it can then be activated by the cellular machinery .
In some ways , these polymer - DNA nanoparticles can act like an artificial virus , delivering functional DNA when injected into or near the targeted tissue .
There are infinite possible sequences for such polymers , and small variations can make a polymer more or less efficient at delivering DNA .
Anderson and Langer 's group have developed a way to automate both the production of vast numbers of particles with slight variations and the screening techniques used to determine the particles ’ effectiveness .
“ Instead of trying to make one perfect polymer , we make thousands , ” says Anderson .
That increases the odds that the researchers will hit on a nanoparticle that does what they want .
“ If you can try one or two things every six months , it might take a while to find something that works .
But if you can try tens of thousands of things , your chances of success are much greater , and that ’s true for any venue , ” says Langer .
Improving efficiency
One drawback to non-viral vectors is that they are not as efficient as viruses at integrating their DNA payload into the target cell ’s genome , says Leaf Huang , professor in the School of Pharmacy at the University of North Carolina .
However , in the past several years , advances by Anderson and others have improved that efficiency by several orders of magnitude .
“ Non-viral vectors are now comparable to viral vectors , in some cases , ” says Huang , whose research focuses on delivering genes surrounded by a fatty membrane .
“ They have come a long way compared to 10 years ago . ”
Both viral and non-viral methods could eventually prove useful and safe , says gene therapy researcher Katherine High , who is part of a team that recently used viral gene therapy to restore some sight to children suffering from a congenital retinal disease .
“ It ’s been a slow road , ” says High , a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School , but over the past 20 years scientists have made much progress in managing the safety issues posed by viral vectors .
The ovarian cancer treatment developed at MIT and the Lankenau Institute has been successful in animal studies but is not yet ready for clinical trials .
Such trials could get under way in a year or two , says Anderson , where their performance would be studied for several years .
Meanwhile , the MIT researchers are exploring other uses for their nanoparticles .
Last month , they reported using the particles to boost stem cells ’ ability to regenerate vascular tissue ( such as blood vessels ) by equipping them with genes that produce extra growth factors .
“ We ’ve had success with gene delivery using these nanoparticles , so we thought they might be a safer , temporary way to modify stem cells , ” says Anderson .

Construction takes place on a 32 - metre high statue of the late Chairman Mao Zedong in his youth , in Changsha , central China 's Hunan province on November 3 , 2009 .
China recently marked the 115th anniversary of the birth of revolutionary Mao Zedong , commemorating the ' Great Helmsman ' , who founded the People 's Republic in 1949 and served as China 's leader until his death in 1976 .

Our real enemy is not the ones living in a distant land ,
they are right here in front of us .
Racism is their weapon
“ Our real enemy is not the ones living in a distant land whose names or policies we do n’t understand ;
The real enemy is a system that wages war when it ’s profitable , the CEOs who lay us off our jobs when it ’s profitable , the Insurance Companies who deny us Health care when it ’s profitable , the Banks who take away our homes when it ’s profitable .
Our enemies are not several hundred thousands away .
They are right here in front of us . ”
How do the the rulers get away with it ?
This soldier is clear :
“ Racism is a vital weapon employed by this government .
It is a more important weapon than a rifle , a tank , a bomber or a battleship . ”
“ They need a public who ’s willing to send soldiers into harm ’s way , they need soldiers willing to kill and be killed without question .
They can spend millions on a single bomb , but that bomb only becomes a weapon when the ranks in the military are willing to follow orders to use it . ”
“ And the ruling class , the billionaires who profit from human suffering , who care only about expanding their wealth and controlling the world economy , understand that their power lies only in their ability to convince us that war , oppression , and exploitation are in our interest .
They understand that their wealth is dependent on their ability to convince the working class to die to control the market of another country .
And convincing us to kill and die is based on their ability to make us think that we are somehow superior .
“ Poor and working people in this country are sent to kill poor and working people in another country , to make the rich richer .
Without racism , soldiers would realize they have more in common with the Iraqi people than they do with the billionaires that send us to war .
..
Our enemies are right here at home , and if we organize and fight with our sisters and brothers we can stop this war , we can stop this government , and we can create a better world . “
Mike Prysner is from IVAW , Iraq Veterans Against the War .
This speech was from Winter Soldier in March 22 , 2008 .
You can view his entire testimony here , which spells out the role of racism , and how , under a veneer of anti-racsm , the army and and civilian society are now pushing an onslaught of racism which is both homicidal and suicidal .

" Ah I remember the days when Dad used to take me down to Kit Kat crescent ... "
It does n't especially have a nostaligic feel does it ?
Our earliest memories of football should be imbued with a sense of innocence and tradition - a feeling that you are somewhere hallowed , even if you are standing in the cold screaming at a team destined for mediocrity .
It seems though that with the growing commercialisation of football such wholesome recollections are slowly going to be eroded .
No longer will we will be able to attribute our football - based feelings of triumph or despair to recognisable places and names .
Increasingly promotions , cup giant killings or derby day victories wo n't be played out at a football club 's spiritual and traditional home - they will be played out at stadia named after confectionary .
Although the commercialisation of football is not exactly a new phenomenon , the level it has reached recently is worrying for football fans and neutrals alike .
It is not uncommon for teams to cash in by selling the naming rights to their stadiums , but recession and simple greed have caused an untimely acceleration in football 's sprint toward utter dominance by commercial interests .
Any hopes that football could hold on to the last vestiges of dignity , that it could eschew the principles of big business in favour of a respect for history are being systematically destroyed .
York City changed the name of their homely Bootham Crescent stadium in 2005 to the gaudy Kit Kat Crescent , after a sponsorship deal with Nestle .
The ethical concerns of doing business with such a company are myriad in themselves , but should the club have changed the name ?
They will answer that they need to make revenue from any available source and sadly they will be backed by every chairman , or executive at every club throughout Britain .
Even Chelsea Chief executive Ron Gourlay announced last week that the club were considering selling the naming rights to Stamford Bridge , and Chelsea do n't exactly have a reputation for being short on cash .
Although Mr Gourlay qualified his decision by stating that : " retaining the ground 's heritage is paramount " it is a move symptomatic of the state of football today .
It is different for clubs that urgently need funds to stay afloat .
Given their dire financal situation perhaps Mike Ashley can be partially excused for changing the name of St James Park to the laughable sportdirect@St James Park stadium ( a decision satirised by George Caulkin , of The Times , on November 5 ) .
He is certainly ending a tradition that will be missed but perhaps if these tough decisions are n't taken Newcastle United may not exist at all and then the whole debate becomes immaterial .
Chelsea , on the other hand , have no excuse .
As one of the wealthiest clubs in world football they have no need to subject their fans to the ignominy of buying tickets to go to the Cillit Bang Stadium or Pot Noodle Bridge .
Their actions are symbolic of a total disregard for the fans that generate the clubs income in the first place and their flirtation with naming rights shows the " Total War " philospophy of modern football .
Each and every club is now scrapping to find any slight advantage over their rivals , any dirty trivial way to make an extra few pounds .
What 's next ?
Will Chelsea , after deciding to play their home games at The Hollywood Bowl Alley , sell the names of their stands ?
Will the most vocal supporters be found in the Tennants Lager Terrace rather than the Matthew Harding stand ?
There 's no point stopping there , why not sell the rights to the colours that Chelsea wear - I 'm sure Fulham fans would chip in if it meant their West London rivals had to a violet home strip .
Although far fetched , these hypotheticals serve to make my point - how many things do you sell or sacrifice before Chelsea is no longer Chelsea ?
It is difficult enough to explain the intagible relationship between club and fan .
Apart from hereditary links , what real affection can you hold for a institution that has a football team .
In the age of spoilt , millionaire players it is getting harder and harder as it is .
If the last real connections that the fans have to their clubs are eradicated then they become dead , unemotive ciphers bereft of any attachement .
The way in which football continues to sell it 's soul suggests that this reality is closer than we could ever envisage .
Time to unravel some tufts of the yak hair lying around from this weekend .
I wanted to work on making my GTD application ( using CouchDB ) a little more friendly .
I started out by learning GreaseMonkey so I could modify Trac pages to include a link converting the ticket into a thing in my application .
The basics of that were easy , but I need to learn a bunch more Javascript before it will actually work well .
So , I switched to finally figuring out if desktopcouch might be a good solution for the general problem for users to set up a couchdb database .
desktopcouch ’s tagline describes it nicely ‘ A CouchDB for every desktop . ’
From what I can tell , it has :
a way to automatically start a per-user couchdb instance
oauth enabled by default for it , so only you can get to it
some gnomekeyring integration
a pairing tool that makes it easy to pair with other desktopcouch instances on your network
a python module on top of python - couchdb that layers a ‘ record ’ concept over CouchDB documents using record_type and record_revision keys
some pre-defined record types for notes , contacts , and bookmarks
possible integration with the UbuntuOne service
At this point I do n’t know how intertwined this record concept is with the rest of desktopcouch .
As at the moment I want to use desktopcouch simply as a reliable way to get a secure , per-user , replicated couchdb database , I ’d prefer to not deal with records at all at this point .
In the process of getting acquainted with desktopcouch and packaging it for Fedora , I ran into a few little niggles :
First off , bdist_rpm did n’t work for desktopcouch because of the man pages being compressed .
My first run failed .
Furthermore , the unhandled exception left my $ HOME /. local / share / desktopcouch in a half - done state ; I ran it again , and it worked , but it did n’t generate a couchdb. html as it should have because of this .
Some rpmlint warnings
As for the package , if you ’re on Fedora 11 , just install tao - release for F - 11 i386 then type ‘ yum -y install desktopcouch ’
After that , you can start it by asking it for what port is running :
dbus - send -- session --dest=org.desktopcouch.CouchDB
-- print - reply --type=method_call / org.desktopcouch.CouchDB.getPort
If all goes well that should come back with a number .
You can now access your desktopcouch through Futon with :
firefox $ HOME/.local/share/desktop-couch/couchdb.html
Let me know if this worked for you or not !
I have a separate post about packaging ubuntuone stuff , which was much more complicated – and I ’m still not sure if I will be able to use it as an online server for my couchdb app .
Now , for some questions to you desktopcouch - savvy people out there :
Looking at the generated couchdb.html , I see that I can now access the user - specific couchdb with a generated username and password .
If I want to push my GTD app to this couchdb , I can do so using this username and password .
So , obvious questions : a ) should I push with couchapp this way to get my app in desktopcouch ? b ) is there a better way to get this username / password ?
I assume desktopcouch does this in the python modules using gnome - keyring c ) is it an intended mode of operation to be able to push my app into the user couchdb ?
I am working on the web interface part served by couchdb and I want it to be one of the ways in which to access the data .
Is it possible to pair with a different user on the same machine ?
I was on a laptop with no other linux computer around , so I was not able to test the pairing .
I did set it up for a different user , but neither account seemed to see the other ’s couchdb running .
Will I be able to sync non-record databases to ubuntuone ?
If not , what else could I do to have an online couchdb to sync between my various work machines ?
Time to unravel some tufts of the yak hair lying around from this weekend .
I wanted to work on making my GTD application ( using CouchDB ) a little more friendly .

A Los Angeles doctor has allegedly found a creative way to speed up his workflow .
Levon Tebelekian , 72 , is accused of giving medical clearance to immigrants applying for U.S. visas by allegedly falsifying the results of medical exams and lab tests , the Los Angeles Times reported .
In one case , he allegedly told an undercover ICE agent that he was not going to " disturb his blood " and that he " did not look like he had AIDS , " according to an affidavit .
Authorities are unsure how many other patients were victims of the alleged scam and may have received one of these apparent visual AIDS tests .
" Aspiring immigrants are required to undergo a medical exam as part of the application process to ensure they do n't have any medical conditions or diseases that might pose a public health threat , " Miguel Unzueta , of ICE in Los Angeles , told the Associated Press .
" By allegedly giving some of his patients a clean bill of health without even examining them , this physician potentially put our communities at risk , " Unzueta said .
If convicted , Tebelekian could face up to 80 years in prison , the San Jose Mercury News reported .
Labour ' deliberately let migrants in to make Britain more multicultural and so Tories could be accused of racism '
Ministers today faced calls for an inquiry into claims that their open - door immigration policy was designed to make Britain more multicultural and allow Labour to portray the Tories as racists .
A former Labour adviser alleged that the Government opened up Britain 's borders in part to try to humiliate Right - wing opponents of immigration .
The Conservatives said that if true , the claim demonstrated ' disgracefully irresponsible ' decision - making and called for an investigation .
Estimates say the population of the UK could reach 70 million in 20 years
Former Labour minister Frank Field said : ' I am speechless at the idea that people thought they could socially engineer a nation on this basis . '
The Daily Mail reported on Saturday the controversial claims by Andrew Neather , who worked for Tony Blair and Jack Straw .
He said Labour 's relaxation of immigration controls in 2000 was a deliberate attempt to engineer a ' truly multicultural ' country and plug gaps in the jobs market .
He said the ' major shift ' in immigration policy was inspired by a 2001 policy paper from the Performance and Innovation Unit , a Downing Street think - tank based in the Cabinet Office .
Civil servant Jonathan Portes , who wrote the immigration report , was a speechwriter for Gordon Brown and is now an aide to Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell .
The report painted a rosy picture of mass immigration , stating : ' There is little evidence that native workers are harmed by migration .
The broader fiscal impact is likely to be positive because a greater proportion of migrants are of working age and migrants have higher average wages than natives . '
It added : ' Most British regard immigration as having a positive effect on British culture . '
Mr Neather said the published version of the report focused on the labour market case for immigration .
But he added : ' Earlier drafts I saw also included a driving political purpose : that mass immigration was the way that the Government was going to make the UK truly multicultural .'
Home Office Minister Barbara Roche , who pioneered the open - door policy , was also said to have wanted to restore her reputation on the Left of the Labour Party .
She had come under fire for attacking the use of children for begging by asylum seekers as ' vile ' .
Ministers were reluctant to discuss the move publicly for fear that it would alienate Labour 's core working - class vote , Mr Neather said .
But they hoped it would allow them to paint the Conservatives as xenophobic and out of touch .
' I remember coming away from some discussions with the clear sense that the policy was intended - even if this was n't its main purpose - to rub the Right 's nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date , ' Mr Neather added .
Labour strategists went on to attack Tory leaders William Hague , Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard as out of touch when they raised questions about immigration policy .
Mr Hague was accused of ' playing the race card ' in 2001 when he said Mr Blair was turning Britain into a ' foreign land ' .
Mr Howard was called a ' racist ' in 2004 after he went to the BNP stronghold of Burnley to denounce Labour 's stance on asylum seekers .
Mr Neather defended the open - door policy , saying mass immigration had ' enriched ' Britain .
But Tory immigration spokesman Damian Green said : ' If this is true , then it would be a disgracefully irresponsible way for a government to run their immigration policy .
' To organise it on the basis of what might embarrass the Opposition would be shameful .
I would urge the Home Affairs Select Committee to look at this whole episode .
' And ministers must now be honest with the British people .
Do they still believe , as they did five years ago , that uncontrolled immigration is good for the country ?
' If they do n't , will they apologise for the mess they have made of the immigration system in the meantime ? '
Jack Straw last night dismissed Mr Neather 's claims as untrue .
A spokesman for the Justice Secretary said : ' This is complete rubbish and the proof of that is the fact that Jack Straw introduced and was implementing the Immigration and Asylum Act at just this time , which tightened up controls and for which he was roundly condemned by all liberals . '
However , Labour 's former welfare minister Mr Field , co-chairman of the cross-party Group for Balanced Migration , said a ' beam of truth ' had been shone on the immigration issue .
' It is so dangerous that I cannot believe anybody even contemplated this course of action , ' he said .
' I can't believe anybody could have been this stupid .
All along anyone who raised questions was told they must be racist .
' Ministers used studies like the one saying only 13,000 people would come from the EU accession countries to say we had all got our figures wrong .
' Even now people are peddling the idea that it 's all over - exaggerated .
The truth is that , without any changes , we are headed for a population of 70 million within 20 years . '
A Home Office spokesman said : ' Our new flexible points - based system gives us greater control of those coming to work or study from outside Europe , ensuring that only those that Britain needs can come .
' Britain 's borders are stronger than ever before and we are rolling out ID cards for foreign nationals .
' We have introduced civil penalties for those employing illegal workers and from the end of next year our electronic border system will monitor 95 per cent of journeys in and out of the UK .
' The British people can be confident that immigration is under control . '

( PhysOrg.com ) --
A global collaborative has produced a first draft of the genome of a domesticated pig , an achievement that will lead to insights in agriculture , medicine , conservation and evolution .
A red-haired Duroc pig from a farm at the University of Illinois will now be among the growing list of domesticated animals that have had their genomes sequenced .
Researchers will announce the achievement Monday ( Nov. 2 ) at a meeting at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton , England .
" The pig is a unique animal that is important for food and that is used as an animal model for human disease , " said Larry Schook , a University of Illinois professor of biomedical sciences and leader of the sequencing project .
" And because the native wild animals are still in existence , it is a really exciting animal to look at to learn about the genomic effects of domestication , " he said .
The Duroc is one of five major breeds used in pork production around the world and is one of about 200 breeds of domesticated pigs .
There are also numerous varieties of wild boar , the non-domesticated pigs that are believed to have originated in Eurasia .
The sequencing project involved an international team of scientists and genome - sequencing centers .
The USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture , formerly the Cooperative State Research , Education and Extension Service , provided $ 10 million in initial funding , requiring that this be the only pig genome - sequencing project in the world , that it be a public - private partnership and a global collaborative effort , with significant financial or in - kind support from the other participating agencies and stakeholders .
The effort cost about $ 24.3 million , with additional support from the USDA Agricultural Research Service and many other American , Asian and European funders .
Another requirement of participation was that the findings be made public , with no proprietary interests allowed .
The draft sequence , which is about 98 percent complete , will allow researchers to pinpoint genes that are useful to pork production or are involved in immunity or other important physiological processes in the pig .
It will enhance breeding practices , offer insight into diseases that afflict pigs ( and , sometimes , also humans ) and will assist in efforts to preserve the global heritage of rare , endangered and wild pigs .
It also will be important for the study of human health because pigs are very similar to humans in their physiology , behavior and nutritional needs .
" We are excited to have the swine genome sequence and anticipate this will accelerate the rate of genetic improvement in swine as the bovine sequence is impacting the dairy industry 's genetic gains , " said Steve Kappes , deputy administrator of Animal Production and Protection for the USDA Agricultural Research Service .
" This is a great day for the pig research community , " said professor Alan Archibald , of the Roslin Institute and R( D ) SVS at the University of Edinburgh .
" When we launched the international pig gene mapping project almost 20 years ago , few if any of us thought a pig genome sequence was attainable or affordable . "
The pig genome sequence is an essential first tool that will allow scientists to delve into the health , science and natural history of the pig , Schook said .
" This is just the end of the beginning of the process , " he said .
" Now we 're just beginning to be able to answer a lot of questions about the pig . "
" We are delighted to have contributed to this important collaboration , " said professor Allan Bradley , the director of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute , which performed most of the sequencing .
" This sequence provides a tool of real value in helping the research community to better understand human diseases , in particular by facilitating cardiovascular , pulmonary , gastrointestinal and immunological studies .
Thanks to the immediate release of sequence data as it has been produced , the scientific impact of this research is already being felt . "
" This is an exciting scientific breakthrough that can lead to new research applications and innovations at many points in the pork chain and one that the Pork Checkoff is proud to help fund , " said Everett Forkner , a pork producer from Missouri and member of the National Pork Board 's animal science committee .

Bankruptcy , mortgage default , and foreclosure
Michelle White , Wenli Li
Did US bankruptcy laws exacerbate the housing crisis ?
This column says that a 2005 reform that made declaring personal bankruptcy more difficult increased mortgage defaults and home foreclosures .
It recommends reversing that legislation to reduce the number of foreclosures , which have high social costs .
The financial crisis of 2008 and the current recession were triggered by the bursting of the housing bubble and the subprime mortgage crisis that began in late 2006 / early 2007 ( Reinhart 2008 ) .
But US personal bankruptcy law also played an important role .
In 2005 , major reform of US bankruptcy law sharply increased debtors ’ cost of filing for bankruptcy .
This caused a sharp reduction in the number of filings .
Because credit card debts and other types of unsecured debt are discharged in bankruptcy , filing for bankruptcy loosens homeowners ’ budget constraints and makes paying the mortgage easier .
Thus the 2005 reform set the stage for an increase in mortgage defaults by making bankruptcy less readily available .
We estimate that the reform caused about 800,000 additional mortgage defaults and 250,000 additional foreclosures to occur in each of the past several years – thus contributing to the severity of the financial crisis ( Li , White , and Zhu 2009 ; Li and White 2009 ) .
But over longer periods , bankruptcy filings and mortgage defaults are positively rather than negatively related .
To show this relationship , we use a large sample of first - lien mortgages that originated in 2004 and 2005 and are followed each month .
Figure 1 shows homeowners ’ cumulative probability of defaulting on their mortgages , conditional on filing for bankruptcy .
More than 90 % of homeowners with subprime mortgages and nearly 80 % of homeowners with prime mortgages who file for bankruptcy also default on their mortgages .
Most often , default occurs first and bankruptcy second .
The reverse relationship ( not shown ) is similar although less strong : 9 % of homeowners with subprime mortgages and 6.5 % of homeowners with prime mortgages who default also file for bankruptcy .
Figure 2 shows homeowners ’ cumulative probability of filing for bankruptcy , conditional on lenders starting foreclosure .
More than 70 % of homeowners with subprime mortgages and nearly 20 % of homeowners with prime mortgages who are subject to foreclosure file for bankruptcy .
Figure 1 . Cumulative probability of mortgage default by homeowners who file for bankruptcy
Figure 2 . Cumulative probability of foreclosure for homeowners who file for bankruptcy
We also estimate hazard models explaining homeowners ’ decisions to file for bankruptcy following default , controlling for homeowner and property characteristics and local economic conditions .
We find that when homeowners default , their probability of filing for bankruptcy over the next several months increases 14 - to 16 - fold , depending on whether they have prime or subprime mortgages .
When lenders start foreclosure , homeowners ’ probability of filing for bankruptcy increases around 25 - fold , regardless of whether they have prime or subprime mortgages .
Why are homeowners ’ decisions to default and to file for bankruptcy so closely related ?
One reason is that increases ( decreases ) in income levels increase ( decrease ) homeowners ’ ability to pay both their mortgages and their unsecured debts .
Similarly , increases ( decreases ) in homeowners ’ total debt levels decrease ( increase ) their ability to pay both their mortgages and unsecured debts .
In addition , default and bankruptcy are positively related because filing for bankruptcy helps homeowners in financial distress .
Homeowners who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments and wish to save their homes gain from filing for bankruptcy , because filing delays foreclosure and gives homeowners more time to repay .
Filing for bankruptcy also helps homeowners because bankruptcy trustees may challenge excessive fees and penalties that mortgage lenders frequently impose and bankruptcy judges sometimes discharge second mortgages if they are underwater .
Homeowners who do not wish to save their homes also benefit from filing for bankruptcy , because the delay in foreclosure allows them to stay in their homes cost - free for several months during the bankruptcy proceeding .
Deficiency judgments – claims on ex-homeowners to pay the difference between the mortgage and the sale price of the home in foreclosure – are also discharged in bankruptcy .
All of these factors suggest that homeowners who default on their mortgages also gain from filing for bankruptcy .
Policy implications
These relationships have important public policy implications .
Foreclosures have very high social costs , many of which are not borne by either borrowers or lenders .
The external costs of foreclosure instead fall residents of neighbourhoods that become blighted because of foreclosures and on residents of towns and cities that are forced to cut public services because foreclosures caused property values and property tax revenues to fall .
There is an efficiency gain from using bankruptcy policy to discourage defaults and foreclosures .
In particular , the 2005 bankruptcy reform should be at least partially reversed , since lowering the cost of filing for bankruptcy will encourage more homeowners to file and therefore reduce foreclosures .
And foreclosure laws should be changed to make the foreclosure process longer and more expensive for lenders – this will encourage them to modify mortgages rather than foreclosing .
In addition , reforms such as the credit card legislation recently adopted by the US Congress will affect both bankruptcy and default .
The new legislation , which prevents credit card lenders from raising interest rates on existing loans , is likely to reduce the cost and availability of credit card loans and therefore will also reduce both mortgage defaults and foreclosures .

Stalker , 40 - year old John McFarlane , has been jailed for life shooting and killing Mary Griffiths , 38 - year old fitness instructor and mother of three daughters , on May 6th with a bolt gun ( cattle gun ) in front of her young daughters aged 10 and 13 years old .
McFarlane will be in jail for at least 20 years .
McFarlane and Griffiths had met through their shared love of martial arts , particularly body combat .
They progressed from being students to part - time instructors .
Sometime during that time he got obsessed with Griffiths .
McFarlane left his wife in April and became increasingly obsessed with Ms Griffiths .
He posted a message on Facebook falsely claiming that they were having an affair .
In reply Ms Griffiths wrote : “ You are delusional if you think I would touch you with a barge pole .
Stop stalking me or I will call the police . ”
Source : www.timesonline.co.uk
On May 5th both of them argued and Griffiths ended up calling the cops complaining that he was stalking her and expressed fears for her safety .
That night McFarlane carefully planned to take revenge on her .
At around 6 pm she called her local police station for advice .
She was due to be seen by officers than night , but the meeting was rescheduled for the following day .
After midnight , McFarlane wrote on his Facebook page : “ They say there ’s nothing worse than a woman scorned , well watch this space .
“ If someone rips out your heart and stamps on it then they deserve the same . ”
The Old Bailey heard that McFarlane carefully planned the murder by diverting armed police to his false report of a burglary at a rifle shed at the farm where he worked as a slaughterman and watched them leave the station before heading to her home in Bury St Edmunds , Suffolk .
At 2.45 am on May 6 he smashed his way into the victim ’s £ 250,000 house with an axe .
He cut the electricity , ran upstairs and dragged Miss Griffiths from her bed where she was sleeping with her 10 - year - old daughter .
A second daughter , 13 - year - old , sleeping in a neighbouring room was woken and both girls tried to fight off McFarlane as their mother screamed for help .
McFarlane threw Miss Griffiths down the stairs and all four ended up outside .
Having beaten away the children he shot the mother twice in the chest and once in the shoulder with the bolt gun , in what one witness described as “ an execution ” .
In a text message sent to a colleague at the farm before the killing , McFarlane wrote : “ Yes JB ( McFarlane ) is off on a revenge mission to teach people a lesson who stamp on your heart .
“ I will spare the mother , not the beautiful girls .
They like me will die .
“ Hasta la vista baby . ”
He followed it with another message to a friend saying : “ This is what rejection does , it ***** you up .
All I needed was a cuddle and to be loved . ”
Source : www.telegraph.co.uk
Griffith ’s 13 - year - old daughter shouted : “ Do n’t do it , stop it , ” as McFarlane shot her mother with a bolt gun used to stun livestock .
The killer was found later lying in a back garden having cut his arms in an apparent suicide attempt .
McFarlane is definitely a psycho and should have been locked up earlier .
If the police would have acted earlier , they might have discouraged him from going on with the revenge .
Six months after the Slate Group launched Double X as " a new kind of women 's online magazine , " it 's being transformed into a section of Slate.com , a very old kind of men 's online magazine .
It 's unclear what , if anything , that means , but it 's strange that the Slate Group — the unit of the Washington Post Co. that publishes Slate , the Root , Slate V , and The Big Money — would reverse itself so soon after launching Double X to much fanfare just a few months ago .
The site grew out of the XX Factor , a group blog launched in 2007 that was , um , a section of Slate .
When we heard a rumor that Slate was pulling the plug on Double X , we asked Slate Group editor in chief Jacob Weisberg about it , and he responded , " It 's going to become a section of Slate , but otherwise pretty much as it has been .
Not sure readers will know the difference — most think it 's a section of Slate now .
There will be still be a homepage at doublex.com . "
We asked Weisberg if there would be any layoffs associated with the switch and he said , " Emily Bazelon and Hanna Rosin still co-editing and running it with a semi-autonomous editorial team a la Slate V. "
Very strange .
As you can see from the logo , Double X never made it out of beta .
If you know of any more about what 's happening at Double X , let us know .
Update : Shortly after this post went live Bazelon and Rosin posted about the coming changes to Double X .
They echo Weisberg in saying that while they 'll no longer be editing a standalone site , people wo n't notice the difference .
But they add the change is being done for " business reasons " — making us suspect that there may be some job cuts as part of the move .
Here 's there statement in full :
The World 's Smartest Cities by Joel Kotkin 12/03/2009
In today 's parlance a " smart " city often refers to a place with a " green " sustainable agenda .
Yet this narrow definition of intelligence ignores many other factors -- notably upward mobility and economic progress -- that have characterized successful cities in the past .
The green - only litmus test dictates cities should emulate either places with less - than - dynamic economies , like Portland , Ore. , or Honolulu , or one of the rather homogeneous and staid Scandinavian capitals .
In contrast , I have determined my " smartest " cities not only by looking at infrastructure and livability , but also economic fundamentals .
These criteria unfortunately exclude mega-cities like New York , Mexico City , Tokyo or Sao Paulo , which suffer from congenital congestion , out - of - control real estate prices and expanding income disparities -- symptoms of what urban historian Lewis Mumford described as " megalopolitan elephantiasis . "
Instead , today 's " smart " cities tend to be smaller , compact and more efficient : places like Amsterdam ; Seattle ; Singapore ; Curitiba , Brazil ; and Monterrey , Mexico .
This is not an entirely new notion : Between the 14th and 18th centuries , modest - sized cities like Venice , Italy ; Antwerp , Belgium ; and Amsterdam nurtured modern capitalism and created canals and vibrant urban quarters that remain wonders even today .
In the Pacific - centric modern era , smart commercial cities are increasingly found outside Europe .
Indeed , the most likely 21st - century successor to 15th - century Venice is Singapore , a commercially minded island nation that , like its forebear , is run by an often enlightened authoritarian regime .
When it first achieved independence in 1965 , Singapore 's condition was comparable to other developing cities like Bombay , Cairo , Lagos or Calcutta .
The island city 's neighbors included unstable countries like Vietnam , Malaysia and Thailand .
Its GDP per capita ranked well below those of Argentina , Trinidad , Greece or Mexico .
The country 's first prime minister and current eminence grise , Lee Kuan Yew , was determined to change reality .
Today , Singapore , with a population of less than 5 million , boasts an income level close to the wealthiest Western countries and a per-capita GDP ahead of most of Europe and all of Latin America .
Once largely semi-literate , its population is now among the best - educated in Asia .
To be sure , this enviable achievement was accomplished in an authoritarian fashion , but much of what Singapore has done must be considered " smart " by any reasonable accounting .
Strategic investments taking advantage of its location between the Indian and Pacific Oceans have paid off handsomely : Today Singapore Airport is Asia 's fifth largest , and the city 's port ranks as the largest container entrepôt and is the second biggest , after Shanghai , in terms of cargo volume in the world .
All this has made Singapore a huge lure for foreign companies , with over 6000 multinationals , including 3600 regional headquarters , now located there .
For foreign managers , engineers and scientists , largely English - speaking Singapore offers a pleasant and predictable environment , particularly compared with other Asian centers .
At least one recent survey by the World Bank 's International Finance Corporation rates Singapore No. 1 in the world for ease of doing business .
Although its growth has been slowed by the recession , the city 's close ties to the resurging economies of Southeast Asia , China and India lead many forecasters to predict a strong recovery over the next year .
Hong Kong , yet another outpost of British imperialism , has also performed well .
Last year the World Bank ranked the area No. 3 for ease of doing business , compared with No. 89 for the rest of China .
As long as Chinese Communists allow wider freedoms in Hong Kong than in the mainland , the area should continue to take advantage of its basic assets , including the world 's third - largest container port , an excellent airport and a highly skilled entrepreneurial population .
The continuing appeal of Hong Kong was vindicated by the recent decision of Hong Kong Shanghai Bank Chief executive George Geoghegan to relocate there from London .
As the center of the world economy continues to shift to Asia while Europe and America struggle , he is likely to find more company .
Not all the world 's " smart " cities are trading giants like Hong Kong and Singapore .
They also include well - run metropolises , such as the city of Curitiba .
The south Brazilian city is regarded as an innovator in everything from bus - based rapid transit , used by some 70 % of residents , and its balanced , diverse economic development strategy .
With a population of 3.5 million , Curitiba demonstrates how to achieve the evolving Brazilian dream without the mass violence , transportation dysfunction and ubiquitous grinding poverty that plague many other Latin American metro areas .
The city 's program of building " lighthouses " -- essentially electronic libraries -- for poorer residents has become a model for developing cities world wide .
These are among the reasons Reader 's Digest recently named Curitiba the best place to live in Brazil .
Another similarly " smart " city in the developing world is Monterrey , Mexico , which has emerged from relative obscurity and turned itself into a major industrial and engineering center over the past few decades .
The city of 3.5 million sits adjacent to the dynamic U.S. - Mexico border region and has 57 industrial parks specializing in everything from chemicals and cement to telecommunications and industrial machinery .
Over the last decade , the area has consistently grown at a faster rate than the rest of Mexico - - or , for that matter , the United States .
Monterrey and its surrounding state , Nuevo Leon , now boast per-capita GDP roughly twice that of the rest of Mexico .
Although hard - hit by the current recession , Monterrey seems poised for an eventual recovery .
Dominated by powerful industrial families , the area has long been business - friendly .
It has also become a major education center , with over 82 institutions of higher learning and 125,000 students , led by the Instituto Technologico de Monterey , considered by some Mexico 's equivalent of MIT or Cal Tech .
Of course , " smart " cities also exist in the advanced industrial world .
Amsterdam , a longstanding financial and trading capital , is home to seven of the world 's top 500 companies , including Philips and ING .
Relatively low corporate taxes and income taxes on foreign workers attract individuals and companies , one reason why , in 2008 , the Netherlands was largest recipient of American investment in Europe .
Amsterdam 's advantages include a well - educated , multilingual population and a lack of political corruption .
Amsterdam 's relatively small size -- 740,000 in the city and 1.2 million for the entire metropolitan area -- belies its strategic location in the heart of Europe and proximity to the continent 's dominant port , Rotterdam .
The city 's Schiphol airport , Europe 's third - busiest , is only 20 minutes from the center of Amsterdam , a mere jaunt compared with commutes to the major London or Paris airports .
Schipol has also spawned a series of economically vibrant " edge cities " that appear like more transit - friendly versions of Houston or Orange County , Calif .
North America also has its share of smart cities .
Although self - obsessed greens might see their policies as the key to the area 's success , Seattle 's growth really stems more from economic reality .
In this sense , Seattle 's boom has a lot to do with luck -- it 's the closest major U.S. port to the Asian Pacific , which has allowed it to foster growing trade with Asia .
Furthermore , Seattle 's proximity to Washington state 's vast hydropower generation resources -- ironically the legacy of the pre-green era--assures access to affordable , stable electricity .
The area also serves as a conduit for many of the exportable agricultural and industrial products produced both in the Pacific Northwest and in the vast , resource - rich northern Great Plains , linked to the region by highways and freight rails .
As North America 's economy shifts from import and consumption toward export and production , Seattle 's rise will be a model for other business - savvy cities in the West and South .
Houston 's close tie to the Caribbean , as well as its dominant global energy industry , thriving industrial base , huge Texas Medical Center complex and first - rate airport , all work to its long - term advantage .
Arguably the healthiest economically of America 's big cities , Houston is also investing in -- not just talking about - - its green future ; last year it was the nation 's largest municipal purchaser of wind energy .
Another smart town poised to take advantage of an industrial expansion is Charleston , S.C. , which has expanded its port and manufacturing base while preserving its lovely historic core .
Once an industrial backwater , Charleston now seems set to emerge as a major aerospace center with a new Boeing 787 assembly plant , which will bring upward of 12,000 well - paying jobs to the region .
Further inland , Huntsville , Ala. , has long had a " smart " core to its economy - - a legacy of its critical role in the NASA ballistic missile program .
Today the area 's traditional emphasis on aerospace has been joined by bold moves into such fields as biotechnology .
Kiplinger recently ranked the area 's economy No. 1 in the nation .
With the likely rise in commodity prices over the next decade , Canada also seems likely to produce several successful cities .
Perhaps the best positioned is Calgary , Alberta .
Over the past two decades , the city 's share of corporate headquarters has doubled to 15 % , the largest percentage of main offices per capita in Canada .
Although last year 's plunge in oil prices hit hard , rising demand for commodities in Asia should help revive the Albertan economy by next year .
In their press releases , all these cities make a point of bragging about being green and environmentally conscious .
Yet they have demonstrated their " intelligence " in other ways -- by exploiting their locations and resources to make savvy business and development decisions .
At the end of the day , it will not be their clean air but their commercial prowess -- as has been the case in history -- that will sustain their success in the decades ahead .
List of the World 's Smartest Cities Singapore
The 21st - century successor to 15th - century Venice , this once - impoverished island nation now boasts an income level comparable to the wealthiest Western countries , with a per-capita GDP ahead of most of Europe and Latin America .
Singapore Airport is Asia 's fifth - largest , and the city 's port ranks as the largest container entrepot in the world .
Over 6,000 multinational corporations , including 3,600 regional headquarters , are located there , and it was recently ranked No. 1 for ease of doing business .
Hong Kong
As the center of the world economy continues to shift from West to East , Hong Kong is certainly reaping the benefits .
Hong Kong Shanghai
Bank 's chief executive recently relocated there from London .
Its per-capita GDP is ranked 15th in the world .
The Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal have ranked Hong Kong the freest economy in the world .
Curitiba , Brazil
This well - run metropolis in southern Brazil is famous for its rapid bus - based transit , used by 70 % of its residents , and its balanced , diverse economic development strategy .
The city 's program of building " lighthouses " -- essentially electronic libraries -- for poorer residents has become a model for developing cities worldwide .
Environmental site Grist recently ranked Curitiba the third " greenest " city in the world .
Monterrey , Mexico
Over the past few decades Monterrey has emerged from relative obscurity into a major industrial and engineering center .
The city of 3.5 million has 57 industrial parks , specializing in everything from chemicals and cement to telecommunications and industrial machinery .
Monterrey and its surrounding state , Nuevo Leon , boast a per-capita GDP roughly twice that of the rest of Mexico .
Amsterdam
This longstanding financial and trading capital is home to seven of the world 's top 500 companies , including Philips and ING .
Relatively low corporate taxes and income taxes on foreign workers attract companies and individuals .
Amsterdam 's advantages include a well - educated , multilingual population and a lack of political corruption , as well as its location -- in the heart of Europe , close to a major international airport and a short train trip to Rotterdam , the continent ’s dominant port .
Seattle , Wash .
Seattle 's location close to the Pacific Ocean has nurtured trade with Asia , and its proximity to Washington state 's vast hydro - power generation station assures access to affordable , stable clean electricity .
The area also serves as the conduit for many of the exportable agricultural and industrial products produced both in the Pacific Northwest and in the vast , resource - rich northern Great Plains , closely linked to the region by highways and freight trains .

( WIRED ) --
When he was 17 , George Hotz poured hundreds of hours of his summer vacation into a special project : learning the iPhone 's secrets .
His unpaid labor eventually paid off .
With the help of a soldering iron , he was the first to unlock the iPhone , delivering the handset to international networks before Apple had a chance to .
He got some perks , too .
His unlock catapulted him to internet stardom , catching the eye of an entrepreneur who traded his Nissan 350Z car for Hotz 's restriction - free iPhone .
Hotz , now 20 , makes a living as a " hacker for hire " of sorts -- getting paid to break into different types of gadgets .
He gets to spend his free time unofficially attending a college , where he pretends to be a student just to socialize .
What 's best , Hotz did n't think unlocking the iPhone was even hard .
" It did take 500 hours , but thinking back to some of the stuff I 've done now , the first iPhone was incredibly easy , " Hotz said in a phone interview .
But what was an easy task for a curious teen has turned into a persistent headache for Apple , one that the company has been trying to cure for over two years , with little success .
With each new version of the iPhone operating system , a small army of independent programmers and hackers get to work prying it open , removing restrictions and making their iPhones do things that Apple CEO Steve Jobs never intended .
To stay faithful to agreements with telecom partners , Jobs in September 2007 declared Apple was playing a " cat- and - mouse game " to disable unlocked iPhones .
Apple regularly issues software updates to disable hacked , unlocked versions of the handset .
But within a few weeks , new hacks emerge , freeing the iPhone from carrier restrictions again .
In fact , Hotz just last month released the easiest hacking solution for the iPhone to date .
Named " Blackra1n , " his software can hack and unlock an iPhone in just two minutes .
All the user needs to do is plug in an iPhone , launch the application and click a button .
It 's safe to say this is a game where the mouse has outrun the cat , and it 's unlikely Apple will catch up anytime soon .
That 's because Apple is up against a lot more than an individual hacker .
The iPhone and its App Store not only gave birth to a new digital frontier for mobile software , but created an entire underground ecosystem : the Jailbreak community .
In addition to multiple iPhone hacker groups pumping out different unlocking solutions on a regular basis , there are several stores hosting unauthorized iPhone apps and programmers developing software strictly for hacked iPhones .
Hackers adopted the word " jailbreak " to describe the act of overriding the iPhone 's restrictions to install unauthorized software in the device .
Jailbreaking is the first step an iPhone owner must take in order to later execute the hack to unlock the handset , enabling it to work with any carrier .
The original iPhone was extremely insecure and thus very easy to jailbreak , according to Hotz , and hackers almost immediately broke into the gadget after it debuted in June 2007 .
Jailbreaking accelerated quickly .
Soon , hackers reverse - engineered major parts of the iPhone API , and they opened doors to creating and installing third - party apps for the device .
Games , utilities and even custom themes and wallpapers enhanced the capabilities of the handset .
To Apple enthusiasts , this was exciting : The iPhone at the time had no App Store , so jailbreaking was the only way to get more than the handful of basic apps provided by Apple .
In August 2007 , Hotz announced he had unlocked the iPhone with the Dev Team , a group of hackers that posts jailbreak tools and instructions .
Soon after , Hotz released software that anyone in the world could use to make their iPhone work with any carrier 's SIM card .
When Apple in July 2008 opened its official App Store , the urge to jailbreak got less exciting .
The App Store grew quickly -- with 100,000 apps to date -- making the act of jailbreaking seemingly irrelevant to the average iPhone owner , who could download Apple - sanctioned apps without risk .
Reformation
But the App Store did n't stop the Jailbreak community from proliferating .
Now that the App Store exists , jailbreakers have shifted their focus to creating work - arounds for the iPhone 's many restrictions .
Most share an open - software philosophy , giving consumers full ownership rights over their product , or the ability to do whatever they wish with the gadget they paid for .
Jay Freeman owns Cydia , an unauthorized app store open to jailbroken iPhones , which distributes iPhone apps Apple would otherwise forbid .
Before opening his store , Freeman played an instrumental role in setting up the early groundwork for the jailbreak platform .
Often referred to as " Saurik " in the Jailbreak community , Freeman admitted he was initially reluctant about the iPhone due to its stifling limitations .
" Apple seems to have spent very little time looking at previous phones , and left out many features that users , such as myself , have come to expect , " said Freeman , reflecting on the original iPhone .
" However , [ a friend ] insisted to me that jailbreaking was the future .
The software it comes with does n't matter ; I can just rewrite it all to my liking . "
The need for an underground app store became more clear after Apple rejected several iPhone apps .
The company faced severe scrutiny when it rejected the official Google Voice app , which would enable consumers to use a single phone number to ring all their phones , send free text messages and make cheap international calls .
The move stirred so much controversy that even the Federal Communications Commission investigated the rejection .
Unauthorized app stores served as a way of circumventing Apple 's censorship .
And some programmers are even making money coding forbidden iPhone apps .
" People are so annoyed by Apple and their s**t , and if you give them opportunity to go around it , then they 'll even pay for it , " said Kim Streich , a developer whose app 3G Unrestrictor earned $ 19,000 in sales in just two weeks through Cydia .
With more than 10 million jailbroken iPhones registered , Freeman 's Cydia store is the most popular underground app store .
Icy and Installer , two previous unauthorized iPhone software distributors , have been discontinued .
Whenever Apple releases an iPhone update , the new software usually erases unauthorized apps and disables unlocked iPhones .
In response , the iPhone hacker group Dev Team continues to post regular updates on its blog with instructions and new jailbreak patches for newer iPhone software .
The Dev Team 's main jailbreak weapon is called Pwnage Tool , which creates a custom ( hacked ) patch for Apple 's iPhone firmware and then installs it on the device .
To further combat jailbreaks , Apple has attempted to claim to the U.S. Copyright Office that jailbreaking is illegal .
However , the Dev Team skirts around copyright issues by not copying and providing Apple 's software , according to Eric McDonald , a member of the Dev Team .
Instead , the Pwnage Tool requires iPhone users to download Apple 's legitimate firmware , and the Pwnage Tool patches it with jailbreak code .
Hotz , who was kicked out of the Dev Team after prematurely publishing information on iPhone hacks , still hacks away the iPhone on his own .
Hotz does n't demand money for his work , though he does accept donations .
He is n't shy about showing his face to Apple or the world , either :
When running Blackra1n , the iPhone temporarily displays a photo of Hotz styled as an angel from a Caravaggio painting ( above ) .
" Blackra1n is only 600 K , and 200 k of it is my picture , " Hotz said , laughing .
Though the Jailbreak community persistently issues new hacks for iPhone updates , Apple is continuing to fight .
A recent Apple job listing reveals the company is seeking an iPhone OS security manager to help prevent exploits , which could block future jailbreak solutions .
Hotz doubted a security expert could block his efforts .
In fact , he said he 's already discovered a brand new exploit that will jailbreak and unlock Apple 's fourth - generation iPhone -- presumably due in stores summer of 2010 -- even though he has n't touched it .
" Personally I love that Apple keeps the iPhone closed , " Hotz said .
" This is a personal hobby ; it'd be no fun if Apple did n't have it closed anymore .
Get a Jailbreak cop and then I 'll show them what I can really do . "

The WikiReader is a little $ 99 gizmo that lets you read Wikipedia .
Yep , that ’s all it does .
No mobile phone , no movie player , no Webkit - enabled browser .
There ’s something about a product that does one simple thing well .
But what really sets the WikiReader apart is that it lasts a year on 2 AAA batteries with no charging .
How ?
The low - power LCD screen , and the tiny microprocessor .
But what ’s even cooler , at least for someone who learned to program by dabbling in Forth , is that the device has a built - in Forth interpreter for testing the hardware and running small programs .
I was pleasantly surprised – I know that Forth is good for embedded work on tiny micros , but since the main WikiReader app is written in C , I was curious why they chose Forth for testing and apps .
So I asked Christopher Hall , one of the main firmware developers .
His reply was very informative , and he ’s kindly allowed me to copy it here :
I have written testing programs in several languages , but compiled programs always have the problem of the edit , cross compile , load , and try to debug .
Sometimes the platform can run BSD or Linux , and then you can have the full suite of tools on the platform .
This is okay if the person doing the initial testing can write programs , but often the test is how to toggle a particular I /O line on / off and see the effect on the rest of the circuit .
Then having some kind of scripting on the platform seems the best way to achieve this .
For the initial testing , just start the interpreter REPL and you can start the initial tests .
Initially I looked at TCL and Python which I have used before , but they would take far too long to port since they need a lot of Posix system calls which do not exist for this platform .
I also considered Hedgehog , Pico Lisp or perhaps some simple Scheme interpreter but the syntax would probably be too difficult for the hardware engineers to use .
Forth is pretty simple syntax and RPN was probably not too difficult for them to learn .
Also it was easy to build the Forth interpreter , incrementally adding features until it is now an almost ANSI standard Forth .
Since I added all the device registers the hardware engineers can use commands like the following ( I used the same register names as the datasheet ) :
P0 _P0D p? \ display value of port 1 P0 _P0D p! \ set port to 1
While waiting for the main application development I could build tests for items like the LCD and CTP with just a serial connection on the device itself – using cut / paste from Emacs to picocom to upload Forth words .
This is much quicker than cross-compiling and swapping SD cards .
The Forth is rather slow in compiling , the dictionary search is quite slow for example , and the indirect threading adds run-time overhead so in its present form it is probably not fast enough for the main reader application , but for quick applications to try things out I find it very convenient .
Also , the first version was hand translated from a version of EForth for Linux before I migrated it to the ANSI standard .
( I kept copies in samo - lib / forth / EForthOriginals subdirectory . )
Very neat .
If Lisp is the secret weapon for developing web apps , maybe Forth is it for embedded apps .
Both are extensible at the language level and both have real macros , but Lisp is high level and Forth is low level .
Well , you know what to buy me for Christmas :
feeling - nice ? if WikiReader buy then

Many conservatives attempted to frame Mr. Hoffman ’s defeat as a victory , saying that despite Mr. Hoffman ’s loss , conservatives prevailed because the moderate Republican candidate , Dede Scozzafava , was forced out of the race .
“ Our number one goal was to make clear that the Republican Party cannot take someone as liberal as Dede Scozzafava and thrust her out on the voters and expect the voters just to accept it , ” said Brian Brown , executive director of the National Organization for Marriage , which worked to defeat Ms. Scozzafava , the Republican candidate who faced a challenge from Mr. Hoffman .
Democrats had thrown muscle behind the race as well , eager to avoid a potentially embarrassing defeat as President Obama ’s approval ratings have softened and efforts to portray them as the party of big government and deficit spending appear to be sticking .
A win in the Republican - leaning 23rd Congressional District would provide Democrats with a welcome boost , while a loss would reinforce the notion that the party is struggling .
The seat became vacant after President Obama appointed its long - serving Republican congressman , John M. McHugh , as secretary of the Army .
Leading conservative voices  including The Wall Street Journal ’s editorial page and The Weekly Standard and the talk show personalities Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck  took on the Republican nominee , Assemblywoman Scozzafava , who supports gay rights and abortion rights and had embraced some Democratic economic policies like the federal stimulus package .
They labeled her as too liberal .
The attacks on Ms. Scozzafava eventually took their toll , and she stunned her party over the weekend first by withdrawing from the race and then by urging her supporters to vote for Mr. Owens , a 60 - year - old lawyer from Plattsburgh .
Image The White House became involved in the efforts to boost the Democratic candidate , Bill Owens , in the closing days of the campaign .

But the ballots had already been printed , and early results showed her picking up 6 percent of the vote .
It was unclear how many of those were protest votes , and how many simply did not know she had left the race .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Wednesday he believes strongly in the need to maintain a strong dollar and said the United States was determined to get its budget deficit down .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner testifies before the House Financial Services Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington , October 29 , 2009 .

The dollar ’s decline has been a source of concern in the export - heavy region , especially since top exporter China keeps its currency ’s value closely managed against the U.S. dollar and so felt less impact on prices for its exports than other Asian nations that let their currencies float freely .
“ I believe deeply that it ’s very important to the United States , to the economic health of the United States , that we maintain a strong dollar , ” Geithner said in a meeting with Japanese reporters at the U.S. embassy .
The Treasury chief was visiting Japan before heading on Wednesday night to Singapore to join a meeting of finance ministers from the 21 - nation Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation forum ( APEC ) on Thursday .
It was his first trip to Japan since assuming the post in January .
The dollar index , which measures the dollar ’s value against a basket of six major currencies , has fallen 7.6 percent this year and hit a 15 - month low of 74.889 on Wednesday .
Geithner said the United States was well aware it must work to keep investors ’ confidence in U.S. economic policymaking .
“ We bear a special responsibility for trying to make sure that we are implementing policies in the United States that will sustain confidence ... in investors around the world that as growth recovers and growth strengthens that we ’re going to bring our fiscal position back to a sustainable balance , ” he said .
The U.S. budget deficit soared to a record $ 1.4 trillion in the fiscal year that ended on September 30 and is expected to be about the same this fiscal year .
Geithner talked with reporters after meeting Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama and before a lunch meeting with Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa .
He met Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii on Tuesday night .
In a separate interview with public broadcaster NHK on Wednesday , Geithner said that while the U.S. economy was growing again , the recovery was still in the very early stages .
“ It ’s a very early stage of recovery , again this is a very tough economy , ” Geithner said .
“ Unemployment is really very , very high , exceptionally higher in the United States .
It ’s still rising .
It ’s probably going to rise for a bit longer , until you see a longer period of growth take hold . ”
The U.S. jobless rate jumped to a 26 - year high of 10.2 percent in October and economists polled by Reuters expect it to hit 10.5 percent by the middle of next year .
LESS DRIVEN BY U.S. CONSUMER
Geithner said he was encouraged by Tokyo ’s commitment to shift its policy toward growth that comes from more spending at home rather than from selling abroad -- a policy that the Obama administration is encouraging throughout Asia .
“ Both the ( finance ) minister and the prime minister made it clear at the very beginning of our conversations that the basic objective of economic policy here is to make sure that future growth comes more from domestic demand , ” he said .
Geithner said the reality was that if a still - struggling recovery was to be turned into sustainable future growth “ it will have to be less driven by the U.S. consumer ” because heavy levels of debt were forcing American consumers to save more .
Geithner cited signs of stabilization in the global economy but said it still needed the stimulus that governments around the world have poured in to foster stronger growth .
“ We ’re at a point now where I think we all recognize that although the world economy is now growing again , you do n’t yet have all the conditions for a self - sustaining recovery led by the private sector , ” he said .
“ It ’s going to take continued , carefully designed support from government policy as a bridge to that recovery , ” Geithner added .
“ It ’s too early on a global basis to see people shift to restraint . ”
In response to repeated questions about China ’s policy of closely managing the exchange rate for its yuan currency , Geithner credited China with helping get the global economy out of crisis and welcomed Beijing ’s commitment to adopt a more flexible currency over time .
“ China has an excellent record of delivering on broad policy objectives , ” Geithner said .
But he said a more flexible currency was only part of “ a very complicated mix of policy changes ”
Beijing was attempting , which he said show encouraging signs of boosting domestic demand - led growth in the world ’s No.3 economy .

( Also this .
I appreciate the ludicrous vanity but it has some bearing on the above . )
Like it 's not bad enough that JavaScript has implied globals ( forget var and you create a global ) , but the browsers have decided it 's a good idea to add more pollution to the global namespace .
This has been a source of frustration before with IE , it 's really hard to understand the logic behind it , but it 's also happening in other browsers .
Consider this :
< meta name = " description " content = " test me " />
A normal META tag , right ?
But in IE this will create in a global variable called " description " pointing to that DOM node .
Yep .
alert ( description .
content ) ;
That 's pretty annoying .
Even more annoying is that getElementById ( ' description ' ) will also point to the DOM node , although it does n't even have an ID .
A test is born
Anyway , I wanted to test the effect of other name and id attributes in different tags and different browsers .
With the exception of Firefox which does n't create any globals , all other did to some degree .
Rather disappointing .
I tested IE6 , 8 ( plus compat view ) , FF 3.5 , Safari 4 and Opera 10 .
Here 's the test page
And below are the results .
The yellow x means that testing for the presence of this global returned " undefined " , the white o means that the global variable points to an object .

So ...?
So this is a useless feature if you ask me .
Not reliable , not cross - browser , maybe considered convenient back when rollover buttons and animated gifs were all the rage ( and animated window.status , remember ? ) , but today can only cause troubles where you least expect it .
Should be removed in future browser versions .
For the time being we just have to remember to always declare and initialize our local variables because it looks like someone else might also decide to do so for us .
Which can lead to errors if we assume too much .

The police are facing criticism over the deaths " It really overwhelms our capacity to store bodies , " says Dr Anthony Mbah , chief medical director at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital .
His mortuary is overflowing - with corpses brought in by the police .
" We have between 70 and 80 bodies right now ... and about three weeks ago , there was a mass burial of some other corpses , " he says .
" We are now getting ready to get these ones buried . "
Inside the mortuary in the south - eastern city of Enugu , two rooms are set aside for the remains of the young men .
In the first room , they are stacked , naked , one on top of the other .
In places the piles are four or five deep .
Faces peer out amongst a forest of legs .
Heads loll into groins .
Limbs are flung around torsos .
Some almost seem to embrace .
The smell - and the flies - make it impossible to get close .
It is a scene beyond belief .
Fathers ' pain
The mortuary is in a state of chaos .
No - one working here can put a precise number on the corpses .
Many of the bodies have no names .
Mortuary records simply say " suspected armed robber " or " unknown thief " .
As they killed him , they killed me , my life is over
Dennis Onovo
Father of victim
The register says police left 75 bodies between the beginning of June and 26 November this year .
But the records are imperfect - staff correct mistakes as they go along , one page appears to be missing .
It is uncertain how many of these bodies really are those of armed robbers .
The father of one victim of a police shooting has no doubt about the innocence of his son .
" A child is a gift from the Gods .
They have taken him from me , " Chief Dennis Onovo murmurs .
The morning that Mr Onovo 's 22 - year - old son , Matthew , died he had been walking to a computer class .
Police were searching for an armed man in the area - and shot him dead .
" I always hoped my son will one day be governor of this state , or even head of state - but all my effort is in vain , " says Mr Onovo .
For two days , the community stood still as people came out in peaceful demonstration .
The police told Matthew 's parents he was suspected of armed robbery .
" This boy was not an armed robber .
He was never a thief , much less an armed robber , " says Mr Onovo .
" As they killed him , they killed me , my life is over . "
Emmanuel Egbo's parents say he was a keen student , not a criminal A few miles away , another father echoes his words .
Chief Mark Ngena trembles , remembering .
" He was playing with his fellow children , " he says of his 13 - year - old son Emmanuel .
" Suddenly policemen , three of them , came in .
They shot and killed this boy .
Murdered him in cold blood . "
It was later claimed that Emmanuel too was an armed robber .
His family have never recovered his body .
Lawyers and relatives point to a pattern - of unlawful killings by police , followed by claims the deceased was an armed robber .
It is an easy way to cover dirty tracks , they say .
Police ' are victims too '
Enugu State Police Commissioner Mohamed Zarewa looks at the photograph of piled up bodies in the mortuary and covers them with his hand .
Why are you not asking about the policemen who died ?
Mohamed Zarewa
Enugu State police commissioner
On patrol with Nigeria 's police " I am not aware of that number you are talking .
I am not aware , I am not aware , " he says .
He mutters it five or six times .
Officers in his force do not carry out unlawful or arbitrary killings , he insists .
He says the young men were all killed in gun battles , fighting the police .
" Not just to go and kill somebody , we do n't do that , it 's unconstitutional .
We are in a democracy , " he says .
" You are asking about the young men , why are you not asking about the policemen who died ?
We people , we lose our lives . "
It is true that police work in Nigeria is a difficult job - often deadly .
An encounter between a police officer and a real armed robber is a matter of life or death .
Police officers ' wages are low .
Corruption in the force is endemic .
Poorly trained and ill - equipped policemen are sent to face armed gangs .
But it is also true that many people are killed in police custody .
Punishment without trial
In the Brought in Dead book , seven names are of particular interest .
The Brought in Dead book revealed names of interest Kennis Victor Okonkwo , Adolphus Odumegwu , Sunday Okoye , Hussein Yusuf , Ugochukwu Ogbonnaya , Amichi Nnamdi , and Ifeani Eze Leonard .
They were arrested , accused of a kidnapping in early September .
On 11 September they were paraded by the inspector - general of Police .
Photos of them alive appeared in local newspapers .
But they never reached court .
By 15 September six of them were dead .
The body of the last was delivered to the mortuary the following day .
By each name is written SARS , Special Anti-Robbery Squad - a feared police unit .
When asked for an explanation , Police Commissioner Zarewa said he was too busy .
' Equivalent to hell '
" They told me they have transferred my brother to Abuja , " says Charles , a shy 22 - year - old .
His older brother was in trouble with the police , accused of robbery .
Charles took a food flask for his brother , and travelled for two days to reach the police station .
On arrival he was arrested , accused of armed robbery , and held for three months .
" Inside there was equivalent to hell , " he says .
He says he was taken out of his cell , hung by the knees and beaten .
But he feels lucky as it happened only a couple of times .
A man held with him suffered a similar punishment , but his joints were smashed .
He screamed as he crawled back into the cell .
Briefly , Charles was held opposite his own brother and the two had the chance to talk .
After that , Charles never saw him again .
" It is the slang they use , " he says quietly .
" They are not going to tell you openly your brother is killed .
They just tell you they have transferred his case to Abuja . "

Here ’s one big reason why Sarah Palin may not run for president in 2012 : Her poll numbers are awful .
It ’s possible for determined politicians to reverse poor ratings of public opinion .
Hillary Clinton has done it , to a certain degree .
And some experts say Ms. Palin ’s current situation is similar to that faced by Secretary of State Clinton in the past .
But , still … 66 percent of respondents to a CBS News survey released Monday said they did not want Sarah Palin to run for the White House in 2012 .
Seventy percent of respondents to a CNN / Opinion Research poll said Palin is not qualified to be president .
And for Palin , the trend is going the wrong way .
As Pollster .com ’s compilation shows , her numbers have slid significantly this year , particularly following her resignation from Alaska ’s governorship in July .
“ Perceptions of Palin ’s qualifications for the presidency are shockingly low for a former presidential / VP nominee -- there ’s been no one comparable to her since Dan Quayle , ” wrote Brendan Nyhan , an assistant professor of government at Dartmouth , in a recent Pollster.com commentary .
Palin continues to be a highly polarizing figure .
Republicans are much less dismissive of her qualifications than Democrats or independents .
In the CBS survey released this week , 43 percent of GOP respondents said Palin would have the ability to be an effective President .
But only 11 percent of Democrats and 29 percent of independents agreed .
Some see opportunity for Palin among independents .
Matthew Continetti , associate editor of The Weekly Standard and author of the new book “ The Persecution of Sarah Palin , ” noted in a recent op - ed that Palin ’s rating among independents is 48 percent unfavorable , and 41 percent favorable , according to Gallup .
“ Not good , but insurmountable .
Flip those percentages , and they could be serving moose burgers in the White House in 2013 , ” wrote Continetti in the Wall Street Journal .
But given the image of Palin already cemented in much of the US public ’s mind , flipping that percentage might be very difficult .
Furthermore , Palin right now is running behind both Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee in a head - to - head matchups , according to an October Rasmussen survey .
That in and of itself is not a huge deal , given the length of time before primaries begin .
But Romney and Huckabee are from very different parts of the GOP coalition , notes Tom Schaller .
The fact that both now lead her means “ Palin ’s ideological appeal is easily dominated because it is wide but not deep on the far right and neither wide nor deep among the party ’s institutional and more mainstream elements , ” writes Schaller on the popular polling blog FiveThirty Eight .

After months of silence , pop sensation Rihanna is talking publicly about her relationship with her ex-boyfriend , Chris Brown , and the February 2009 events that led to his arrest .
" The more in love we became , the more dangerous we became for each other , " she told ABC News ' Diane Sawyer in an exclusive interview set to air on " Good Morning America " at 7 am ET Thursday , Nov. 5 .
Their full interview will air on " 20/20 " at 10 p E.T. Friday , Nov. 6 .
In August , Brown was sentenced to five years of probation , six months of community service and one year of domestic violence counseling for assaulting the 21 - year - old pop singer the night before the Grammy Awards .
" This happened to me ... it can happen to anyone , " Rihanna told Sawyer in the " 20/20 " interview , which will also be seen on " GMA . "
Rihanna told Sawyer that Brown was " definitely my first big love " before the dramatic incident , which resulted in the tabloids tearing apart the couple 's seemingly fairy tale relationship .
The pop star also spoke out to Glamour magazine about her trying year .
" I felt like I went to sleep as Rihanna and woke up as Britney Spears .
That was the level of media chaos that happened the next day , " she said in an interview featured in the magazine 's December issue .
" It was like , What , there are helicopters circling my house ?
There are 100 people in my cul - de-sac ?
What do you mean , I ca n't go back home ? "
Rihanna told the magazine that having a photo of her after Brown 's attack , in which her face appears battered and swollen , get leaked to the press was " humiliating . "
" It was humiliating , " she said .
" That is not a photo you would show to anybody .
I felt completely taken advantage of .
I felt like people were making it into a fun topic on the Internet , and it's my life . "
The pop star told Glamour that she reached out to her family and to God in the months following Brown 's assault and their subsequent breakup , though she often felt alone .
" My friends and family have been extremely supportive , and everyone has been there for me .
But at some point you are there alone .
It 's a lonely place to be -- no one can understand , " she said .
" That 's when you get close to God . "
After a nine month hiatus , the star -- known for her fierce fashion sense and infectious hits like " Umbrella " -- is back with a new single , " Russian Roulette , " from her highly anticipated album " Rated R " to be released later this month .
Now , speaking out about domestic violence , she told Glamour that she is " stronger , wiser and more aware , " and she warns young girls not to repeat her mistakes .
" The positive thing that has come out of my situation is that people can learn from that , " she said .
" I want to give as much insight as I can to young women , because I feel like I represent a voice that really is n't heard .
Now I can help speak for those women . "
Portions of ABC News ' exclusive interview with Rihanna will air on " Good Morning America " at 7 am E.T. Thursday , Nov. 5 .
Her full interview will air on " 20/20 " at 10 p E.T. Friday , Nov. 6 .
AT&T is planning to find ways to convince heavy iPhone users to stop using so much data ( despite paying for unlimited plans ) , as a way to ameliorate the perpetually clogged 3G networks in San Francisco and New York , according to AT&T executive Ralph de la Vega .
Speaking at the UBS conference in New York Wednesday , de la Vega said that heavy video and music listeners were bandwidth hogs , and some 3 percent of smartphones were using 40 percent of its network capacity , according to Reuters .
He suggested the company would find ways to persuade heavy users to reduce their activity and that caps on data usage could be imminent .
Epicenter has two alternative suggestions : Stop selling iPhones in San Francisco and New York , and shut down the Major League Baseball app , which streams live baseball games to users ' phones .
The first piece of advice is just a no - brainer .
If you can't handle the network traffic , stop selling a device that comes with a promise of unlimited 3G data service .
The second one is pretty straightforward as well .
The cellphone industry likes to say that heavy usage from more than a single user at the same time on the same tower can block others from even using their cellphones to make calls or send text messages .
That 's the reason Apple and AT&T put up roadblocks for apps like Slingbox 's that stream video from your home cable setup to your phone .
But the MLB At Bat 2009 app , which is pushed by Apple and was even featured by Steve Jobs at an Apple event , is even worse .
It streams games live .
That means as soon as the San Francisco Giants or the New York Yankees start playing , iPhone users with that app can start watching the game over AT&T 's precious , overloaded 3G network .
All at the same time .
( Update :
As commenters note , the app uses GPS to enforce MLB 's Byzantine blackout rules for local markets , but the point remains that fans stream games ( away games and playoffs ) in ways that strain a network more than asynchronous video apps do )
Oddly , this is n't considered a hazard to the network .
It 's a featured app that costs $ 10 for the now - finished 2009 season .
There 's little chance AT&T will ban the app come spring training time , but if the company really worried about its network , it would bench MLB indefinitely .
Oh , and AT&T could also try rolling out network upgrades to better use the spectrum they already own , steeply discount its femtocells ( essentially a home or office cell tower ) or put up more towers too .
But I guess it 's easier to be defensive and blame your network woes on customers to whom you sold unlimited plans .
UPDATE : AT&T wrote in to say that it 's doing more than complaining and that it has been working hard in San Francisco in particular , and that things are getting better there .
And the company says it is spending close to $ 20 billion in 2009 on building out its network .
o We are nearly doubling the wireless spectrum serving 3G customers in hundreds of markets across the country , using high - quality 850 MHz spectrum .
This additional spectrum expands overall network capacity and improves in - building reception .
o We are adding about 2,000 new cell sites , expanding service to new cities and improving coverage in other areas .
o We ’re adding about 100,000 new backhaul connections , which add critical capacity between cell sites and the global IP backbone network .
We 're doubling the number of fiber - served cell sites this year .
o We ’re enabling widespread access to our Wi -Fi network – the largest in the country with more than 20,000 hotspots in all 50 states – allowing them to take advantage of the best available AT&T mobile broadband connection .
o We ’re rolling out even faster 3G speeds with deployment of HSPA 7.2 technology , with availability in six markets planned by the end of the year .
o We are preparing for field trials of next generation , LTE wireless networks next year , with deployment planning to begin in 2011 .
This schedule aligns with industry expectations for when a wide variety of compatible 4G wireless devices should be available .
The proof , of course , will be in your hand .
Let us know in the comments how AT&T 's coverage is working for you .

Most of backpackers tend to seek experience and call themselves as “ Experience seeker . ”
Experience is part of individuals ' inward , and will be transformer into memory which engages in the behavior decisions .
It is important to realize the target consumer before asking positive benefits from this market .

A year after an unruly crowd trampled a worker to death at a Wal - Mart store , the nation ’s retailers are preparing for another Black Friday , the blockbuster shopping day after Thanksgiving .
Along with offering $ 300 laptops and $ 99 navigation devices , stores are planning new safety measures to make sure the festive day does not take another deadly turn .
Last year , frenzied shoppers at a Wal - Mart in Valley Stream , N.Y. , trampled Jdimytai Damour , a temporary store worker who died soon afterward .
To prevent any repeat , Wal - Mart has sharply changed how it intends to manage the crowds .
That new plan , developed by experts who have wrangled throngs at events like the Super Bowl and the Olympics , will affect how customers approach and enter the stores , shop , check out and exit .
Each store will have its own customized plan .
The hope is for an orderly Black Friday , a seemingly incongruous notion .
The most significant change at Wal - Mart is that the majority of its discount stores ( as opposed to its Supercenters ) will open Thanksgiving morning at 6 a.m. and stay open through Friday evening .
Last year , those stores closed Thanksgiving evening and reopened early Friday morning .
By keeping the stores open for 24 hours , Wal - Mart is hoping for a steady flow of shoppers instead of mammoth crowds swelling outside its stores in the wee hours of Friday .
Activision 's upcoming first - person shooter Modern Warfare 2 includes scenes " designed to evoke the atrocities of terrorism , " the publisher told Kotaku today .

The scenes are so powerful that despite already having a Mature rating , players can choose to skip playing through it .
Details of the scene came to light after footage from the game was leaked on the Internet .
Activision says that the footage comes from a game obtained illegally and " is not representative of the overall gameplay experience in Modern Warfare 2 . "

You probably want to stop reading now if you do n't want to hear anything about the game .
" Infinity Ward 's Modern Warfare 2 features a deep and gripping storyline in which players face off against a terrorist threat dedicated to bringing the world to the brink of collapse .
The game includes a plot involving a mission carried out by a Russian villain who wants to trigger a global war .
In order to defeat him , the player infiltrates his inner circle .
The scene is designed to evoke the atrocities of terrorism . , " according to the statement provided to Kotaku from Activision .

" At the beginning of the game , players encounter a mandatory " checkpoint " in which they are warned that an upcoming segment may contain disturbing elements and they can choose not to engage in the gameplay that involves this scene .
Consistent with its content , the game has been given an " M " for Mature by the Entertainment Software Ratings Board .
The rating is prominently displayed on the front and back of the packaging , as well as in all advertising . "
It sounds like Modern Warfare 2 is n't planning on riding on the success of its predecessor .
Whether the game goes too far will have to wait until all of us can play the game and experience the scenes in context .
Paula
Asher has lost everything in just two years – her husband , money , job and now is on the brink of having her home taken away .
The 63 - year - old grandmother said her string of tragedies began early last year when she discovered her dying husband Miles had remortgaged their house then flown to Dubai after being tricked by internet fraudsters .
He was fleeced of all their cash .
Miles , 63 , died on July 22 after suffering motor neurone disease , a neurological condition which causes progressive degeneration of cells in the brain and spinal cord , and can affect decision making .
Paula 's late husband Miles .
He was diagnosed in January .
Paula said in the months before her husband 's death , he made a series of " poor financial decisions " .
Paula said TSB Bank allowed Miles to freeze their mortgage on their home on Auckland 's North Shore of around $ 500,000 over the telephone .
He told the bank he would pay the loan in " one lump sum " using money from a Dubai - based investment .
Paula said bank staff asked her husband to fax documents bearing both of their signatures , which he forged , to enable the payments to be frozen .
She said she was unaware what her husband of 20 years had done , and had no idea their $ 700 weekly mortgage payments were going unpaid and tumbling into arrears .
Paula said TSB allowed Miles to use their home to borrow the $ 45,000 he then invested in the Dubai scam .
TSB has now put the house in Birkenhead up for a mortgagee sale .
Paula has no way of paying the mortgage herself after leaving her job in the tourism industry to help care for her ill husband .
Yesterday , Paula said TSB should have contacted her when they began receiving " strange requests " from her husband .
" Surely to God someone who gets a call at a bank with the stuff he was saying would raise alarm bells , " Paula said .
" My husband always looked after the finances and he was damn good at it , never a problem .
But when he started getting sick his rationale went out the door .
He started talking about how he would earn millions from the Dubai scheme and I tried to tell him it was a load of nonsense but he was n't interested in listening . "
Paula has briefed a barrister and is considering taking legal action against TSB .
" I am not looking for sympathy but I suppose you could say I am unlucky , very unlucky .
It 's been a bad couple of years .
Everything has gone from before my eyes . "
TSB – which handles bank accounts for 3 % of Kiwis – last night said they would review Paula 's file .
The bank 's managing director Kevin Rimmington told Sunday News that staff were trained in dealing with customers who behaved like Paula said Miles did in his last months .
" If people are n't of sound mind , then we would take that into account , " he said .
" All such cases should be treated with caution . "
Rimmington said TSB was currently dealing with three mortgagee sales .
" Obviously they create a very stressful period in people 's lives , " he said .
After Paula discovered her home was going to be sold by the bank , she turned to Home Rescue – a Hamilton - based firm which told customers that for a fee of $ 200 per week they could prevent mortgagee sales .
Home Rescue , no longer operating and the subject of a police investigation , relied on supposed Maori statutes to claim mortgages were illegal .
Paula said she was desperate and signed up with Home Rescue in November 2008 at a cost of $ 10,070 , which equated to one per cent of her home 's valuation and outstanding mortgage .
The company provided her with a trespass notice she was told to pin to her front door which warned real estate agents , debt collectors and police officers to keep off her property or they would be charged with trespass .
Barfoot and Thompson were engaged by TSB to sell Paula 's home and were confronted with the trespass notice , which had made some potential buyers feel uncomfortable .
" It is rare for home owners under the threat of a mortgagee sale to challenge access to a property by putting up trespass notices or land claim notices , " said Barfoot and Thompson managing director Peter Thompson .
" Most people faced with a mortgagee sale see the sense of working with the agent and lender to get the best possible price . "
Motor neurone disease , which mainly affects people over 50 , causes muscle spasms , exaggerated reflexes and an increasing wasting and weakness of muscles responsible for speech , swallowing and chewing .
National manager of the Motor Neurone Association , Diane Robinson , said the theory that the disease affected patients ' brain functions was controversial and needed more research .
But there was research , in Australia and New Zealand , which " suggested " it affected thinking and reasoning .
As a longtime Santa Claus at a suburban Chicago mall , Rod Riemersma used to jokingly tell children they would get socks for Christmas if they were naughty .
This year , he stopped telling the joke .
Too many children were asking for socks .
" They 've probably heard their parents say , ' Geez , I wish I had some money to get them clothes , ' " says Mr. Riemersma , 56 years old .
A wintry measure of hard times can be found this holiday season on the knee of white - bearded , red - suited men around the country .
A couple of years ago , children were shooting for the moon , asking St. Nick for Xboxes , iPods and laptops .
But with the economy still fragile , many children are requesting basics such as shoes , library cards and even eyeglasses , say dozens of Santas who work at malls or on the party circuit .
" Kids will hear the E - word , but it 's not Elmo , " says Tim Connaghan , who runs a Los Angeles Santa - training school .
" It 's the economy . "
The extent to which money woes are weighing on children is clear from the letters flooding into North Pole , Alaska .
That 's the home of the Santa Claus House , a Christmas - themed shop where parents can order letters from Santa with a North Pole postmark .
It gets tens of thousands of letters to Santa every year .
Operations manager Paul Brown says the messages not only predict the holiday 's hottest toys months in advance but also gauge the mood of the nation .
Schizophrenia hides its heritability well .
Although fewer than 1 percent of the general population will be diagnosed as schizophrenic based on symptoms such as hallucination and disorganized thought , for children of a schizophrenic parent , those odds jump to about one in 10 .
And yet the condition ’s genetic underpinnings have stubbornly resisted discovery .
In the latest attempt , three crack teams of investigators pooled genomic data from 8,000 schizophrenics of European ancestry but could lay claim to only a handful of weak genetic risk markers .
Analyses such as these , which appeared online July 1 in Nature ( Scientific American is part of the Nature Publishing Group ) , have led researchers to question the value of brute - force genomics for analyzing schizophrenia .
“ I think we need to pause and think through the risk pathways to disease more clearly , ” says Dolores Malaspina , director of the social and psychiatric initiatives program at New York University Langone Medical Center .
In particular , devotees of genetics might want to cede a little ground to their colleagues in epidemiology , who over the past decade have amassed a provocative , interlocking set of studies implicating urban birthplace and migrant status as persistent risk factors .
Researchers believe the potential for schizophrenia starts to emerge during early brain development , beginning in the womb .
Rates tick up slightly for offspring whose mothers were infected with influenza or undernourished during pregnancy , for newborns who suffered obstetric complications such as oxygen deprivation , and for offspring born in the winter or spring .
Starting in the 1990s , studies from Denmark , the Netherlands and Sweden began making the case for urban life as a distinct risk factor .
In the largest of these , out of a cohort of 1.75 million Danes , being born in Copenhagen was associated with a 2.5 - fold greater risk of schizophrenia than being born in rural areas .
Danes who were born in smaller cities showed intermediate risk .
Although the nature of the exposure remains obscure , researchers were able to narrow down its timing : Danes who lived in urban centers for the first 15 years of life had the most elevated risk .
A second wave of findings has documented that immigrants to European countries are at heightened risk of schizophrenia as compared with native - born residents .
Second - generation immigrants show increased risk relative to their parents , and rates are highest among those of African heritage .
In a study of three cities in the U.K. , Afro-Caribbeans were nine times as likely as the general population to be treated for schizophrenia .
Neighborhood composition seems to play a role .
In South London epidemiologist James Kirkbride of the University of Cambridge and his colleagues at King ’s College London have found that in neighborhoods with higher measures of “ social cohesion , ” such as voter turnout , the incidence of schizophrenia is proportionally lower .
Despite the consistency of the findings , epidemiologists who work in the field say scientific journals in the U.S. have shown reluctance to consider papers that explore the relation between race and schizophrenia .
Hence , it was not until 2007 that Michaeline Bresnahan , Ezra Susser and their colleagues at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health cautiously published data from a cohort of 12,000 Californians enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente health plan , which showed that the rate of hospital admission for schizophrenia was twice as high for African - Americans as for whites , even after controlling for socioeconomic status of the parents .
Because the cohort was part of the same health plan , reduced access to health services was unlikely to account for the discrepancy , Susser says .
Given that schizophrenia has no clear biological markers , skeptics may question whether diagnostic criteria have been applied rigorously across diverse cultural groups .
For epidemiologists , such arguments miss the point .
“ The strategy is to identify important risk or protective factors within a given group , ” observes Dana March , a Ph.D. candidate in Susser ’s group .
March says her preliminary work shows that of Kaiser cohort members born in Oakland , Calif . , * those born into more densely populated neighborhoods are at twofold to threefold greater risk of schizophrenia than those born in less dense areas , irrespective of race .
Residents of more run-down or overcrowded city neighborhoods could be more exposed to toxic chemicals and infections , she says , and may have less access to social capital that would blunt the effects of a predisposition to mental illness acquired early in life .
In an attractive synthesis , such neighborhood - level risk factors might impart lasting epigenetic changes — the chemical overwriting of the genome in response to environmental cues .
If true , the roots of schizophrenia would lie where geography and genetics meet .

A Washington - based investigative journalism organization said in a report issued Tuesday that it found a " culture of secrecy " surrounding sexual assault cases on university campuses across the U.S.
The report by the Center for Public Integrity showed that nearly half of the 33 female students it interviewed in the past year about being raped were unsuccessful in pursuing criminal charges .
That left the campus judiciary system as their only recourse .
But victims who take that route " face proceedings that are shrouded in secrecy , where they encounter mysterious disciplinary proceedings , where they themselves are shut out of the hearing process , " Kristen Lombardi , lead reporter on the nine - month investigation , said during a news conference broadcast Tuesday .
Nearly a third of the 33 victims said school administrators discouraged them from pursuing complaints , and about a dozen experienced confidentiality requirements " sometimes followed by threats of punishment if they were to disclose any information about the case , " Lombardi said .
The 33 students interviewed for the study represent only a fraction of the sexual assault cases at campuses nationwide .
The U.S. Department of Education 's office of post - secondary education said there were 2,532 forcible sex offenses in campuses in 2007 .
A 2005 study by the National Institute of Justice , the research arm of the U.S. Justice Department , found that one in five women on a college campus will be the victim of rape or attempted rape by the time she graduates .
The Center for Public Integrity did not reveal where the 33 victims went to school or where the clinics and crisis - services programs were located , citing confidentiality .
The center 's study revealed that fewer than 5 % of sexual assault cases are reported to authorities .
Victims who do report an assault on campus face a " litany of barriers , " said Bill Buzenberg , the center 's executive director , including " confidential agreements and off - the - record negotiations with administrators and guidance counselors uninterested in the victim 's plight altogether . "
Another key finding by the center was that the campus judicial system resulted in lenient punishment .
Expulsion is a rarity , Lombardi said .
Michele Cole , a victim advocate with Ball State University 's office of victim services who is consulted every time a sexual assault is reported , advises victims about both the criminal system and the campus judicial system .
" If they 're going to file one ( complaint ) , I encourage them to file the other , " Cole said .
" My function is to break down those barriers so that the victim does n't feel like they have to be silenced . "

I do n't mean to be a party pooper , but they said this for Liverpool Echo Arena .
Let 's just hope he is n't clonked on the nogging again .
Last week , actor Patrick Stewart wrote of his experience of growing up with a father who beat his mother .
Here are readers ' responses to that article
Last week , the actor Patrick Stewart – patron of the domestic violence charity Refuge – wrote about his experiences of growing up with a father who regularly beat and abused his mother .
There were many heartfelt responses to the article – here is a small selection :
✒ Patrick Stewart 's article touches on something which is hidden and forgotten – the children trapped within violent marriages , not necessarily abused directly , but living with it , within it , for years .
When you are five , six , seven and utterly dependent on your parents , there is no escape .
I can remember telling my teacher that " my dad hits my mum " .
Nothing came of it and it was never mentioned again .
The situation is so uncomfortable , it 's easier to pretend it is n't happening .
Jane
✒ My father was very abusive – mostly verbal – but the rows were constant , with little or no provocation from my mother .
It pushed her into mental illness .
I have grown up to detest male authority figures and to find many aspects of my own masculinity abhorrent .
I wonder what creates such men , for I believe they are created , and for that they are not to blame .
Yet [ this means that ] , for the victims , there is not even the consolation of hating them .
Only loneliness and emptiness .
James
✒ My dad was a Vietnam vet and I identified a lot with Patrick Stewart 's childhood experience .
I do n't remember too much , other than the feeling of dread as I walked home from school , hearing the shouting as I neared the door .
I too would have gladly killed my father , yet I sobbed like a baby when he died .
Anonymous
✒ I was abused by my ex-husband on and off for about 12 years .
It was random and unpredictable , which made it all the more terrifying .
People liked my ex-husband and thought that he was a warm , loving person – which he was , at least half the time .
Once , I managed to get to the safety of the bathroom and locked myself in with the phone , before calling the police .
On that occasion a police officer took my husband into another room ; I heard laughter – they were discussing house prices and how the stress of paying for our house must be hard for him .
I was still shaking uncontrollably , and my hair was coming out from where he had pinned me to the wall .
The police officer took a statement from me , then left , telling us to " stay in separate rooms " .
As soon as he was gone , my husband looked at me with a cold fury ; needless to say , he did n't fulfil his side of the agreement .
I have had good and bad experiences with the police , but women 's refuges were a total godsend .
Name withheld
✒ Patrick Stewart 's article struck a chord .
I endured the same , and worse [ as a child ] – as did my mother , of course .
Not a day goes by when I do not suffer .
In some ways it 's a living hell .
Alex
✒ I believe that there should be a domestic abuser register so that women with a new partner can have them checked out – not just for arrests and convictions , but also police call - outs .
Some , if not most , abusers are clever or controlling enough to avoid arrest or conviction , no matter how obvious the situation .
Kevin
✒ Thank you for highlighting Patrick Stewart 's story of his father 's abuse of his mother .
I spent 18 years in a similar situation [ to his mother ] – my eldest child was born blue , asphyxiated , and consequently suffered all his life from a form of epilepsy , as a result of being born prematurely , after I was beaten by his father .
I gave birth to three sons in all – two conceived in rape .
Two of my sons grew up to hit their respective wives , and they dealt with this shortcoming by hanging themselves .
It is my mission to educate every girl from the age of five that [ abuse ] is just not acceptable .
Alexa
✒ Patrick 's article put into words the feelings I went through growing up in similar circumstances – the loneliness of stepping in to stop the violence , the feeling of wanting to protect my mum , but irrationally still loving my dad .
Fortunately , as an adult , I am not one of the one in four women who become victims of this terrible abuse .
I have a wonderful loving man to whom I have been married for the last nine years .
This is my second marriage , and I would like to spread a few words of hope to those who have suffered that there are many exceptionally good men still out there .
Trisha
✒ I lived in a household with an alcoholic father as well , and thankfully he rarely struck us , but his tongue lashed harder than his belt ever could .
My sister suffered great emotional disturbances from it , and to this day , at 28 , still struggles with body image issues , depression and rage .
I internalised the damage and it took me well into my young adult life – I am 26 this year – to come to terms with how his actions affected me .
I too fell into the pattern of blaming everyone other than him for the problems .
I blamed my sister for the verbal fights they would have ; I blamed her for the screaming matches and the times he hit her .
His actions have led to me having difficulties maintaining relationships with friends , family and sexual partners .
More light needs to be shed on the emotional aspects that continue long after the bruises heal .
These are hard to see , and you can't call the cops for them .
Thomas
✒ In 1997 my mother 's partner of 10 years assaulted her and she told him to move out , which he did .
What followed was at least a year of extreme and intense stalking .
Our phone number was changed several times , letters would arrive on an almost daily basis , he would drive along our street constantly .
On one occasion he arrived at the house when my mother was on her own and held a knife to her throat .
When the police arrived he claimed that he was in the house to collect his knife and was not charged with any crime .
In many ways my mother was fortunate .
He was not our father ; they were not married ; she informed the police of the initial assault .
She had three sons aged 15 , 17 and 19 , each of whom had friends in the area .
She was well known locally and people did call the police when they sensed trouble .
One of her brothers was a high - ranking police officer who phoned him to warn him off .
All of this was useless .
I believe that the police were sincere in their attempts to protect my mother , and us , but frankly the law was , and is , pathetic .
Men who behave like he did are engaged in terrorism .
When he was finally brought to court on charges arising from his year of stalking and the initial assault , the punishment was a fine of £ 1,500 .
In my opinion , there should be extraordinary measures to contain domestic abuse .
Like child abuse , it contributes to creating a new generation of abused people , abusers and criminals .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Solar energy costs will drop by half in 2009 while other low - carbon technology costs will see their pre-subsidy costs drop by 10 - 20 percent , renewable energy analysts said on Monday .
The sun shines in the sky with temperatures of 114 degrees farenheit with a Net Zero Plus facility shown at ( R ) at the Army National Training Center in Fort Irwin , California July 31 , 2008 .
The dome structure is composed of concrete and foam insulation which is powered by both a solar and wind energy generated by self - contained photo - voltaic cells and two wind turbines at the unit .

Prices for renewable energy equipment , including wind turbines and solar panels , fell this year , but they were offset by higher financing costs in the wake of the global economic slowdown , New Energy Finance said in a quarterly research note .
“ As capital markets loosen up and equipment prices continue their decline , we will see the levelized costs decline , finishing the year 10 percent below the end of last year across the board and far more than that in solar , ” said Michael Liebreich , London - based New Energy Finance ’s chairman and CEO .
Levelized costs for solar energy , or the lifetime cost per kilowatt hour before government subsidies , will drop this year , with thin - film solar power generation rates falling to as low as $ 3 per watt , the report said .
Chinese and European solar power companies were upbeat about next year , saying last week that demand for clean energy systems was rebounding after a dismal 2009 .
Wind turbines have dropped to their lowest level in several years , shedding 18 - 20 percent of their cost in 2009 , New Energy Finance said , adding that equipment prices could be offset by higher construction costs as developers build in deeper waters .
Geothermal energy rates also eased as low oil prices caused many drilling rigs to sit idle , meaning more equipment was available .
Geothermal uses underground hot water and steam to spin turbines and generate electricity .
New Energy
Finance said drilling costs , having dropped by nearly 50 percent earlier this year , recovered somewhat alongside oil prices in the third quarter .
The U.S. , Europe , China and South Korea lead global renewable energy spending plans after committing about $ 500 billion to push ‘ green ’ technologies under wider plans to stimulate their own economies .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Federal Reserve threw a lot of money at the crisis to get the gears of the economy turning again -- but it may soon be time to collect on the bill .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke gave an update on the Fed 's expensive economic rescue package Thursday evening , in a keynote address at a conference in Washington .
Bernanke and the central bank have been engaged in unprecedented actions over the past year .
After the Fed used the last of its rate - cutting bullets , dropping interest rates to zero in December 2008 , it had to get creative to keep the recession from tailspinning into a depression .
The Fed 's solution was three - fold .
It lent funds to companies and investors , bought up Treasury bonds , and purchased Wall Street 's unwanted assets .
In all , the Fed more than doubled the size of its balance sheet , to $ 2.3 trillion .
As the recovery begins to take hold , many of those programs are phasing out , but the balance sheet still stands at $ 2.2 trillion .
Now the Fed will have to walk a tightrope :
If it keeps its balance sheet super - sized for too long , that could lead to out - of - control inflation .
But deflation and soaring unemployment are a concern if the Fed begins its exit too soon .
" My colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I believe that accommodative policies will likely be warranted for an extended period , " Bernanke said Thursday .
" At some point , however , as economic recovery takes hold , we will need to tighten monetary policy to prevent the emergence of an inflation problem down the road . "
The Fed has said repeatedly that it will wind down its balance sheet and raise rates at the appropriate time .
But it has n't yet budged .
" Bernanke is a student of history , and he knows that the real problems during the Depression occurred when the government pulled back its stimulus too quickly , " said Doug Roberts , chief investment strategist at ChannelCapitalResearch.com .
" Also , the Fed chief is up for reappointment , and he wo n't help his case if unemployment hits 12 % , 13 % or 14 % . "
Most economists think the wind - down will start in the beginning of 2010 , but with $ 1 trillion in troubled assets , the eventual exit may be easier said than done .
The Fed 's ability to sell them off will depend heavily on how many investors want to buy unattractive assets like mortgage - backed securities and agency debt .
If the Fed does sell them off soon , it will likely take a big loss .
But Bernanke said the Fed has the tools for an exit strategy :
By unloading its assets on the open market and lending the assets to banks , the Fed could reduce the size of its balance sheet fairly quickly , Bernanke said .
He also said the Fed could issue something similar to certificates of deposit to banks , effectively holding onto bank deposits for a while to take some money out of the system .
The Fed can also raise interest rates on banks ' deposits , encouraging banks to keep their money with the Fed .
That would reduce the chance of out - of - control lending that could lead to wild inflation .
Bernanke said that the Fed will be looking to a number of economic measures to determine when it is the right time to exit , including the effects of the $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan .
In the meantime , Bernanke said , more work must be done on increasing regulation of the financial markets to ensure that a crisis of last year 's magnitude can never happen again .
" One of the major lessons of last year is ' too big to fail ' is an enormous problem , " Bernanke said .
" It is a burden on the taxpayer and a burden on the financial markets .
We need to address this effectively and as soon as possible . "
Here 's a look at what the Fed has lent and bought to rescue the economy :
Lending : The Fed has lent nearly $ 345 billion to businesses and investors in an effort to restore credit to consumers , banks and companies .
Innovative programs include the Commercial Paper Funding Facility , which gave businesses access to short - term loans to finance day - to - day operations .
Similarly , the Term Auction Facility , a bank lending program , and a money market rescue program also helped restore liquidity to the market .
Those programs now account for about $ 220 billion of the Fed 's balance sheet , down from $ 800 billion at their collective peak .
Currently , a big chunk of Fed lending is going to troubled insurer AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) , which has received $ 40 billion from the Fed as of last week .
TALF , the government 's program to provide financing to private investors to buy up securities backed by consumer and small business loans , also accounts for a little more than $ 40 billion on the balance sheet .
Treasurys :
As part of its effort to keep down bond yields -- and mortgage rates that track those yields -- the Fed has ramped up its purchases of government bonds since March , buying nearly $ 300 billion .
The Fed now holds about $ 770 billion in Treasurys on its balance sheet , nearly double its pre-crisis total .
Prior to the recent ramp - up , the Fed 's balance sheet was primarily composed of Treasurys , which the central bank held to control the flow of money in the economy .
Now Treasurys make up just 35 % of the Fed 's balance sheet .
Asset purchases :
The largest part of the Fed 's balance sheet is in troubled assets .
The Fed has $ 970 billion of these assets , $ 700 billion of which are mortgage - backed securities it continues to purchase in bundles directly from government - sponsored mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) .
The Fed also holds $ 200 billion of Fannie and Freddie debt .
The Fed purchased these assets in an attempt to keep mortgage rates lower , and it has largely succeeded .
The Fed said last month that it will continue to buy those assets for another six months , and its total purchases will add up to $ 1.5 trillion .
The rest of the Fed 's troubled assets are asset - backed securities from AIG 's counterparties and troubled assets it took off of Bear Stearns ' balance sheet when Bear Stearns was sold to JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) .
Though many economists credit these purchases with rescuing the financial sector , the Fed has taken a substantial loss on them in the first half of 2009 .
While you were n't looking , the popular Ubuntu Linux distribution changed several features under the hood .
Kyle Rankin , coauthor of The Official Ubuntu Server Book , points out the most distressing changes and explains why you need to suffer through them and ultimately come to acceptance .

Of all the things I love about Linux , I think I love its stability the most .
I 'm not talking about uptime here , even though it 's great .
What I mean is the sense you get from Linux that it's on a solid foundation .
Concepts like " everything is a file , " " small programs that do one thing well , " and the overall file system layout are well - worn principles with all the major kinks worked out .
I get the sense of a collected wisdom , accumulated in the system over the years , guiding Linux forward .
Sure , Mozilla 's browser will change its name every few years , and both GNOME and KDE have gone through their start - from - scratch phase , but / dev files , initrd , at , cron , and System V init  I can always count on these things being there .
Not so fast .
It turns out that a few things in that list I just mentioned have already been replaced in a modern Ubuntu system …and the rest are on their way out .
Perhaps that fact makes you want to reach for your torch and pitchfork , but hear me out first .
By the time you reach the end of this article , I hope that you 'll have gone through the five stages of grief : denial , anger , bargaining , depression , and finally reached acceptance of the impending death of these classic parts of Linux infrastructure .
Denial : System V Init
My own journey through the five stages of grief started a few months ago .
I was documenting the System V init system under Ubuntu for The Official Ubuntu Server Book when I discovered that my Ubuntu system did n't have an /etc / inittab file .
Considering that inittab is the core configuration file for init , that missing file piqued my curiosity .
Soon I discovered that not only had it been replaced , but that change happened years ago and I never noticed until now !
If you 're new to Linux , you might need a quick tutorial about init .
The System V init system governs how Linux starts .
After the kernel loads , the System V init program ( / sbin / init ) starts .
This program then launches other scripts that mount file systems and start core services ; in the case of a desktop system , init then ultimately starts X so you can log in .
One of the core characteristics of System V init is its use of runlevels .
Runlevels define up to seven different states of the system , each having an associated number .
When init switches to a particular runlevel , it starts or stops certain programs based on that runlevel 's settings .
For instance , when you tell init to change to runlevel 0 , it prepares to halt the computer , shuts down services on the system , unmounts the file systems , and ( if your power management works ) powers off the system .
Runlevel 6 does much the same thing , except that at the end the system reboots .
Do We Still Have Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 's Sons ?
Finally , after having been held in U.S. CIA and military custody for more than four years while being subjected to “ all appropriate pressure ” by “ interrogators ” employing their “ full range of permissible techniques , ” the former student at North Carolina ’s Chowan College and North Carolina A & T , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , has finally claimed to have directed just about every major terrorism attack against the United States over the past fifteen years .
From the techniques that we have read about , one has to wonder what took him so long to start singing like a canary .
But little known to most Americans , no matter how closely they might follow the news , the torture by whatever name one might choose to call it , is not even the worst of it .
According to a March 2003 report that appeared in the Washington , DC , area only in the little - read Washington Times , the United States government has his two young sons in its custody .
As reported by Olga Craig of the Sunday Telegraph of London on March 9 , 2003 :
The boys [ Yousef al - Khalid , 9 , and his brother , Abed al - Khalid , 7 ] have been held by the Pakistani authorities but …they were flown to America where they will be questioned about their father .
CIA interrogators confirmed that the boys were staying at a secret address where they were being encouraged to talk about their father 's activities .
" We are handling them with kid gloves , " said one official .
" After all , they are only little children , but we need to know as much about their father 's recent activities as possible .
We have child psychologists on hand at all times and they are given the best of care . "
To the knowledge of this writer , nothing further about Mohammed ’s sons has appeared in the news , so we may assume that that is where matters stand .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ’s sons , who would now be 13 and 11 , have apparently been incarcerated somewhere in the United States for four years now , and all that time they have been at the tender mercies of the Central Intelligence Agency .
Now there may still be some innocents among us who will readily believe that the CIA has been giving them nothing but “ the best of care , ” but that could hardly include anyone with the imagination to put himself in Mohammed ’s place .
These determined continued believers in the word of people who have been caught in lies repeatedly might also swallow the assertion that we nabbed these moppets to pump them for vital information , never mind that this kidnapping flies in the face of everything that is legal and decent and seems to be just another part of systematic U.S. practice .
If our purpose was simply to question them about their father ’s activities , one might ask , why did we find it necessary to take them into custody and to bring them to the United States ?
No , the lead sentence in the Sunday Telegraph story says it all ; the children “ are being used by the CIA to force their father to talk . ”
As an unnamed CIA official is quoted , “ His sons are important to him .
The promise of their release and their return to Pakistan may be the psychological lever we need to break him . "
He sure did take a lot longer than Nikolai Bukharin or Grigory Zinoviev back in the late 1930s in Moscow , but now it looks like he has pretty thoroughly broken and has confessed to everything that we wanted him to , and more .
Do you think we will soon be reading stories in the mainstream media that his two precious ones have now been allowed to return to their families , or will the incarcerators be as true to their word as they have been in the case of Palestinian - American professor , Sami Al - Arian ?
Some Questions for the " Mastermind "
If he is , indeed , the 9 - 11 mastermind , I surely would like to ask him a question or two , questions you can be sure will never be asked should Mohammed ever get his day in court .
The first would be how on earth he was able to persuade Osama and the boys that the plan would have any chance at all to succeed .
From the beginning , it depended upon complete ineptitude on the part of America ’s air defenses .
Even though Tom Clancy , a man who seems to be on the best of terms with the Pentagon crowd , had already written two novels , Debt of Honor and Executive Orders , in which terrorists hijack airliners with the intent of crashing them into important buildings , the very notion that someone would actually do it was beyond our leaders ’ wildest imagination , we have been told .
Though the top U.S. bulb might be an exceptionally dim one , why would one make grandiose plans that depend utterly upon such unimaginably low wattage up and down the chain of command ?
Would n’t Mohammed have to be more than a mastermind , but a master mind reader ?
More than that , would n’t it even have required a degree of clairvoyance that would surely have made the plan very hard to sell to superiors ?
The hijackers would all have to be able to get through security without their weapons being detected and those weapons would have to be perceived as lethal enough to allow them to control the far larger numbers of passengers and crew of the airplanes .
What are the chances , really , of so many people behaving so much like sheep ?
“ Sorry , Khalid , ” I can hear Osama saying , “ Go back to the drawing board and come up with something a bit simpler that has a greater likelihood of success , ” and we have n’t even mentioned the need for virtuoso piloting and navigating performances by novice pilots on harrowing suicide missions .
If preserving our security were our real concern — and , indeed , if the confession was real — we would be treated to a full explanation of how this bunch of zealots pulled off their miraculous attack , but if I were you I would not be holding my breath waiting for it .

Another representation of what will likely become a prevalent topic in upcoming days : the Exter pyramid .
When the system works , the various layers are in equilibrium .
When the system is broken , like it is now , the Fed and all Central Banks try to refill the pyramid from the bottom - up with every single dollar they print .
The current temporary calm is all Bernanke can hope to achieve before $ 2 quadrillion of liquidity collapses onto whatever truly tangible assets exist .
They do n't call it a pyramid scheme for nothing .
And by assets , we are not talking about the crap that the Fed collateralizes against in its Discount Window and Primary Dealer Lending Facility taxpayer handouts .
And for the goldbugs : $ 2 quadrillion ( mythical liquidity ) collapsing into $ 2 trillion ( hard assets ) : can you spell $ 1 million an ounce of gold ?
( Because even S&P would likely rate any company with 1000 x book ( imaginary to real asset ratio ) at most an AAA - ... Maybe )
It is starting to get interesting .

By putting more emphasis on the symbolism of a failed NATO membership bid than the unglamorous work of energy reform , the U.S. did no favor for Ukraine ’s security .
It should be clear that an independent Ukraine must not consume Russian - sourced energy as though it were still part of the Soviet Union .
By contrast , Russia ’s designs on Ukraine are hardly idealistic .
At the NATO summit last year , Vladimir Putin reportedly remarked to former president George W. Bush , “ You understand , George , that Ukraine is n’t even a country .
What is Ukraine ?
Part of its territory is Eastern Europe , and part of it , a significant part , was given by us . ”
Political bullies can be clever at implanting a grain of truth in their predatory barbs .
Like other European nations , Ukraine ’s ethnicity is mixed and its borders were not God -given .
These things emerged through collisions of tribes , ethnic intermingling and considerable bloodshed over centuries .
Western Ukraine — Galicia and Bukovina — were Hapsburg lands and never part of the czarist empire .
The Crimean peninsula was transferred from the Russian Republic to Soviet Ukraine by Nikita Khrushchev in 1954 , when both were part of the Soviet Union .
Ukraine faces deep identity issues .
Ethnic Russians are roughly 20 percent of the population , and many more Ukrainians speak Russian .
The languages are close , like High German and Bavarian or Danish and Swedish .
Europe prides itself on what Freud called “ the narcissism of small differences . ”
However , Ukrainian nationalists would be wise not to overplay their hand , as Mr. Yushchenko often has done on sensitive language and historical issues .
In the 21st century , Ukraine needs to pursue its own path as a pluralist democracy and emerging market , balancing Western integration with a respect for its older cultural roots and affinities .
Despite the present economic crisis and wide dissatisfaction with the political elite , Ukraine has a bright future .
It has fertile land , solid industry and well - endowed human capital .
Fashion is temporary and expensive .
Style is timeless and affordable .

Depression is often viewed as the “ common cold ” of mental disorders , because it is so prevalent in our lives .
The lifetime prevalence of depression suggests that more than 1 in 9 people could be diagnosed with the disorder at one point in their lives .
And unlike some other mental disorders , depression affects virtually every aspect of what you do and how you interact with others .
Every year , it wreaks havoc in millions of Americans ’ lives , especially amongst those who believe it is something you should just “ get over ” on your own .
Here are seven common myths about depression , and the facts that answer them .
1. Depression means I ’m really “ crazy ” or just weak .
While depression is indeed a serious mental disorder , it is no more serious than most other mental disorders .
Having a mental disorder does n’t mean you ’re “ crazy , ” it just means you have a concern that is negatively impacting how you live your life .
Left unaddressed , this concern can cause a person significant distress and problems in their relationships and life .
Depression can strike anyone , at any time — whether you ’re “ weak ” or strong , it knows no bounds .
Some of the strongest people I ’ve met are people who ’ve coped with depression in their lives .
2. Depression is a medical disease , just like diabetes .
While some pharmaceutical - influenced marketing propaganda might simplify depression into a medical disease , depression is not — according to our knowledge and science at this time — simply a pure medical disease .
It is a complex disorder ( called a mental disorder or mental illness ) that reflects its basis in psychological , social , and biological roots .
While it has neurobiological components , it is no more of a pure medical disease than ADHD or any other mental disorder .
Treatment of depression that focuses solely on its medical or physical components — e.g. , through medications alone — often results in failure .
Get to know the risk factors for depression .
3. Depression is just an extreme form of sadness or grief .
In most cases , depression is not just ordinary sadness or grief over a loss .
If it were ordinary sadness or grief , most people would feel better just over time .
In depression , time alone does n’t help , nor does willpower ( “ Pull yourself up and stop feeling so sorry for yourself ! ” ) .
Depression is overwhelming feelings of sadness and hopelessness , every day , for no reason whatsoever .
Most people with depression have little or no motivation , nor energy and have serious problems sleeping .
And it ’s just not for one day — it ’s for weeks or months on end , with no end in sight .
4. Depression just affects old people , losers and women .
Depression — like all mental disorders — does not discriminate based upon age , gender , or personality .
While generally more women than men are diagnosed with depression , men suffer for it all the more since many people in society believe that men should n’t show signs of weakness ( even a man ’s own upbringing may reinforce such messages ) .
And while aging brings many changes in our life , depression is not a normal part of the aging process .
In fact , teenagers and young adults grapple with depression just as much as seniors do .
Some of the world ’s most successful people have also had to deal with depression , people such as Abraham Lincoln , Theodore Roosevelt , Winston Churchill , George Patton , Sir Isaac Newton , Stephen Hawking , Charles Darwin , J.P. Morgan and Michelangelo .
So being a loser is not a prerequisite to being depressed .
5 . I ’ll have to be on medications or in treatment for the rest of my life .
While some doctors and even some mental health professionals believe that medications may be a long - term solution for people with depression , the truth is that most people with depression receive treatment for it for a specific period of time in their lives , and then end that treatment .
While the exact amount of time will vary from person to person based upon the severity of the disorder and how well the various treatments may work for each individual , most people who have depression do not need to be on medications for the rest of their lives ( or be in treatment for the rest of their lives ) .
In fact , a lot of research suggests that most people can be treated for depression successfully in as little as 24 weeks with a combination of psychotherapy , and if needed , medications .
6 . All I need is an antidepressant to treat depression effectively .
Sorry , no , it ’s not as easy as popping a pill .
While certainly you can have an antidepressant medication quickly prescribed to you by your primary care physician , you ’re unlikely to feel any beneficial effects from that medication for 6 or more weeks in most cases .
In two - thirds of patients , that first medication wo n’t even work !
Combined psychotherapy treatment with medication is the recommended gold standard for the treatment of depression .
Anything else is going to be significantly less effective , meaning most people will suffer with their depressive symptoms longer than they need to .
7 . I ’m doomed !
My parents ( or grandparents or great uncle ) had depression , and is n’t it inherited ?
While in the past there ’s been research to suggest the heritability of depression , more recent studies have called into question how much of depression really is genetic .
The upshot ?
While researchers continue to explore the neurobiology of mental disorders like depression , having a relative with depression only marginally increases your risk for getting depression ( 10 to 15 % ) .
Remember , too , that relatives impart a lot of their own coping strategies upon us in our childhood development — strategies that may not always be the most effective when dealing with things like depression ( making one more vulnerable to it ) .

7 Myths of Depression
I just wanted to thank you and the team at Creative Coffins for all your work in providing the bluebell coffin for my mother ’s funeral in March of this year .
I was very impressed with your company , I found you to be efficient , courteous and responsive , and I really appreciate the time and effort you put into the design process to make sure that we got what we wanted , and to find exactly the right kind of bluebells !
The end result was just perfect , and so many people spoke to us at the funeral to say how appropriate they thought the coffin was for my mother , both in the bluebell design and in it ’s eco credentials .
I was particularly concerned that my brother would be happy with the design , and he said to me that when he thinks of the funeral he has a striking mental image of the beauty of the coffin and feels that it will be a lasting and wholeheartedly positive memory for him .
I feel just the same , and I think I can speak for everyone by saying that the coffin went a long way to helping us to create the warm , uplifting atmosphere that we wanted – these occasions are never happy , exactly , but I think we got as close as possible to achieving our aim .
Hulu fans can breathe a temporary breath of relief .
On the conference call explaining its acquisition of NBC , Comcast said it does n't plan on changing Hulu 's operations .
When asked by analyst if there would be a " Hulu premium " -- a version of the site where viewers have to pay to watch shows -- the response was that 's " not in the cards . "
In fact , Comcast 's COO Stephen Burke says the " Hulu strategy is smart and appropriate . "
There 's lots of broadcast shows on Hulu .
Not much cable content .
That 's how it shoud be .
Cable content will go to TV Everywhere , Comcast 's authentication initiative .
Burke says Hulu is a " complementary product " to TV Everywhere .
That might come as news to the other partners in Hulu .
NBC only owns a third of the company .
News Corp , another owner , has already started saying it wants Hulu to have a premium channel to charge for certain content .
UPDATE : On a later call , Burke conceded that it was n't his call , as NBC is just a minority investor .
But , he 's happy with how Hulu is operating now .
He did n't want to say Comcast would be for or against a premium channel .
Islandsbanki
With just over 70 operating plants offering capacity of around 3,100 megawatts , the United States is the global leader in generating electrical power from geothermal resources , according to a recent report from Islandsbanki , an Icelandic bank that provides investment and financial services to the sustainable energy sector .
Of course , this represents less than 1 percent of the electricity generation of the United States , and while estimates from the bank ’s “ United States Geothermal Energy Market Report ” suggest the country could greatly expand this capacity , securing financing for geothermal projects remains dicey .
Using current technologies , the report found , the United States could generate another 40,000 megawatts from geothermal resources , while the development of new enhanced geothermal systems could bring an additional 517,800 megawatts online .
Geothermal resources also have the advantage of providing continuous base - load power at a competitive cost compared with alternatives , the study suggested .
“ Taking into account the long life span of a geothermal plant , its up - time , base - load capacity and predictability , it provides a levelized cost of electricity that is very cost competitive against not only renewable , but also traditional energy sources . ”
Still , “ financing and the availability of equity will remain the key challenge for the geothermal sector , ” as interest in geothermal projects by investors lags behind wind and solar projects .
Large capital costs required for drilling and the risk to this capital until the resource has been proven creates an “ investment bottleneck , ” said C.J. Arrigo of Glacier Partners , a corporate advisory firm focused on the geothermal - energy sector and authors of “ Geothermal Economics 101 . ”
For a typical project , they assume 50 percent of the cost is spent on drilling four to six production wells that provide heat , water and flow rates required to operate the plant .
Exploration technologies do a good job of locating the heat source , but have less success ensuring a good flow of water .
An average 20 percent failure rate during this exploration and drilling phase represents more risk than most investors are willing to bear , said Mr. Arrigo in a telephone interview .
The stimulus package should improve the financing situation .
Due to a lack of debt financing caused by the credit crisis , the package provides loan guarantees .
And because of the decreased tax appetite for production tax credits , the package offers investment tax credits and cash grants in lieu of credits .
The grant system , administered by the Treasury Department , allows the project developers to receive an upfront payment equivalent to the value of any tax credits , which should prove especially useful for geothermal projects .
“ These will all help to get some banks back into the lending business for geothermal , ” said Alex Richter , the director of Islandsbanki ’s Sustainable Energy group in an e-mail message .
Utilities obligated to comply with state quotas for renewable - energy sourcing will also favor geothermal and “ pay a higher price for electricity from geothermal in power - purchase agreements , ” Mr. Richter said , because it provides reliable , base - load power compared with wind and solar .
Twenty - nine states have enacted standards that will require utilities to use a specified percentage of renewables in their energy portfolio .
Iceland meets roughly 99 percent of its electrical demand with renewables : 30 percent from geothermal and the rest from hydroelectric .
Also , almost all heating needs in the country are provided by geothermal systems .
After its own banking crisis , the country has two major resources to draw on : its fishing industry and renewable - energy expertise .
Mr. Richter said he expected that “ energy and particularly geothermal will play a major role in rebuilding Iceland ’s economy . ”
月 間3000 万PVの大規模サイトの運用費が月額4万円!?
月間3000 万PV相当の膨大なトラフィックを楽々とさばく大規模サイトが、月額4万円弱で運用されている。
Google App Engine（以下 、App Engine）が普及するにつれて、そんな驚愕の国内事例も登場しつつあります。GClueがApp Engine上で実装したmixiアプリモバイルモバイルには、1日100万PV以上のアクセスが集中している状態でもサービスのレスポンス低下やダウンは皆無だそうです。1日の運用コスト（グーグルへの支払い料金）は$12程度で、プログラマ以外に専任のサーバ管理者などはまったく不要とのことです。
こうし たApp Engineのけた違いのスケーラビリティやコストパフォーマンスといった大きな「価値」を得るには、われわれエンジニアがそれ相応の「発想の転換」を受け入れる必要があります。
前回の 「素朴な Bigtable、できること できないこと」でも説明したとおり、App Engineの中核をなすデータストア「 Bigtable 」は、「キーを指定して値を読み書きする」という単純な機能しかサポートしていない分散Key-Valueストア（分散KVS）です。この素朴なデータストアの大きな制約を受け入れ、そのうえで複雑なWebアプリケーションのロジックをいかにして実装できるか工夫していくことが、この発想の転換へのはじめの一歩となります。
繰り返すが 、Bigtableの検索機能は「 スキャン」だけ
前回も説明したとおり 、Bigtableは、リレーショナルデータベース（RDB）におけるクエリやジョインを一切サポートしておらず、以下の2種類の機能だけを提供しています。
キーに基づく行 のCRUD
キーに基づく 「 スキャン 」
「 キーに基づく行のCRUD」とは、個々の行に割り当てられた「キー」を指定して、行のCRUD（追加、取得、更新、削除）を行うことです。一方、「キーに基づくスキャン」とは、キーの前方一致検索、もしくは、範囲指定検索により、複数の行を一括取得する機能です。
図 1 「 キーによるスキャン 」 の例
例えば上記 の 「 スキャンの例1」では、テーブル「Emp」に対して、キーが「02」で始まる行を前方一致検索でスキャンし、「山田」「鈴木」という2行を取得しています。また「スキャンの例2」では、キーが「040」から「070」までの行を範囲指定検索でスキャンし、「吉川 」
「坂田」の2行を得ています。
Bigtable が備える唯一の検索は、このスキャンだけです。つまり、値を条件とした検索は一切実行できません。Bigtableについて学び始めた当初、筆者は「これでどうやってアプリケーションロジックを書くのだろう」と悩みました。しかし、App
Engineでは、この問いに答えるソリューションを提供しています。それは、Bigtable上でRDBライクなクエリ機能を実装する「Datastoreサービス」です。
Datastoreサービスと3つのAPI
Datastoreサービスとは 、App Engine上で動作す るPythonもしくはJavaアプリケーションがBigtableにアクセスするためのサービスであり、主に以下の3つの機能を提供します。
キーに基づくエンティティのCRUD エンティティに対するクエリ 数エンティティを対象としたトランザクションのACID保証
ここで 「 エンティティ」とは、PythonやJavaの個々のオブジェクトを保存したBigtableの行を表します。Datastoreサービスでは、このエンティティに対してキーに基づくCRUDが可能です。加えて、RDBライクな「クエリ」によるエンティティの検索を実行できるのが重要なポイントです。App EngineのJava版の場合、これらのDatastoreサービスの機能は、以下の3つのAPIを通じて利用できます。
JDO （Java Data Objects ） JPA （Java Persistence API ） 低レベ ルAPI （Low - level API ）
これらのうち 、 「 JDO 」 および「 JPA 」 は、JCP （Java Community Process）を通じて策定された標準のデータ永続化APIです。とはいえ、JDOやJPAの機能をフル実装しているわけではなく、あくまで「Bigtableで実装できる機能のみ標準APIに合わせて提供している」といった位置付けです。
一方、低レベ ルAPI（以下、LL） はApp Engine独自のAPIであり、ほかの2つのAPIに比べてより“ 生の” Bigtableに近い機能を提供します（なお、以下ではJDOに基づいて説明を続けますが、これら3つのAPIのいずれを選択すべきかについては、本稿最後の章をご覧ください）。
キーに基づく行 のCRUD
さて、1つめの機能である「キーに基づくエンティティのCRUD」は、先に記したBigtableの「キーによる行のCRUD」と同じ機能です。以下は、JDOによるエンティティ保存の記述例です。
PersistenceManager pm = PMF.get ().getPersistenceManager( ) ; Emp e = new Emp ( " 山田 " , 18 , " D5 " ) ; try { pm.makePersistent(e ) ; } finally { pm.close ( ) ; }
この例のように 、PersistentManagerクラスのmakePersistent()メソッドに続いてcloseメソッドを呼び出すことで、JavaオブジェクトであるEmpをBigtableの1行として保存できます。ちなみに、こうしたCRUD処理に要する平均時間は数10ms程度で、前回説明したとおり、たとえ数千万件のエンティティが保存されていても処理時間は変化しません。
またBigtableでは、ACID特性の保証の範囲が行単位であったのに対し、Datastoreサービスでは「エンティティ・グループ」と呼ばれる複数のエンティティの集まりを対象としてACID特性の保証が可能です。よって、例えば「Deptエンティティ」と「 Empエンティティ」を同じエンティティ・グループに含めておけば、トランザクションの競合時でも不整合の発生を防ぐことができ、一般的なRDBと同等の信頼性を確保できます。
Datastoreサービスの「 クエリ 」
Datastoreサービスのもう1つの機能である「クエリ」とは、エンティティのプロパティ（フィールド）の値を条件とする検索機能です。以下は、JDOを用いてクエリを実行するコードの例です。
uery query = pm.newQuery ( " select from Emp " + " where age >= _startAge & age <= _endAge " + " order by age asc " + " parameters int _startAge , int _end Age " ) List < Emp > results = ( List < Emp > ) query.execute ( 20 , 40 ) ;
この例では 、JDOが定めるSQLライクなクエリ言語である「JDOQL」でクエリ条件を記述し、Queryオブジェクトのexecute()メソッドを呼び出してクエリを実行しています。上記のクエリは「ageプロパティが20〜40のEmpエンティティ一覧を取得し、ageプロパティの昇順でソートする」という意味です。こうしたクエリは、通常150〜200ms程度の時間で処理されます。
このように、一見する とDatastoreで はRDBのような
「テーブルのカラム値を条件とした検索」が実行できているように見えます。しかし繰り返し説明したとおり、Bigtableはあくまで「スキャン」しか実行できません。この間を埋めるカギが、「シングルプロパティインデックス」です。次ページで解説します。

I do n't know why this drawing shows a tank at the front of the truck , but I guess that in Russia people drive T - 90s like in the US people drive Fords .
I wish the technology was so cheap that this could be implemented for real , because I 'm sure it would save a lot of lives on the road .

About halfway through the very funny , very disturbing , very ethnic new film A Serious Man , the modern - day Job who is the serious man in ­ question climbs up on to the roof of his ghastly 1960s Minneapolis suburban home and tries to adjust the antenna to improve his TV reception .
Beleaguered on all fronts – conjugally , professionally , medically – Larry Gopnik , a dorky physics professor who may be about to lose his job and is very likely to lose his family , is a bright , principled Jewish man whose children have begged him to fix the antenna so they can watch F Troop , an idiotic 1960s comedy .
Many of Larry 's travails unfold as songs from Jefferson Airplane 's seminal 1967 LP Surrealistic Pillow play in the background .
With his khakis , his short - sleeved shirts , his nerdy glasses , and his stereotypically inconsequential name , Gopnik is clearly not a Surrealistic Pillow kind of guy .
Once on the roof , Gopnik spies a sultry , mysterious , not terribly classy next - door neighbour sunbathing nude in the privacy of her fenced - in backyard .
She is a stoner and looks nothing like his wife , who is about to divorce him .
The architecture , the locale , the attire , and the way the scene is shot capture majestically the mood of spiritual desolation and endemic weirdness that defined suburban US life in the 60s .
It evokes the opening scenes from The Straight Story , the 1999 film about a 73 - year - old man who drives a lawn mower 300 miles across Iowa to see his dying brother , with whom he fell out decades earlier .
As I took in the amazing rooftop sequence in this troubling but rewarding movie , I forgot who had really made it and thought : " Gee , I never knew David Lynch was Jewish . "
Lynch , the half - Finnish , all Presbyterian maker of The Straight Story , is not Jewish ; the Coen brothers , who made A Serious Man , most emphatically are .
Yet despite all the trademark humour , quirkiness and sarcasm that characterises their film , A Serious Man does not feel like a typical Coen brothers movie .
It lacks the tongue - in - cheek goofiness of Fargo , Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski , the stately depression - era charm of Miller 's Crossing , the overwrought noir of Blood Simple , the unrelenting darkness of No Country for Old Men .
If it is possible to imagine a Woody Allen script with all the schtick exfoliated , and then filmed by Lynch , that master of conveying the under - the - skin bizarreness of small - town America , you have A Serious Man .
Although perplexing and unnerving , with a finale that will not satisfy all tastes , the Coen brothers ' latest film is the most daring project they have ever undertaken .
It is mordant .
It is philosophical .
It addresses all the big questions .
It is frequently hilarious .
And it feels like somewhere along the line David Lynch took over .
A Serious Man falls into that category of films that , for whatever reason , do not have the same texture or mood as a director 's other films .
It may be a decision the film - maker has made deliberately , or it may be entirely inadvertent , but these films stand apart from the other movies in a director 's body of work .
It is as if the film - maker abruptly decided to take a holiday from his own personality and make a film in somebody else 's style .
These films are not always successful , and not always memorable , but there is definitely something appealing about the genre itself : included among the successes are Martin Scorsese 's The Age of Innocence , a high - society , drawing - room melodrama with nary a gangster in sight ; Peter Weir 's Green Card , a lighthearted comedy starring Gerard Depardieu that Weir filmed between the lugubrious Dead Poet 's Society and the even more depressing Fearless ;
The Bridges of Madison County , one of the very few Clint Eastwood movies in which nobody dies , and the only truly romantic film he has ever made .
By stripping away Robert James Waller 's appalling prose and chopping the story down to its essentials , Eastwood made a touching motion picture that has absolutely nothing in common with Unforgiven , Pale Rider , The Outlaw Josey Wales , White Hunter Black Heart or even Bird .
Immediately after finishing The Bridges of Madison County , Eastwood directed and starred in Absolute Power , a thriller about a murder involving the US president .
Eastwood 's sabbatical from his own career was over .
Not every film in this genre is as successful as The Age of Innocence and The Bridges of Madison County .
To this day , no one knows what Ang Lee was thinking of when he made Hulk , one of those catastrophes so bad that its sequel seems like the industry 's personal apology to the movie - going public for what has gone before .
Windtalkers , though reliably sadistic , was a tremendous disappointment to John Woo fans , in part because it takes place on assorted beaches in the south Pacific during the second world war , and is therefore devoid of the ominous gangsterland charm that characterises Woo 's Hong Kong films .
For my money , Woody Allen 's strangest project ever is Cassandra 's Dream , his benighted attempt to make a suspense film .
After the failure of this London - based drama , Allen directed Vicky Cristina Barcelona , the same film he has been making for the last 20 years .
His fans adored it .
In certain cases , a film does not bear a director 's stamp because he is renting himself out for a project he did not originate , or because he is at the tail end of his career .
Inside Man is a passable caper film , with serviceable performances by Denzel Washington and Clive Owen – but , with its complete lack of social commentary , it certainly does n't have the feel of any other Spike Lee film .
It is work for hire .
This is an apt , if unfortunate , description of The Next Best Thing , John Schlesinger 's disastrous 2000 incursion into Madonna territory , and one of the worst films of the millennium .
It is a sad commentary on our times that the man who started out making Billy Liar , Midnight Cowboy and Sunday Bloody Sunday should end up in Mondo Ciccone .
Another curiosity is Werner Herzog 's Rescue Dawn , essentially The Great Escape remade during a different war , this time Vietnam .
Entirely lacking in the all - encompassing strangeness of The Enigma of Kasper Hauser , or Aguirre , The Wrath of God , or Fitzcarraldo , or just about any other Herzog film including Little Dieter Needs to Fly ( the 1997 Herzog documentary on which it is actually based ) , Rescue Dawn is a well - crafted action picture .
And nothing more .
Presumably , Herzog made the film to raise money for other , more interesting projects like Grizzly Man .
And obviously , with Rescue Dawn , Herzog was at a disadvantage from the start : it is hard to make a distinctive , intellectually engaging motion picture when your leading man is Christian Bale .
Small , perfect jewels
When I was at university I had a professor who said we could learn as much from a writer 's minor works as we could from their major ones .
He also believed that , in some cases , an author 's best book was the one that stood apart from the bulk of their oeuvre – because , when they stepped out of character , they were not seduced into doing the same old routine they had done a dozen times before .
Examples included : James Baldwin's Giovanni's Room , which is not about the African - American experience in the US ;
The Colossus of Maroussi , a beautiful travel book Henry Miller wrote about Greece that does not even slightly extol fleshly pleasures in Paris ; and Thomas Mann 's Confessions of Felix Krull , Confidence Man , an oddity that is infinitely less portentous – and far more readable – than the novels that won Mann the Nobel prize .
All of these books are small , perfect jewels that bear little or no resemblance to the works that made the authors famous .
Films like A Serious Man and The Age of Innocence , and even Quentin Tarantino 's sublimely goofy Inglourious Basterds , all fit into this category .
The nicest thing about these strange interludes is that they hold out the possibility that other directors might follow suit .
I for one would love it if Michael Bay took a break from movies like Armageddon and Transformers and tried a musical instead , perhaps a long - overdue remake of My Fair Lady , starring Jean - Claude van Damme and Penélope Cruz in the roles originally made famous by Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn .
I would also be thrilled to see a Merchant - and - Ivory - type affair directed by Guy Ritchie , with the rustle of crinoline and the echoes of pianofortes everywhere ; perhaps something along the lines of Henry James 's The Wings of the Dove .
Last but certainly not least , I think the public would react quite enthusiastically to a Ridley Scott movie starring Maggie Smith and Joan Plowright as zany spinsters working as tour guides in Vichy in 1942 before striking out alone .
Tea with Monsieur Pétain , that sort of thing .
Or better yet , a Michael Moore documentary extolling the virtues of free trade and paying tribute to Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher .
That 's one I 'd pay to see .
So would Margaret Thatcher .
Four days before the fall of Kabul in November 2001 , Osama bin Laden was still in town .
The Al Qaeda leader ’s movements before and after September 11 are difficult to trace precisely , but , just prior to the attacks , we know that he appeared in Kandahar and urged his followers to evacuate to safer locations in anticipation of U.S. retaliation .
Then , on November 8 , he was in Kabul , despite the fact that U.S. forces and their Afghan allies were closing in on the city .
That morning , while eating a meal of meat and olives , he gave an interview to Hamid Mir , a Pakistani journalist who was writing his biography .
He defended the attacks on New York and Washington , saying , “ America and its allies are massacring us in Palestine , Chechnya , Kashmir , and Iraq .
The Muslims have the right to attack America in reprisal . ”
Six months later , when I met Mir in Pakistan , he told me that the Al Qaeda leader had , on that day , appeared to be in remarkably good spirits .
Kabul fell on November 12 , and bin Laden , along with other Al Qaeda leaders , fled to Jalalabad , a compact city in eastern Afghanistan surrounded by lush fruit groves .
( He was quite familiar with the area , having maintained a compound in a Jalalabad suburb in the 1990s . )
Tracking bin Laden closely was Gary Berntsen , a bear - sized CIA officer with a pronounced Long Island accent , who arrived in Kabul on the day it fell .
Berntsen had been serving in Latin America on September 11 when he was yanked to run the CIA ’s fast - moving ground operations in Afghanistan .
It was a perfect job for an operative with a distinctly independent and aggressive style .
By November 14 , Berntsen was receiving a stream of intelligence reports from the Northern Alliance that the Al Qaeda leader was in Jalalabad , giving pep talks to an ever - growing caravan of fighters .
Berntsen dispatched an eight - man CIA team to the city .
To provide them with local guides , he made contact with Hazarat Ali—an Afghan commander , longtime opponent of the Taliban , and nose - picking semi-illiterate .
Ali sent three teenaged fighters to escort the U.S. team into Jalalabad , which was now crawling with fleeing Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters .
But bin Laden was n’t in Jalalabad for long .
Following the fall of Kabul , Jalalabad descended into chaos ; no one was in charge for at least a week .
Abdullah Tabarak , a Moroccan who is alleged to be one of bin Laden ’s bodyguards , reportedly told interrogators that , during the month of Ramadan , which began on November 17 , bin Laden and his top deputy , Egyptian surgeon Ayman Al Zawahiri , left Jalalabad and headed about 30 miles south .
Their destination was Tora Bora , a series of mountain caves near the Pakistani border .
Berntsen ’s team remained one step behind them , for now .
Tora Bora was not yet a familiar name to many Americans .
But what would unfold there over the subsequent days remains , eight years later , the single most consequential battle of the war on terrorism .
Presented with an opportunity to kill or capture Al Qaeda ’s top leadership just three months after September 11 , the United States was instead outmaneuvered by bin Laden , who slipped into Pakistan , largely disappeared from U.S. radar , and slowly began rebuilding his organization .

One is a copy of the fundamental Tibetan medical classic Gyu Shi ( ' Four Tantras ' ) written in the 12th century ; the other is a manuscript on compounding medicines , which was composed by the members of his medical family ( going back four generations ) and takes into account the knowledge the doctors of this lineage have gained through trial and error .

In an open letter to the diocese 's 230,000 parishioners , Bishop W. Francis Malooly called bankruptcy a " painful decision " that he had hoped to avoid .
However , he wrote , it would ensure that funds will be available for all victims , not just the first who go to trial .
Liberty demands tolerance .
Liberty fosters diversity .
Intolerance , or more precisely , the fear of those who are not yet assimilated , stands at the center of US politics .
The left and the right use this fear to herd folks towards the center .
Independents were already there , thus their independence only means they do n't have to be led to the center .
Libertarian leaders use this fear to herd their faithful into the tippy top peak of the Nolan Chart scale .
For all of these groups , anyone who is not perfectly assimilated is an enemy to be feared .
Fear always fuels bullying , procedural maneuvering , and a fanatical devotion to the faith that their herd can eliminate the feared beings once and for all .
Progressives have always been up front about it .
They dislike liberty and have no tolerance for diversity of thought and faith .
They believe all tactics are justified to eliminate liberty and enhance conformity through the power of the State .
Their faith is in the benevolence and wisdom of big government .
Since this has been disproven throughout history it takes a powerful faith to discount the evidence at hand .
The Religious Right dislikes liberty also because it puts man above God 's word .
To be fair , most will embrace liberty right up to the point they believe it allows something God intended to exclude from our so called free will .
Since God was n't up to the task , the right wing feels it necessary to fill in for God 's lack in this area .
If your flag winds up at the end of a convoluted chain of reasoning that challenges God 's intentions or his plans for our country or his plans for our country as determined by Israel , your flag is toast .
The patriotic , nationalistic and nostalgic right overlap with the religious right but the religious political leaders set the course .
At turns , but together , the right and the left grow our government and increase the oppression of liberty .
For both of these groups who now control our politics , our media and our government , fear is the power that is needed to obliterate morals , ethics and conscience .
Fear and faith can subvert any reality into a surreal nightmare .
The libertarians and anti-political navel gazing academics will shout from their little tippy top niche at the top of their lungs that individuals have rights .
But they will not do a damn thing to prevent the Right or the Left from taking those rights to feed the homogenization machine .
I mean they will not do anything constructive .
They will shout and write .
They will cite quotes and wear patriot outfits for the press .
They will preach to their choir with a fervor that rivals Brother Love 's Traveling Salvation Show .
They will revel and delight in creating public spectacles .
They will emote and wail with outrage but they will steadfastly refuse to participate in constructive political behavior aimed at wresting control of our government from the left and right progressives who now rule the land .
They deliberately choose self - marginalization .
They are to politics what karaoke night at the local watering hole is to Woodstock .
Only a magnificent faith could possibly shroud such a blatant absurdity .
Their faith is n't necessarily rooted in man over God nor in God over man .
No , neither of those faiths is powerful enough to obscure such obvious futility from a group who simultaneously prides itself on being rational and logical .
It takes great power to bring those contradictions together in one belief system .
Their faith is that rights , like the emperor 's new clothes , become more real with each increment of better description and definition .
They believe that with the right definitions and constraints , rights will suddenly manifest into world - changing non-forceful force that will non-forcefully eliminate all diversity of thought and thus eliminate the need for the notion of community ( State ) and enable their utopian world of pure anarchy through homogeneity .
Every last human will suddenly fit into the tippy top niche in the Nolan Chart scale and we 'll all live happily ever after …and best of all , NO ACTUAL CONSTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR NEED BE DEMONSTRATED !!!
Is it possible to create a society where tolerance of those who have different faiths is enabled , fostered or even guaranteed ?
Our constitution was an attempt to do that but we have come to the point of mutually assured fear - fueled oppression as we slide into the cesspool of Socialism under that very constitution .
Words on paper do not change the behavior of individuals .
Defining ever more rigorously those desired outcomes , specifying in endless detail the nature of what is a right or what is a sin will not prevent individuals from opposing those rights or committing those sins .
No plan that rests on the premise that “ If everyone would just … ” is a viable plan in the real world .
It is just as absurd to pursue a plan for everyone to put the needs of strangers above the needs of their own offspring and self as it is to pursue a plan requiring that everyone must be governed by the constraints of any one religion .
It makes no difference if that religion is diety based , ego based or rights based .
The intolerance inherent in every religious homogenization effort is used as a justification for force to oppress non-believers .
Libertarians will claim to be against force because their faith conveniently shrouds the logical necessity for force to be used to eliminate diversity and guarantee their “ freedom from ” any struggle to defend liberty .
The proof is simple .
I am that proof .
So long as I exist I will defend the right for individuals to form communities and enforce the will of those collective participants .
Therefore , force must be used to prevent me from defending the right for individuals to form communities .
There is no alternative .
Without the application of overwhelming force , the notion of “ freedom from ” is just a thought exercise aimed at rationalizing one 's unrealistic expectations placed on others ; entitlements .
I love the balance , with all the logic and reason applied to the descriptions and definitions of the tenets of their rights - based faith , there is nothing left but absurd fantasy to describe the way to achieve their goal .
I call the force implied in the logic of a rights - based , Rothbardian utopia the “ unicorn force . ”
( I really liked “ the Emperor 's New Force but opted for the “ Unicorn Force and this parenthetical disclaimer )
No libertarians believe in the Unicorn Force yet their faith requires its existence .
No wonder there are so few libertarians ; it must be really hard to live in such a quandary day in and day out .
In my lifetime of political consumption and participation I have never met an individual besides Ron Paul who has consistently understood the implications of force and the necessity of constructive political behavior to avoid being logically inconsistent or hypocritical .
The power of the rights - based faith even shrouds Ron Paul 's most important messages and examples from his libertarian , would - be supporters .
They remain independents or LP members yet claim to have a great affinity with Ron Paul .
The absurdity and contradiction is startling sometimes .
Fear and faith so easily combine to nullify logic and reason ( and Hope and Change . )

Hard drives gone bad do n't always have to end up in the trash .
Miguel Rivera , a systems administrator , took a pile of used drives , gutted some and turned them into beautiful sculptures .
" The overall concept was to make something out of just hard drive parts and pieces , " says Rivera .
" I wanted it to look solid and heavy so I leaned towards just using metal – no plastic or gluing things together . "
The results are creations that almost take your breath away in their complexity and beauty .
Rivera 's first sculpture was made out of a standard 3.5 - inch hard drive , and designed to evoke a car .
" It was n't really difficult putting this one together since I did n't have to modify anything other than the cover – everything else just screwed on , " he says .
It took 33 hard drives – each wheel made of eight discs from gutted drives , and one intact drive for the body – and a whole weekend to make .
From there , he created his second project , a mini car that took 29 hard drives .
The third project , the " fat boy motorcycle , " was even more complex .
" This one was a bit tricky for me because I just could n't get parts to mix well at first to reflect the look I wanted , " he says .
The bike took about three full weekends to put together .
Rivera , who works at a U.S. Air Force base overseas , says he added a pair of dog tags a Navy chaplain gave him as " a tribute to our selfless troops . "
The front wheel of the bike has eight discs , the rear 28 .
The most complex of Rivera 's creations is a robot he calls his masterpiece .
It took about two weeks to create .
The robot is made of 14 laptop hard drives with 18 additional discs from gutted hard drives and spare parts .
" This piece allowed me to show off some internal pieces of hard drives I was n't able to incorporate with any of the other pieces like using the armatures as weapons . "
Rivera also included a cable management arm from a Dell 2950 into the robot and bent the hard drive covers to show off its insides .
" The hard drive sculptures are a personal challenge and a chance for others to see what the inside of a hard drive looks like in a creative way , " he says .
" It 's my therapy after a five - day , 12 - hour - shift work week . "

The saga of the embattled anti-poverty group ACORN has taken a new twist , with the disclosure of a Justice Department opinion that a vote by Congress to cut off all federal funding to the group should not affect contracts signed before it was passed .
A spokesman for the Republicans in Congress has already blasted the decision as “ shameful . ”
According to The New York Times , soon after Congress voted in September , a lawyer for the Department of Housing and Urban Development asked the Justice Department how it should handle pre-existing contracts with ACORN .
Much of the money which ACORN receives from the federal government is in the form of HUD grants involving the provision of affordable housing .
ADVERTISEMENT
In an October 23 memorandum ( pdf ) , which has just been released , Acting Assistant Attorney General David Barron replied that the language of the bill was ambiguous but his opinion was that those contracts could not be breached “ where doing so would give rise to contractual liability . ”
Barron was specifically concerned with “ cases where performance has already been completed but payment has not been rendered , ” which he argued could raise questions of constitutionality if payment was withheld .
Representative Darrell Issa ( R - CA ) , the ranking minority member on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , quickly issued a statement insisting that “ the bipartisan intent of Congress was clear — no more federal dollars should flow to ACORN . ”
“ Taxpayers should not have to continue subsidizing a criminal enterprise that helped Barack Obama get elected president , ” Issa ’s statement continued .
“ The politicization of the Justice Department to payback one of the president ’s political allies is shameful and amounts to nothing more than old - fashioned cronyism . ”
Ironically , Issa ’s own name has been linked to the politicization of the Bush Justice Department .
He was known as a leading antagonist of fired US Attorney Carol Lam , and his leak in May 2006 of a Border Patrol report suggesting that Lam was lax on the smuggling of illegal immigrants was pivotal in justifying her firing a few months later .

Lam was working on the Brent Wilkes corruption case at the time , but the Bush Justice Department denied that had anything to do with her firing .

So where are we at the end of a long day of reports -- ours and others ' -- flying across the World Wide Web about the Lee / Halladay stunner ?
Not quite there , it appears , but headed in the direction of a huge trade .
A baseball source told the Inquirer tonight that a deal was not totally done .
There were several other indications that it was close .
With a contract extension to be worked out , medical records to be reviewed , and three teams needing to make final decisions , it is no surpise that this is taking time .
The names batted around as future Blue Jays in various reports were pitchers Kyle Drabek , outfielders Michael Taylor or Domonic Brown .
CSNphilly.com had the first report of Drabek being included , which was later followed up on by the Toronto Sun .
Ruben Amaro did not respond to phone calls seeking comment today , and team president David Montgomery said he " could not comment . "
It is the Phillies ' policy never to publicly address trade talks .
Keep this in mind : Even if the Phils lose Drabek in this deal , they would be surrendering less than the package requested in July of Drabek , Brown , J.A. Happ and Anthony Gose for Halladay .
Baseball America considers Drabek a potential no .
2 or 3 starter , and would n’t you give that up to get Halladay ?
We also know that both teams place a higher value on Brown than on Taylor — so if Taylor is a part of this deal instead of Brown , that is considered a discount from the July offer .
The AP reported today that Happ , Brown and Joe Blanton took physicals in Philly today , but there were no other indications that those players were involved .
This information is all tentative and speculative because a deal has not yet been finalized .
There are indications that an official announcement could come within the next day or two .
Until that time , anything can happen .
Once again I hear Joel Spolsky saying the same thing about Linux that I consider wrong .
I ’m sure I ’m not the only one thinking that and I ’m sure I ’m not the only one writing about it , but I ’m going to do it anyway .
Joel ’s position is that administrating Linux must be harder because something like 70 % of the support calls they handle for FogBugz come from Linux while it is less than 30 % of its market .
I ’d agree that for someone that does n’t know anything about administrating , getting a Windows server running is easier than getting a Linux server running .
I think that being an expert in both environments is equally hard .
The sysadmin problems are hard and there are no shortcuts .
But Joel Spolsky point is wrong in one regard : Linux is not an operating system .
I ’ve said it before and I ’ve got many negative comments , mails , messages about it but very few actually got my point .
This is an instance where Linux being taken for an operating system is causing someone pain and thus causing that someone to say something that is not completely right .
Joel makes FogBugz for Windows and Linux .
Does that mean that I can run it on my Windows CE phone ?
It is a Windows , is n’t it ?
It says Windows in the name !
It has a start button !
Well , of course I ca n’t run FogBugz on it .
They ship it for Windows the PC operating system .
Does it work on ReactOS then ?
In a sense it is a Windows PC operating system ; an alternative implementation of one with all the same interfaces and libraries .
Well , of course not .
It work only in the Windows PC operating system produced by Microsoft .
For example , Windows 7 Starter Edition , yes , that one that allows you to run only three apps at the time .
Well , no !
All those things I mentioned are in a sense Windowses as well , yet they are not supported and probably FogBugz does n’t work on them .
Yet , he says he supports Linux .
Saying you support Linux is like saying that you supports computers that have RAM .
It ’s too broad .
Trying to ship something that should run on almost everything wo n’t work .
Be it Linux or anything else .
Linux is only a kernel .
It ’s a kernel used by many different operating systems .
Some of them radically different ( like Android or Chrome OS ) .
If you are a company and make a product supporting it on Linux is crazy .
What should Joel do then ?
He should support operating systems , not kernels .
What operating systems should Joel support ?
I do n’t know , whatever is popular .
I ’d guess Red Hat ’s RHEL , Ubuntu , Debian are probably popular operating systems .
Once you start supporting operating systems instead of kernels the world looks differently .
You do n’t have to deliver a tar.gz ( a compressed archive ) that should compile and run everywhere .
It ’s insane to ship that and it ’s insane to expect users to be able to install them .
I administer various Debian and Ubuntu servers and workstations .
Do you know how often I compile source code that I have n’t written myself ?
Never !
When you support an operating system like Ubuntu or Debian you can ship binaries .
You build binaries in the form of debs or rpms .
And you do n’t build only one of them , you probably need one deb for Ubuntu , one deb for Debian and maybe even one deb for each version of Ubuntu if they vary enough .
If you think this is a lot of work , then look at how much work is building a Windows installer that can work in any Windows from XP pre-SP1 without .
Net to Windows 7 .
If it was trivial there would n’t be companies like InstallShield making money .
I ’ve heard FogBugz comes with its own copy of MySQL and Apache .
How Windowish !
That ’s crazy and meant to break .
You do n’t copy code , programs or libraries in the world of Linux - based operating systems .
You set dependencies .
You make a fogbugz.deb that depends on Apache and depends on MySQL and when fogbugz.deb is installed it will automatically install Apache and MySQL .
It will install an Apache built , optimized and customized for that version of Apache that follows the Ubuntu guidelines for storing caches , config files , etc .
There ’s more , since there are some pretty straighfoward guidelines where everything is installed , fogbugz .deb could work out of the box .
In an Ubuntu box I can run
aptitude install phpmyadmin
and it works out of the box .
And phpMyAdmin depends on Apache and MySQL .
Of course I could break those services so that nothing works , but most people do n’t .
What the phpmyadmin package does is drop files in certain locations where Apache is going to pick them up .
Apache as many other programs do n’t have just one configuration files but directories of them , so you can drop another configuration file and it ’s picked up .
I am very certain that if FogBugz was packaged in this fashion , then it would not generate as many phone calls as it does now .
It is packaged and distributed like software in 1995 for Linux - based operating systems , when almost everything was a mess and chaotic and there were very few people putting it in production .
To close this post let me tell you something else to convince you that Linux is not an operating system .
You can write a program for Linux , but then it runs just fine in OpenBSD .
And then you find out that it also runs just fine in Solaris .
Well , but you wrote it on a Debian box , which is Linux .
Did you know that there ’s a Debian kFreeBSD ( or something like that ) ?
which is Debian running the FreeBSD kernel .
Debian kFreeBSD is more similar to Debian than to FreeBSD .
Nexenta is Ubuntu with the Solaris kernel , and it ’s more similar to Ubuntu than to Solaris .
Android is Linux , yet almost none of the software that runs on Debian , FreeBSD , Nexenta , Solaris runs on Android .
You see , Linux is just one component , and not even the biggest component , of an operating system .
It is not the component users interact with when using a computer and it is not even the component programmers interact most of the time , when writing a program .
It makes almost no sense to say “ I make this program for Linux ” .
Sometimes you need to schedule a batch file to run some script periodically on a windows server .
I found myself having to run one fairly often and it would always pop up that annoying console window whenever I was in the middle of typing something .
This sent me searching for a way to run the script without the pop up console window .
There was a few ways to do this but I did n’t want to download and install any other software so I went the vbscript route .
Here is what I did .
First create a file and call it ‘ somefilename.vbs ’ and put it in the same directory as the batch file that you want to run .
Next put this code in it :
Dim oShell Set o Shell = WScript.CreateObject ( " WScript .
Shell " ) o Shell.run " my-batch- file.bat " , 0 , False Set o Shell = Nothing
Now when you set up the windows scheduler you want to point it at the ‘.vbs ’ file and not the ‘.bat ’ file .
That seemed to be the easiest and quickest way to get rid of the console popup when running a batch file on a windows server .
If anyone has another method that does n’t require the creation of a new file I would like to hear it .
You could always do some reading on vbscript and just code everything in vbscript and not use a batch file at all but I did n’t bother .
This is a discussion a person had with Imam Jafar As Sadiq .
He was a polymath : an astronomer , alchemist , Imam , Islamic scholar , Islamic theologian , writer , philosopher , physician , physicist and scientist .
He was also the teacher of the father of Chemistry , Jabir ibn Hayyan ( Geber ) .
Several such discussions with Imam Jafar , on the evidence for the existence of God have been recorded more notably Hadith Mufaddal and Hadith Halila .

STOCKHOLM --
Pressure is mounting on crisis - stricken Latvia after Sweden 's finance minister said Tuesday he wanted to " send a clear signal " that the Baltic state wo n't get additional rescue - loan payments unless government spending is slashed further .
Continuing his recent stern rhetoric , Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg told reporters in Stockholm that many have worked hard to help Latvia deal with its severe economic recession but that patience is wearing thin .

Dragon Age : Origins : Role - playing .
Developer : BioWare .
Publisher : Electronic Arts. $ 49.99 for PC ; $ 59.99 for Xbox 360 and PS3 .
ESRB rating : M for Mature .
A lifetime ago , BioWare developed Dungeons and Dragons PC games such as Baldur 's Gate , praised for its tactical combat and indulgent dialogue .
BioWare of late is lauded for space operas , Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect , where it tightened storytelling and simplified gameplay for the console generation .
Inspired by George R.R. Martin's Games of Throne , Dragon Age : Origins sees BioWare 's return to high fantasy with a grand entrance for both platforms , combining its high - caliber epic storytelling with fun tactical combat filled with spell - casting mayhem .
DA: O starts in Ferelden , a politically unstable kingdom where humans have indentured elves and cast out dwarves .
You 're recruited into the Grey Walden , warrior watchers of the demonic Darkspawn .
With six " origins , " defined through character creation as a noble human , Dalish wild elf or dwarf commoner , you experience the game through their eyes while seeking companions to deal with the growing threat .
Your acts and dialogue through your own or supporting characters have a ripple affect - beneficial or harmful .
And the dialogue should n't go unnoticed .
DA : O's writing comes to life with top - notch voice - acting .
The off - camera bantering between party members creates a sense of camaraderie .
Combat delivers plenty of nerve - racking action .
You can obsessively pause combat , directing your party like a micro-managing general looking over the battlefield .
Or let the AI handle other party members through customizable scripts or tactical slots , which direct them to use potions , perform melee attacks or cast spells .
Gameplay is vastly different between the PC and console .
If you ever played Baldur 's Gate , which DA : O considers its predecessor in spirit , the PC version feels natural .
The ability to use hot keys , zoom and direct combat positions greatly enhances the experience .
The console strips and simplifies the interface through an action wheel , and combat relies heavily on smartly created tactical slots .
The console 's controller limitations do n't hinder immersion into the game .
After innumerable long nights of playing , I dreamed about wielding bread and paring knives while chasing bandits who invaded my home .
BioWare and its latest opus have deeply changed the way I think about today 's role - playing games .
Recent RPGs disguise themselves with other genres for the sake of action and gore , which takes away from the fantasy .
Kind of like Arnold Schwarzenegger shouting " Hasta la vista , baby ! " and machine - gunning orcs in " The Lord of the Rings . "
A game should n't sacrifice or dumb - down any part of itself because the story or gameplay are too lengthy or too complex .
Dragon Age : Origin never does .
KABUL , Afghanistan — President Barack Obama ’s announcement on troop strength will be just as eagerly awaited in Kabul as it will be in Washington , D.C. , but the stakes are very different here .
Capitol Hill politicos will debate the pros and cons while calculating the partisan benefits of their position ;
Afghans are trying to figure out which option gives them the best chance of staying alive .
More troops mean more fighting , with more civilian casualties .
This is the unfortunate “ mathematics of death ” pointed out in an earlier March interview by Brigadier General Richard Blanchette , who was spokesman for NATO in Afghanistan at the time .
U.S. and Afghan military analysts seem to agree that a staged withdrawal of U.S. troops would almost certainly mean a return to civil war , as newly empowered “ warlords , ” backed by American money and might , gear up for battle with their long - time foe , the Taliban .
It is an unenviable dilemma , both for Obama , who has to sell his choice to an increasingly skeptical American public , and for Afghan President Hamid Karzai , who is trying to hold his fragile country together .
Afghans are historically allergic to foreign military presence , as witnessed by centuries of history .
This latest engagement bears little difference to previous incursions in the Afghan mind , despite rhetoric emphasizing “ democracy ” and “ progress . ”
Given their recent fraud - stained presidential elections , Afghans are fast developing an aversion to democracy itself , which many see as a rather cruel trick being played on them by a cynical international community and a local puppet regime .
NATO commander General Stanley McChrystal ’s new counter - insurgency strategy , which puts protection of the civilian population center stage , relies on the assumption that those very civilians support the Taliban only out of fear .
If the local population can be convinced that their government , backed by the international community , will help and protect them , they will cease to provide shelter to the insurgents .
Then the military can mop up the opposition and commence the job of helping the locals to develop a stable , productive society .
It sounds good on paper , but begins to fall apart almost as soon as boots hit the ground .
In much of southern Afghanistan , where the bulk of the new troops will be deployed , the Taliban dominates not only through outright intimidation , but perhaps more often because people have no faith in the central government and actively hate the foreign military presence .
In most cases , they are turning to the Taliban as the best of a very bad set of choices .
At the end of the day , Afghans are a pragmatic lot ; if the troops can rout the insurgents , deliver massive aid , bully the central government into a less corrupt and more responsive pose , they will tolerate their presence .
The enthusiasm and hope with which U.S. troops were welcomed in 2001 is testimony to this attitude .
The problem is that eight years of non-performance have made the Afghans wary of foreign promises .
And Obama ’s emphasis on an “ exit strategy ” is likely to reinforce their cynicism .
The famous Taliban dictum “ you have the clocks , we have the time ” is quite understandable to a population that senses that the U.S. and their faltering allies may not be around to protect them in one , five or 10 years ’ time .
The Taliban , on the other hand , are n’t going anywhere .
Unless more troops can turn the situation around with lightning - like speed , the fear in Afghanistan is that the war against the Taliban will quickly transform itself into a war on the population itself .
There has been progress in some provinces .
In Helmand , the Taliban seemed poised to take over just a few short months ago .
Now two districts – Garmsir and Nawa – have been stabilized , with life slowly returning to what passes for normal in southern Afghanistan .
Schools are reopening , the bazaar is doing a brisk business and poppy production is down .
But it has taken 4,000 Marines to partially secure two districts .
There are 14 districts in Helmand alone .
Trying to replicate Nawa ’s success in this one troubled province would quickly swallow up Obama ’s entire proposed surge .
What happens , then , to neighboring Kandahar ?
Or the increasingly unstable North ?
The rancorous U.S. debate over the links between Taliban and Al Qaeda has no traction in Afghanistan .
The local population knows full well who the Taliban are :
They are local commanders , the boy next door , the unemployed uncle , the younger son who went with the Taliban because his older brother joined the police , and the family is hedging its bets .
“ I have a lot of friends who are Taliban , ” said one young journalist from Helmand .
“ It would be impossible to live here if I did not . ”
Young men join the Taliban for a variety of reasons , ranging from boredom to poverty .
The Taliban pay three times more than the police , and they pay on time .
Local Taliban fighters are respected and feared , while police are despised for their venality and incompetence .
Relatively few join the Taliban out of religious fundamentalist conviction .
They join the Taliban to drive out the occupiers , and in that they have the tacit support of much of the local population , particularly in the southern portion of the country .
But while Afghans are uncomfortable with a foreign presence , the prospect of an immediate withdrawal is a frightening one .
A recent article in the New York Times quotes American officials supporting a new Community Defense Initiative , which will assist tribal leaders in fomenting resistance to the Taliban .
This ignores the fact that , for the majority of Afghans , one of the few phenomena they loath more than the Taliban are tribal militia , which were responsible for so much corruption and predation that Afghans rushed into the harsh but honest embrace of the Taliban in the mid-1990s .
If the United States helps to impose one badly flawed regime on Afghans in order to get rid of another , they could very well end up getting the worst of both .
For Afghans , there is little to choose between the oppressive policies of the Taliban and the corrupt and repressive Kabul government .
Transparency International has placed Afghanistan 179th out of 180 countries on its 2009 Corruption Perceptions Index — only Somalia is seen as having shadier rulers .
The United States has publicly insisted that Karzai restore confidence to his administration by cracking down on corruption — but there are few encouraging signs that he is able or willing to do so .
In order to gain his victory in a badly marred election , Karzai has purportedly made a pact with some of the most corrupt people in Afghanistan .
It will be extremely difficult to convince Afghans that their president is serious about restoring faith in the government while drug lords and men accused of serious human rights violations occupy high positions in the government .
Nor will it be easy to demonstrate our own commitment to the task .
The photos from Karzai ’s inauguration , showing a beaming Hillary Clinton sitting directly in front of notorious warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum , made a great impression on the Afghan public .
Karzai ’s own brother has been linked both to drug dealing and to the CIA , according to the New York Times : The U.S. government has made its own share of deals with the devil , actively shoring up drug smugglers who were seen as tough on the Taliban .
This has been amply documented in various media , most recently in “ The Master of Spin Boldak , ” published in Harper ’s December issue , a profile of a border police chief in Kandahar province , who clears millions of dollars per month in drug profits while being generously supported by both Canadian and American troops .
As one counter - narcotics official put it in an earlier interview : “ We had to get into bed with some pretty nasty characters in the name of counter - terrorism . ”
The West has limited leverage over the Afghan government .
It is true that Karzai could not run his government for a day without U.S. money and support .
But the United States cannot afford to let him fall – this would spell the death of its own efforts in Afghanistan .
So the two countries , and their presidents , are locked together , with no clear solution in sight .
Whatever Obama announces on Tuesday evening will cement their union , for better or for worse .
UPDATE : 18 DEC 2009
While not the basics , there is a nice list of 100 things here :
http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/146138
With “ Climategate ” we must also add that the “ scientists ” involved have indulged in subornation of the Peer Review process and have used “ fudge factors ” in generating the data series that most of the “ peer reviewed science ” rests upon .
They created global warmer where there was none .
Basically , at this point , we do n’t know which parts of the “ science ” done before has any value or truth in it , if any .
And finally , NOAA via the National Climatic Data Center or NCDC has “ cooked the books ” in the GHCN data set that is used by just about everyone from the Japanese ( whom , I suspect , will be really peeved at the “ loss of face ” NCDC has handed to them … ) to the NCDC GHCN “ adjusted ” set and GIStemp .
Also , HadCRUT ( from UEA / CRU ) in the leaked Climategate email state their data are substantially identical with GHCN .
So basically , all the major temperature series agree because they are built on the same “ cooked books ” :
https://chiefio.wordpress.com/2009/11/03/ghcn-the-global-analysis/
I would summarise ‘ the basics ’ as :
1 ) The raw data is defective .
There are many pages on WUWT about various thermometer errors ( placement , urban heat island , changed paint type leading to higher readings , etc. ) that bias the data to the high side .
2 ) The raw data is missing .
There are several variations here , too .
Stations come and go .
Sometimes large numbers ( when the USSR collapsed a very large percentage of total thermometers just went away , many in Siberia .
At the same time the recorded temperature average went up … )
3 ) The raw data is from too short a period .
We are looking at a system with at least 1500 year cycles in it ( Google “ Bond Event wiki ” for details ) .
To do that and not be fooled by a cyclical slope needs about 3000 years data .
For satellite data we have 30 years or so .
For land based thermometers , a couple of hundred .
That couple of hundred just happens to start at the bottom of a cold period known as the Little Ice Age and is rising due to a normal cycle .
It was warmer in the past ( several times in history , more times demonstrable by archaeology like the ice man from under a glacier … ) and No Bad Thing happened .
4 ) Sometimes the raw data is just made up .
GISS , it seems , can fill in the arctic temperatures with guesses via computer .
ANY US land station can have missing readings ‘ estimated ’ by the person filling in the form if they want .
( Missed a day ?
Just make it up … ) .
5 ) Once the data are collected , they are subject to strange and wondrous changes and manipulations .
The exact methods are more or less secret .
The changes are conducted by people who often have their entire self worth and career vested in ‘ global warming ’ .
The results often seem disjoint from observed reality .
( I have a particular gripe with the GISS method that involves adjusting past temperatures down based on present temperatures .
I ’d rather that my history did n’t keep changing under my feet , but I ’m old fashioned that way . )
Where there are details on the adjustment available , they can often be shown to be bogus .
( Removal of urban heat island effect by reference to ‘ nearby ’ ‘ rural ’ thermometers that are in fact hundreds of miles away in different microclimates and sometimes in large urban area . )
6 ) Based on this flakey data , folks build castles in the sky .
They do this with computer models .
( I ’m a ‘ computer guy ’ by trade and managed a Cray supercomputer site that did modeling for plastic flow so this one galls me . )
The models are ‘ not very good ’ to put it charitably .
The do n’t match reality .
Their predictions are regularly shown to be bogus .
When you do get a little look at how they work , it is not convincing .
They leave out major , perhaps even dominant , features of climate .
( Cloud formation of all sorts , cosmic rays that lead to cloud formation , variation in the sun , many most or all of the various ocean oscillations and heat transfer anomalies ENSO , AMO , etc. )
Oh , and we have a specific admission by at least one of the modelers that they deliberately made the model run fast for more dramatic effect .
That 50 year doom ?
Even their model would say it ’s 150 years away if not run on ‘ juice ’ .
We have public quotes from ‘ scientists ’ in the field saying they need to punch up the results to create stronger public responses …
7 . Many of the assumptions and science in the models are based on errors of assumption .
I can only list a couple of examples here ( too many … ) .
It is assumed that CO2 causes warming .
All the archeological data show CO2 follows heating by 800 years .
How does cause follow effect ?
All sorts of positive feedbacks are assumed , but negative ones are ignored ( cloud cooling anyone ? )
8 . They simply can not model what they do not know .
ANY computer model can only tell you things in the domain of your present understanding .
If your understanding is broken , so is your model .
They “ know ” that CO2 is causal ( despite the data ) and that is what they model , ergo what they find .
The truth is that we really do n’t know how weather and climate work completely , so any ‘ model ’ can at best be used to show places to do more research , not to make policy .
They do n’t predict , they inform of our ignorance .
9 ) The thing they are trying to model , 30 year weather , is chaotic .
( That does not mean random , it means that the state jumps all over from trivial input changes . )
Chaotic models are , at the present state of the art , worse than guessing ( and may always be , the math behind it leads me to think maybe so … )
The input data are very flawed .
10 ) Based on these models saying the world will end Real Soon Now , many other folks run off to show that they ought to get funding for their grant because it is related to this hot topic of global warming .
When you look into the ‘ thousands and thousands ’ of papers endorsing the global warming thesis you find the vast majority are of the form “ If we assume that the model run by [ foo ] is right , this is the bad thing that will happen in MY field . ”
There are in fact only a few centers doing the modeling ( a half dozen ? ) and their ideas are very inbred .
We are really basing world decisions on the work of about a half dozen .
11 ) Dissent is to be crushed , ruthlessly .
Frankly , this is what got me started down the “ What the … ” trail .
I ’ve worked in forensics and law enforcement from time to time .
Sets off my Madoff Alarm .
( Used to be Ponzi … )
If you ’re so sure you are right , demonstrate ( share ) your data , models , et. al. and we ’ll have a nice debate .
No ?
OK , WHAT ARE YOU HIDING ?
One of the hallmarks of a shared delusion is the ruthless attack of anything that would threaten the delusion .
It just smells of cult .
And there are plenty of alternative theories , including the established one of ‘ it is natural variation ’ .
The science is not settled and the debate is not over , even if one side is paranoid about being challenged .
12 ) The major drivers of the process are not scientists , but political bodies with agendas for control and a history of corruption and deception .
UN ?
You want me to trust a UN Political Committee ?
The IPCC is NOT a bunch of scientists , it ’s a bunch of politicians .
They consult scientists .
They have at times re-written scientists work ( without notice ) .
Many scientists have now begun speaking out against the IPCC .
See # 11 for how they are treated .
13 ) Mr. Albert Gore .
His ‘ inconvenient truth ’ is a nice propaganda piece .
It is decidedly not science .
Polar bears are aquatic , they swim hundreds of miles sometimes ( one swam from Greenland to Iceland ) .
He shows them drowning …
Their numbers are rising , he shows them near extinction .
The list goes on .
When a politician starts blatantly propagandizing for central power and authority my ‘ peace in our time ’ buzzer goes off …
14 ) The ‘ cure ’ .
The proposed cure will result in terrible death and poverty .
It will misallocate trillions of dollars ( that would be much better spent improving other things : education world wide , malaria , cooking stoves in the 3rd world , food supplies , etc. ) Mr. Gore and others stand to profit greatly from it ( he has a ‘ carbon credit ’ company from which he buys his own indulgences … )
Further , since China and India get a free pass , the only real result is to move most industry there and kill the western democracies .
( Hmmm socialist western - hating UN proposing ‘ solutions ’ that hobble western democracies … )
The rate of ‘ ramp up ’ in coal consumption in China assures that no ‘ control ’ of CO2 is possible .
Why are we ‘ curing ’ what is not broken with a solution that will not work ?
15 ) The whole ‘ tipping point ’ thesis is simply and demonstrably false .
For most of the history of the planet , CO2 has been much much higher .
10 times or more .
We are actually at historic low levels .
( Plants respond to CO2 as they do to any nutrient that is lower than their ideal value , up to about a 1000 ppm value .
This implies they evolved expecting that much , and that is what the geological record shows . )
Why are we trying to reduce CO2 to levels that restrict plant growth ?
Why are we trying to make the planet colder when that reduces food production ?
The potential harm here is stupendous .
Why have we never ‘ tipped ’ before ?
16 ) We may be doing exactly the wrong thing at exactly the wrong time .
Google “ pessimum ’ .
Periodically these cold periods come along in our history .
They result in the destruction of social order , starvation , disease , mass migrations .
We are about to push in that direction .
Why ?
Google ‘ climate optimum ’ and you find the Medieval Optimum , the Roman Optimum , etc .
We are now in the Modern Optimum .
Warm is good , cold is bad .
Yet there is more .
I can only briefly state that there are reasons to believe that the present optimum may be peaking ( or maybe even ending ) .
From the planetary theories of solar output modulation , to the simple calendar correlations , to observed physical oscillations like the PDO flip to a colder direction in the short run ; some theory points to cooler .
While there is not enough to show causality , there is enough to urge caution in pushing that particular direction really really hard right now .
I ’m going to stop now , or this will not be ‘ the basics ’ …
There is more , but you get the idea .
It starts to be a bit more technical ( Like why does a global average of all those temperatures mean anything ?
– it does n’t ; and that the temperatures gathered do n’t contain enough information for sampling theory and control theory to allow anyone to know what to do even if warming were true and if we could do anything : we have a ‘ hot shower ’ with 30 years between turning the knobs and changed water temp out .
The knobs are not labeled and non-linear .
There are several toilets being flushed and dishwashers running .
Keep the temperature at exactly the right temperature ; and your thermometer is broken . )
I ’m sure other folks will have their own ideas as to what are ‘ the basics ’ but I hope I ’ve also shown that even 1 / 2 of ‘ my basics ’ are enough to say that we ought not be doing what we , as a country , are about to do …
Low impact woodland house ( Wales , UK )
Location : Wales , UK
Date : unknown
Architect : Simon Dale
Purpose : private house
More info :
From the author : “ You are looking at pictures of a house I built for our family in Wales .
It was built by myself and my father in law with help from passers - by and visiting friends .
4 months after starting we were moved in and cozy .
I estimate 1000 - 1500 man-hours and £ 3000 put into this point .
Not really so much in house buying terms ( roughly £ 60/ sq m excluding labor ) . ”
“ The house was built with maximum regard for the environment and by reciprocation gives us a unique opportunity to live close to nature , ” he says .
This building is one part of a low - impact or permaculture approach to life .
This sort of life is about living in harmony with both the natural world and ourselves , doing things simply and using appropriate levels of technology .
When asked why he is doing this , he gave this answer : “ It ’s fun .
Living your own life , in your own way is rewarding .
Following our dreams keeps our souls alive . ”

Some key points of the design and construction :
Dug into hillside for low visual impact and shelter
Stone and mud from diggings used for retaining walls , foundations , etc .
A frame of oak thinnings ( spare wood ) from surrounding woodland
Reciprocal roof rafters are structurally and aesthetically fantastic and very easy to do
Straw bales in floor , walls , and roof for super - insulation and easy building
Plastic sheet and mud / turf roof for low impact and ease
Lime plaster on walls is breathable and low energy to manufacture ( compared to cement )
Reclaimed ( scrap ) wood for floors and fittings
Anything you could possibly want is in a rubbish pile somewhere ( windows , burner , plumbing , wiring … )
Woodburner for heating – renewable and locally plentiful
Flue goes through big stone / plaster lump to retain and slowly release heat
Fridge is cooled by air coming underground through foundations
Skylight in the roof lets in natural feeling light
Solar panels for lighting , music , and computing
Water by gravity from nearby spring
Compost toilet
Roof water collects in a pond for garden etc .
Main tools used : chainsaw , hammer and 1 - inch chisel , little else really .
Oh and by the way , I am not a builder or carpenter , my experience is only having a go at one similar house 2yrs before and a bit of mucking around in between .
This kind of building is accessible to anyone .
My main relevant skills were being able - bodied , having self - belief perseverance and a mate or two to give a lift now and again .

Fighting back , Finance sector
Remember when the Reserve Bank here in Australia was cutting official interest rates ?
The Bank cut deep to help stave off the impact of the Global Financial Crisis on Australia .
Australia ’s banks claimed at the time that they could n’t pass on all of the rate cuts because their cost of borrowing had gone up .
The RBA cut rates by 4.25 percent during the financial crisis .
The banks passed on about 3.8 percent over that time .
They argued that the global financial crisis had increased the cost of borrowing and so they could n’t give borrowers the full benefit of interest rate cuts .
Indeed for business borrowers they increased some rates .
It is true that borrowing costs went up .
Banks around the world were petrified to lend to one another for fear that some of them would collapse overnight .
But the banks used this as an excuse to gouge more money out of borrowers .
They have used the global financial crisis to increase their share of the wealth we create .
Banks have what is called a net interest margin .
This is the difference between what they earn in interest from borrowers and what they pay in interest to lenders .
To understand what this is about let ’s have a look at two banks who reported their profits this week .
National Australia
Bank ’s net profit dropped markedly because of bad loans and a one off item of over $ 500 million in a court rejected tax arrangement .
If we exclude these , NAB ’s cash profit only went down a little under 2 percent .
The bank increased its net interest margin .
In other words it slugged other businesses by actually increasing business rates and hit home owners by not passing on all of the RBA cuts .
The story is even better for ANZ shareholders .
Its cash earnings increased 12 percent .
Again bad debts dragged down its net profit .
Both ANZ and NAB increased their net interest margin to help recoup some of their bad debts and tax losses from other businesses and home owners .
That margin is now at its highest since September 2002 .
We pay for their bad loans and in the case of NAB their tax scheme debacle .
Finance capital is not productive .
It creates no new value .
But it is an important lubricant for productive capital .
It depends for its existence on the creation of surplus value by workers in the productive sector , and then battles , along with the capitalists in the productive sector , the state and the like for a share of that surplus .
State support and a quasi monopoly of the big 4 banks put the banks in a strong position to grab an extra share of surplus .
So while the banks are particularly hated ( since they impact directly on most working people ) their gouging merely reflects the feeding frenzy of all the bourgeoisie on the profit we have created .
Every other boss is a ruthless as the banks in their pursuit of profit .
Rather than singling out banks and indulging in soul destroying hate , we should realise that every boss needs us to make profits .
We do n’t need them .
We can begin a fight back against higher interest rates and prices by striking for more wages and so winning back a little of the profit we make for bosses .
That way we can pay the banks and all the other capitalist bloodsuckers back with interest .

( AP ) -- Scientists are preparing the world 's largest atom smasher to explore the depths of matter after successfully restarting the $ 10 billion machine following more than a year of repairs .
When the machine is fully operational , its magnets will control the beams of protons and send them in opposite directions through two parallel tubes the size of fire hoses .
In rooms as large as cathedrals 300 feet ( 100 meters ) under the Swiss - French border , the magnets will force them into huge detectors to record the reactions .
One goal is to unravel the mysteries of the Big Bang that many scientists theorize marked the creation of the universe billions of years ago .
The restart of the Large Hadron Collider late Friday was hailed as a significant leap forward in efforts to launch new experiments - probably in January - on the makeup of matter and the universe .
The machine was heavily damaged by a simple electrical fault in September last year .
The nuclear physicists working on it were surprised at how quickly they got beams of protons whizzing through the 17 - mile ( 27 - kilometer ) circular tunnel underground late Friday .
" That was all wrapped up by midnight .
They are going through the paces really very fast , " said James Gillies , spokesman for the European Organization for Nuclear Research , also known by its French acronym , CERN .
Things went so well Friday evening that scientists achieved the operation seven hours earlier than expected , he said .
Some scientists had gone home early Friday and had to be called back as the project jumped ahead , Gillies added .
Praise from scientists around the world was quick .
" I congratulate the scientists and engineers that have worked to get the LHC back up and running , " said Dennis Kovar of the U.S. Department of Energy , which participates in the project .
He called the machine " unprecedented in size , in complexity , and in the scope of the international collaboration that has built it over the last 15 years . "
CERN decided Saturday to test all the protection equipment while there still is a very low intensity proton beam circulating in the collider .
The tests will take 10 days , Gillies said .
In this Sept. 10 , 2008 file photo , a European Center for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) scientist controls a computer screen showing traces on Atlas experiment of the first protons injected in the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) during its switch on operation at the Cern 's press center near Geneva , Switzerland .
Scientists switched on the world 's largest atom smasher for the first time on Friday , Nov. 20 , 2009 since the $ 10 billion machine suffered a spectacular failure more than a year ago , circulating beams of protons in a significant leap forward for the Large Hadron Collider .
( AP Photo / Fabrice Coffrini , Pool , File )
He said CERN decided against immediately testing the collider 's ability to speed up the beams to higher energy or to start with low - energy collisions that would help scientist calibrate their detection equipment .
In the meantime , CERN is using about 2,000 superconducting magnets - some of them 15 meters ( 50 feet ) long - to improve control of the beams of billions of protons so they will remain tightly bunched and stay clear of sensitive equipment .
Officials said Friday evening 's progress was an important step on the road toward scientific discoveries at the Large Hadron Collider , which are expected in 2010 .
" We 've still got some way to go before physics can begin , but with this milestone we 're well on the way , " CERN Director General Rolf Heuer said .
With great fanfare , CERN circulated its first beams Sept. 10 , 2008 .
But the machine was sidetracked nine days later when a badly soldered electrical splice overheated and set off a chain of damage to the magnets and other parts of the collider .
Steve Myers , CERN 's director for accelerators , said the improvements since then have made the collider a far better understood machine than it was a year ago .
It is expected soon to be running with more energy than the world 's most powerful accelerator , the Tevatron at Fermilab near Chicago .
It is supposed to keep ramping up to seven times the energy of Fermilab in coming years .
This will allow the collisions between protons to give insights into dark matter and what gives mass to other particles , and to show what matter was in the microseconds of rapid cooling after the Big Bang .
The Large Hadron Collider operates at nearly absolute zero temperature , colder than outer space , which allows the superconducting magnets to guide the protons most efficiently .
Physicists have used smaller , room - temperature colliders for decades to study the atom .
They once thought protons and neutrons were the smallest components of the atom 's nucleus , but the colliders showed that they are made of quarks and gluons and that there are other forces and particles .
And scientists still have other questions about antimatter , dark matter and supersymmetry they want to answer with CERN 's new collider .
The Superconducting Super Collider being built in Texas would have been bigger than the Large Hadron Collider , but in 1993 the U.S. Congress canceled it after costs soared and questions were raised about its scientific value .
Gillies said the Large Hadron Collider should be ramped up to 3.5 trillion electron volts some time next year , which will be 3 1/2 times as powerful as Fermilab .
The two laboratories are friendly rivals , working on equipment and sharing scientists .
But each would be delighted to make the discovery of the elusive Higgs boson , the particle or field that theoretically gives mass to other particles .
That is widely expected to deserve the Nobel Prize for physics .
More than 8,000 physicists from other labs around the world also have work planned for the Large Hadron Collider .
The organization is run by its 20 European member nations , with support from other countries , including observers Japan , India , Russia and the U.S. that have made big contributions .

Next year the country will go through another census .
The people and the states — the creators and on - going sustainers of the federal government — have authorized this undertaking ( U.S. Constitution , Article I , section 2 ) .
The census should be seen not as a burden but rather as an opportunity for Americans to practice self - government .
Let me explain .
Our written Constitution embodies ideas to which every member of Congress has taken an Article VI oath to support .
In taking their constitutional oath the members of Congress are joined by every member of the 50 state legislatures , every federal executive , legislative , judicial officer , and every executive , legislative , judicial officer of the 50 states , as well as all military personnel .
That so many are required to take the oath " to support this Constitution " is ample evidence that the Framers thought their written document to be quite important , a belief shared by most Americans .
Our Constitution is written in clear , understandable English .
Consider the census provision .
" The [ first ] actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States [ March , 1789 ] , and within every subsequent Term of ten Years , in such Manner as they [ Congress ] shall by Law direct . "
This allows Congress to count us , but only count us .
The operative word , " Enumeration . "
How then can we help Congress ?
By giving census officials your name and address , thereby counting you , but nothing more .
By doing this simple task , you assist Congress and census officials fulfill their oath - taken duties " to support this Constitution . "
We have agreed to be counted but the license ends there .
With our consent Congress is authorized to count us for one purpose : to apportion among the states , as a function of population , the number of House representatives who will then speak for / represent the people on federal matters .
That 's it .
As to senators , the representatives for the states , no apportionment / enumeration scheme is necessary because no variable is involved : each state is entitled to two senators regardless of demographic or geographical size ( " The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State " ) .
These provisions are the result of the delegates ' debates on representation and their final agreement , often referenced as the Great ( or Sherman 's ) Compromise .
The Constitution in Ex ... Andrew P. Napolitano Best Price : $ 3.49 Buy New $ 9.98 ( as of 06:15 EST - Details )
Readers will note that the Constitution simply authorizes an enumeration , a counting of heads .
Not an enumeration by race , Hispanic ethnicity , personal relationships , or by the manner in which a person occupies his / her home ( " tenure " in census - speak ) .
Not an enumeration by one 's labor force status , by health insurance coverage , by disability status , by level of education .
Not an enumeration of the number of bedrooms , kitchens , cars , distances / times traveled to work , school .
Not an enumeration of the amount of income made , or by the answers to numerous other nosy questions found in the American Community Survey .
Just a simple counting of the number of people .
Madison 's extensive notes on the 1787 Convention contain not one word about the delegates spending any of their valuable time discussing the issues of race , Hispanic origins , personal relationships , or plumbing .
We can thus practice self - government by just giving name & address .
Under our constitutional republican form of government the people are sovereign .
We govern ourselves best by following our consensually - adopted Constitution , and demanding that Congress and all federal officials do similarly .
LewRockwell.com readers understand that the federal government does not exist unto itself ; that is , it is not a self - existing , perpetual entity .
Its creation and its continued existence are subject entirely to the will of the two principals , the people themselves and the states , which allow it to remain in being .
" But , " the statists will sputter , " the Constitution says that this counting may be done u2018in such Manner as they [ Congress ] shall by Law direct , ' and that allows us to get further information from and about you . "
This language merely goes to the mechanics of the counting ( who will do it ; when it is to be done ; how , when results are to be reported ; and so forth ) ; it does not enlarge what may be counted .
Constitutionally the only permitted enumeration is the number of people in the United States .
Why ?
Because that count is the determinant for apportionment and therefore the only pertinent information needed .
Not race , not ethnicity , not personal relationships , not housing tenure .
The minimum information requested for the 1790 census — the number of persons in each household and the " Names of heads of families " ( Public Law , March 1 , 1790 ) — provided Congress with the necessary data to accomplish Congress 's first re-apportionment .
Addresses and the names of other household occupants were not sought .
This historical perspective is significant : the first census established precedent ; was nearest to the date of the Constitution 's ratification ; and is in straight alignment with the Framers ' purpose and plan .
Regardless of which form you receive in the mail ( your address is already known ) , the 10 - question short form or the longer American Community Survey form , any busybody question beyond name and address has no bearing for apportionment .
The ACS , sent out to different addresses on a monthly basis ( even though the Constitution expressly authorizes only a single decennial census ) , is extraordinarily intrusive .
" But , " the statists will stammer further , " Congress says you must give all this other information . "
Perhaps Congress has enacted something along those lines , but that is not to say that that law is itself lawful .
As noted , we agreed to be counted , but that 's all .
If the original grant of authority from the authors of the Constitution ( the people and the states ) does not allow or authorize Congress to enact such a law , then that so - called law is not law within the meaning of the Constitution because that purported enactment was not authorized in the first place .
The Constitution 's Supremacy Clause ( Article VI ) states that purported federal law is considered authorized law only when made within the framework of the written Constitution ( " This Constitution , and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof ; . . . " ) .
Nowhere in this Constitution ( a document of limitations ) is there found any authority from us enabling Congress to ask about race , ethnicity , or household utility bills .
" But , but , . . . , the necessary and proper clause encompasses these further census questions . "
Not so .
The Necessary and Proper Clause ( Article I , section 8 ) is not an independent grant of power standing on its own .
It is at most a derivative power ; before that clause may be used as justification for a federal law , primary authority must first be located elsewhere .
As far as the census is concerned authority is found solely in the Article I provision noted above , and in that provision Congress is only allowed to count / enumerate us . (*)
Nothing further ; demanding the disclosure of race or Hispanic ethnicity or other information is not enumeration .
[(*)
So that the forest does n't get lost among the trees :
The authorization for the decennial counting of the American people is found in the article defining how the House of Representatives is to be composed .
The provision is about those representatives , not about the people themselves .
Only statist - minded controllers would take a provision defining the House of Representatives and turn it into an opportunity to conduct third - degree inquisitions of the country 's sovereigns , the people themselves . ]
Using tired excuses we will be told that government needs this information to function .
Really ?
The Framers did n't think so ; otherwise they would have placed that authority in the document .
Further , if Congress believes itself in need of additional information about us , let Congress propose an amendment to the Constitution and pitch its case to the creators of the federal government — the people and the states — as to why further , intrusive personal information is needed in order to apportion House representation .
The Framers were forward thinkers ; they anticipated that the needs of the created government might change , providing to this end an amendment process ( Article V ) .
" But , but , . . . , " the statists will whine , " amending the Constitution is such a burdensome process .
It 's so much easier for us to get this information by threatening citizens with fines and demanding it . "
To which we simply reply , " We the people expected that you read , understood , and agreed with the written Constitution before you voluntarily took your oath of office to support the people 's document .
Did you cross your fingers ?
Is it your intention not to honor your constitutional oath ? "
Name , address and number of occupants .
The only information to be given in response to any letter or satchel - toting census bureaucrat demanding " Your information , please . "
We live more freely when all public officials obey the law .
Let 's begin with the Constitution .

Top 10 Oldest Universities in the World : Ancient Colleges
Facebook Twitter Google + LinkedIn
Unfortunately , the U.S. will never boast a medieval university , as this country ’s origins , established in 1776 with the Declaration of Independence , were formed when the oldest university in the world already was about nine centuries old .
If you ’re interested , we do have a list of the oldest universities in the U.S. , by accreditation year .
The following list of ten oldest universities in the world shows , through their brief histories , a trend :
The university as an autonomous self - governing institution first was developed as religious institutions ( madrasahs ) that originated in the medieval Islamic world .
But , Europe did not fall far behind these Islamic developments , as Italy founded its first university approximately two centuries after the first university developed in Morocco .
The last university on this list , the University of Padua in Italy , was founded in 1222 — 270 years before Columbus sailed the Ocean Blue in 1492 .
This list is compiled of extant universities , although a few of them closed for brief periods from the effects of war or local disputes .
On the whole , the European universities on this list have expanded their campuses and enjoy high rankings in the world today .
The list below is compiled in order of the university ’s founding .
My recommendation against explicit scalar in Embracing Idioms gathered some attention .
" It 's clearer to read , " said some people .
" It 's more obvious what I mean , " said others .
The best advice I can give any fledgling Perl 5 programmer is to read anything Mark Jason Dominus writes , especially his Higher Order Perl .
That book may be daunting , so for now start with Ovid 's journal entry about synthetic classes .
He quotes MJD , who responds himself :
I realized after a couple of years that architects have ... " structural " and " functional " elements .
One of the characteristics of novice code is that it focuses on structural elements .
When someone says " You write Perl like a C programmer " , it often means that you 're doing too much work in your loops :
for ( my $ i = 0 ; $ i < @elems ; ++$ i ) { my $ elem = $ elems [ $ i ] ; say " $elem " ; }
Compare that to the Perlish use of iteration :
for my $ elem ( @elems ) { say $ elem ; }
... or the postfix iteration , implicit topic form :
say for @elems ;
Sometimes you can even get away with the version which exploits list context :
say @elems ;
( Though note that the current output record separator has a greater effect on the functional equivalence of the final version .
In this case , the structure of the iteration is less important than the function of printing every element of the array .
While for people learning Perl , the multiple seemingly - equivalent options seem overwhelming , daunting with fragmentation possibilities , experienced Perl programmers can choose the form which best expresses the intended function while minimizing synthetic code .
Perhaps it 's clearer to explain why map and grep are important .
Perl 5's map iterates over a list and produces a list .
That 's it .
You can produce a list of the first ten square numbers with the code :
my @squares = map { $ _ * $ _ } 1 .. 10 ;
The equivalent iteration version might be :
my @squares ; for my $ i ( 1 .. 10 ) { push @squares , $ i * $ i ; }
If you 're not familiar with map , the first version may seem inscrutable and the second comforting .
Yet compare the amount of structural code in the second example .
The iteration is explicit .
Creating list elements is explicit .
Creating the resulting list is explicit .
Extending the resulting list is explicit .
Similarly , grep removes synthetic code :
my @primes = grep { is_prime ( $ _ ) } @maybe_primes ;
... versus :
my @primes ; for my $ maybe_prime ( @maybe_primes ) { next unless is_prime ( $ maybe_prime ) ; push @primes , $ maybe_prime ; }
Perl 6 takes this further by introducing a concept of metaoperators ( see Perl 6 Synopsis 3 ) , which allow the use of any existing operator -- built in or user - defined -- to reduce or distribute over a list ( in parallel , even ) or more .
This is not to say that it 's bad or wrong to use structural code , especially as a novice .
Learning to program takes work .
Learning syntax and design and the interaction of symbols in symbolic computation is complex .
Even so , one of your goals should be to reach the point where you can evaluate syntax and idioms and choose the ones which best clarify the intent and function of your code , rather than the ones which emphasize the structure of how you accomplish that goal .
On April the 1st (! ) 2009 I had a phone call with Mickey Kim of Google .
The Chromium development team was starting to design a browser extension API , and they wanted to know what kind of hooks were needed for FlashGot and NoScript to be ported on Chrome .
I gave them detailed answers with references to related Mozilla technologies , and they promised to keep me updated with progresses .
Eight months later , Chrome extensions are here but NoScript is not among them yet , and people are asking why .
The reason is very simple : Chrome is still lacking the required infrastructure for selective script disablement and object blocking .
Maybe Google plans to implement the missing stuff later , maybe they 're still trying to figure out whether it can be done without enabling effective ad blocking , but in the meanwhile the pale AdBlock and FlashBlock imitations which have been hacked together by overwhelming popular demand , are forced to use a very fragile CSS - based hiding approach , ridiculously easy to circumvent .
Just install the most popular FlashBlock clone for Chrome and visit this page I put together in 3 minutes to see what I mean ...

Women in COIN ( II ) : How to do it right
While Tom Ricks is away from his blog , he has selected a few of his favorite posts to re-run .
We will be posting a few every day until he returns .
This originally ran on October 9 , 2009 .
I ’ve been reading a recent internal summary of how Marine “ Female Engagement Teams , ” or FETs , have worked in Afghanistan .
The bottom line is that done right , this approach works surprisingly well , with benefits among the population that ca n’t be achieved by males .
The findings run directly contrary to several assertions made in the comments reacting to my previous post on this subject .
First ,
Afghans do n’t seem to mind the female teams .
Paradoxically , “ Female Marines are extended the respect shown to men , but granted the access reserved for women , ” the report finds .
“ In other words , the culture is more flexible than we ’ve conditioned ourselves to think . ”
Second , the teams have been successful in reaching the other half of the population , one that carries disproportionate influence with the prime Taliban recruiting pool .
“ Local women wield more influence than many of us imagined — influence on their husbands , brothers , and especially their adolescent sons . ”
When one patrol that took a FET with it was observed , the female Marines were invited inside several compounds , while the male Marines stayed outside .
“ And in each case , the FET succeeded in breaking the ice and getting women to open up and discuss their daily lives and concerns . ”
Nor was this an isolated event .
When patrols returned , “ we discovered some Afghan women had been anticipating the opportunity to meet American women .
In one home , the women said they had caught glimpses of the patrolling FET through a crack in the wall and that they had ‘ prayed you would come to us . ' ”
The fact that the Afghan women welcomed return visits indicated that their men had n’t punished them for speaking to Americans .
The women interviewed also had surprisingly diverse backgrounds .
Though all impoverished now , some had once been prosperous .
One group of young women reported that they had been held captive by the Taliban .
The interactions also seemed to change how some local men viewed the Marine presence .
“ One gentleman with a gray beard who opened his home to the FET put it this way : ‘ Your men come to fight , but we know the women are here to help . ' ”
But , the report warns , these teams ca n’t be run casually .
They are best done as a full - time job , overseen by an officer who trains and shapes the group , rather than a pick - up team of female Marines who happen to be around .
The FETs also need extremely good interpreters , who must be female , fluent , and healthy enough to walk foot patrols .
It also helps if they are self - confident enough to confront an Afghan male who rudely intrudes on the conversation .
There are several other tips in the report of the sort that only come from observed experience :
Afghan security forces have to be watched and prevented from coming along as peeping toms .
A special eye needs to be kept on non-Pashtun soldiers and policemen .
The female Marines should wear headscarves , so when they remove their helmets inside compounds they are clearly seen as women , especially by men watching from the sidelines .
First engagements should not be turned into interviews .
Nothing freezes interaction quickly than ripping through a list of questions , the report notes , except perhaps whipping out a notebook in which to record the answers .
Do that only on subsequent visits , after a relationship has been developed .
Take humanitarian aid into the compounds , where the women can get it , instead of dumping it on a clamoring crowd in the marketplace , where the strongest , fastest or most - feared men get it .
“ We recommend using the FETs to distribute grain directly to the women of each household . ”
Good gifts are rice , beans , sugar , tea , cooking oil and aspirin .
The FETs need two types of preparation :
All the Marine stuff about patrolling , search techniques , and immediate action drills , plus training in culture , history and the use of interpreters .
NB : The main barrier to more intensive and extensive use of the teams seems to be the inflexibility not of Afghan men but of U.S. Marine and Army officers .

NEW YORK --
Of the many countries participating at the
Vancouver Olympics , add Colbert Nation to the list .
On Monday 's " The Colbert Report , " Stephen Colbert announced
his show has become the primary sponsor of the U.S. Speedskating
team .
The team 's largest annual cash sponsor , DSB Bank NV , left the
team in the lurch after it declared bankruptcy in October .
The name " Colbert Nation " -- the catchall for the legion of
ardent fans of the satirical Comedy Central program -- will be
emblazoned on the team 's uniforms .
" On their enormous , billboard thighs , it will say , ' Colbert
Nation , " ' Colbert said in an interview before Monday evening 's
taping .
" Be looking for that logo as it comes around the final
turn .
It will be easy to see because it will be in first place . "
Speedskating has produced some of the most iconic figures in
U.S. Olympic history , from Eric Heiden to Dan Jansen and Bonnie
Blair .
In all , Americans have claimed 75 medals -- 32 of them gold --
on the traditional long track oval and the wild - and - wooly short
track rink .
In Vancouver , Shani Davis , Chad Hedrick and short track
star Apolo Anton
Ohno will all be vying for medals .
" I personally love Comedy Central + The Colbert Report , " Ohno
said in an e-mail to The Associated Press .
" Any attention the
sport can get is going to be beneficial .
I 'd like to see how
creative they can get !
I 'm game to do a skit about it :-) "
The show is n't paying the team any money directly .
Instead ,
Colbert is calling on his fans to donate to the team via
www.colbertnation.com and www.usspeedskating.org.
In the past ,
Colbert has had a great deal of success raising money this way .
He
has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Yellow Ribbon
Fund , a charity that assists injured service members and their
families .
The Dutch bank DSB was to pay $ 300,000 for the sponsorship but
failed to make any payments .
That put U.S. Speedskating in a
difficult position with little time to court new sponsors before
the games begin in February .
U.S. Speedskating executive director Robert Crowley , who
appeared on Monday 's show along with Jansen , acknowledged it was a
" definitely unconventional arrangement , " but said it would
generate exposure for the sport .
" We 're highly optimistic that the country is going to get
behind this and get behind the Colbert Nation and support this
amazing team , " Crowley said .
" I do n't have any idea if it 's going
to make $ 5 or $ 500,000 .
I could n't tell you . "
Colbert , who often leads his audience in chants of " U - S - A ! , "
said he had been considering taking " The Report " to Vancouver for
the Olympics , much as he took the show to Iraq earlier this year to
perform for American troops .
" My character sees the Olympics as war , but nobody gets hurt , "
Colbert said .
" It 's a way to peacefully figure out who has got the
top country . "
Colbert , who plays a kind of mock conservative talk - show host on
" The Report , " also has a penchant for seeing his name adopted for
various causes around the world .
Things that have taken his name
include a NASA treadmill used in the international space station
( COLBERT ) , a bald eagle ( Stephen Jr. ) , a Ben & Jerry 's Ice Cream
flavor ( Americone Dream ) and a junior hockey league team ( mascot
Steagle Colbeagle the Eagle ) .
An American Olympic team is clearly a step up , and Colbert can
be expected to feature the team frequently on his show in the
coming months .
" It still tragically involves a lot of Canadians , " the
comedian said .
" It 's kind of unseemly how many Canadians I 'm going
to have to be dealing with . "

Update : Japan ’s HTV cargo ship launched successfully on 10 September at 1701 GMT

If the first launch of Japan ’s new heavy - lifting rocket passes without incident this month , the residents of the International Space Station will soon be taking delivery of food , water , some spanking new laptops , a robot arm and a couple of Earth - observing experiments .
Business as usual , you might think , except that the way this particular cargo gets to its destination is subtly different to its predecessors .
The reason ?
The cargo is being carried by the latest uncrewed spacecraft to vie for a place in the emerging market to supply the ISS .
The driving force behind this latest space race is the impending retirement of NASA ’s space shuttle fleet , sometime in 2010 .
This latest vehicle is the work of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency .
JAXA ’s H - II Transfer Vehicle , or HTV , offers the space station a range of new capabilities .
See a graphic showing the runners and riders in the race to supply the ISS .
Docking ports
Unlike previous uncrewed cargo - carrying craft , which dock automatically or under human control , the HTV stops dead alongside the ISS when its retro rockets fire and it is grabbed by the space station ’s giant robot arm .
Then the arm pulls the HTV slowly but surely into the docking port on the US Harmony module .
“ This will be our first free - flier capture from the space station , ” says Dana Weigel , lead flight director for the ISS at the Johnson Space Center in Houston , Texas .
The advantage of this , says JAXA mission spokesman Masazumi Miyake , is that the HTV does not need an elaborate approach and docking guidance system .
And that in turn frees up space for yet more payload .
“ Without a complicated rendezvous , attitude and range - control system , the whole spacecraft is far simpler than other cargo supply craft , ” Miyake says .
In addition , the HTV has separate compartments for both pressurised and unpressurised cargo , allowing astronauts to unload the likes of food , water and laptops from the pressurised section in just their shirtsleeves .
Supply fleet
An unpressurised cargo module can hold racks for experiments and equipment designed to sit outside the ISS .
Such gear can be removed from the HTV by the robot arm and installed on the “ porch ” platform on Kibo , the Japanese ISS lab module .
Two of the outdoor experiments on the HTV ’s first flight are a NASA ionospheric and thermospheric mapping device , and a JAXA system for monitoring the ozone layer ’s chemistry .
“ The HTV is just an amazing vehicle and it ’s a pleasure to have it in the supply fleet , ” says Mike Suffredini , NASA ’s ISS programme manager .
But just what vehicles have the space agencies recruited for this fleet ?
Until now , uncrewed missions to space stations like the now defunct Mir , and the ISS , have been carried out by the veteran Russian craft , Progress .
This is effectively an uncrewed version of a Soyuz capsule .
Then just last year , another option arrived when the European Space Agency successfully flew its own uncrewed cargo carrier , the Automated Transfer Vehicle , to the ISS – carrying three times the cargo of a Progress vehicle .
Both Progress and ATV dock with the Russian Zvezda module of the ISS .
Now JAXA is adding a third option with the HTV .
This craft , however , docks with the American Harmony module .
Cosmic trashcans
The usual mode of operation for these cargo beasts is to deliver their payloads and then morph into a cosmic trashcan , remaining at the station until the vessel is brimming with ISS waste – whereupon it is jettisoned , deorbited and burned up .
But a fourth , less wasteful , cargo option beckons .
SpaceX , the civilian spaceflight firm backed by PayPal founder Elon Musk , has won a NASA contract to ship cargo to the ISS , running 12 resupply flights between 2012 and 2015 .
And the upper capsule of SpaceX ’s new Dragon vessel , which resembles an Apollo spacecraft , is recoverable – via a parachute splashdown in the Pacific ocean .
It too can dock via the robot arm .
SpaceX ’s programme is at an advanced stage .
Last week , it supplied NASA with the UHF radio system that will enable the Dragon to dock with the ISS : it will be taken up on the next flight of the shuttle Atlantis .
“ This radio unit had to pass NASA ’s strict
ISS safety standards and reviews , demonstrating our progress and laying the groundwork for Dragon flights , ” says SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell .
JAXA is also investigating capsule reuse .
“ One of our upgrade plans is to make HTV recoverable .
It ’s something we ’re studying right now , ” Miyake says .
First flight nerves
HTV is scheduled for lift - off sometime between 10 September and the end of the month , on board the HII - B launch vehicle , which has never flown before – and the record of successful first rocket launches is poor .
For instance , the giant Ariane 5 , which carries ESA ’s ATV , failed to launch several times before the glitches in the technology were finally ironed out .
A variant of JAXA ’s workhorse HII - A rocket , the HII - B has four solid rocket boosters instead of the HII - A’s two – and has two main liquid - fuelled engines instead of the HII - A ’s one .
“ This is indeed the HII - B ’s first launch .
But many of the components are already working well on the HII - A , ” says Miyake .
“ We have great confidence in it . ”
Sixty years ago , the Soviet Union detonated its first nuclear weapon , nicknamed " First Lightning " , at a test facility on the steppe of northeast Kazakhstan ( formerly the Kazakh SSR ) .
The test site , named the Semipalatinsk Polygon , would go on to host 456 atomic explosions over its 40 - year existence .
Residents in the surrounding area became unwitting guinea pigs , exposed to the aftereffects of the bombs both intentionally and unintentionally .
The radiation has silently devastated three generations of people in Kazakhstan - the total number affected is thought to be more than one million - creating health problems ranging from thyroid diseases , cancer , birth defects , deformities , premature aging , and cardiovascular diseases .
Life expectancy in the area is seven years less than the national average of Kazakhstan .

Lord Mandelson today denied union claims that he was orchestrating the postal strike .
The Business Secretary described CWU 's accusations as " complete stuff and nonsense from beginning to end " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Lord Mandelson spoke out as he toured the new headquarters of eaga , in Gosforth , Newcastle .
He was officially opening their HQ , called Partnership House , which used to be known as the Northern Rock Tower .
Refuting the union claims he said : " The CWU know that is complete stuff and nonsense from beginning to end .
" What is at the heart of this dispute is the nature and speed of change at the Royal Mail and the modernisation that is necessary to secure its future .
" Of course Government support that , and indeed we have put £ 1.2 billion on the table to help bring it about , but there is no substitute for the management and workforce agreeing on the detail of how change is going to be implemented .
" That relationship , certainly between the management and parts of the CWU has broken down , and they have got to put it back together again and they have got to do so by talking , by negotiation rather than strike action .
" I hope we will see very intensive discussions between the two sides to avert further strike action next week . "
Earlier this week , CWU general secretary Billy Hayes accused Lord Mandelson of being " extremely unhelpful " by " repeating the management mantra that is blatantly untrue " .
He added : " While the CWU and management are working hard to reach an agreement , Lord Mandelson is misrepresenting the facts to Parliament and undermining any progress being made in the talks . "
HONG KONG  China ’s national government tolerates an extensive network of secret jails in Beijing operated by provincial and municipal governments to prevent citizens from complaining to national officials , according to a report released here Thursday by Human Rights Watch .
The report was based on interviews with 38 former detainees who had gone to Beijing to complain about what they described as corruption or other abuses of power at lower levels of government .
It said that guards at the “ black jails ” beat , sexually abused , intimidated and robbed men , women and teenagers .
Provincial and municipal officials in China are subject to a national civil service system that penalizes them based on the number of complaints received in Beijing about their management .
So local and provincial officials have a strong incentive to prevent petitioners from reaching the central government .
Sophie Richardson , the advocacy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch , said that abuses were widespread in China ’s prison system , which has some judicial supervision , but that they were worse in unofficial jails .
Water and Energy Crisis Looms on Horizon â€ œResearch into capturing ocean energy is where oil and gas were in the early 1950s , â€ says Matthew Simmons , above .
Ocean Energy Institute
After several years existing solely in the mind of Matthew Simmons and his energy colleagues , the Ocean Energy Institute finally is establishing a home .
Bob West , a member of the institute 's board , confirmed on Saturday that the institute will be opening an office in the Breakwater Marketplace in Rockland .
" We are doing renovations on the fourth floor , " West said , " and should be open within the next several months . "
Simmons first announced his vision for an Ocean Energy Institute in December 2006 , with plans to base it in the former MBNA building on the Rockland waterfront .
The building had just been purchased by Simmons , Stuart and Marianne Smith and two other investors , but it was subsequently rented to Boston Financial Services .
For its first years of existence , the institute existed as a virtual entity , without a physical location .
During that time Simmons and George Hart , the institute 's sole employee , drafted a business model for the organization and explored the many different forms of energy potentially derived from the ocean .
The initial focus was on wind energy , Simmons said .
" We helped convene on wind energy projects and then we are moving on to other energy from the ocean [ such as geothermal , oil seeps and tidal ] , " he explained .
A new Ocean Energy Institute web site ( www.oceanenergy.org) explains that among the organization 's goals are the fostering of collaborative research and development teams for ocean energy projects and providing venture capital to seed commercialized ocean energy ventures .
The Ocean Energy Institute lists among its " team " members Habib Dagher , director of the Advanced Engineered Wood Composites Center at the University of Maine and a leading proponent of offshore wind projects ; Wickham Skinner , former professor at the Harvard School of Business and St. George resident ; Philip Conkling , president of the Insland Institute ; and Don Perkins , president and chief executive officer of the Gulf of Maine Research Institute .
Sporting a delicate windmill as a lapel pin , Simmons started off by reflecting on the concept of sustainability , a current buzzword among energy development experts .
" More and more people around the world are beginning to wonder , " Does the globe have a sustainable strategy ? ' "
Simmons said .
" It 's all about sustainability .
Sustainability means protecting or improving our living standards .
And without abundant water and energy , we are not sustainable , " he said .
" There 's no question that our oceans are energy 's last frontier . "
Referring to Maine 's year - round island communities , Simmons noted that by definition " islands rarely have adequate local resources to be sustainable .
Iceland is the only one with sustainable energy because it has abundant geothermal resources .
No others have been able to do it . "
Simmons said that the critical resources in the world 's future economy will be energy and potable water .
Population growth will exacerbate the demand for both resources .
" Energy is the most serious scarce resource among many right now , " Simmons explained .
" In my opinion peak oil is past tense .
What I 'm also worried about is that peak global gas is also past tense .
Black coal is heavily depleted and so we have probably now seen the peaking of fossil fuels entirely . "
" In the United States I suspect we will be at 350 million people by 2030 .
That number will be much larger in other regions of the world , " he continued .
Simmons noted that presently in China there are 18 cars per 1,000 people , while in the United States the figure is more than 900 per 1,000 people .
Demand for automobiles will continue to rise in China as well as in Brazil , India and other developing countries , leading to further depletion of fossil fuel resources .
" The bigger concern is the scarcity of other resources , starting with water , " Simmons said .
" If oil is precious , water is priceless . "
" Gravity drip water is scarce .
Desalination is difficult and energy intensive .
All water extraction methods require energy - intensive pumps , " said Simmons .
" Global water demand has grown by a factor of six this century , twice the rate of population growth . "
This scarcity becomes particularly ominous when
one considers the linkage between energy and water .
Just three percent of water of the earth is freshwater , noted Simmons , much of that sequestered in ice sheets and glaciers .
A large amount of the freshwater available is used to produce energy .
" The energy industry uses an enormous amount of water , " Simmons said .
Referring to a table of water use by different types of energy producers , Simmons pointed out that nuclear energy uses a huge amount of water for cooling purposes .
Shale gas extraction is also a massive water guzzler .
He noted that the Barnett Shale Gas field ( a natural gas field located in Texas ) has used 70 billion gallons of potable water in three and half years .
" Americans may eventually live without oil .
But there is no substitute for water , " Simmons said .
Ocean Energy Institute founder and energy investment banker Matthew Simmons gave an hour - long keynote address at the Island Institute 's 2009 Sustainable Island Living conference on Saturday morning at the Strand Theatre in Rockland .
Simmons titled his talk " The Gulf of Maine : What Lies Beyond the Fossil Fuel Horizon , " but his presentation ranged far outside the Gulf to encompass the globe .
Sporting a delicate windmill as a lapel pin , Simmons started off by reflecting on the concept of sustainability , a current buzzword among energy development experts .
" More and more people around the world are beginning to wonder , " Does the globe have a sustainable strategy ? ' "
Simmons said .
" It 's all about sustainability .

He noted that the Barnett Shale Gas field ( a natural gas field located in Texas ) has used 70 billion gallons of potable water in three and half years .
" Americans may eventually live without oil .
But there is no substitute for water , " Simmons said .
But energy is available from seawater , argued Simmons .
" That 's why the University of Maine , the Department of Energy and the Ocean Energy Institute are launching a Manhattan Project , " he said , referring to the government research project that invented the atomic bomb during World War II .
He said that the offshore wind energy development center , recently approved by the Department of Energy , is likely to be located in the midcoast area .
" Research into capturing ocean energy is where oil and gas were in the early 1950s , " Simmons declared .
The Ocean Energy Institute is now examining the possibility of an offshore wind farm in the Gulf of Maine that would create liquid ammonia for use in existing internal combustion engines .
The electricity generated by each individual wind turbine would be used to split seawater into hydrogen molecules which , combined with nitrogen , would form liquid ammonia ( NH3 ) .
" Liquid ammonia has no carbon footprint .
And the byproduct is desalinated water .
At room temperature it replaces oil and gas in aviation fuel and diesel , " Simmons said .
Rather than run expensive electricity cables beneath the sea to the land , liquid ammonia could be loaded onto ships and transported at low cost throughout the country .
Creating a fuel that can be used immediately , without costly retrofitting , is key to successfully transitioning from fossil fuels , Simmons argued .
" There are 280 million vehicles now [ in the United States ] with internal combustion engines .
It took Toyota ten years before they finally had a million Prius cars on the road , " he said .
In answer to a question from the audience after he concluded his talk , Simmons spoke of specific changes he thinks must be taken by society as a whole to husband the world 's remaining energy resources .
" I am not in favor of electric cars [ because of the net energy cost to convert existing fleets to the new models ] , " Simmons said .
" The first thing is we should end long - distance commuting .
Let people work where they live and pay by productivity .
We should end global food and rely on local food .
In my opinion , it is the energy content that will end global food . "
He said that the cost to obtain increasingly scarce fuel in the future will preclude international or transnational transport of food via truck .
" Plus we wo n't have fertilizer because we will have an energy shortage , " he added [ commercial fertilizer is based on petroleum ] .
How we and our products move across the country will also have to change , Simmons continued .
" We will move people and goods by vessel first , light rail second , " he said .
" I would envision in ten years , if we play our cards right , you would see up the east coast a ferry system delivering people rather than I - 95 .
You need a new vessel fleet to do it but we are going to be forced to do that . "
But energy is available from seawater , argued Simmons .

Prospects have never been good for ex-cons .
Even during good economic times they hover between 50 and 75 percent unemployment , and generally take home about nine grand a year .
No wonder 70 percent of them wind up violating their parole and getting back in the slammer .
Now , with unemployment rates hitting levels unseen since the Great Depression , we might just make it to 100 percent recidivism .
So criminals stay in jail , you say .
Easy come easy go , right ?
Well , consider the recent federal court ruling forcing California to release 40,000 prisoners — a quarter of its total prison population — in the next two years because the state can no longer afford to properly house its inmates .
Out here they went pack rat on the population , stuffing cells with so many bodies that they violated prisoners ’ basic constitutional rights and led to at least one death a day .
But California is n’t alone in this .
States all across the nation are starting to purge their warehouses by the tens of thousands , adding to the 700,000 people already being regularly released from state and federal penitentiaries every year .
So we ’re talking about millions of dudes flooding the job market , all of them guaranteed to strike out .
Forget about integrating into society , how the hell are they going to get food ?
Short answer :
By jacking your shit .
The whole situation is a bubbling , pustulous neck boil just waiting to splatter all over our cheap economic recovery linens .
States are slashing prison populations because they have no money , only to find prisoners being sent right back because they , too , are broke .
It is an intractable problem .
And it throws a whole different light on the dumb thugs and petty criminals I read about in the local paper every day .
Like this one :
VICTORVILLE • A man held a family of four hostage threatening to harm them with a gun Wednesday morning as he tried to get away from law enforcement officials after he attacked his girlfriend , officials said .
San Bernardino County Sheriff ’s Victorville station deputies quickly arrested the man and no one in the home was harmed , Karen Hunt , spokeswoman for the Victorville station , said .
No gun was found .
Roland Sanders , 35 , of Adelanto , went to his girlfriend ’s home in the 15600 block of Yucca Avenue at about 6 a.m .
One of the victim ’s roommates called 911 to report Sanders was threatening and attacking the victim and accusing her of cheating on him .
Sanders got out of the van refused to comply with [ Deputy ]
Mooradian ’s orders and ran away , officials said Neighbors told deputies Sanders ran into a home and that the family was still inside including several small children , she said .
They also reported they heard Sanders threaten the family with a gun .
Sanders , who had been previously arrested for battery , was arrested for domestic abuse , false imprisonment , burglary , evading officers , domestic abuse and for an outstanding parole warrant .
He is being held at West Valley Detention Center .
Now the question is this : Did Sanders beat up on his girlfriend and hold her family hostage just because he thought she was fucking his buddy ?
And did he really mean to beat her up ?
It ’s a technical , but nonetheless important distinction .
Because if Sanders had an ulterior motive for opening a 40 oz can of whoopass on those suckas , namely , to use it as an excuse to get back on prison welfare , he should definitely not be eligible for incarceration .
It would n’t be fair to the genuine , truly needy criminals out there .
Though , impostor criminals like Sanders do deserve to be slapped with a nice , hefty fine for engaging in conspiracy to commit fraud .
Last week , I acted on a tip from a reader and a friend of mine and cruised on over to the dry banks of the Mojave River on the edge of Victorville , looking for a tent city that had supposedly sprung up there not too long ago .
The rumors turned out to be true , although it ’d be hard to label the handful of raggedy tents sticking out from behind a row of tall bushes a “ city . ”
It was more like a tent encampment , which is redundant , but accurate .
This was rock bottom , folks .
Life in a tent in the shadow of a landfill on the outskirts of a dying subprime suburb on the edge of the Mojave Desert 100 miles east of Los Angeles is maybe about as far down as a man can fall .
At least on this continent .
Two years ago , Victorville was the second - fastest growing city in America catering to the lowest - income homebuyers banks could find .
Now , two years later , it ’s quickly turning into a 21st century ghetto : an isolated outpost of cheap , abandoned housing , no jobs , high school dropout rates of 50 percent and rising , and absolutely nothing at all to do besides speed .
I got to the hobo outpost Tuesday at mid-afternoon only to find it all but deserted .
Everybody was either out looking for work or actually at work except for two guys hanging out in a truck .
One of them was a Latino guy named Robert with faded prison tats running up his arm .
I half - expected him to give me another of those “ I had a mortgage , a car , and a job , then I realized I was just a paycheck away from homelessness ” sob stories you always read in news reports about tent cities , but his tale was way more simple and stark .
Basically , he ’d gotten out of jail a few months earlier , could n’t find work and wound up as a desert hobo who nearly froze to death every night ( it drops below zero degrees after sunset this time of year ) .
His only saving grace at this point was a girlfriend with a minimum - wage job who gave him food and a daily ration of cigarettes and helped keep him warm at night .
“ I ’m not sure how long I ’ll be able to live like this out in the cold , ” he told me , ” I ’ll probably be going in soon .
At least on the inside I ’m not dependent on anyone .
There I got a place — food and lodging .
Out here , I got nothing . ”
This guy was actually thinking of breaking his parole just so he could be sent back to jail .
And do n’t mistake this for some Shawshank Redemption - like “ I ca n’t make it on the outside , ” pity - poor - me talk .
While he was telling me this , Robert was level - headed and matter - of - fact .
To him it was a completely pragmatic decision , like some middle - class schmo weighing whether or not to uproot your family to take a better - paying job .
You know we live in an insane , fucked - up country when an ex-convict feels better living in a concrete box under 24 - hour surveillance than he does as a “ free ” man .
I wonder what the Founding Fathers would have to say about that .

“ THIS is the first time I ’ve done an interview with an ice pack down my pants , ” Matt Damon said one recent Sunday , having retreated to the relative comfort of his trailer on a wet and chilly Manhattan film set .
The culprit was a pulled groin muscle , sustained during a full morning of sprinting through TriBeCa streets in the pouring rain for “ The Adjustment Bureau , ” a romantic thriller based on a Philip K. Dick story .
The last setup of the morning called for Mr. Damon , wearing a porkpie hat , to burst out of a side door and hurtle down an alley that had been rigged with sprinklers .
This is the start of the climactic chase , which takes his character , a political candidate , through downtown Manhattan and up the steps of the courthouse on Centre Street .
While this particular shot will amount to just a couple of seconds in the finished film , Mr. Damon was giving it the careful consideration befitting a thinking man ’s action hero .
Between takes he walked over to a cluster of video monitors to watch playbacks and confer with George Nolfi , the film ’s director .
Mr. Nolfi , whose writing credits include two of Mr. Damon ’s films , “ Ocean ’s Twelve ” and “ The Bourne Ultimatum , ” talked about the rhythm of the sequence and the music he was planning to use for it .
They discussed the impact of the door smacking into the wall .
Mr. Damon suggested ways he could orient his body in relation to the camera .
Earlier this year , we heard from many of you on how important speed is to your daily activities on the web .
We kicked off a series of discussions with the Internet community on ways to make the web faster : from Internet protocols and best practices in website development , to improvements in the browser itself .
A lot of engineering effort is involved in making sure that a browser continually provides a fast , responsive , and satisfying experience on the web .
We 're excited to see modern browsers continue to push the envelope in designing and optimizing browser architecture for speed and performance .
We 've often been asked what makes Google Chrome so fast -- from its snappy start - up time and fast page - loading , to the ability to run complex web applications quickly .
To walk through some of the thought processes and technical decisions involved in making Google Chrome a fast browser , we 've put together three technical interviews on DNS pre-resolution , the V8 JavaScript engine , and DOM bindings .
In a future post , we 'll also cover other important areas like WebKit and UI responsiveness .
What is DNS pre-resolution , and how does it make Google Chrome even faster ?
Why is DNS pre-resolution difficult to do ?
Explain in more detail how adaptive pre-resolution works .
How else is DNS pre-resolution beneficial ?
Can it help with browser start - up time ?
How do we measure and benchmark the benefits of DNS pre-resolution ?

A new NBC / Wall Street Journal poll found 76 % Americans want to be given a choice between a public and private option .
The American people clearly want to have a breadth of options and be able to choose between a plan that suits themselves and their families the best .
I hope this is a wake up call to “ moderate ” Democrats like Sen.
Conrad , Sen.
Baucus , and other invertebrate Democrats on the need to offer a strong public option so that people can make the best choice for their health instead of being shackled to just the private options .
And the American people will have to make a decision because all health care reform plans so far mandate every American to obtain health insurance like how every driver must have car insurance .
Health care reform will earn a bad name if people are forced to pick private plans that they ca n’t afford .
A public option is needed as a check on the private insurance industry to keep them honest and keep prices low .
This is because a government insurance pool will have lots of people and can use those numbers to negotiate lower prices .
Private insurance companies will have no choice but to adapt to that type of competition by also lowering prices .
It ’s a bit galling to hear anti-HCR people say that a public option will run private insurance companies into bankruptcy when it ’s just meant to be a viable consumer choice .
I thought government programs were supposed to be inefficient and badly run so why is a public option now said to be so efficient and so effective that it can eradicate an entire industry ?
That ’s because those are lies , and the American people are n’t fooled and just want the most options for their families .
Also , note to President Obama .
58 % of Americans trust you on health care so please do n’t disappoint them .
( conversely , no one trusts the Republicans on health care so there ’s no need to placate Repubs ) .

The Congressional Oversight Panel overseeing the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) , also known as the bank bailout , issued its year - end audit results ( . pdf ) today .
Overall , the report found that the TARP was effective in stabilizing the financial sector .
It also , however , lists quite a few criticisms of the TARP .
With Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner asking for the TARP 's extension today , considering its failures is particularly timely .
I agree with much of the report , though it included few revelations .
First , here 's the mission accomplished declaration about stabilizing banking :
Because so many different forces and programs have influenced financial markets over the last year , TARP 's effects are impossible to isolate .
Even so , there is broad consensus that the TARP was an important part of a broader government strategy that stabilized the U.S. financial system by renewing the flow of credit and averting a more acute crisis .
Although the government 's response to the crisis was at first haphazard and uncertain , it eventually proved decisive enough to stop the panic and restore market confidence .
I actually do n't think the effects of the TARP are particularly difficult to isolate .
It 's pretty clear that the U.S. government used it to establish an implicit guarantee of large financial institutions .
That calmed markets .
While the Federal Reserve also had a great many programs , its work was more focused on market logistics and macroeconomics , rather than calming panic .
And to that end , the TARP was indisputably successful .
I mean , it would almost have to be by definition .
Anytime the government , particularly the U.S. government , will stand behind something no matter the cost , you can assume it 's quite safe .
After all , if the government can't manage to live up to that promise , then the country will have much bigger problems than just a credit crunch .
So , yes , government guarantees calm people down .
No surprise there .
But that does n't mean that the TARP was completely effective .
In fact , there are seven ways in which the TARP failed , according to the report .
I wanted to go through those briefly , and add one more :
Getting Credit Flowing
No matter how red - in - the - face Congressmen got during hearings , they just could n't get the bailout banks to lend more .
And that 's not surprising : the TARP contained no tangible mechanism with which to require them to do so .
But that 's okay -- it should n't have .
By forcing banks to lend more in their fragile state , such a strict lending requirement could have endangered the very capital cushion that the TARP sought to create .
So I think this was more of a misguided goal of the legislation .
In fact , this end was better accomplished by the Federal Reserve through its programs like the Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility .
Regional Bank Failures
While the TARP did a great job in healing the big banks very quickly , the same can't really be said of the smaller regional banks .
I wrote about this problem yesterday , so I wo n't rehash all of that analysis here .
As the report says , since January 1 , 2008 there have been 149 bank failures .
As commercial real estate struggles , there may be more to come .
So while Wall Street is stabilized , regional banking is hardly out of the woods .
Removing Toxic Assets
The original purpose for the TARP was to purchase toxic assets from banks , as its name indicates .
For whatever reason , former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson could n't make that happen , so it used the fund as a blunt instrument to recapitalize banks instead .
That worked for stabilization purposes in the short - term .
But in the long - term , these bad assets continue to plague bank balance sheets .
No effort to purge them with the TARP has been successful .
At this point , banks will likely slowly sell some here and there and just allow the others to run off , with the losses spread out over time .
Preventing Foreclosures
The homeowner bailout , a sub - bailout within the TARP , has n't done particularly well .
Foreclosures continue to soar .
I reported yesterday on how poorly the Treasury 's program has done modifying troubled mortgages , according to Chase Bank 's statistics .
It 's got around an 8 % success rate for trial foreclosures that manage to be made permanent under the TARP - funded program .
Obviously , the success rate is even lower for the total number of applicants who apply for the government program , as many probably do n't even make it into the trial period .
From any measure , that 's a pretty awful result .
Slowing Job Losses
This is one of the few areas where I disagree with the COP report .
I did n't see slowing job losses as a direct goal of TARP .
I guess you could argue that , by making sure credit was available , fewer businesses would need to lay off workers .
So , maybe in some indirect manner twice - removed , job loss prevention was a goal .
But I do n't think you can really blame unemployment on the TARP .
The Market Still Reliant On Government
This problem overlaps with a few others .
So , while I find it legitimate , I 'll defer to the next failure which better addresses this worry .
Created An Implicit Government Guarantee Of Big Banks
This is one of the most serious problems resulting from the TARP .
Big financial institutions are now seen as having an implicit government guarantee .
I was watching CNBC this morning and the COP chairwoman Elizabeth Warren actually made an interesting comment regarding this guarantee .
When asked whether she worried that banks were now rushing to pay back their bailout money before they were really ready , Warren cited this implicit guarantee as the reason why she was n't so concerned .
She said that , even if big banks appear to run into trouble again , the market wo n't worry , because it understands that the government will continue to stand behind the big financial institutions .
So after paying back Uncle Sam , banks will still have the benefit of the government guarantee without any of those pesky pay constraints .
Here 's that whole CNBC clip if you want to watch it .
She makes some other interesting comments as well :
Of course , this implicit guarantee is n't an entirely good thing .
It creates significant moral hazard for banks to continue taking risks , because everyone assumes the government will just bail them out again , if necessary .
The TARP report notes this problem .
If financial regulation is done right , however , this issue can be quickly eliminated .
With a non -bank resolution authority in place , bank failure plans will be submitted .
Then the systemic risk regulator can weigh if those plans will work , and if not the institution will be deemed too big to fail and will be broken up .
At that time , the market should understand that the government will not stand behind any firm going forward .
Staying On Task
There 's one final pretty clear flaw in the TARP that the report only kind of mentions in passing .
The plan called for in the legislation barely resembled what actually occurred .
Toxic assets were not purchased .
To make matters worse , the money started being used for purposes other than stabilizing the financial market , like bailing out U.S. automakers .
TARP never should have become the Treasury 's a slush fund .
If the Obama administration ends up using it for another jobs stimulus without Congressional approval , then it would be hard to describe it as anything other than that .

Arms globocorp Lockheed Martin announced today that it has won a $ 31 m contract from the famous Pentagon crazy - ideas bureau , DARPA , to reinvent the internet and make it more suitable for military use .
Microsoft will also be involved in the effort .
The main thrust of the effort will be to develop a new Military Network Protocol , which will differ from old hat such as TCP / IP in that it will offer “ improved security , dynamic bandwidth allocation , and policy - based prioritization levels at the individual and unit level ” .
“ New network threats and attacks require revolutionary protection concepts , ” said Lockheed cyber-arsenal chieftain John Mengucci .
“ Through this project , as well as our cyber Mission Maker initiatives , we are working to enhance cyber security and ensure that warfighters * can fight on despite cyber attacks . ”
Lockheed will be partnered with Anagran , Juniper Networks , LGS Innovations , Stanford University and – of course – Microsoft in developing the MNP .
Apart from that , Lockheed ’s own Information Systems & Global Services - Defense tentacle will work on amazing new hardware .

When it comes to President Barack Obama 's long - awaited decision to send more troops to Afghanistan , there are three main points to consider : the decision itself , the manner in which he made it , and the way in which he sold it .
He could not , in the end , have decided on a very different course of action .
Having replaced the previous commander in Afghanistan with one of the outstanding soldiers of this generation , how could he deny Gen. Stanley McChrystal 's request for some 40,000 troops ?
To do so would tell the world that Mr. Obama had no confidence in his new commander , a tried veteran of our post 9/11 wars .
Moreover , the president 's protracted deliberations about the war undermined his chosen course of action .
On March 27 , he proclaimed " a comprehensive , new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan . "
But when Gen. McChrystal presented the manpower bill for the strategy , it seemed to all the world that the president and his advisers got a bad case of nerves .
One of the articles describes early experiments in blood transfusion
One of the world 's oldest scientific institutions is marking the start of its 350th year by putting 60 of its most memorable research papers online .
The Royal Society , founded in London in 1660 , is making public manuscripts by figures like Sir Isaac Newton .
Benjamin Franklin's account of his risky kite - flying experiment is also available on the Trailblazing website .
Society president Lord Rees said the papers documented some of the most " thrilling moments " in science history .
The Royal Society grew out of the so - called " Invisible College " of thinkers who began meeting in the mid-1640s to discuss science and philosophy .
Its official foundation date is 28 November 1660 and thereafter it met weekly to debate and witness experiments .
Mozart study
The papers published on the Trailblazing website were first printed in the society 's journal , Philosophical Transactions .
They were chosen from 60,000 printed since the journal 's foundation in 1665 - a date which makes it the oldest continuously published scientific periodical in the world .
Among the highlights are a gruesome account of a 17th Century blood transfusion and the article in which Sir Isaac showed that white light is a mixture of other colours .
The scientific papers represent a ceaseless quest by scientists over the centuries
Lord Rees
President of the Royal Society
Audio slideshow : 350 years of discovery
Also included is Mr Franklin 's account of his ill - advised attempt in 1752 to show that lightning was a form of electricity by flying a kite in a storm , and a 1970 paper on black holes co-written by Professor Stephen Hawking .
There is also an entertaining paper about a study of the nine - year - old Mozart in London in 1770 to determine whether he really was a child prodigy .
Suggestions he was in fact a midget adult were dismissed by writer Daines Barrington on the grounds that young Wolfgang was more enthusiastic about playing with his cat than practising his harpsichord .
' Thrilling moments ' Lord Rees said : " The scientific papers on Trailblazing represent a ceaseless quest by scientists over the centuries , many of them Fellows of the Royal Society , to test and build on our knowledge of humankind and the universe .
" Individually , they represent those thrilling moments when science allows us to understand better and to see further . "
The Royal Society is holding a series of events during its 350th year to mark the anniversary .
They include a nine - day science and arts festival next summer and a series of public lectures and debates at its London headquarters .

With his latest book , creationist - basher Richard Dawkins believes he has amassed all the evidence he could ever need to convince unbelievers that Darwin was right .
Now he just has to get them to read it ...
Richard Dawkins is in the middle of London 's Natural History Museum , telling me about the applications on his iPhone .
Sitting in the museum café , he holds the phone up to his mouth and tips back his head to show me how he can drink a virtual " pint " of Carling on screen , the beer draining as the phone tips further .
Which is not exactly what I was expecting .
Dawkins has the enthusiasm of a teenage geek for new technology .
" I love my iPhone , " he confesses .
" I 'm on my third already . "
Then he shows me another phone app , this time simulating Darwinian natural selection .
As each generation of a populace is born , the appearance of the group of individuals on screen varies .
As Sir David Attenborough walks past and says hello , I feel secretly relieved we are n't still laughing at the lager trick .
" Do you find it difficult to switch off from technology ? " " Aha , yes , " he says with a dark chuckle , straightaway .
And do you ever get in trouble for that ?
He laughs again .
To most observers , Dawkins is the textbook aggressive champion of evolutionary theory .
His new book , The Greatest Show on Earth , is intended to amass the scientific testimony for evolution in one place , answering creationist critics who say there is no evidence that evolution by natural selection has ever taken place .
In person , Dawkins fails to live up to the " aggressive " label .
More rightly described as " dapper " , he is today wearing a pale - grey suit whose stitching and cut look deliciously Savile Row .
The smartness is tempered by a touch of English whimsy : the outfit is completed by a hand - painted tie featuring the birds of the Galapagos , with wings outstretched for flight , and talons spread to snatch prey .
" My wife painted it for me , " he explains proudly .
All in all , he is an intriguing combination .
He has the beady - eyed , fiercely scrutinising gaze of the Oxford professor inviting you for interview , and at the same time a warm and generous enthusiasm for science and all its manifestations ( including those of Steve Jobs and the Apple corporation ) .
But his greatest wonder is reserved for the natural world .
Walking through the gallery that contains skull casts and bones from our ancestors , he greets each as if they were old friends .
" Ah , dear boy ! " he exclaims to one skeleton .
( It turns out " Dear Boy " is the nickname given by celebrated anthropologists the Leakeys to Paranthropus boisei , a skeleton they carried around for a time in a biscuit tin .
It is now recognised as one of our most distant relatives . )
Then , moments later , he says more sadly , " Ah , the Taung baby " : a child snatched from its mother by eagles some 2.5 million years ago .
The child died after having its eyes pecked out , as evidence from the skull shows .
In his new book , Dawkins spends a whole chapter discussing human evolution , including a touching passage on the Taung baby and its bereft mother .
It 's this ability to be deeply imaginative that captures his readers in their millions .
As we walk through a gallery hung with gibbon skeletons , articulated as they would be in their jungle home , he stops and sighs : " It must be a wonderful experience to swing your way through the forest like that , at extremely high speed .
They actually take off for a moment when they swing from one branch to the next .
Very much like flying , " he adds , wistfully .
The Greatest Show on Earth tackles more controversial matters , too .
Included is a transcript of his 2008 interview with Wendy Wright from Concerned Women for America , an out - and - out creationist who simply denies the existence of evidence for human evolution .
As Dawkins urges her repeatedly to visit any museum and see the skulls and skeletons for herself , she simply ignores him and repeats her own orthodoxy .
" Why is it so important to you that everyone believes in evolution ? " she asks , almost plaintively .
" I am a lover of truth , " he simply tells me .
So he is genuinely puzzled by people calling him aggressive .
" Well , I 'm nothing like as aggressive as I 'm portrayed .
And I 'm always being labelled ' strident ' .
In the bestseller lists it always has a little one - line summary of the book , and for my new one it says ' strident academic Richard Dawkins ' .
I 'm forever saddled with this wretched adjective .
I think I 'm one of the most unstrident people in the world .
I 'd like to think my books are humorous at points , " he adds , pensively .
" I 'd like to think people laugh when they read them . "
There are moments in the new book which do make the reader laugh , not all of which concern Wendy Wright and her views about the morning - after pill ( " a paedophile 's best friend " ) .
Dawkins quotes in full Eric Idle 's Monty Python parody of " All Things Bright and Beautiful , " a hymn he has clearly enjoyed seeing rewritten .
His books also have whimsical moments : in this one , a full - page colour photograph of one biologist 's naked back , bearing a large evolution - themed tattoo .
But most importantly his writing radiates an intense sense of fascination .
He is a great explainer , taking complex biological processes and making them accessible .
Here , that includes the development of the embryo in early pregnancy , the wonkiness of giraffe anatomy , and our own fishy ancestry .
Born in Africa during the Second World War , Dawkins had parents who were both keen naturalists – his father worked for the British government of Kenya , a biologist specialising in agriculture .
Africa was an exotic environment for a small child .
Walking around the insect gallery , he suddenly sees a large scorpion preserved in a mahogany case , its tail raised as if about to sting , and stands back .
" I was badly stung by one of them as a child , " he reveals .
" I 'm quite frightened of large spiders and scorpions still . "
But young Dawkins also spent time in England .
" My grandparents lived at Mullion in Cornwall , so we always used to go there for our holidays .
It was idyllic . "
Holidaying at their home on the Lizard , he developed a lifelong passion for walking the cliff path .
" All the way down from Mullion , past Kynance , to the Lizard , " he says , with a smile .
" Lovely flowers , sea pinks on the cliffs . "
He has a clear sense of his debt to a series of inspiring mentors .
An old headmaster at his school , called Sanderson , had been enormously enthusiastic about natural history .
" And his spirit lived on there .
My old biology teacher Ioan Thomas had come to the school specifically because of it .
There was one time he came into class and asked : ' What animal feeds on hydra ? '
We did n't know .
He went right around the whole class asking .
Everybody was guessing , and then , finally , we said , ' Sir , Sir , what animal does ? '
And he waited and waited , and then he said , ' I do n't know .
And I do n't think Mr Coulson does either . '
He burst into the next room , got Mr Coulson and dragged him out by the arm , and he did n't know either !
It was a wonderful lesson , I never forgot it and neither did anyone else : it 's OK to not know the answer . "
He is proud of his career so far : " All my books have sold very well , and none has ever gone out of print .
The Selfish Gene has sold as many as The God Delusion , but over a longer time span , of course .
My books do make a lot of money , and I do n't want to keep it myself , so I wanted to find something to put the money into .
I started my charitable foundation , The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science , to promote a sceptical , critical , enlightened view of the world . "
So , I ask , you never splash out on anything ?
He pauses .
" Actually we do have a swimming pool , " he admits , bashfully .
He remains passionately interested in the world around him .
At one point he stops in front of a display on dung beetles rolling up balls of faeces in their burrows .
" I never knew they did that , " he says , wonder in his voice .
Today , Dawkins divides his time between writing and campaigning , fighting what he feels is an essential battle .
The Greatest Show on Earth is simply the latest weapon in his armoury .
So finally I have to ask him , does he honestly think any creationists will read it ?
" Hardline , mind - made - up creationists , no .
But there are lots of people , people who think they are creationists but who have n't thought about it very hard , people who grew up in some religion or other , who are just beginning to question what they were taught .
And all of a sudden they are reading about evolution and saying , wait a minute , this makes sense .
I get a lot of letters from people thanking me , saying , ' You 've changed my life . '
That is very , very gratifying . "
So you have actually converted people ?
" Well , for example , I was at one point teaching in Oxford , and we had an animal - behaviour student who was a creationist from some out - of - the - way Bible college in America .
He came dutifully to all my lectures , every week , and after the last lecture , he came down to the desk where I was packing up my notes and he said , ' Gee , this evolution , it really makes sense ! '
So yes , yes , I do believe that people can change their minds , be convinced by the truth .
And I thought , yes , that 's what I 'm here for . "

President Obama 's job - approval rating has slipped below 50 % in the Gallup Tracking Poll for the first time in his presidency , pulled down by concerns about the economy , federal spending and health care legislation .
In daily tracking from Tuesday through Thursday , Obama 's approval rating was 49 % , down from 50 % reported the day before in the rolling three - day average .
That 's not a statistically significant change , but historically it has some political significance when a president can no longer claim the support of half the American people .
Other national surveys previously have shown Obama below 50 % , but the daily tracking survey by Gallup has been particularly closely watched .
Obama also had slipped to 49 % in a separate Gallup Poll taken Oct. 1 - 4 .
The bad news for Obama really came during the summer amid growing concern about the economy and unemployment .
His approval rating was 60 % in the tracking poll at the beginning of July , then significantly dropped that month and the next .
Since September , his standing has been holding steadily in the low 50s .
Jeff Jones of Gallup reports that every modern president except John Kennedy dropped below majority approval in the Gallup Poll at some point in their presidencies , and all recovered afterwards to go back above 50 % .
Even so , Obama 's fall has been relatively fast .
Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton slipped below 50 % sooner -- Ford in his third month in office , Clinton in his fourth .
Obama 's experience is close to that of Ronald Reagan , who like Obama dropped below the marker during his tenth month in office .
( Reagan beat Obama by a few days . )
Falling fast clearly is n't fatal .
Clinton and Reagan , for instance , went on to win second terms .
Among other modern presidents : Harry Truman fell below 50 % for the first time at 11 months in office , Jimmy Carter at 13 months , Richard Nixon at 25 months , Lyndon Johnson at 29 months , the elder George Bush at 36 months and the younger George Bush at 37 months .
And Dwight Eisenhower ?
He went 63 months -- his fifth year in office -- before falling below the marker just once .
The Gallup survey included interviews by landline and cell phone with 1,533 adults .
The margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points .
Gallup has now posted the results on its website .

The fatal flaw in the theory behind pharmaceuticals
The list of drugs taken by Brittany Murphy boggles the mind
How many other patients are dying from Acute Pharmaceutical Toxicity ?
( APT )
Why celebrities need real nutrition
( Natural News )
The entire pharmaceutical industry is based on the idea that for whatever 's wrong with you , there 's a patented chemical pill that can make it better .
Feeling some anxiety ?
There 's a pill for that .
Have high blood pressure ?
There 's a pill for that , too .
Suffering from sleepless nights ?
There 's yet another pill for that , too .
Importantly , modern medicine and the pharmaceutical industry both believe .
If you have ten health problems , they 've got ten different pills for you .
And when those pills cause twenty different dangerous side effects , they 're ready for twenty more prescriptions for you to dutifully swallow .
And yet it 's the foundation of the pharmaceutical industry .
Take as many pills as you " need " , they insist .
Do n't worry :
They 're all FDA approved !
This is akin to believing that if it 's safe to drive 65 mph in your truck , and it's also safe to drive 65 mph on your motorcycle , then if you load your motorcycle onto your truck , it 's now safe to drive 130 m ph .
As you already guessed , there 's a fatal flaw in this pharmaceutical approach to sick care : .
So all the so - called " gold standard science " is absolutely worthless at knowing what might happen when half a dozen pharmaceutical drugs are combined in a patient 's body .
Brittany Murphy may have been on as many as TEN drugs !
Despite the fact that no combination testing has ever been done on pharmaceuticals , .
Obviously , this creates a whole new realm of unknown risk based on the way multiple drugs might chemically interact in the human body ..
While one pharmaceutical chemical may at first seem harmless ( even though just one drug can actually kill you ) , when you start adding a second , third , fourth and fifth prescription on top of that , you 're dealing with ( APT ) that 's never even been tested in clinical trials .
Pharmacists are trained to help people avoid the most toxic two - drug combinations , but they rarely have any real knowledge about what happens when you combine three , four , five or more drugs .
No one does .
The science has simply never been done on that question .
It 's no wonder :
With all the possible combinations and permutations of pharmaceutical toxicity , it would take literally trillions of clinical trials to test them all .
So this whole idea that you can take a drug to treat one problem , then take a second drug to treat a second problem , and a third to treat a third problem ... this entire approach to health care , upon which modern medicine is largely based , is .
In clinical trials , patients are tested for .
Never five or six ( or ten ) .
So all the clinical trials that have ever been conducted by the pharmaceutical industry need to be thrown out the window .
And that 's just about everybody !
Ask any senior citizen which prescription drugs they take , and most of them ( the ones who can still remember , anyway ) will rattle off a shockingly long list of toxic chemicals that have never been tested in combination .
Just because one drug in isolation seems " safe " in one trial in no way means it 's going to be safe when combined with half a dozen other toxic chemicals taken by the patient at the same time .
According to information leaked to the press , Brittany Murphy was found near prescription medications of all the following drugs : • Topamax ( an anti-seizure medication ) • Methylprednisolone ( anti- inflammatory drug ) • Fluoxetine ( antidepressant ) • Klonopin ( anxiety medication ) • Carbamazepine ( bipolar medication ) • Ativan ( anxiety medication ) • Vicoprofen ( pain reliever ) • Propranolol ( hypertension drug ) • Biaxin ( an antibiotic ) • Hydrocodone ( pain medication ) That 's a whoppingthat Brittany Murphy may have been swallowing all at once .
Now , you can search PubMed , the National Library of Medicine and the archives of the FDA , and you will never find a single clinical trial testing these ten drugs in combination .
It 's never been done ( and never will be ) .
Big Pharma , you see , is n't interested in finding out what happens when their various drugs are combined in the same patient at the same time .
Why ?
Because
The result was certainly disastrous for Brittany Murphy .
Her FDA - approved , doctor - prescribed , Big Pharma - promoted combination of toxic drugs appears to have cost her her life .
Brittany Murphy surely is n't the only Big Pharma customer who has been killed by Acute Pharmaceutical Toxicity .
But no one knows the actual number because
The FDA simply does n't want to know .
That 's why reporting drug side effects and deaths to the FDA remains entirely voluntary .
Big Pharma does n't want anyone looking too closely at this issue , either .
Coroners , for their part , rarely ask about pharmaceuticals as a possible cause of death .
Typically , they just blame the death on whatever organ failed , calling it a " heart attack " , for example , even when the heart attack might have been brought on by toxic pharmaceuticals .
Imagine if police detectives worked the same way .
Investigating a crime scene where someone was thrown from a ten - story window and plunged to their death on the street below , imagine if the detective reported the cause of death as being , " Hitting the ground .
" That 's the way coroners work with the cause of death in patients killed by pharmaceuticals .
They routinely ignore the real cause -- the chemical cause -- and just name whatever organ happened to fail first .
" Liver failure " is a popular one .
But what caused the liver to fail in the first place ?
It usually has something to do with Acute Pharmaceutical Toxicity .
I 've said it before , but celebrities lead extremely stressful lives .
Being a movie star is no easy career choice -- it involves long hours , stressful travel and crazy work schedules .
Sadly , many movie stars have turned to pharmaceuticals to try to keep them functioning through the extreme stresses of a movie shoot .
This inevitably leads to devastating consequences .
What professional actors need more than medication is .
Only high - density nutrition can help them cope with the enormous stresses their careers demand .
That 's why I think more movie stars need to be drinking Boku Superfood , or Living Fuel , or Pure Synergy , or other high - quality superfoods every single day .
I continue to believe that if Brittany Murphy had ditched all those dangerous psychotropic drugs and instead turned to superfoods and high - density nutrition , she'd be alive and well today .
The bigger question in all this , though , is : Could millions of people around the world be dying right now from Acute Pharmaceutical Toxicity ?
If so , how would we even know ?

“ That is one hundred percent untrue , ” said the McCain official , who would only speak on the condition of anonymity in deference to McCain .
“ All those bills are from her personal attorney Thomas Van Flein , mostly relating to the Troopergate investigation and other ethics investigations .
It is not legal to pay for those investigations out of general election funds , even if the campaign was so inclined . ”
After checking comments on my latest HuffPo article , Palin - Bachmann Syndrome™ , I spotted a news item about Sarah Palin .
It seems she was under a misapprehension that the McCain campaign had charged her $ 500,000 to vet her for VP .
The McCain camp has issued a denial :
It makes sense ; for $ 500,000 , they should have known her liabilities .
For all the surprises McCain got , I doubt the vetting cost $ 5,000 or even $ 500 .
I might even know people who ’d do a more thorough job for $ 50 .
Oh , and one of my commenters has given me a scientific name for Palin - Bachmann Syndrome™ :

The Next Big- Gov Bailout
Looks like another government arm will soon be knocking on the Treasury ’s door : “ We are currently considering all options , including borrowing from the Treasury , ” said FDIC chairwoman Sheila Bair .
As we ’ve forecast many times , the steady collapse of banks around the U.S. has put an irreparable dent in the FDIC deposit insurance fund .
Now likely less than $ 10 billion strong and with more bank failures sure to come , the FDIC faces two choices :
Raise their taxes on banks to bolster the fund or tap the Treasury .
Given the health of the U.S. banking system and the tendencies of our government over the last decade , you can probably guess which Bair will chose .
Here ’s another hint …
Barney Frank , leader of the House Financial Services Committee , has already publicly opined on what Bair should do .
The FDIC has the authority to borrow as much as $ 500 billion through 2010 .
“ Stock market bulls are n’t concerned about the inevitable acceleration in bank failures — at least for now , ” Dan Amoss told his Strategic Short Report readers just before Irwin ’s failure .
“ Even though deposits will be insured against loss , the loss of local banks will still have a depressing effect on hundreds of small communities .
These communities are going to lose their only access to business credit when their local zombie banks — loaded with toxic construction or commercial real estate loans — are liquidated or merged into other weak banks .
“ Meanwhile , the latest monthly figures show that commercial bank balance sheets are shrinking at a fairly rapid rate , due to a combination of several factors : loan charge - offs , older loans being paid back at a faster rate than new loans are being made and regulators pressuring banks to build larger capital buffers .
“ So credit - fueled growth in consumption or investment is not occurring .
Combine this with stagnant or declining wages and corporate profit margins and it becomes hard to imagine how GDP will rebound on a sustainable basis . ”

Sharlet also revealed that the sponsor of the notorious proposed , Ugandan Anti-Homosexuality Act , David Bahati is a member of The Family , as are other leading advocatres , as well as President Museveni .
The bill has been the subject of a growing international effort to stop it .
Here is the relevant section of the interview , from the transcript :
GROSS : This is FRESH AIR .
I 'm Terry Gross .
Let 's get back to our interview with Jeff Sharlet , the author of the bestseller � The Family , � about the secretive fundamentalist group that promotes its anti-abortion , anti-gay , pro-free market ideas with the help of several Congressman and Senators who are connected to the group , including John Ensign , Bart Stupak , Joe Pitts , James Inhofe , Tom Coburn , Charles Grassley and Zach Wamp .
The Family is active in America and around the world .
Let 's talk about The Family 's connection to Uganda , where there 's , really , a draconian anti-gay bill that has been introduced into parliament .
Uganda already punishes the practice of homosexuality with life in prison .
What would the new legislation do ?
Mr. SHARLET : Well , the new legislation adds to this something called aggravated homosexuality .
And this can include , for instance , if a gay man has sex with another man who is disabled , that 's aggravated homosexuality , and that man can be - I suppose both , actually , could be put to death for this .
The use of any drugs or any intoxicants in seeking gay sex - in other words , you go to a bar and you buy a guy a drink , you 're subject to the death penalty if you go home and sleep together after that .
What it also does is it extends this outward , so that if you know a gay person and you do n't report it , that could mean - you do n't report your son or daughter , you can go to prison .
And it goes further , to say that any kind of promotion of these ideas of homosexuality , including by foreigners , can result in prison terms .
Talking about same sex - marriage positively can lead you to imprisonment for life .
And it 's really kind of a perfect case study and the export of a lot of American largely evangelical ideas about homosexuality exported to Uganda , which then takes them to their logical end .
GROSS : This legislation has just been proposed .
It has n't been signed into law .
So it 's not in effect and it might never be in effect .
But it 's on the table .
It 's before parliament .
So is there a direct connection between The Family and this proposed Anti-Homosexual Legislation in Uganda ?
Mr. SHARLET : Well , the legislator that introduces the bill , a guy named David Bahati , is a member of The Family .
He appears to be a core member of The Family .
He works , he organizes their Uganda National Prayer Breakfast and oversees a African sort of student leadership program designed to create future leaders for Africa , into which The Family has poured millions of dollars working through a very convoluted chain of linkages passing the money over to Uganda .
GROSS : So you 're reporting the story for the first time today , and you found this story - this direct connection between The Family and the proposed legislation by following the money ?
Mr. SHARLET : Yes , it 's - I always say that the family is secretive , but not secret .
You can go and look at 990s , tax forms and follow the money through these organizations that The Family describe as invisible .
But you go and you look .
You follow that money .
You look at their archives .
You do interviews where you can .
It 's not so invisible anymore .
So that 's how working with some research colleagues we discovered that David Bahati , the man behind this legislation , is really deeply , deeply involved in The Family 's work in Uganda , that the ethics minister of Uganda , Museveni 's kind of right hand man , a guy named Nsaba Buturo , is also helping to organize The Family 's National Prayer Breakfast .
And here 's a guy who has been the main force for this Anti-Homosexuality Act in Uganda 's executive office and has been very vocal about what he 's doing , and in a rather extreme and hateful way .
But these guys are not so much under the influence of The Family .
They are , in Uganda , The Family .
GROSS : So how did you find out that Bahati is directly connected to The Family ?
You 've described him as a core member of The Family .
And this is the person who introduced the anti-gay legislation in Uganda that calls for the death penalty for some gay people .
Mr. SHARLET : Looking at the , The Family 's 990s , where they 're moving their money to - into this African leadership academy called Cornerstone , which runs two programs : Youth Corps , which has described its in the past as an international quote , �invisible family binding together world leaders , � and also , an alumni organization designed to place Cornerstone grads - graduates of this sort of very elite educational program and politics and NGO 's through something called the African Youth Leadership Forum , which is run by according to Ugandan media which is run by David Bahati , this same legislator who introduced the Anti-Homosexuality Act .
GROSS : Now what about the president of Uganda , President Museveni ?
Does he have any connections to The Family ?
Mr. SHARLET : Well , first , I want to say it 's important that you said it , yeah , it has n't gone into law .
It has n't gone in to effect yet .
So there is time to push back on this .
But it 's very likely to go into law .
It has support of some of the most powerful men in Uganda , including the dictator of Uganda , a guy named Museveni , whom The Family identified back in 1986 as a key man for Africa .
They wanted to steer him away from neutrality or leftist sympathies and bring him into conservative American alliances , and they were able to do so .
They 've since promoted Uganda as this bright spot - as I say , as this bright spot for African democracy , despite the fact that under their tutelage , Museveni has slowly shifted away from any even veneer of democracy : imprisoning journalists , tampering with elections , supporting - strongly supporting this Anti-Homosexuality Act of 2009 .
He 's come out just this - just last week and said that this bill is necessary because Europeans are recruiting homosexuals in Uganda , that Europeans are coming in and trying to make Ugandans gay .
And he 's been rewarded for this because this is sort of where these sort of social issues and foreign affairs issues and free market fundamentalist issues all come together .
We 're also told Brooke recanted her story to a female officer just before the bail hearing , telling the cop she was drunk when she made the 911 call .
Nevertheless , law enforcement sources say police will still pursue the case -- at least for now .
Valley residents have filed so many complaints against a Chandler moving company that the Arizona Department of Weights and Measures routinely calls in local law enforcement and stands by homes to oversee unloading .
Authorities say there are no criminal charges against Allstar Moving & Storage .
But a growing number of civil lawsuits and small claims seeking compensation for damaged possessions , missing items and overcharges are being filed against the company , and at least a dozen disgruntled customers who have taken action in justice courts say they are frustrated more is n't being done to stop the practices .
" They tore up my beautiful furniture , broke my fine china and wo n't give me the name of their insurance company , " said Georgia Tuminello , 59 , who moved from Gilbert to Chandler earlier this year and sued Allstar in justice court .
The company did not respond to the lawsuit and she is preparing to seek a default judgment .
Allstar charged her $ 1,800 to move six miles , demanded $ 50 cash tips for employees before they unloaded her furniture and caused $ 3,500 in damage , Tuminello said .
Shawn Marquez , director of compliance programs for the Department of Weights and Measures , said Tuminello 's story is all too familiar and moving company problems are pervasive in Arizona .
Allstar is considered one of the worst , he said , and little help is available for customers .
( The company has no connection to Allstar Metro Movers of Glendale , which has a top rating . )
An employee at the Chandler company 's business office said owner Mohamed Elsayed , the only name listed on Arizona Corporation Commission records , is out of the country and unavailable .
Messages left for a response from local company representatives were not returned .
San Marcos Justice of the Peace Keith Frankel has issued civil arrest warrants for Elsayed 's arrest because the owner has failed to respond to court appearance orders .
But Constable Kevin Jones has been unable to find him .
Jones said Allstar has been the subject of complaints and judgments in the San Marcos court for more than a decade ; state records show the business was incorporated in 1996 .
Meanwhile , the Better Business Bureau has rated Allstar an " F , " the lowest possible , with 134 complaints over the past 36 months .
Several Allstar Moving clients say they filed consumer fraud complaints with the Arizona Attorney General 's Office , but that agency is taking no legal action against the company , said spokeswoman Anne Hilby .
Privacy rules preclude the office from saying why , said communications director Steve Wilson .
He also said investigations into consumer complaints that do n't result in charges , as well as ongoing investigations , are confidential .
Hilby advises anyone who hires a moving company to get a copy of the price quote in writing , check the company 's insurance coverage beforehand and check the Better Business Bureau and other references .
Similar scenarios
Marquez said the stories that reach his agency are similar : charges for the service skyrocket after furniture is loaded onto trucks , possessions are held pending payment in cash , items are lost or damaged and the company will not provide customers with the name of an insurance carrier .
That scene played out last week when Audra Smith , 36 , carried hundreds of dollars in cash through a dark industrial parking lot to meet Allstar 's demands for payment before they delivered her furniture .
" We have no beds to sleep in tonight , " she said .
A move from Gilbert to Queen Creek that she arranged with a $ 49.99 - an - hour coupon from a direct mail advertisement escalated to $ 1,000 after crews spent three hours loading the truck , Smith said .
A company representative had told her she must pay $ 750 in cash before 6 p.m. or they would hold her belongings .
That 's when she called Weights and Measures , which documented her plight in one of dozens of similar reported complaints against Allstar , which also goes by the name Allways Moving .
Smith and Chandler police officer Shawn Hansen went in the office with a man identified as Amru Mohamed Hamdy Abdalla .
Weights and Measures investigator J.J. Stroh drove to Smith 's home address to stand by for the unloading .
When it was over , Smith had negotiated a $ 550 payment to have her possessions delivered that night .
Unable to collect
Many customers won small claims judgments by default after the company did n't respond .
But most have been unable to collect , records show .
Jones said a few years ago he was able to collect judgments by threatening to seize the company 's trucks or other assets .
But lately the company has been using rental trucks and recently moved the business from 870 E. Chandler Boulevard to leased space in an industrial building at 550 E. Elliot Road , he said .
The court cannot seize items that are n't owned free and clear by the business , Jones said .
Tempe resident William Nowack , 75 , said he got a $ 300 estimate from Allstar to move his daughter 's furniture and was presented with a bill for more than $ 1,200 .
He won a $ 713 small claims judgment in October but has n't been able to collect .
Foreclosure forced Dave Sanderman , 52 , to move from one Phoenix home to another .
He said his wife selected Allstar from a direct mail flyer that advertised they were " licensed , bonded and insured . . . that made her feel safe . "
Sanderman said he was forced to pay them a higher price than he was originally quoted before they would unload .
After he paid he heard a loud crash .
His new stainless steel refrigerator had been dropped off the moving truck and broken .
He took photos of his other possessions crammed at odd angles in the back of the truck .
Sanderman won a $ 2,342 default judgment against Allstar in justice court but the company has ignored certified letters and has refused to name their insurance company , he said .
" We already had a lot of stress with the move ; our house had been foreclosed on .
Now we have to deal with compensation for a refrigerator they destroyed , and the company has stopped taking our calls , " Sanderman said .
" I can't believe that company is still open . "
Earlier this month , Weights and Measures were called in to investigate allegations that Allstar doubled the quoted charges for a 90 - year - old Mary Coleman of Surprise for her move into a Peoria assisted living facility .
The agency report said Allstar held some of her belongings until she paid the full amount .
Peoria police and Stroh negotiated return of her possessions and payment for the quoted price .
The direct mail advertisement for Allstar said they are insured , and when asked for the name of the carrier , an employee said it is LeBaron and Carroll .
Agent David Brinson , who said he is handling the Allstar account , said an application for a policy covering the contents of the moving trucks was made in November through a different company , But he said there is no record it has been issued .
LeBaron and Carroll has insured Allstar 's trucks and offices since November and Brinson has no knowledge of insurance before that time .
A " black eye "
Chandler police spokesman Sgt. Joe Favazzo said it is illegal for a moving company to hold clients ' possessions but that becomes a civil matter outside the purview of police action once the customer pays and possessions are released .
A recent report indicates an Allstar client called Chandler police to report her personal items were stolen by the company in October .
However , Abdalla told officers the client had given him some of the items and he agreed to return others .
No charges were filed .
Some customers have said they were confused when they checked out the BBB record of a similarly named firm , Allstar Metro Movers of Glendale , which as an A rating .
Doug Whitson , owner of that company , said the similar names bring continuing calls to his office from distressed customers of the Chandler firm .
" It 's a nightmare of a story and unfortunately gives the moving industry a black eye , " he said .
In 1990 , Wellesley College professor Peggy McIntosh wrote an essay called White Privilege : Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack .
McIntosh observes that whites in the U.S. are " taught to see racism only in individual acts of meanness , not in invisible systems conferring dominance on my group . "
To illustrate these invisible systems , McIntosh wrote a list of 26 invisible privileges whites benefit from .
As McIntosh points out , men also tend to be unaware of their own privileges as men .
In the spirit of McIntosh 's essay , I thought I 'd compile a list similar to McIntosh 's , focusing on the invisible privileges benefiting men .
Since I first compiled it , the list has been posted several times on internet discussion groups .
Very helpfully , many people have suggested additions to the checklist .
More commonly , of course , critics ( usually , but not always , male ) have pointed out men have disadvantages too - being drafted into the army , being expected to suppress emotions , and so on .
These are indeed bad things - but I never claimed that life for men is all ice cream sundaes .
Pointing out that men are privileged in no way denies that sometimes bad things happen to men .
In the end , however , it is men and not women who make the most money ; men and not women who dominate the government and the corporate boards ; men and not women who dominate virtually all of the most powerful positions of society .
And it is women and not men who suffer the most from intimate violence and rape ; who are the most likely to be poor ; who are , on the whole , given the short end of patriarchy 's stick .
As Marilyn Frye has argued , while men are harmed by patriarchy , women are oppressed by it .
Several critics have also argued that the list somehow victimizes women .
I disagree ; pointing out problems is not the same as perpetuating them .
It is not a " victimizing " position to fight against injustice ; we can't fight injustice if we refuse to acknowledge it exists .
An internet acquaintance of mine once wrote , " The first big privilege which whites , males , people in upper economic classes , the able bodied , the straight ( I think one or two of those will cover most of us ) can work to alleviate is the privilege to be oblivious to privilege . "
This checklist is , I hope , a step towards helping men to give up the " first big privilege . "
The Male Privilege Checklist
My odds of being hired for a job , when competing against female applicants , are probably skewed in my favor .
The more prestigious the job , the larger the odds are skewed .
I can be confident that my co-workers wo n't think I got my job because of my sex - even though that might be true .
If I am never promoted , it 's not because of my sex .
If I fail in my job or career , I can feel sure this wo n't be seen as a black mark against my entire sex 's capabilities .
The odds of my encountering sexual harassment on the job are so low as to be negligible .
If I do the same task as a woman , and if the measurement is at all subjective , chances are people will think I did a better job .
If I 'm a teen or adult , and if I can stay out of prison , my odds of being raped are so low as to be negligible .
I am not taught to fear walking alone after dark in average public spaces .
If I choose not to have children , my masculinity will not be called into question .
If I have children but do not provide primary care for them , my masculinity will not be called into question .
If I have children and provide primary care for them , I 'll be praised for extraordinary parenting if I 'm even marginally competent .
If I have children and pursue a career , no one will think I 'm selfish for not staying at home .
If I seek political office , my relationship with my children , or who I hire to take care of them , will probably not be scrutinized by the press .
Chances are my elected representatives are mostly people of my own sex .
The more prestigious and powerful the elected position , the more likely this is to be true .
I can be somewhat sure that if I ask to see " the person in charge , " I will face a person of my own sex .
The higher - up in the organization the person is , the surer I can be .
As a child , chances are I was encouraged to be more active and outgoing than my sisters .
As a child , I could choose from an almost infinite variety of children 's media featuring positive , active , non-stereotyped heroes of my own sex .
I never had to look for it ; male heroes were the default .
As a child , chances are I got more teacher attention than girls who raised their hands just as often .
If my day , week or year is going badly , I need not ask of each negative episode or situation whether or not it has sexist overtones .
I can turn on the television or glance at the front page of the newspaper and see people of my own sex widely represented , every day , without exception .
If I 'm careless with my financial affairs it wo n't be attributed to my sex .
If I 'm careless with my driving it wo n't be attributed to my sex .
I can speak in public to a large group without putting my sex on trial .
If I have sex with a lot of people , it wo n't make me an object of contempt or derision .
There are value - neutral clothing choices available to me ; it is possible for me to choose clothing that does n't send any particular message to the world .
My wardrobe and grooming are relatively cheap and consume little time .
If I buy a new car , chances are I 'll be offered a better price than a woman buying the same car .
If I 'm not conventionally attractive , the disadvantages are relatively small and easy to ignore .
I can be loud with no fear of being called a shrew .
I can be aggressive with no fear of being called a bitch .
I can ask for legal protection from violence that happens mostly to men without being seen as a selfish special interest , since that kind of violence is called " crime " and is a general social concern .
( Violence that happens mostly to women is usually called " domestic violence " or " acquaintance rape , " and is seen as a special interest issue . )
I can be confident that the ordinary language of day - to - day existence will always include my sex .
" All men are created equal , " mailman , chairman , freshman , he .
My ability to make important decisions and my capability in general will never be questioned depending on what time of the month it is .
I will never be expected to change my name upon marriage or questioned if i do n't change my name .
The decision to hire me will never be based on assumptions about whether or not I might choose to have a family sometime soon .
Every major religion in the world is led primarily by people of my own sex .
Even God , in most major religions , is usually pictured as being male .
Most major religions argue that I should be the head of my household , while my wife and children should be subservient to me .
If I have a wife or girlfriend , chances are we 'll divide up household chores so that she does most of the labor , and in particular the most repetitive and unrewarding tasks .
If I have children with a wife or girlfriend , chances are she 'll do most of the childrearing , and in particular the most dirty , repetitive and unrewarding parts of childrearing .
If I have children with a wife or girlfriend , and it turns out that one of us needs to make career sacrifices to raise the kids , chances are we 'll both assume the career sacrificed should be hers .
Magazines , billboards , television , movies , pornography , and virtually all of media is filled with images of scantily - clad women intended to appeal to me sexually .
Such images of men exist , but are much rarer .
I am not expected to spend my entire life 20 - 40 pounds underweight .
If I am heterosexual , it 's incredibly unlikely that I 'll ever be beaten up by a spouse or lover .
I have the privilege of being unaware of my male privilege .

The Oregonian reports on Portland having received a rating as one of the safest walking cities in America — Portland was # 9 .
But is it really a safe walking city ?
The methodology is seriously flawed .
It is clearly designed to make a political point and not provide meaningful data .
The way they compiled the ranking was to divide the number of pedestrian deaths divided by the number of people who walk to work .
What you would ideally want is some measure of total pedestrians or , better yet , total pedestrian - hours .
Proxying this by using walking to work may seem like a good idea , but I doubt that it is .
Clearly walking to work is very , very highly correlated with urban density but may not be correlated with the population who walk for any reason at any time .
So you skew the statistics and , not surprisingly , very dense cities look safe and sprawling cities do not .
Which is , I imagine , their point .
Now , I hate sprawl as much as the next guy , but it is not necessarily bad for walking safety in general .
Yes , you ca n’t walk to get everywhere , but walking around inside the little cloistered neighborhoods that were the rage before the new urbanism ethos kicked in is probably pretty safe .
What sprawl is bad for is walking in general .
I do n’t think conflating the two is helpful .
A telltale signature of consciousness has been detected that takes us a step closer to disentangling the brain activity underlying conscious and unconscious brain processes .
It turns out that there is a similar pattern of neural activity each time we become conscious of the same picture , but not if we process information from the image unconsciously .
These contrasting patterns of activity can now be detected via brain scans , and could one day help determine if patients with brain damage are conscious .
They might even be used to probe consciousness in animals .
“ It ’s very exciting work , ” says neuroscientist Raphaël Gaillard of the University of Cambridge , who was not involved in the work .
“ The use of a reproducibility measure to disentangle conscious and non-conscious processes is genuinely new . ”
Gaillard has previously shown that coordinated activity across the entire brain is one of the signatures of consciousness .
Consistent signals
So far , efforts to find a brain signature of consciousness have focused on the intensity of neural activity , how long it lasts , and whether signals tend to be synchronised across different regions of the brain .
Advertisement
“ We were looking for something other than the intensity and duration of the neural activity that characterises conscious neural processing , ” says Aaron Schurger of Princeton University in New Jersey , who led the new work .
He and his colleagues hypothesised that when the brain is presented with the same sensory input – a picture , say – time after time , then conscious awareness of the picture should produce similar neural activity each time .
Conversely , if the sensory input did not enter conscious awareness , it should produce different brain activity each time because there would be other subconscious processes going on at the same time .
Invisible pictures
To test this hypothesis , Schurger and colleagues used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to measure the brain activity in 12 volunteers who were asked to look at a series of images – some designed to elicit a conscious response , others a subconscious one .
The researchers invoked conscious processing simply by showing volunteers pictures of faces or houses .
To invoke subconscious processing , the researchers presented volunteers with so - called “ invisible stimuli ” .
These consist of two drawings , of either a house or a face , one shown to each eye .
Crucially in each pair , one drawing is in pale orange on a pale green background , the other is the same drawing with the colours reversed .
When the brain is confronted with such seemingly contradictory visual inputs it reconciles them by creating a yellow patch .
So the volunteer consciously sees nothing but yellow , though the brain has subconsciously processed the face or house .
Probing anaesthesia
A set of fMRI recordings of subjects ’ temporal lobes backed up the team ’s hypothesis : each time a house or face was consciously processed by an individual , the resulting patterns in brain activity were similar .
When the same image was processed subconsciously , the researchers found that the patterns of brain activity were much more variable .
“ Neural patterns were more reproducible when the drawings were seen consciously compared to when they were not , ” says Schurger .
The team thinks that reproducibility – the replication of similar neural patterns in the brain each time it becomes conscious of the same sensory input – gives us clues as to what consciousness is .
It could also be used in the future to tell if someone in a coma is conscious , or probe the consciousness of people under anaesthesia , something that also is n’t well understood .

Pensions for top executives rose an average of 19 % in 2008 , with more than 200 executives seeing pensions increase more than 50 % , according to a Wall Street Journal analysis .
The executive - pension growth stemmed partly from generous pension formulas , which are based on executive pay , according to the filings .
Also adding to the pension jumps are arcane techniques that have received little scrutiny , including increases triggered when an executive reaches a certain age or when companies change interest rates used to calculate ...
Last we heard from David Mamet , his script for a re-imagining of The Diary of Anne Frank was being rejected by Disney .
While Disney seemed surprised that Mamet 's work was not to their liking , the internet community was surprised from the beginning that the House of Mouse would hire a writer whose most famous work contains almost 140 variations of the word " fuck . "
But considering the man already has over 30 screenwriting credits to his name , it 's not a shock that he has gotten back on the horse , and now his newest script has found people to develop it .
According to THR , Mamet 's newest screenplay , titled Come Back To Sorrento has found a home as Firefly and Bla Bla Bla Productions have joined to produce it .
The script is an adaptation of the 1932 novel of the same name by Dawn Powell .
Set during the Great Depression , the story centers on a music teacher with a " mysterious past " ( is there any other kind ? ) who moves to Ohio and falls in love with a local housewife .
Husband / wife team William H. Macy and Felicity Huffman are in talks for the film , as is Rebecca Pidgeon , who also worked on script with Mamet .
To put it bluntly , it was fucking dumb of Disney to give the Anne Frank story to Mamet .
The man is a fucking genius when it comes to dark fucking characters and complex fucking story telling , and Anne Frank was never either of those fucking things .
That 's why they ended up with a fucking script about a modern - day Jewish girl who travels to Israel to discover the traumatizing effects of fucking suicide bombers .
Come Back To Sorrento seems much more up Mamet 's fucking alley , and if his fucking reputation is anything to rely on ( and it most certainly fucking is ) , then we should be in for a fucking treat .

The fact that Google opted to lead the announcement about its new Dashboard feature with the word " transparency " speaks to a fundamental concern about the company 's current position in the world .
One product stood out this week amongst the standard flurry of Google product releases .
It was n't a or a .
It was a fairly unassuming , which aggregates users ' personal information from more than 20 Google services into a single , password - protected page .
Google unveiled the new service with a blog post titled , " Transparency , choice , and control  now complete with a Dashboard . "
The choice and control parts of the equation are pretty clear  users can update their account information directly from the new Dashboard , which is far handier than being forced to visit each page individually .
However , the fact that Google opted to lead its Dashboard blog post with the word " transparency " speaks to a fundamental concern about the company 's current position in the world .
Some time ago , the company adopted the admirable motto " Do n't Be Evil , " a slogan pundits have often suggested is a dig at Microsoft .
As Google quickly discovered , however , the adherence to such an abstract notion is at times inversely proportional to the size of a company .
As a company grows , opportunities for evil become more numerous , and the ability to police them decreases .
Things get even trickier when a company 's stated objective is to gather and catalog all the world 's information .
Over the past few years , concerns about the " anti-evil " corporation have grown at nearly the same rate as the company itself , from its to the cameras it perches atop its .
The sheer breadth of Google 's knowledge base is staggering , something that becomes far more apparent on a personal level when one investigates their own Dashboard .
But if Google has always been so devoted to transparency , why are we only seeing this feature rolled out now ?
The answer is that , ultimately , even the most noble corporation is only as transparent as they have to be .
The good news , however , is that in this post - Web 2.0 world , the bare minimum is ever increasing .
As personal information becomes more publicly available , the same goes for corporate information .
The informational megaphone that is Twitter and the blogosphere makes protests all the more powerful .
Remember Amazonfail , on the part of the online retailer ?
What about the online kerfuffle surrounding ?
When information moves at the speed of the Web , corporations must operate at a similar pace .
This means more than just creating a corporate Twitter account , it means offering information in anticipation of complaints , which is where the concept of transparency comes into play .
Companies that make information publicly available have less to hide , and it therefore becomes more difficult to bandy about words like " evil . "
Sunlight , as the saying goes , is the best disinfectant .
While the advent of Dashboard can be seen as a response to past criticism and an attempt to avoid future accusations , the availability of information like our Web history does have the effect of bringing to light even more questions  such as ?
It 's a reminder that , as we hand more and more of our own personal information over to a company like Google , we need to keep asking questions .
Fortunately , the Internet is history 's most powerful suggestion box , and if corporations want to operate in that world , they have to listen .
When Microsoft showcased Project Natal at E3 this year we all got excited what the future of controller free gesture - based gaming could hold for us in the future but uncontrollable enthusiasm and rumored release dates aside , since that time there has n’t been much in the way of new , concrete details or any title announcements .
A few months back the dudes at Engadget had a chance to demo the technology where they were disappointed with issues such as graphical inconsistencies in their virtual characters and occasions where recalibration was required but since it was an early prototype of Natal a few bugs are bound to pop up here and there .
We got our hands on a new video which shows a developer playing Geometry Wars on Natal , now , bearing in mind as cool as he looks playing the Geometry Wars using only hand movements the technology seems more evolved and stable .
Although there are few occasions where the game freezes for a second or two , but we ’ll hope that these issues will be taken care of in later builds of Natal .

As bad as things have gotten in the United States , is there anyone who has considered whether America is now at the point where we may be simply too stupid to continue as a nation ?
Before you scoff , just consider the 18 items discussed in this article .
You have to admit that they represent stupidity to the extreme .
Certainly it would be hard to argue that the vast majority of Americans living today are “ founding father ” material .
So can this be turned around , or have we now reached the point where the stupidity cannot be reversed ?
Consider the 18 signs of America ’s stupidity posted below and then leave a comment with your opinion …..
#1) The U.S. government is supposed to be “ by the people ” and “ for the people ” .
So to represent the interests of ordinary Americans , we have elected 237 millionaires to the U.S. Congress .
#2) As rich as the United States supposedly is , the truth is that half of all U.S. kids will be on food stamps during some point of their lives .
#3) The new airport security scanners that give security screeners a clear view of what your body looks like under your clothing also “ tears apart your DNA ” .
# 4) The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that landowners in Mississippi have “ standing ” to sue oil and coal companies for emitting greenhouse gases .
If you are an American landowner now you can get rich by suing any company that emits carbon dioxide too .
Meanwhile every last ounce of U.S. heavy industry will race to move their operations overseas .
#5) Tens of millions of Americans follow Al Gore , the “ eco- prophet ” who is trying to “ save the environment ” by viciously attacking carbon dioxide – one of the fundamental building blocks of life on earth .
# 6) The fear of “ climate change ” is being used as a pretext to get world leaders to sign the Copenhagen Treaty which would tranfer huge portions of U.S. sovereignty to international bodies and which would be a gigantic step towards world government .
# 7 ) A new bill in the U.S. Congress would give the Federal Reserve ( the very bozos who created the financial crisis ) more power over the U.S. economy than any agency of the U.S. government .
Considering the fact that the Federal Reserve is a privately owned central bank that has been systematically draining the wealth out of America ’s middle class , is that really such a good idea ?
#8) The U.S. Transportation Security Administration has stationed specially trained “ behavior - detection officers ” at 161 U.S. airports .
Anyone who has watched “ Minority Report ” knows that the idea of “ pre-crime ” does not work .
What kind of bizarre Big Brother police state are we creating anyway ?
# 9 ) With all of our amazing technological advances , the truth is that we still are n’t smart enough to even deal with a raging epidemic of bedbugs in New York City .
# 10 ) With all of our big talk about “ the war on terror ” , we have still allowed radical Islamic jihadists to infiltrate every branch of the U.S. military .
# 11 ) In fact , the U.S. allows Islamic jihadist training centers to openly operate all over America .
# 12 ) Our Secretary of State believes that there are too many people in the world and that we need to start finding ways to get rid of some of them .
# 13 ) The U.S. has abortion mills running all across the nation where employees are pushed to meet “ abortion quotas ” in order to boost profits .
# 14 ) The CIA reportedly had a practice of sending terror suspects to prisons in Uzbekistan – a place where widespread torture practices include raping suspects with broken bottles and boiling them alive .
Then we have the gall to wonder why the rest of the world hates us so much .
# 15 ) According to the Pentagon , more than a third of American youth of military age are unfit for service , mainly because they are too fat or sickly .
What a great generation of young men we have , eh ?
# 16 ) 45 percent of U.S. doctors say that they would consider shutting down their practices or retiring if Obamacare is ultimately adopted , the American people have been so outraged by the health care reform plan that there were near riots at town hall meetings all over the country this summer , and yet the U.S. Congress is still pushing it down the throats of the American people .
# 17 ) One company in Arizona is reportedly freezing the heads of their customers when they die so that later they can bring them back to life and cure whatever had ailed them ( or download their brains into a computer ) .
# 18 ) Lastly , we are openly teaching our schoolchildren that it is perfectly acceptable to sing songs of praise and worship to our president .
Well , at least if he is a Democrat .

( CNN ) -- A Pennsylvania soccer mom was chatting with a friend via webcam when she was shot to death by her husband , who then went upstairs and shot himself , police said Friday .
Pistol - packing soccer mom Meleanie Hain was shot dead while chatting with a friend on a webcam , police said .
Meleanie Hain , 31 , made national headlines last year as the mother who carried a loaded , holstered handgun to her 5 - year - old daughter 's soccer game .
She was found dead in her Lebanon , Pennsylvania , home along with her husband , Scott Hain , 33 , on Wednesday evening , Lebanon police said .
Hain was in her kitchen talking with a friend via webcam just before her death , police said .
Watch why Hain caused controversy »
The friend , who police will not name , was looking away from the computer screen when he heard a shot and a scream , police said .
He turned back to the monitor , he told police , and no longer saw Meleanie Hain but instead saw Scott Hain firing several rounds from a handgun toward where his wife had been .
Police said that the woman 's body had already fallen to the floor by the time the friend turned back to the screen .
Scott Hain then went upstairs to a bedroom , where he shot himself in the head with a 12 - gauge shotgun , police said .
Meleanie Hain was shot several times with a 9 mm handgun , police said .
Her fully loaded 9 mm handgun was found in her backpack hanging on the back of the front door .
The couple 's three children were home at the time of the killings , police Capt .
Daniel Wright said .
They were unharmed and took refuge at a neighbor 's house before police arrived , he said .
Investigators have confiscated the webcam and computer , but cannot review what the friend says he saw because the online conversation was not recorded .
The death of the couple came four months after Meleanie Hain told her attorney she was separating from her husband , her attorney , Matthew B. Weisberg , told CNN Thursday .
However , police said the couple still appeared to be living together .
Meleanie Hain drew media attention on September 11 , 2008 , when she carried a Glock strapped to her belt to her daughter 's soccer game .
Nine days later her permit to carry a gun was revoked by Lebanon County Sheriff Michael DeLeo , who claimed she showed poor judgment by wearing the weapon to a child 's game .
County Judge Robert Eby later reinstated the permit .

|| Global Warming || Table of Contents ||
Based on the analysis of entrapped air from ice cores extracted from permanent glaciers from various regions around the globe , it has been demonstrated that global warming began 18,000 years ago , accompanied by a steady rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide .
Humans are quite likely the cause of a large portion of the 80 ppm rise in CO2 since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , and from a distance , it looks possible that increasing CO2 may cause atmospheric temperatures rise .
However , on closer examination it is seen that CO2 lags an average of about 800 years behind the temperature changes -- confirming that CO2 is not the primary driver of the temperature changes .
The real signature of greenhouse warming is not surface temperature but temperature in the middle of the troposphere , about 5 kilometers up .
If global warming is occurring from an increasing greenhouse effect due to CO2 additions by humans the temperature of the middle troposphere should be warming faster than Earth 's surface ( 1,2 ) .
However , the opposite has been happening -- which suggests either the surface temperature records are in error or natural factors , such as changes in solar activity , may be responsible for the slight rise in surface temperatures ( approximately 0.6° C , globally ) that appears to have occurred over the past century .
Interestingly , from 1999 to the present the temperature of the mid troposphere has actually decreased slightly and surface temperatures have ceased warming -- even as CO2 concentrations have continued to increase ( 3 ) .
This should not be happening if CO2 increases to the atmosphere are the primary driver of global warming .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday approved $ 636 billion to fund military operations for the fiscal year that started on October 1 , $ 3.9 billion less than requested by the Obama administration .
Lawmakers must resolve differences with a similar spending bill passed by the House of Representatives before President Barack Obama can sign it into law .
Following are some key provisions of the bill , which passed by a vote of 93 to 7 :
* $ 128.2 billion would fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Congress in prior years funded the two wars separately from regular Pentagon operations .
* The bill would end production of Lockheed - Martin Corp . ’s F - 22 fighter plane and the VH - 71 presidential helicopter , also made by Lockheed .
The Pentagon has said it does not need these aircraft .
* The bill likewise contains no funding for an alternate engine for the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter , which is being built by General Electric Co and Britain ’s Rolls - Royce Group Plc .
However , the engine program could survive despite a White House veto threat .
The House has approved $ 560 million for the program and lawmakers from both chambers have agreed to include that money in a separate bill that sets the Pentagon ’s budget .
* The bill allocates $ 2.5 billion to continue production of Boeing Co. ’s C - 17 cargo plane -- another program the Pentagon had sought to shut down .
* It prohibits the Obama administration from transferring international terrorism suspects currently held at the Guantanamo Bay military prison to the United States .
* It includes $ 2.7 billion for hundreds of lawmakers ’ pet projects , from a World War Two museum to a civic - education center named for the late Senator Edward Kennedy , that the Pentagon did not request .
Such “ earmarks ” serve as a lightning rod for budget hawks concerned about runaway federal spending , but senators turned back several attempts to strip them out .
* $ 7.7 billion for missile defense , a $ 1.4 billion cut from last year .
* $ 154 billion for operations and maintenance , which is $ 2.4 billion less than the Pentagon wants .
* $ 125 billion to pay salaries and other personnel costs for 1.43 million active - duty troops , including an increase of 22,000 troops for the Army , and a reserve force of 845,000 .
* The bill provides $ 3.65 billion to build two DDG - 51 destroyers , one more than the Pentagon wants .
But if sensory feedback can extend a surgeon ’s body across a room , why stop there ?
A new version of the machine adds Ethernet , freeing the doctor to inhabit a mechanical body anywhere with a good cable or wireless connection .
By digitizing surgical commands , we ’ve already created transitional moments in which maneuvers have been described but not executed .
Why not extend this transition , playing out the surgery in virtual reality and then editing out any errors ?
That ’s the next step : surgery with a word processor , so to speak , instead of a typewriter .
Unfortunately , the military does n’t have these luxuries .
Soldiers get wounded in faraway places without broadband or doctors , and they need help fast .
That ’s why Darpa wants mobile machines that can do surgery without human guidance .
Such robots are in the works , according to Bel­fiore .
Their initial repertory will be limited , but that ’s O.K .
They just have to keep the wounded alive for the hour it takes to reach a hospital .
And with every life they save , they ’ll begin to earn our trust .
So maybe you ’ll let a robot fix your body .
But would you let one join your body ?
In fact , the coupling is well under way .
As troops come home from Iraq and Afghanistan with limbs blown off , they get computerized arms that read the body ’s electrical signals .
They ’re cyborgs .
The next step is mutual adaptation .
Amputees have always had to learn how to operate their new limbs .
Now the limbs are returning the favor .
Their software studies each user ’s electrical signals , gradually becoming more accurate at interpreting commands .
And though the user ’s brain remains in charge , his body has become negotiable .
Amputees are getting surgeries to make their motor signals more readable by myoelectric arms .
The human is being reconfigured for the machine .
The eventual payoff is n’t just parity with unreconstructed humans .
It ’s superiority .
Some mechanical arms now exceed the reach of human arms .
Last year , a disabled sprinter was forbidden to run in Olympic - level track meets on his carbon - fiber legs because they were deemed too fast .
And computerized limbs can be networked .
Belfiore recalls a recent conversation with an Iraq war amputee about whether his new hand could manipulate a mouse .
“ Why do I need a mouse ? ” he asked .
“ Why ca n’t I plug my arm right into a USB port ? ”
For that matter , who needs a USB port ?
Limb designers have devised injectable sensors that can transmit motor commands to artificial arms through wireless signals .
Once you can operate an arm wirelessly , you do n’t need it attached to your body .
You can control it from anywhere .
But your arm can also be hacked .
And that raises an unsettling question :
If humans marry machines , who will control the marriage ?
In its 2007 car contest , Darpa took elaborate measures to stop robots from going rogue .
Each vehicle was outfitted with multiple shutdown devices and trailed by a human driver with a kill switch .
The penalty for the slightest disobedience was immediate disqualification .
But at least one team , according to Belfiore , liked to run simulations with its car ’s “ software aggression level cranked up into what they jokingly called Rambo mode . ”
Imagine your arm in Rambo mode .
Something like that has already been reported : Michael Weisskopf , a journalist who lost his right hand in Iraq , was making a turn in rush - hour traffic sometime later when , as Belfiore describes it , Weiss­kopf ’s new hand “ clenched the wheel of his car in a death grip and refused to let go . ”
It was just a misunderstanding .
But electronic limbs are being programmed to make more and more decisions .
After all , it is n’t just your body anymore .
It ’s theirs , too .
I study cosmology for a living .
Whenever I tell people this ( and I usually use the word astronomy ) , I usually get one of three responses : 1 ) ' Oh , well ... that must be hard '
2 ) ' I could n't even begin to understand any of that ' or 3 ) ' Cosmotology !
Can you do my hair ?
Haha !'
This kind of gets to me after a while , and I was thinking last night about how people generally dismiss math and science ( my passions in life ! ) from conversation .
To the best of my consideration there are two reasons for this , certain people are actually incapable of understanding math and science , or they are afraid of it .
I really hope the answer is the latter .
I then began to think about people 's ideas of a well - rounded , well - educated individual : he / she is expected to have read Shakespeare , but he / she is not expected to know the two postulates of relativity , or all three of Newton 's laws , or what a derivative is .
This is at least my impression from my experiences in my tier - 1 college and grad school ( you can probably guess where from my username ) .
So what 's the deal ?
Why do elementary school teachers teach multiplication tables for 6 years and call that math ?
Why do people tell women that they can't do math ?
Why do people treat me , a scientist , as if my work is that much more esoteric and specialized than someone else with a similar degree in another field ?
Is the ability to do math a learned behaviour , or is it somehow intrinsic knowledge ?
Basically , what the hell is so scary about math ?!
Why do people hate math and science so much ?
An emotional Fathima Rifqa Bary — whose personal writings reaveal that she wants to be a modern day prophet–said of her parents :
“ My parents are Muslim … I do n’t know if you know about honor killing … They have to kill me …Because if they love Allah more than me , they have to do it .
It ’s in the Quran .
And you can , like , give them knowledge about it [ gestures to someone off camera , who says something unintelligible ] . ”
It seems that Fathima ’s understanding of the Quran comes from whomever she pointed to , whom I can only assume is her pastor ( or pastor ’s underling more likely ) .
A few more dry runs could have perfected the performance .
She just had to memorize a few verses to prove her claim :
13:6 If –your brother , the son of your mother , or your son , or your daughter , or the wife of your bosom , or your friend , which is as your own soul–entice you secretly , saying , “ Let us go and worship other gods , ” which you have not known– not you , nor your fathers ; 13:7 Namely , of the gods of the people which are round about you , near to you , or far off from you , from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth ; 13:8
You shall not consent unto him , nor hearken unto him ; neither shall your eye pity him , neither shall you spare , neither shall you conceal him : 13:9
But you must surely kill him ; your hand must be first upon him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
13:10 And you must stone him with stones , that he die ; because he has sought to thrust you away from the LORD your God .
Well , that ’s pretty damning evidence right there .
That sounds a lot like “ honor ” killing : “ If your brother …or your son or your daughter …. entice you secretly , saying , ‘ Let us go and worship other gods ’
… You must kill him …you must stone him with stones , that he die . ”
Well , if that ’s in the Quran , then we better ban all Muslim immigration to America !
But before we call Homeland Security , I hope you do n’t mind if I check the Quran to verify if those verses exist .
[ Flipping through pages of Quran ]
Hmmm , ca n’t seem to find it .
Oh wait , * smacks forehead * , I remember now where those verses are from .
Ahh yes , they are from the Bible ( Deuteronomy , 13:6 - 10 ) .
There are of course many other Biblical verses in the same vein , such as 2 Chronicles 15:13 which reads :
“ All who would not seek the LORD , the God of Israel , were to be put to death , whether small or great , man or woman . ”
Oopsie doopsie !
Maybe it ’s not such a good idea to randomly quote someone else ’s scripture or medieval texts without any context as a proof to demonize a people or to fear monger .
Introduction
Islamophobes insist that Islam says that apostates must be killed .
These ardent critics of the faith are of the view that Islam is for this reason simply incompatible with the Western Judeo - Christian tradition .
Their view–which they try to propagate–is that Islam is somehow so inherently different from all other religions that it should be singled out as the one faith that we just absolutely cannot tolerate .
The issue of course is that “ Islam ” does n’t “ say ” anything , since it is not a person .
Islam is in fact polyvalent : it has within it different understandings and interpretations of the religion .
On this particular issue , Islam itself does n’t “ say ” anything .
Valerie Hoffman , a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Illinois , commented on the issue of apostasy in Islam : “ You ca n’t say Islam says this or Islam says that . ”
The question of course is “ whose Islam ” and “ which Islam ? ”
Yes , the majority “ classical ” and “ traditional ” opinion codified hundreds of years ago was indeed that apostates from Islam should be killed .
However , such views are abundantly present in the Judeo - Christian tradition as well , yet Jews and Christians have over the course of time reanalyzed their canonical texts and come to different understandings today .
Before the Great War , the Ottoman Empire united Muslim lands under one symbolic leadership .
( Perhaps an oversimplification but it suffices for our discussion here . )
It is interesting to note that the Ottoman government eventually stopped enforcing the punishment for apostasy and finally abolished it altogether in 1844 , more than one hundred and sixty years ago :
Punishment for apostasy ( in any case , extremely rare ) was not in practice enforced in later times and was completely abolished by the [ Ottoman ]
Turks by a decree of the Ottoman government in 1260 / 1844 .
( The New Encyclopedia of Islam , by Cyril Glasse , p.54 )
And we read :
The Ottoman Caliphate , the supreme representative of Sunni Islam , formally abolished this penalty … The Shaykh al - Islam , the supreme head of the religious courts and colleges , ratified this major shift in traditional legal doctrine .
It was pointed out that there is no verse in the Qur’an that lays down a punishment for apostasy ( although chapter 5 verse 54 and chapter 2 verse 217 predict a punishment in the next world ) .
It was also pointed out that the ambiguities in the hadith ( the sayings of the Prophet ) suggest that apostasy is only an offense when combined with the crime of treason …
The debate triggered by the Ottoman reform was continued when al - Azhar University in Cairo , the supreme religious authority in the Arab world , delivered a formal fatwa ( religious edict ) in 1958 , which confirmed the abolition of the classical law in this area .
( T.J. Winters writing for Newsweek )
It should be kept in mind that the Ottomans had embraced change , pushing what came to be known as the Tanzimat reforms , a drive to modernize the Islamic state to be compatible with the contemporary age .
They abolished the jizya and dhimmi system ; the Hatt - i Humayun of 1856 promised full legal equality for citizens of all religions , and the Nationality Law of 1869 created a common Ottoman citizenship irrespective of religious or ethnic divisions .
The point is that the Islamic state had embraced change and reform of their religious understanding .
The debate had begun , but after World War I , the Allies occupied Turkey and Arab lands .
They broke up the Ottoman Empire , and carved out mandate states , installing despots into power , something which of course retarded further Muslim intellectual growth .
The modern Muslim world is living with the consequences of these events .
Unfortunately , feelings of anti-Westernism have emerged as a backlash to colonialism and subsequent events .
Extremists and religious fundamentalists began to define themselves in opposition to the West ; the more the West condemned their extreme understandings of Islam , the more “ street cred ” these fundamentalists garnered .
Hey , if the West hates you , and the West is the colonialist , then you must be right !
Such was the thought process .
So harsher understandings replaced more tolerant ones , and the punishment for apostates –which had been long abandoned by the Ottoman Empire –was re-instituted in a few Muslim majority countries .
As Dr. Tariq Ramadan put it :
The opposition and condemnations by the West supplies , paradoxically , the popular feeling of fidelity to the Islamic teachings ; a reasoning that is antithetical , simple and simplistic .
The intense opposition of the West is sufficient proof [ for them ] of the [ supposed ] authentic Islamic character of the literal application of hudûd ( Islamic penal code ) .
In the context of relationships between countries , we often tend to remember only the conflicts and the wars .
We focus on the battles and wars between the Muslim world and the Judeo - Christian West , but on a deeper level , there is another more significant aspect , which is an ideological cultural exchange .
Muslims now live in the West ; when Western Muslims approach the Islamic texts , they come with a certain background and upbringing which necessarily affects their understanding .
What we have witnessed in the last couple decades is a growing trend of a return back to early reformist understanding of freedom of religion .
These reform - minded Muslims have realized that not only is the modern concept of freedom of religion permissible in their religion–and not only is it wholly compatible with the Quran–but rather it is mandated and obligatory in Islam .
A “ soft reformation ” is taking place in Islam , as mentioned by Dr. Tariq Ramadan and others .
The reformists are challenging traditional interpretations and understandings of the religion , and pushing for a repeal of apostasy laws in specific where they exist .
The struggle is on , and change cannot and will not happen overnight ; the post - colonial mess that the Muslim world finds itself in only retards intellectual growth but the process has begun .
Enter the Islamophobes
Instead of seeking to help the reform - minded Muslims , the Islamophobes have demonized virtually all Muslims , except of course a few self - hating Muslims who simply repeat whatever the Islamophobes want to hear ( for which they are rewarded handsomely ) .
The main argument used by Islamophobes is that Islam as a religion itself advocates the death penalty for apostates , and therefore it is the religion itself– not the interpretation of it –that is the problem , an unusually obtuse and altogether unhelpful assertion .
Furthermore , some of them argue , Muslims must abandon their belief in the inerrant nature of the Quran .
In other words , the Islamophobes posit that the only possible way for Muslims to become “ civilized ” is to view the Quran as any other text , deleting what they dislike from it and adding whatever they wish to it–or as Daniel Pipes puts it : to make it “ defunct . ”
While , certainly , that may seem like a plausible solution to an outsider , the problem is that for the vast majority of Muslims it is quite simply not a possibility ; it is anathema to question the Quran ’s veracity .
Regardless of the arguments back and forth on the issue , the practical reality is that the Muslim masses cannot countenance such a thing ; the Islamophobes know this , and that ’s why they set up this formula .
In other words , they know that the Muslims cannot do this and therefore it has become for the Islamophobes the “ only possible solution ” to the problem .
Yet , it is hardly the case that the Muslims can only take one possible route to modernization .
Reform - minded Muslims believe that a change in the texts is not required , but only a change in the understanding and interpretation of said texts .
Open Texts
The Quran is an open text , because it generally refrains from specifics .
In fact , names are almost never used in it , in order that its verses have not only a specific meaning but also a more general import .
For example , a verse may have been revealed to placate the Islamic prophet Muhammad during a particularly difficult time in his struggle ; so even though the verse will have a specific reason for revelation ( to one particular man in one specific situation ) , it can also be used in a general context : Muslims will use that same verse when they themselves are going through tough times .
Because of this unique structure of the Quranic text , what one gets out of it depends a lot on the reader , who tends to inject into verses his own background and biases , for better or for worse .
Having said that , it seems to the author that an unbiased and neutral reading validates the argument of the reform - minded Muslims : nowhere in the Quran does it clearly and definitively say one must kill apostates .
In fact , it seems to say the exact opposite .
If Muslims can understand it in that way , why this continual insistence by the Islamophobes that the Muslims “ must ” abandon their belief in the inerrant nature of the Quran ?
( Again , it is in order to set up a situation whereby Muslims simply cannot fulfill the requirements to be accepted into society , which is exactly what the Islamophobes desire . )
But enough jibber jabber ; the proof is in the pudding .
The Quran
Ms. Fathima Rifqa Bary was incorrect : unlike the Bible , the Quran does not at all say to kill apostates if they choose to leave Islam .
Rather , it says the exact opposite .
The Quran declares emphatically :
“ Let there be no compulsion in religion : Truth is distinct from error ! ” ( Quran , 2:256 )
Almost every Muslim knows this verse by heart .
It categorically closes the door to religious compulsion , and is used by reform - minded Muslims to promote freedom of religion and the idea that the people have a right to follow whatever religion they so choose .
Because “ truth is distinct from error , ” people should be able to discern it for themselves without having to be forced .
Tafsir al - Jalalayn , a classical Islamic text , says of this verse : “ This was revealed concerning the Ansar who tried to compel their sons to enter into Islam . ”
Some of their children were Jewish , and the parents wished to force them to become Muslims .
In Al - Suyuti ‘s classical text Asbab al - Nuzul ( Reasons for Revelation ) , it also says that there was a Muslim father by the name of Husayn bin Salim bin Awf who had two daughters both of whom were Christians .
After failing to convince them to convert to Islam of their own free will , he went to the Islamic prophet Muhammad and requested permission to compel them into Islam .
It was for this that the verse “ Let there be no compulsion in religion ” was revealed , to forbid parents from forcibly converting their children to Islam .
The relevance to the Fathima Rifqa Bary case cannot be understated : contrary to Fathima ’s claim , the Quran forbids religious compulsion in general .
The verse in question was specifically revealed for parents in regard to their children of different faiths .
Amazingly , the Quranic verse was revealed to forbid a Muslim father from forcing his Christian daughters into Islam .
Sound familiar ?
Sounds a lot like Mr. Bary and his daughter !
So how accurate was Fathima ’s claim that the Quran commands parents to force their children into Islam or kill them if they refuse ?
Ironically , it is the Bible –the same one that Fathima holds –that has verses in it commanding parents to stone their daughters should they worship gods other than the Christian one .
Considering that Fathima espouses a hardliner literalistic Christian fundamentalist mentality , we wonder if she would even contextualize the verse like the Christian mainstream does ?
( This is not about Christianity vs Islam ; this is about extremists vs moderates ; Fathima and the Global Revolution Church are not representative of mainstream Christianity , at least not any more than Al - Muhajiroon is of the Islamic mainstream ! )
Alas , I digress .
Back to the Quran , which says :
“ And if your Lord had pleased , surely all those who are in the earth would have believed , all of them ; will you then force men till they become believers ? ” ( Quran , 10:99 )
Reform - minded Muslims use the above verse to argue that forcing people into Islam is wrong because God Himself did not do that .
They believe that the power to guide and misguide people rests only with God , and nobody can share in that .
The next verse is used by reformists to show that Muslims should just worry about what they themselves do , instead of trying to force people into guidance :
“ And had God willed , He could have made you all one [ religious ] community , but He sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills .
But you shall certainly be called to account for what you ( yourself ) used to do [ i.e. not what others used to do ] . ” ( Quran , 16:93 )
The phrase –“ God guides Whom He wills ” and that He “ misguides Whom He wills ” –appears in dozens of Quranic verses .
All of these references are commanding believers that they cannot force or will people into the religion , but that only God can do that .
The Quran commands :
“ The Truth is from your Lord ; so let him who please believe and let him who please disbelieve . ” ( Quran , 18:29 )
And the Quran says :
“ Exhort them to believe ; your task is only to exhort .
You can not compel them to believe . ” ( Quran , 88:21 - 22 )
Another verse in the Quran indicates that during the life of the Islamic prophet Muhammad , there were people who believed and disbelieved –and then believed only to disbelieve once again ; in other words , people entered into and out of the religion freely .
The Quran says that such people are weak in faith and God will never guide them in this worldly life .
The verse reads :
“ Those who believe then disbelieve , again believe and again disbelieve , then increase in disbelief , Allah will never forgive them nor guide them to the Way . ” ( Quran , 4:137 )
Reform - minded Muslims use this verse as a proof that there can be no punishment for apostasy .
If that had been the case , then those who believe and then disbelieved ( i.e. apostates ) would have been put to death and therefore no chance would have been given to them to once again believe and disbelieve .
Furthermore , the verse says that God will never guide them back to Islam , indicating that the Muslims are to ignore such a person : if God did not guide them to the Way , then why should Muslims ?
So there are clear and explicit verses of the Quran that reform - minded Muslims naturally understand to mean that freedom of religion must be extended to all , and that compulsion into Islam is not to be tolerated .
The Hadiths
Enter the Hadiths .
For those who do n’t know , the Hadiths are a body of collection of the prophet Muhammad ’s sayings or traditions .
In other words , the Quran is considered by Muslims to be the word of God , and the Hadiths are the words of their prophet .
Unlike the Quran however , Muslims do not believe that all of the Hadiths are authentic .
Rather , many of them are apocryphal and therefore rejected .
In other words , if some Islamophobe claims that such - and - such Hadith exists , be aware of the fact that many of them are rejected by Muslims .
The Hadiths do not occupy the same rank as the Quran , but are rather a secondary source open to criticism .
In this huge body of collection , we find the Hadith that Islamophobes rely on as their trump card in this debate , which reads as follows : “ Whoever changes his religion , kill him . ”
At first glance , that seems pretty clear and unambiguous but has the Islamophobe proven his case ?
Well , let ’s take into consideration that the Bible has many seemingly clear and unambiguous verses which call to kill apostates , yet we never assume that Christians today believe this , nor do we insist that Christianity itself demands it .
A Christian–when confronted with those verses in the Bible–would respond by saying something like the following :
“ Well , that ’s the Old Testament , and Jesus abrogated that part of the law .
Back then during Biblical times , the believers were few and there was a real fear that they would be eliminated so punishing apostates was a deterrent .
Furthermore , at that time apostasy was akin to high treason . ”
And this answer would completely placate the Islamophobes .
In other words , verses that seemed unambiguous and clear from a religious book seemed to indicate one thing at face value , but the people who follow that book have a different way of understanding it : they give an explanation that contextualizes the verses .
Let ’s be clear here : we ’re not trying to bash Christianity at all .
What we are saying however is that if we extend the common courtesy to Christians that they can contextualize such verses in the Bible , then why do we not extend the same courtesy to the Muslims when it comes to the Hadiths ?
Keep in mind also that Muslims believe that their Bible–so to speak–is the Quran and not the Hadiths .
In other words , if Christianity ’s primary source seems to say that apostates are to be killed , then why do we not accept any explanation from Muslims about their secondary source ?
( Hint : Islamophobia is the answer ! )
It is this terrible double standard that bothers Muslims and those who believe in religious tolerance .
So how do reform - minded Muslims contextualize the Hadith in question ( i.e. “ whoever changes his religion , kill him . ” ) ?
First of all , they point out that these are not the words of the Islamic prophet Muhammad to begin with ; rather , these are the the words of a man named Ibn Abbas who was paraphrasing the words of the Islamic prophet .
The full text of that particular Hadith is as follows :
Some Zanadiqa were brought to Ali and he burnt them .
The news of this event , reached Ibn Abbas who said , “ If I had been in his place , I would not have burnt them , as Allah ’s Apostle forbade it , saying :
Do not punish anybody with Allah ’s punishment ( fire ) .
I would have killed them according to the statement of Allah ’s Apostle : Whoever changed his Islamic religion , then kill him . ”
( Sahih Bukhari , Vol. 9 , Book 84 , Number 57 )
If this was a paraphrase , what were the actual words of the Islamic prophet Muhammad ?
We find one such Hadith which says :
“ The blood of a Muslim , who confesses that there is no God but God and that I am His Apostle , cannot be shed except in three cases : ( 1 ) In penalty for murder , ( 2 ) a married person who commits adultery and ( 3 ) the one who reverts from Islam ( apostates ) and leaves the community . ”
( Sahih Bukhari , Vol. 12 , Book ad - Diyat , Number 6878 , p.209 )
Based on this , reformists say that a person cannot be given capital punishment except for three offenses : ( 1 ) murder , ( 2 ) adultery , and ( 3 ) apostasy combined with “ leav[ing ] the community . ”
Such Muslims say that apostasy is not punished except for when it is combined with “ leav[ing ] the community , ” which they say refers to high treason against the Islamic state .
What is meant specifically by “ leaving the community ” is of leaving the community to join the enemy forces .
To bolster this claim , reformists point to another similarly narrated Hadith , which reads :
“ The blood of a Muslim , who confesses that none has the right to be worshiped but God and that I am His Apostle , cannot be shed except in three cases : ( 1 ) a married person who commits adultery ; he is to be stoned and ( 2 ) a man who went out fighting against God and His Messenger ; he is to be killed or crucified or exiled from the land and ( 3 ) a man who murders another person ; he is to be killed on account of it . ”
( Sunan Abu Dawud , Vol. 4 , Number 4353 , p. 126 )
In other words , we have the exact same three instances in which a person may be put to death : ( 1 ) murder , ( 2 ) adultery , and ( 3 ) “ a man who went out fighting against God and His Messenger . ”
Reform - minded Muslims reason that since the Islamic prophet restricted capital punishment to three classes of people , the third instance must be referring to the same group .
In other words “ leav[ing ] the community ” refers to “ a man who went out fighting against God and His Messenger . ”
Reform - minded Muslims tie these Hadiths to the following Quranic verse :
“ The punishment of those who wage war against God and His Apostle , and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is : execution , or crucifixion , or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides , or exile from the land : this is their disgrace in this world , and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter . ” ( Quran , 5:33 )
Notice how similar the above verse is to the Hadith mentioned in Sunan Abu Dawud ( above ) .
The Hadith mentions the one “ who went out fighting against God and His Messenger ” whilst the Quran says “ those who wage war against God and His Apostle , ” and the punishment for such is also the same in both : “ killed or crucified or exiled from the land . ”
Reformists point out that the opinion of the ultraconservative Muslims –that peaceful apostates are to be killed –does not jive with the above , since that would mean that a person is to be killed for other than the three reasons , even though the Islamic prophet limited it to only three reasons , not four .
And even if we say that the Hadiths do not limit capital punishment to only three reasons , argue reformists , the issue is that the two Hadiths ( as found in Sahih al - Bukhari and Sunan Abu Dawood ) both mention three sins–murder , adultery , and apostasy / waging war .
It is abundantly clear then that the third sin ( other than murder and adultery ) is in reference to the same thing in both narrations , due to the congruency of the two Hadiths –which firmly establishes the linkage so the linking of apostasy to treason is firmly established by the congruency of the two Hadiths .
This argument stands alone in itself and is not dependent on limiting capital punishment to three sins .
Reasons for Revelation
At the time that this Hadith was said ( i.e. to kill apostates that left the community ) , the Muslims of the city of Medina were under attack by the Quraish “ idolaters ” of Mecca ( which at that time was predominantly non-Muslim ) .
Many of the Muslims in Medina were emigrants from Mecca , who had converted to Islam .
Do you see now why religion and national identity was fused at the hip back then ?
If you were a Meccan who converted from paganism to Islam , you ’d be persecuted or even killed by your former co-religionists .
So those who converted to Islam would “ leave the community ” of Mecca to join Medina .
The Meccans reacted harshly to this new religion of Islam and desired to wipe it off the map .
They gathered armies and marched towards the fledgling Islamic city - state .
Naturally , since the converts to Islam came from pagan families , such battles between Mecca and Medina would result in brother being pitted against brother , and father against son .
Some of the newly converted Muslims naturally felt uncomfortable having to fight their families , and therefore would apostatize to the side of the idolatrous Meccans .
Others were simply weak in faith and felt overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of the invaders , so they defected to the pagan army .
More insidiously , there were some in Medina who conspired with the people of Mecca to betray the Muslims in battle .
They hatched a plan that they would “ convert ” to Islam to join the forces of Medina , only to apostatize and abandon the Muslims in the thick of things , in order to destroy the morale of the Muslim army .
The Quran says of this :
“ A section of the People of the Book say : ‘ Believe in the morning what is revealed to those who believe , and reject it at the end of the day , perchance they may themselves turn back . ” ( Quran , 3:72 )
In the classical Tafsir ( commentary ) entitled Asbab al - Nuzul ( Reasons for Revelation ) it says of this verse :
… The town of Uraynah conspired with each other , saying : “ Pretend to join the religion of Muhammad at the beginning of the day and declare your disbelief in it at the end of the day .
Say :
‘ We have looked in our Scriptures and consulted our scholars and found that Muhammad is not genuine ; it is clear to us now that he is lying and that his religion is false . ’
If you do this , his Companions will doubt their religion .
They will say : ‘ these are people of the Book and they are more knowledgeable than us .
They will then abandon their religion and embrace yours . ' ”
Reformists believe it was in this particular situation that the Hadiths about killing “ apostates ” who “ leave the community ” and “ wage war against God and His Messenger ” were said .
“ Leaving the community ” is a reference to leaving the community of Medina to join the invaders .
Therefore , they reason , it was not merely “ peaceful apostasy ” which is to be punished , but rather high treason , i.e. trying to destroy the Islamic state ’s army .
It was a specific plot of the unbelievers to convert to Islam in order to mass apostatize and defect to the pagan side to destroy the Muslims .
One can see then how apostasy and defection are linked ; back then , there was a pagan army and a Muslim army .
If you were pagan , you fought for the pagan army .
If you were Muslim , you fought for the Muslim army .
If you converted from one to the other , then you ’d likely abandon one army and defect to the other .
Hence the phrase “ the one who reverts from Islam ( apostates ) and leaves the community . ”
Furthermore , the act of assisting in battle the unbelievers against the believers was in itself considered an act of apostasy .
This is why reformists believe that back then religious identity was fused with national identity and state loyalty .
This is what professor M. Cherif Bassiouni meant when he wrote ,
My position on apostasy … [ is ] that at the time of the Prophet it was not considered as only changing one ’s mind but that it was the equivalent of joining the enemy and thus constituting high treason .
Going back to the now famous Hadith ( “ Whoever changes his religion , kill him ” ) this was –revealed about the Zanadiqa :
Some Zanadiqa were brought to Ali and he burnt them .
The news of this event , reached Ibn Abbas who said , “ If I had been in his place , I would not have burnt them , as Allah ’s Apostle forbade it , saying :
Do not punish anybody with Allah ’s punishment ( fire ) .
I would have killed them according to the statement of Allah ’s Apostle : Whoever changed his Islamic religion , then kill him . ”
( Sahih Bukhari , Vol. 9 , Book 84 , Number 57 )
The word “ Zanadiqa ” translates to heretics , and here is referring to a group known as the Saba’iyya .
The founder of this group , Ibn Saba , was believed by Muslims to be an enemy of the Islamic state who pretended to convert to Islam in order to instigate civil war and strife .
Although his existence is a matter of dispute amongst scholars , his group –the Saba ’iyya ( Zanadiqa ) – did exist .
They claimed that the prophet Muhammad ’s cousin–a man by the name of Ali ibn Abi Talib–was god incarnate .
They instigated revolts against the government and eventually orchestrated the murder of the Caliph ( Muslim leader ) of the time , a man named Uthman ibn Affan .
We read :
Ibn Saba … [ whose ] activity began during the caliphate of Uthman when he travelled from Hijaz to Syria , stirr[ed ] up unrest and rebellion in Egypt , Basrah , and Kufah and incit[ed ] to the murder of the caliph by the Egyptian rebels …
Ibn Saba was also responsible for the outbreak of fighting between the armies of Ali and Aisha at Basrah .
( Shi’ite Heritage : Essays on Classical and Modern Traditions , by Lynda Clarke , pp.9-10 )
And :
The Khalif Ali caused the adherents of Abd Allah ibn Saba to be burnt to death …
But when Ibn Abbas learned of the occurrence , he said : “ I should indeed have put them to death , but certainly not burned them , for the Prophet has forbidden that any one shall be punished by fire , because this is the mode of punishment exclusively to Allah . ” ( Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics , Edited by James Hastings , p.625 )
In other words , the Zanadiqa being referred to here were not “ peaceful apostates ” who simply changed their mind , but rather they were guilty of high treason , causing a civil war , instigating a rebellion in Egypt , and ultimately killing the Caliph .
Indeed , they were similar to the group of people who had pretended to convert to Islam in order to apostatize during the thick of things ( i.e. in the battle between Medina and Mecca ) .
The bottom line then is that even the Hadith that the Islamophobes rely upon can be used as a proof that only those apostates who wage war against the state are to be killed .
The Traditional Opinion
Yes , it is true that the majority “ classical ” and traditional opinion of Islamic jurists was that apostasy–even “ peaceful apostasy ” – should be punished by death .
This belief was enshrined into Islamic jurisprudence in the medieval era , and therefore many “ classical ” Islamic texts do indeed say this .
It is for this reason that Alan Kornman of ACT for America–a fervently Islamophobic group–was waving around a copy of Reliance of the Traveler , a fourteenth century manual of Islamic jurisprudence , which does say that apostates should be killed .
Is it possible to point out the obvious ?
The text was written hundreds of years ago in the medieval era .
The absurdity of using it as some sort of proof against contemporary Muslims is absurd .
Muslims do not consider this book to be religiously binding upon them .
The words of the classical scholars are not considered a part of the Islamic canon .
Only the Quran and some of the Hadiths are said to have any divine origin .
Contemporary Muslims believe that they are free to agree or disagree with the words of classical scholars .
There is no equivalent to the pope in Islam .
Yes , they do respect the classical scholars , and do view them as some of the greatest scholars of all time , but that does not mean that they agree with them on all issues .
As for “ classical texts ” like the Reliance of the Traveler , yes many moderate Muslims consider such treatises to be a good source of attaining their Islamic knowledge , but they do n’t believe that they must accept every single sentence or dot therein !
As the famous Islamic saying goes : they take the good in it , and leave the rest !
Even within the classical Islamic texts , one can find great disagreement therein .
For example , there are classical texts which refute some of the views expressed in the Reliance of the Traveler .
If that is the case –that Islamic scholars of that time disagreed with some views within that text and others –why should n’t contemporary Islamic scholars–and Muslims in general –disagree with some of its views ?
Is this really so hard to comprehend ?
I do n’t think so .
We understand it perfectly well with classical Christian texts .
Let ’s look at the work of Saint Thomas Aquinas , one of the most influential Christian scholars in history .
The Vatican considers him as “ the model teacher ” for those pursuing priesthood .
The Summa Theologica , a book written by St. Thomas Aquinas , is considered one of the best summaries of Catholic doctrine to this day , and continues to be relied upon .
In other words , here we have a text that is certainly more central to the Catholic faith than theReliance of the Traveler is to Muslims .
Well , let ’s take a look - see into what the Summa Theologica says about apostasy ; the first part talks about how Jews are apostates and thus worse than regular disbelievers , and the second part talks about how apostates ought to be compelled by the sword to Christianity :
Question 10 : Unbelief in General …
It is written ( 2 Peter 2:21 ) : “ It had been better for them not to have known the way of justice , than after they have known it , to turn back . ”
Now the heathens have not known the way of justice , whereas heretics and Jews have abandoned it after knowing it in some way .
Therefore theirs is the graver sin…
He who resists the faith after accepting it , sins more grievously against faith , than he who resists it without having accepted it … [ The Jews ] accepted the figure of that faith in the Old Law , which they corrupt by their false interpretations , [ so ] their unbelief is a more grievous sin than that of the heathens , because the latter have not accepted the Gospel faith in any way at all …
Article 8 .
Whether unbelievers ought to be compelled to the faith ?
… I answer that , Among unbelievers there are some who have never received the faith , such as the heathens and the Jews : and these are by no means to be compelled to the faith …
On the other hand , there are unbelievers who at some time have accepted the faith , and professed it , such as heretics and all apostates : such should be submitted even to bodily compulsion , that they may fulfil what they have promised , and hold what they , at one time , received …
For , Augustine says “ … When a man ’s crime [ apostasy ] is so publicly known , and so hateful to all , that he has no defenders , or none such as might cause a schism , the severity of discipline should not slacken ” … Those Jews who have in no way received the faith , ought not by no means to be compelled to the faith : if , however , they have received it , they ought to be compelled to keep it …Christ at first compelled Paul and afterwards taught Him … the rites of other unbelievers , which are neither truthful nor profitable are by no means to be tolerated …
Do we then think it is justified to wave around this seven hundred year old text in the air as a proof that Christians believe that apostates should be killed ?
Or that “ since the Jews are the slaves of the Church , she can dispose of their possessions ” and the “ the rites of other unbelievers , which are neither truthful nor profitable are by no means to be tolerated ? ”
No sensible person can say so .
Rather , Catholics are free to read the book , taking what they like and disagreeing with whatever they dislike .
So why then ca n’t these people understand the same thing for the Reliance of the Traveler , which says the exact same thing about apostasy as does the Summa Theologica ?
Muslims use it in a similar manner to learn about traditional Islamic jurisprudence just as Catholics use the Summa Theologica to learn traditional Catholic doctrine , taking the good and leaving the rest .
In fact , the Muslim translator of the book , Nuh Keller , did not even translate parts of the book into English which he deemed totally irrelevant to the modern day and age , which shows that Muslims do not consider whatever is in the text as religiously binding .
It does n’t mean that Muslims must abandon the book in its entirety , just as Catholics do n’t need to abandon the Summa Theologica altogether .
The Four Schools of Islamic Jurisprudence
A critic of Islam argued back :
Yes there may be moderate Muslims but at this moment in time there is no moderate Islam , as defined by the [ four ] main schools of Islamic jurisprudence .
First , it is absurd to say that there is no moderate Islam ; moderate Islam is what the vast majority of Muslims follow , and how they define it .
As for the argument that “ all four schools of Islamic jurisprudence demand the death penalty for apostasy , ” is n’t this simply restating the obvious ?
Contemporary Muslims already admit that the traditional and classical opinion of Islamic jurists was that apostates were to be killed ( which by the way was also amongst the “ traditional and classical opinions ” in Judaism and Christianity as well ) .
Since the four schools of thought were defined and codified hundreds of years ago , does n’t it already go without saying that the four schools of jurisprudence would take the traditional and classical opinion on the matter ?
Stated another way : as the four schools were codified hundreds of years ago , is it any surprise that they should follow the old way of looking at the matter as opposed to the new ?
So what exactly is the critic trying to say ?
It is simply restating and repackaging the obvious attack in attempt to give an air of authority to it .
His statement also betrays a superficial understanding of the four schools of Islamic jurisprudence .
The four schools are not defined by their final rulings or verdicts , but rather based on their methodology ( Usul ) .
Within a school itself , all sorts of conflicting opinions can be found , since a school is defined not by a ruling but by the methodology one uses to arrive at such a ruling .
In other words , contemporary Muslims can still follow the same methodology and arrive at different conclusions , without betraying the school of thought itself .
Many followers of the four schools have done so with regard to the issue of apostasy .
So the fact that a person follows a school of jurisprudence does not at all mean that he must commit himself to one particular ruling .
Furthermore , many Muslims do not follow a school of jurisprudence at all , with still others claiming that it is wrong to follow the four schools whatsoever .
Bottom line : there are diverse opinions on this matter , and to pigeonhole Muslims into a particular belief is wrong .
It is just wrong to speak on behalf of Muslims ; let them speak for themselves !
Contemporary Muslims argue that their rejection of an opinion held by the classical scholars does not amount to rejection of the scholars themselves , nor of the schools of thought they founded .
Rather , they insist that respectful disagreement is not only permitted but mandated in Islam .
Furthermore , the new opinion of contemporary Muslims is simply a reflection of changed circumstances which have allowed Muslims to properly understand the issue .
Dr. Mohammad Omar Farooq says :
Undeniably , the traditional position of Muslim scholars and jurists has been that apostasy [ riddah ] is punishable by death .
The longstanding problem of the traditional position , as held by Classical jurists or scholars , can be explained and excused as not being able to see apostasy , an issue of pure freedom of faith and conscience , separate from treason against the community or the state .
However , the accumulated experience over the history in terms of abuse of this position about apostasy even against Muslims as well as the changed context of a globally - connected , pluralistic society should help us appreciate the contemporary challenges in light of the Qur’anic norms and the Prophetic legacy .
In this context , while the classical misunderstanding about this issue of apostasy is excusable , the position of some of the well - known contemporary scholars is not .
Contemporary Scholars
Whilst ultraconservative scholars tenaciously cling to medieval opinions , moderate Muslim scholars are increasingly adopting the opinion that absolute freedom of religion is mandated in Islam .
Hundreds of Islamic clerics have accepted this view as correct .
Representatives from all the major Western Muslim organizations have spoken out against the death penalty for apostates .
Indeed , Islam is witnessing a “ soft revolution ” nowadays , and a reformation is taking place .
It seems almost every other day another major Islamic scholar announces that he has studied the issue and come to the conclusion that there should be no punishment for apostasy .
Ijma
The conservative Muslims ( and in turn the Islamophobes ) insist that there is an Ijma ( consensus ) on the view that apostates are to be killed .
This is an Islamic legal term which connotes a sort of authoritativeness to a ruling , almost like a papal decree .
However , this is a hotly contested topic , and this article here explains why it is inappropriate to use Ijma as a proof .
Imam al - Shawkani argued :
“ The one who claims that ijma constitutes proof is not correct , for such [ a claim ] constitutes mere conjecture ( zann ) on the part of an individual from the community of Muslims .
No believer can worship God on the basis of this . ”
Refuting Robert Spencer ’s Drivel
Robert Spencer of JihadWatch argues that Fathima Rifqa Bary was correct for claiming that the Quran mandates death for apostasy .
We have already outlined the numerous verses in the Quran that state the contrary .
But let us now deal with Spencer ’s “ proof . ”
He claims that the following verse is “ direct proof ” that apostates are to be killed :
“ And if any of you turn back from their faith and die in unbelief , their works will bear no fruit in this life and in the Hereafter ; they will be companions of the Fire and will abide therein . ” ( Quran , 2:217 )
Sorry , Spencer , but I do n’t see how that ’s “ direct proof , ” especially in light of the explicit verses in the Quran that I have cited above which clearly and unambiguously forbid compulsion in religion .
In fact , contemporary Islamic scholars use this verse ( the one Spencer just used ) as a proof that there is no worldly punishment for apostasy , only a heavenly one .
For example , Dr. Jamal Badawi says :
There is no single verse in the Qur’an that prescribes an earthly punishment for apostasy .
Verses about apostasy in the Qur’an speak only about God ’s punishment of the apostate in the Hereafter [ such as ] “ … But if any of you should turn away from his / her faith and die as a denier [ of the truth ] – these it is whose works will bear no fruit in this world and in the life to come ; and these it is who are destined for the fire , therein to abide . ” ( [ Quran ] Al - Baqarah 2:217 ) … The silence of the Qur’an on any prescribed mandatory capital for apostasy is quite revealing .
More revealing is the fact that there is overwhelming evidence in the Qur’an of freedom of conscious , belief , and worship .
Of course , Spencer quotes an Islamic scholar who lived hundreds of years ago as a proof .
Sorry , but that ’s not a proof to Muslims , nor is it binding .
Whilst moderate Muslims respect Imam al - Qurtubi like Catholics respect St. Thomas Aquinas , they do n’t believe his words are divine and simply disagree with them .
That is in actuality the bulk of Spencer ’s argument , since the verse itself is not at all “ direct proof ” of anything !
Then Spencer uses verse 4:89 as a “ proof : ”
“ If they turn renegades , seize them and slay them wherever you find them . ” ( Quran , 4:89 )
But he does not quote what comes right before and after it , thereby removing the context of the verse .
The Quran says :
“ Why should you be divided into two parties about the Hypocrites ?
… If they turn renegades , seize them and slay them wherever you find them ;
Except those who join a group between whom and you there is a treaty of peace , or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting you as well as fighting their own people .
If God had pleased , He could have given them power over you , and they would have fought you :
Therefore if they withdraw from you and fight you not , and instead send you guarantees of peace , then God Has opened no way for you to war against them …
Therefore if they do not withdraw from you , and do not offer you peace and restrain their hands , then seize them and kill them wherever you find them ; and against these
We have given you a clear authority ( to war against ) . ” ( Quran , 4:89 - 91 )
This verse is talking about a group of apostates who are pretending to be Muslims ( and are thus Hypocrites ) , so that they can turn renegade during war and destroy the Muslim army from the inside .
In actuality , this verse shows the mercy of Islam , in the sense that the Islamic prophet was forbidden to make war against these people until they picked up arms against the Muslims ; if , however , they did not pick up arms and instead sent guarantees of peace , then Muslims were forbidden from fighting them .
This verse can be used as a proof for the reformist position , namely that peaceful apostates cannot be killed , but those who wage war against the Islamic state ( i.e. high treason ) should be .
Spencer quotes Tafsir al - Jalalayn as a proof , yet does n’t realize that the text itself negates his view .
Tafsir al - Jalalayn says of the very next verse ( 4:90 ) :
[ Those who come to you ] refraining from fighting either you or them , then do not interfere with them , neither taking them as captives nor slaying them …
If they stay away from you and do not fight you , and offer you peace , reconciliation , that is , [ if ] they submit , then God does not allow you any way against them , [ He does not allow you ] a means to take them captive or to slay them .
Abrogation
Christianity was militarized after Jesus died , by latter day thinkers .
A similar thing happened with Islam .
The Quranic text prohibits military aggression , allowing war only in self - defense ; it also gives absolute freedom of religion .
Latter day thinkers within Islam had such a hard time dealing with these issues that they simply decided to “ abrogate ” the peaceful and tolerant verses in order to make Islam “ more compatible ” with the warlike times .
For example , the author of Tafsir al - Jalalayn had such a hard time reconciling verse 4:90 with the view –that apostates are to be killed –that he rationalized that : “ this statement and what follows was abrogated . ”
This has importance here : Spencer uses the verse ( 4:90 ) as a proof that apostasy is mandated in the Quran , yet the classical scholar he quoted as a proof was so “ frustrated ” by this same verse–since it seemed to imply freedom of religion –that he was forced to abrogate it .
In other words , even those Muslim scholars who believe that apostates are to be killed had to get rid of this Quranic verse in order to make their claim , so how can Spencer now use the verse as a proof ?
For those of you who do n’t know what abrogation means , it means that a verse was rescinded and basically no longer counts .
Translation : the verse still appears in the Quran but it has no legal import to it .
Contemporary moderate Muslim scholars reject such a haphazard abrogation of Quranic verses .
For example , a Muslim cleric by the name of Shabir Ally says :
[ Question : ]
Now this idea of abrogation altogether seems odd .
You have a book –you say it ’s from God–and you say ‘ well , He did n’t really mean this . ’
How does one justify this ?
[ Answer : ]
Well , Imam al - Tabari is in a way the father of tafsirs .
And his tafsir is the monumental one that came to be used widely in later tafsirs … and he said very clearly that if a verse is to be agrogated , you have to have some definitive information from the Prophet Muhammad ( peace be upon him ) himself which says that this verse is abrogated , otherwise how would you know if a certain verse is abrogated ?
You should n’t claim that a verse is abrogated without this type of definitive information .
Dr. Jamal Badawi says :
While some scholars have claimed that hundreds of verses of the Qur’an were abrogated , the majority of scholars reject that claim .
Interestingly , the ultraconservative Muslim scholars are inconsistent in their own understanding of the Quran .
For example , the ultraconservative Saudi scholar Ibn Baz affirmed the idea that abrogation is to be used only as a last resort when understanding two seemingly “ contradictory ” verses of the Quran ; Ibn Baz stated :
Whenever it is possible to show agreement or reconciliation between various narrations , in a manner which is suitable , without stretching their meanings , it becomes obligatory to do so .
Making Reconciliation ( al - Jam ) between the texts takes precedence over the other two methods of resolving apparent contradiction between proofs –the two other methods being Outweighing ( al - Tarjih ) and Abrogation ( al - Naskh ) .
This is what has been agreed upon in the Science of Usul al - Fiqh .
The above might be very confusing to the layperson , so to summarize : he is basically saying that when two texts seem to contradict each other , then one should first try to reconcile them ( al - Jam ) before one claims that one is abrogated by the other ( al - Naskh ) .
In other words , when we have one text saying “ Let there be no compulsion in religion ” and another saying “ Whoever changes his religion , kill him , ” there seems to be an apparent contradiction between the two .
One way to resolve these two texts would be to say that the latter abrogated the former ( and this is the argument of Bin Baz and other ultraconservative scholars ) .
Ibn Baz is quoted by an ultraconservative Saudi website as saying :
[ Question : ]
Some friends say that whoever does not enter Islam , that is his choice and he should not be forced to become Muslim , quoting as evidence the verses in which Allaah says ( interpretation of the meaning ) …
“ There is no compulsion in religion ” [ al - Baqarah 2:256 ]
What is your opinion concerning that ?
[ Answer : ] … Ayat al - Sayf ( the verse of the sword ) … and similar verses abrogate the verses which say that there is no compulsion to become Muslim .
Oddly however Bin Baz does not follow his own rule that Reconciliation of texts takes precedence over Abrogation !
Reform - minded Muslims reconcile the texts by simply contextualizing the second narration , which indicates that peaceful apostates are not to be killed but those apostates who “ wage war ” ( i.e. high treason ) are .
The way in which Ibn Baz , other ultraconservatives , and some classical scholars abrogated the peaceful verses without direct proof of that must be rejected , argue reform - minded Muslims .
As Ibn Al - Hassar , a classical Islamic scholar himself , stated :
It is not acceptable , in the matter of Abrogation , to accept statements of the interpreters of the Quran , not even the ijtihad ( reasoning ) of those engaging in ijtihad without authentic reports or clear evidence …
What is acceptable in that matter is the [ explicit ] narration [ of the Prophet ] and history [ Sunna / Sira ] not opinion or ijtihad .
Therefore , reform - minded Muslims reject any classical or contemporary scholar ’s opinion that such - and - such verse was abrogated , unless the claimant brings unequivocal proof of that , such as a direct statement from the Islamic prophet to that effect .
But in the absence of that , such arguments are rejected ; otherwise , every single verse in the Quran could be abrogated by mere desire !
Therefore , when Islamophobes try to build their whole case on Tafsirs ( commentaries ) written hundreds of years ago , be extremely wary !
A Tafsir is not a proof in and of itself ; it is simply one man ’s interpretation of the Quran open to criticism .
Reform - minded Muslim scholars argue that their understanding of the Quran ’s view on this matter is more accurate and truer to the text , since they take into consideration all of the verses instead of simply doing away with whatever verses they cannot reconcile to their preconceived view .
Meanwhile , the ultraconservatives are forced to abrogate verses of the Quran without any proof for that , such as the verse that forbids compulsion in religion .
Certainly , it is unacceptable to just abrogate verses that one does not agree with !
In other words , neither the ultraconservative Muslims nor the Islamophobes can make their case , i.e. that the Quran says to kill apostates , without having to get rid of certain Quranic verses , those that are abundantly clear that religious compulsion is forbidden .
This in actuality shows the strength of the reformist view , namely that if one looks at the Quran as a whole , it mandates religious freedom .
Hypocrites Worse than Disbelievers
In the Quran , it is clear that the worst of mankind are the Hypocrites , a group of people who pretended to be Muslims but were really disbelievers in their hearts .
They were a group that sought to destroy Islam from the inside .
Reformists point out that forcing people into Islam–be they disbelievers or apostates –would create a legion of Hypocrites within the ranks of the Muslims , something far more dangerous than people simply peacefully following whatever religion they want .
Dr. Jamal Badawi argues :
The fear of such assumed [ capital ] punishment [ for apostasy ] may lead many to hypocrisy ; by pretending to remain Muslims just to save their lives .
In the final analysis , hypocrisy is a greater danger to the community than apostasy in itself .
Hypocrites may implode the Muslim community from within .
Reform - minded Muslims also point out the fact that there was a Bedouin who apostatized in the lifetime of the prophet Muhammad , leaving the Islamic city - state of Medina ; he abandoned both his religious and national identity ( as the two were fused back then ) .
Instead of punishing the man , the prophet Muhammad simply replied by saying : “ Medina is like a pair of bellows ( i.e. a furnace ) : it expels its impurities and brightens and clears its good . ”
( Sahih al - Bukhari , Vol.9 , No.316 , pp.241 )
Reformists use this narration as a proof that someone leaving the religion is –in a way–a good thing : it purifies the religion from those weak in faith who could become Hypocrites .
Is it not better to have a few strong believers rather than many weak Hypocrites ?
Dr. Jamal Badawi notes that this incident involving the Bedouin took place after the Islamic city - state of Medina was up and running , so the Islamophobes cannot claim that this was before some mass abrogation of verses :
This incident took place in Madinah when Muslims were living in an independent Islamic “ state , ” where the Prophet ( peace and blessings be upon him ) had full authority to implement Shari`ah law .
If indeed the “ revealed ” prescribed punishment for apostasy is death , the Prophet ( peace and blessings be upon him ) would have been the first to carry out the punishment .
In fact , he did not even prescribe any punishment at all against that Bedouin , nor did he send any one to arrest him as an “ apostate , ” imprison , or ask him to recant or even reconsider his decision as later jurists prescribed .
Nor is there any solid ground to claim that this and other similar hadiths were “ abrogated . ”
In fact , these Hadiths are in conformity with the Qur’an and consistent with its central value of freedom of conscious and rejection of any compulsion in matters of faith ( Al - Baqarah 2:256 ) .
Nonsensical Defense
Some conservative Muslims argue that the death penalty for apostasy makes “ perfect sense , ” since “ people choose to enter Islam knowing that it is a lifetime decision punishable by death ” and therefore “ it serves to ensure that their intention is strong ” and “ dissuades those weak in faith from entering it . ”
Reform - minded Muslims argue that this argument is weak from many angles .
It is negated by the fact that the conservative Muslims do not differentiate in this matter between converts to Islam and those born into the religion : in fact , some of the classical scholars opined that born Muslims who apostatize ( murtad fitri ) are more liable to punishment than those who had converted to Islam ( murtad milli ) .
The question reform - minded Muslims ask is : does a born Muslim get the chance to enter the religion knowing that he will be killed if he ever leaves it ?
The answer is of course no ; one simply grows up following the religion of one ’s parents ; therefore , the justification that “ apostates knew what they were getting into ” falls flat on its face .
Reform - minded Muslims also say that it is quite simply common sense that people change their minds .
This is quite obvious : one day a person thinks Islam is the religion for him , but maybe ten years down the line he does n’t .
Additionally , reform - minded Muslims argue that killing an apostate robs him of the chance to repent later in life .
There are for example many youth who leave religion only to come back to it in their elderly years when they become fearful of death and what follows that .
A person who apostates today could become Islam ’s best follower some day in the future .
Lastly , reform - minded Muslims point out that the Quranic principle is that God has granted humans free will : they have the right to accept Islam or reject it .
Nobody can force them to do so .
Why would God command Muslims to force people into Islam when it is He Himself
Who gave people the ability to leave the religion ?
An Important Clarification
Even if Fathima ’s parents held the “ traditional view , ” this does not mean that they were going to kill her .
In fact , the traditional view–as espoused by the classical scholars and now championed by the ultraconservatives –has always been that corporal punishments –such as killing of apostates–must be done by the government and not individuals .
Vigilante justice has always been strictly forbidden , and in fact severely punished .
The second Caliph of Islam was in fact killed , and his son ended up killing the murderer , vigilante style .
Even though his case seemed just , the Muslim authorities punished him for murder , due to it being vigilante justice outside the court system .
We can read this from ultraconservative Islamic websites themselves , which quote classical scholars ; for example , the Saudi based Islam - QA strictly forbids “ honor killing ” on the grounds that it is vigilante justice :
Al - Qurtubi said :
There is no dispute among the scholars that qisaas ( retaliatory punishments ) such as execution cannot be carried out except by those in authority who are obliged to carry out the qisaas and carry out hadd punishments etc , because Allaah has addressed the command regarding qisaas to all the Muslims , and it is not possible for all the Muslims to get together to carry out the qisaas , which is why they appointed a leader who may represent them in carrying out the qisaas and hadd punishments .
Tafseer al - Qurtubi , 2/245 , 246 .
No one should carry out the hadd punishments without the permission of the ruler .
If there is no ruler who rules according to sharee ’ah then it is not permissible for the ordinary people to carry out the hadd [ corporal ] punishments .
Whoever does that is sinning , because carrying out the hadd punishments requires examining the matter and requires shar ’i knowledge in order to know the conditions of proof .
The ordinary people have no knowledge of such things , and the carrying out of one of the hadd punishments by the ordinary people leads to many evils and the loss of security , whereby people will attack one another and kill one another or chop off one another ’s hands on the grounds that they are carrying out hadd punishments .
Islam - QA : Honor Killings Forbidden in Islam
And that ’s the opposite of a reformist site .
So even they do n’t advocate honor killings or vigilante justice .
The point here is not to justify the ultraconservative view .
Rather , it is simply to show that this entire thing has been a hyped up situation used to demonize Islam and Muslims in general .
Most Western Muslims do n’t believe in killing apostates , and even the small fraction that do do n’t believe it can be done in the West .
Conclusion
The Quran does not at all say to kill apostates .
As for the Hadiths , yes there are some texts which could be interpreted as such , but reform - minded Muslims believe that if you properly contextualize them , this is not the case .
Furthermore , they believe that if a Hadith contradicts a basic tenet of the Quran , it is to be rejected ; in other words , the Quran takes precedence over all other texts .
As for a parent forcing a child to convert to Islam , an explicit verse in the Quran rejects this practice , which was specifically revealed for a Muslim father who was trying to force his Christian daughters to accept Islam , a remarkably similar situation to what we see in the Fathima Rifqa Bary case today .
What seems apparent is that Fathima ’s parents never threatened to kill her ; rather , she was brainwashed by some Christian extremists ( who by the way look down on the Christian mainstream ) into thinking that Islam itself–and the Quran in particular–mandates death for apostates .
Notice in her emotional interview that she clearly was of the view that : the Quran mandates it , ergo religious Muslims believe in it .
This logic is faulty and problematic .
The Islamophobes have jumped on this opportunity to spread fear and hate , insisting that Islam is intrinsically culpable , a pagan and heathen religion incompatible with those who love Christ .
Yes , a legitimate criticism is that it is unfortunate that there are Muslims–even some big time scholars who are not ultraconservatives –hold onto this view .
This is in fact a self - criticism that the reform - minded Muslims themselves engage in , and if the critics limited their input to this , there would have been no problem .
But the Islamophobes wanted to impugn Islam as a whole , and the Muslims in generality .
The issue of apostasy is at “ the heart of a burning debate among modern Muslims , ” explained Sherman Jackson , a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Michigan .
It is a time of reassessment , flux , and hopefully change .
But to reduce that all down to “ Muslims ( or Islam ) say that apostates are to be killed ” is preposterous .
Muslims are undergoing a soft reformation , led by Western Muslims .
But it will take time , just like Europe did not reform overnight .
Even if there happens to be a case of Muslim parents killing their children for changing religions , this should n’t be used as an example of what Islam advocates , or what Muslims in general think .
Such demonization is altogether unhelpful and only helps to strengthen a binary worldview .
If indeed such a case takes place ( and they do from time to time ) , then the fault lies with the murderers , not Islam and not the Muslims in generality .
Certainly we should n’t encourage extremists and xenophobes who seek to co-opt such tragedies for their own nefarious agendas of fear mongering and singling out of Muslims , who are already one of the most maligned minority groups in the West .
Network reduces Obama ’s bank bailout savings by 99 percent
You probably think we ’re talking about last week ’s flub .
But no — another day , another Fox News reporting “ mistake ” that conveniently supports the news network ’s editorial bias .
The nation ’s most - watched 24 - hour news channel has made no less than two politically - loaded math errors in the past several days .
First , the network reported that a vast majority of Americans — 94 percent — believe that climate scientists have falsified research into global warming ( see picture below ) .
The only problem is , according to Fox ’s poll graphic , the total number of participants in the poll adds up to 120 percent .
ADVERTISEMENT
The network had been reporting on a Rasmussen poll that shows considerably different numbers .
It appears Fox added the number of people who said data falsification was “ very likely ” ( 35 percent ) to the number of people who thought it was “ somewhat likely ” ( 24 percent ) and then presented that sum — 59 percent — as the number of people who said it was “ somewhat likely . ”
Any independent observer will certainly note the coincidence that the fudged number makes it look like a disproportionately large part of the US population is opposed to climate change legislation , a favorite whipping boy of Fox news hosts .
“ It ’s impossible to tell what motivated Fox to distort Rasmussen ’s data this way , ” writes Simon Maloy at media watchdog MediaMatters .
“ The network as a whole has quite obviously sided with the ‘ skeptics ’ and regularly plays host to a whole roster of petroleum industry - funded climate change deniers .
Then again , it very well may be that the graphics department simply got confused once they started adding percentages together and did n’t catch the mistake before it went on the air . ”
An innocent mistake ?
Perhaps .
But given that Fox presented the numbers broken down the same way as the Rasmussen poll , why would they have even bothered adding those numbers up in the first place ?
ADVERTISEMENT
Fox producer Lauren Petterson , executive producer of Fox & Friends , said in an interview Tuesday that graphic was n’t erroneous .
“ We were just talking about three interesting pieces of information from Rasmussen , ” Petterson said .
“ We did n’t put on the screen that it added up to 100 percent . ”
Then , on Tuesday , as the network broadcast a speech by President Barack Obama in which the president announced that the US will spend $ 200 billion less on bank bailouts than previously estimated , the chyron at the bottom of the Fox News screen announced that the president ’s bailout savings would amount to … $ 2 billion .
ADVERTISEMENT
Raw Story has confirmed that , as of press time , Fox News has n’t corrected the error on air .
But they certainly must know what the actual figure is , as the online version of the story correctly cited the $ 200 - billion figure .
( That bit of good news for taxpayers is buried way at the bottom of Fox ’s story . )
Fox ’s factual errors — which somehow always seem to lean towards the network ’s conservative bias , rather than against it — are quickly becoming the stuff of legend .
ADVERTISEMENT
This past summer , the network was broadly criticized after MediaMatters uncovered footage of a Fox producer stage - managing a crowd at the 9/12 Tea Party rally .
Then in November the network made a similar sort of “ mistake ” when it showed footage from that 9/12 rally when covering a much smaller protest organized by Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) .
A week later , the network went for the hat trick and used footage from a 2008 presidential campaign rally to depict a Sarah Palin book - signing .
The following video was broadcast on Fox News , December 8 , 2009 , and uploaded to the Web by DailyKosTV .

At least four people have been killed and hundreds arrested amid violence between anti-government protesters and police in the Iranian capital , Tehran .
Opposition sources said the nephew of reformist leader Mir Hossein Mousavi was among those killed when police opened fire .
Officials say three people died in accidents and one was shot dead but not by police , who they say were unarmed .
Witnesses say clashes are continuing overnight in parts of the city .
Opposition website Jaras said police were firing tear gas to disperse protesters , but more demonstrators had gathered near the state - run radio and television headquarters .
Other opposition websites have also reported four deaths in Tabriz , north - western Iran , however there is no confirmation of this .
ANALYSIS Jon Leyne , BBC News Tehran correspondent
The opposition hoped for a massive day of demonstrations , and they have managed that beyond their expectations .
Despite attempts by the security forces to disperse them , the protesters eventually took over a large section of central Tehran , leaving the police watching from the sidelines .
And there are similar reports from across the country .
For much of the morning there was a series of violent confrontations .
Witnesses described how opposition supporters attacked the police with their bare hands , and the police eventually opened fire directly on the crowd .
The size of the demonstrations , and the death of a number of protesters , could dramatically change the nature and the intensity of the confrontation .
But neither side has a clear strategy of what to do next .
The opposition is leaderless .
The government is still pretending there are just a handful of troublemakers .
From day to day , it is not clear how the crisis will develop .
Leaders of opposition parties had urged their supporters to take to the streets on Sunday as the Shia Muslim festival of Ashura reached a climax .
People were chanting " Khamenei will be toppled " , opposition sources said , a reference to Iran 's Supreme Leader .
According to witnesses , demonstrators defied attempts by security forces to disperse them and some attacked police .
Police responded by firing into the crowd , opposition sources say , although this is denied by the authorities .
" Police [ have ] not fired any shots in Tehran and security forces were not in possession of firearms , " Tehran 's police chief Commander Azizollah Rajabzadeh was quoted as saying by the Iranian ISNA news agency .
Commander Rajabzadeh was among dozens of security force members injured in the clashes , Iranian state - owned channel Press TV reported .
Iran 's deputy police chief , Ahmad - Reza Radan , said one of those killed fell from a bridge , two others were hit by cars and one other was shot dead " by an unknown assailant " .
He said the fatal shooting was being investigated .
Mr Mousavi 's website said his nephew , Seyed Ali Mousavi , was shot in the back as security forces fired on demonstrators Mr Mousavi rushed to a Tehran hospital where his nephew had been taken , the website added .
In pictures : Tehran clashes
As the clashes escalated , police helicopters were seen flying over central Tehran and clouds of smoke billowed into the sky , reports said .
Security forces clashed with protesters trying to reach central Enghelab Square , witnesses said .
Protesters chanted " this is the month of blood " and called for the downfall of Ayatollah Khamenei , according to opposition websites .
At the same time , pro-government demonstrators marched on Enghelab Street in support of the ayatollah , witnesses said .
Protests were also reported in the cities of Isfahan and nearby Najafabad .
In a statement , the White House said it strongly condemned the " unjust suppression of civilians in Iran " .
The French foreign ministry said it condemned the " arbitrary arrests and the violent actions " committed against protesters defending " their right to freedom of expression and their desire for democracy " .
The French government has continued to lobby the Iranian authorities to release a French university lecturer who was charged with spying during the election .
Clotilde Reiss remains in Tehran , and last appeared in court on 23 December .
Disputed election Tensions have risen in Iran since influential dissident cleric Grand Ayatollah Hoseyn Ali Montazeri died a week ago aged 87 .
Mr Mousavi ' supporters have sought to use Shia religious festivals to show continued defiance of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government .
Denied the right to protest , the opposition chose the highly significant festival of Ashura when millions of Iranians traditionally take to the streets for ceremonies and parades , BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne says .
The festival mourns the 7th Century death of Imam Hussein , a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad .
Mr Mousavi came second in the June election , and anger at the result saw mass protests in Tehran and other cities that led to thousands of arrests and some deaths .
Mr Mousavi has said the poll , that returned Mr Ahmadinejad to power , was fraudulent .

The delegates began by nodding through a few uncontroversial matters : homosexuality is contrary to the truths ordained by God ; " any mechanism to process , license , record , register or monitor the ownership of guns " should be repealed ; income tax , inheritance tax , capital gains tax and corporation tax should be abolished ; and immigrants should be deterred by electric fences .
Thus fortified , they turned to the real issue : the affairs of a small state 7,000 miles away .
It was then , according to a participant , that the " screaming and near fist fights " began .
I do n't know what the original motion said , but apparently it was " watered down significantly " as a result of the shouting match .
The motion they adopted stated that Israel has an undivided claim to Jerusalem and the West Bank , that Arab states should be " pressured " to absorb refugees from Palestine , and that Israel should do whatever it wishes in seeking to eliminate terrorism .
Good to see that the extremists did n't prevail then .
But why should all this be of such pressing interest to the people of a state which is seldom celebrated for its fascination with foreign affairs ?
The explanation is slowly becoming familiar to us , but we still have some difficulty in taking it seriously .
In the United States , several million people have succumbed to an extraordinary delusion .
In the 19th century , two immigrant preachers cobbled together a series of unrelated passages from the Bible to create what appears to be a consistent narrative : Jesus will return to Earth when certain preconditions have been met .
The first of these was the establishment of a state of Israel .
The next involves Israel 's occupation of the rest of its " biblical lands " ( most of the Middle East ) , and the rebuilding of the Third Temple on the site now occupied by the Dome of the Rock and al - Aqsa mosques .
The legions of the antichrist will then be deployed against Israel , and their war will lead to a final showdown in the valley of Armageddon .
The Jews will either burn or convert to Christianity , and the Messiah will return to Earth .
What makes the story so appealing to Christian fundamentalists is that before the big battle begins , all " true believers " ( ie those who believe what they believe ) will be lifted out of their clothes and wafted up to heaven during an event called the Rapture .
Not only do the worthy get to sit at the right hand of God , but they will be able to watch , from the best seats , their political and religious opponents being devoured by boils , sores , locusts and frogs , during the seven years of Tribulation which follow .
The true believers are now seeking to bring all this about .
This means staging confrontations at the old temple site ( in 2000 , three US Christians were deported for trying to blow up the mosques there ) , sponsoring Jewish settlements in the occupied territories , demanding ever more US support for Israel , and seeking to provoke a final battle with the Muslim world / Axis of Evil / United Nations / European Union / France or whoever the legions of the antichrist turn out to be .
The believers are convinced that they will soon be rewarded for their efforts .
The antichrist is apparently walking among us , in the guise of Kofi Annan , Javier Solana , Yasser Arafat or , more plausibly , Silvio Berlusconi .
The Wal - Mart corporation is also a candidate ( in my view a very good one ) , because it wants to radio - tag its stock , thereby exposing humankind to the Mark of the Beast .
By clicking on www.raptureready.com, you can discover how close you might be to flying out of your pyjamas .
The infidels among us should take note that the Rapture Index currently stands at 144 , just one point below the critical threshold , beyond which the sky will be filled with floating nudists .
Beast Government , Wild Weather and Israel are all trading at the maximum five points ( the EU is debat ing its constitution , there was a freak hurricane in the south Atlantic , Hamas has sworn to avenge the killing of its leaders ) , but the second coming is currently being delayed by an unfortunate decline in drug abuse among teenagers and a weak showing by the antichrist ( both of which score only two ) .
We can laugh at these people , but we should not dismiss them .
That their beliefs are bonkers does not mean they are marginal .
American pollsters believe that 15 - 18 % of US voters belong to churches or movements which subscribe to these teachings .
A survey in 1999 suggested that this figure included 33 % of Republicans .
The best - selling contemporary books in the US are the 12 volumes of the Left Behind series , which provide what is usually described as a " fictionalised " account of the Rapture ( this , apparently , distinguishes it from the other one ) , with plenty of dripping details about what will happen to the rest of us .
The people who believe all this do n't believe it just a little ; for them it is a matter of life eternal and death .
And among them are some of the most powerful men in America .
John Ashcroft , the attorney general , is a true believer , so are several prominent senators and the House majority leader , Tom DeLay .
Mr DeLay ( who is also the co-author of the marvellously named DeLay - Doolittle Amendment , postponing campaign finance reforms ) travelled to Israel last year to tell the Knesset that " there is no middle ground , no moderate position worth taking " .
So here we have a major political constituency - representing much of the current president 's core vote - in the most powerful nation on Earth , which is actively seeking to provoke a new world war .
Its members see the invasion of Iraq as a warm - up act , as Revelation ( 9:14 - 15 ) maintains that four angels " which are bound in the great river Euphrates " will be released " to slay the third part of men " .
They batter down the doors of the White House as soon as its support for Israel wavers : when Bush asked Ariel Sharon to pull his tanks out of Jenin in 2002 , he received 100,000 angry emails from Christian fundamentalists , and never mentioned the matter again .
The electoral calculation , crazy as it appears , works like this .
Governments stand or fall on domestic issues .
For 85 % of the US electorate , the Middle East is a foreign issue , and therefore of secondary interest when they enter the polling booth .
For 15 % of the electorate , the Middle East is not just a domestic matter , it 's a personal one : if the president fails to start a conflagration there , his core voters do n't get to sit at the right hand of God .
Bush , in other words , stands to lose fewer votes by encouraging Israeli aggression than he stands to lose by restraining it .
He would be mad to listen to these people .
He would also be mad not to .

President Barack Obama 's speech on Tuesday night deserves to be cheered .
Over the objections of his vice president and despite opposition from his political base , the president is sending an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan to fight terrorists .
But praise for Mr. Obama 's decision needs to be qualified .
Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan , had said he could use as many as 40,000 troops , a figure he arrived at after carefully evaluating what would be needed to accomplish the mission Mr. Obama ...
This will be a strange post .
I just finished the Harry Potter series , and I ’m a bit overwhelmed .
I ’m quite sure it ’s the best series I ’ve ever read in many ways .
Not in all ways , but in many .
Perhaps in most that matter .
Anyway , I ’ll come back to that later ; that ’s not the important part .
While reading it slowly over the last few months I ’ve come to realize something interesting , and possibly profound : a certain type of non-typical worldview can blend fantasy with reality .
Hold on …this post is n’t that weird …
I ’m not saying that fantasy can enter reality , or become reality , but rather that if you have a particular type of secular , materialist–yet empathic–perspective on life , fantasy actually be considered another type of reality .
In short , if our * real * experiences are merely chemical imprints in our minds that we can recall with varying ( and diminishing ) degrees of accuracy , then what distinguishes those experiences from those we get from sources other than our direct interactions ?
As an example , I had many friends throughout my childhood that were only casual friends –acquaintances really –and perhaps we had some good times skateboarding or whatever .
But when I think back to these people I can barely remember them .
All the times we went skating across town , or to 7 - 11 to get a Big Gulp , or whatever … they ’re all mixed up and faded .
In fact , I ’m probably mixing together several acquaintances when I think of those memories , and furthermore mixing the various times we went on our various adventures ?
How real is that ?
How real is something when you ca n’t remember the distinct times you went to do something , and who exactly was with you , and what all they said , etc . ?
Not very .
Now , compare that to a memory of good books you ’ve read .
Maybe they ’ve been Tom Clancy - type books with elaborate spy plots .
Or , maybe they ’re fantasy books like Harry Potter .
Explain to me , or to yourself , what the difference is between memories of a friend you have n’t interacted with in a long time and was n’t really that close , and the memories of a character that you ’ve followed for around 4,000 pages recently .
The answer is startling to me .
The answer is nothing .
I can feel these HP characters , just as I have felt other characters in other books that were vivid enough to become tangible in my mind .
Just like people I can scarcely remember from my past .
In fact , I think if an alien were to probe my brain and peruse my memories they may become very confused .
Who was this young kid who went to battle school and fought insect people ?
A friend of his ?
Who are these people who can violate physical laws by studying at Hogwarts ?
How did he see these people ?
I wonder if they would n’t be challenged to find the line between what I ’d experienced through imagination and story , vs. what I ’d “ actually ” experienced .
And that ’s the key I think .
Experience is experience .
To some degree , depending on resolution , if you can experience the event in any sense , then it happened to you .
You can live at Hogwartz , you can fight at battle school , you can be a super hero .
I think the difference between reality and fantasy is simply a matter of stimuli resolution .
In other words , reading about how good a steak tastes has much less fidelity than does tasting it yourself , but that ’s merely a limitation of the imagination and / or external input .
I ’ve no doubt that the future offers a complete merging between fantasy and reality , as the barrier between them is more fragile than we realize .
But I digress .
The real point of this post is to say that if you do have this world view , and you do accept that friends you read about in books are much more like “ real ” friends than realized , then the world opens itself to you .
What this means is that you can actually experience more of life by reading .
It means that you can look back upon the things you ’ve experienced while reading as things you ’ve done , not just things you ’ve looked in on in an artificial way .
This perspective magnifies with great force the gift of sharing reading with others ( assuming they have a similar worldview ) .
It means by showing them other worlds and other perspectives , you ’re actually enhancing their lives .
It puts reading in a new role , where , rather than being a mechanism for escaping reality , it becomes a method of augmenting reality . ::

Update : Brad Rice has informed me that japanator.com reports that she is official :
“ Akiba PC reports that the premium set of Windows 7 Ultimate Edition will come with a special wallpaper and sound set for a character called Nanami Madobe , voiced by Nana Mizuki , who also played such characters as Naruto ’s Hinata and Nanoha ’s Fate .
The new OS - tan ’s name , Nanami Madobe , is wordplay on Mizuki ’s name and the Japanese word for “ window ” . ”
Starting next year , the Harris County District Attorney 's Office no longer will file state jail felony charges against suspects found with only a trace — less than a hundreth of a gram — of illegal drugs , District Attorney Pat Lykos said Tuesday .
Instead , people found with crack pipes with nothing more than residue inside or other drug paraphernalia , would face a ticket for a class C misdemeanor , which carries a maximum fine of $ 500 .
Not surprisingly , the pending change was hailed by defense lawyers , but criticized by police officers .
“ It ties the hands of the officers who are making crack pipe cases against burglars and thieves , ” said Gary Blankinship , president of the Houston Police Officers ' Union .
“ A crack pipe is not used for anything but smoking crack by a crack head .
Crack heads , by and large , are also thieves and burglars .
They 're out there committing crimes . ”
A Houston Police Department spokesman said Chief Harold Hurtt declined to comment on the change , citing ongoing discussions between Hurtt and the district attorney 's office .
But Blankinship said the district attorney 's office is trying to restrict the volume of cases rather than deal with them .
“ When they get to a certain caseload , we 're supposed to stop ? ” he asked .
“ Stop arresting people who are violating the law ?
How much sense does that make ? ”
Lykos said there were several reasons to change the policy , including the inability of defense experts to re-test drug residue that is destroyed when it is analyzed .
To be tested twice , there has to be more than a hundredth of a gram , she said .
A packet of sugar generally weighs a gram .
Half a grain of rice weighs about one - hundredth of gram .
Lykos said the move “ gives us more of an ability to focus on the violent offenses and the complex offenses .
When you have finite resources , you have to make decisions , and this decision is a plus all around . ”
She said she did not have figures for how many cases may be affected , because cases are filed as possession of less than a gram .
Of more than 46,000 felony cases filed last year , almost 30 percent , 13,713 , were for possession of less than a gram of drugs .
She said that while having a crack pipe will be only a ticketable offense , police still will be able to search suspects and cars if they find one .
She noted that other counties , including Travis and Bexar , have similar policies .
In Fort Worth , she said , the minimum is twice as large — .02 of a gram .
Lykos said the policy may help reduce jail overcrowding , an an idea “ cautiously ” embraced by Sheriff Adrian Garcia .
“ The sheriff is cautiously in support of the policy , ” said Alan Bernstein , director of public affairs for the Harris County Sheriff 's Office .
He said as many as 750 of the 11,000 people in jail could be affected , but it was impossible to know Tuesday whether each inmate was facing other charges or other possible charges that were not filed in lieu of the state jail felony that was filed .
“ So , if they 're in here on other charges , they would be here anyway , ” Bernstein said .
Lykos said it would affect cases that include cocaine , crack , heroin , methamphetamine and other drugs .
The change was praised by defense attorneys .
“ It 's a smart move and it's an efficient move and it lets us get down to the business of handling criminal cases of a more serious magnitude , ” said Nicole Deborde , president - elect of the Harris County Criminal Lawyers Association .

Soyons fous : à Copenhague , adoptons la “ société à 2ooo watts “ .
Divisons la consommation d’énergie de l’Europe par 3 , persuadons Obama de réduire celle des USA d’un facteur 6 et la Chine de stopper la croissance de la sienne pour que le monde entier se retrouve à la moyenne actuelle de sa consommation d’énergie , mais propre .
Un petit calcul sur la Suisse pour commencer :
7.5 millions d’habitants à 2000 W , ça donne une puissance de 15 Gigawatt à produire en continu .
15 GW x 8766 heures donnent 141.5 Terawattheure ( TWh ) d’énergie à produire annuellement .
Nos barrages produisent 42.3 TWh
Les plans les plus optimistes pour le solaire + éolien prévoient 10 TWh en 2050 .
Dans le meilleur des cas , les énergies renouvelables couvriront donc 30 % de nos besoins réduits d’un facteur 3 …
Heureusement , la société à 2000W nous permet tout de même 25 % d’énergies fossiles , soit 36 TWh au maximum .
Les centrales nucléaires existantes fourniront 25.3
TWh jusqu’à ce qu’elles rouillent .
Restent 28
TWh à produire .
Comment ???
Passons au calcul mondial :
7 milliards d’habitants ( en 2012 ) x 2000 watts x 8766 heures = 116 ’580 Terawattheures
25 % de pétrole , gaz , charbon : 29 ’145 TWh soit 2.5 milliards de tonnes équivalent pétrole , le quart de la consommation actuelle de charbon + pétrole+gaz , soit celle des années 1950 :
14’000 TWh de biomasse ( =bois ) , biocarburants et biogaz
la production actuelle d’électricité est de 19’000 TWh , dont : 3000 TWh hydrauliques 242 TWh éoliens 509 TWh de géothermie 5 TWh photovoltaïque …
Allez , ajoutons les 45.3
TWh de solaire thermique pour les encourager … marémotrice et hydroliennes : autant que le photovoltaïque : 5 TWh et 2587
TWh nuclaires le reste , soit 12’607
TWh est actuellement produit par des centrales thermiques au charbon , gaz et pétrole .
Normalement on devrait inclure ceci dans les 25 % de pétrole , mais admettons qu’on équipe toutes ces centrales de systèmes de capture et de stockage du CO2 , ok ?
Admettons qu’on arrive encore à doubler la production hydroélectrique et multiplier par 10 la production des autres renouvelables pour atteindre 14 ’ 513 TWh .
Vous pouvez multiplier par 100 le photovoltaïque si vous voulez , ça ne change rien .
Arrondissons la production future d’électricité totale à 30’000 TWh
Total de la production : 73 ’145 TWh , soit seulement 60 % de la consommation d’une humanité à 2000 watts .
Comment produira - t - on les 43’600 TWh manquants ???
Je rappelle que ce scénario est basé sur des propositions environnementalistes actuelles qui impliquent une réduction d’un facteur 3 de la consommation d’énergie de l’Européen moyen … .
Une utopie , passe encore , mais si le total ne joue pas , je m’inquiète …
* Note : Le titre de l’article “ shut up and calculate ” est la devise attribuée à “ l’école de Copenhague “ , active en mécanique quantique .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Whatever happened to all those new nuclear power plants the country was supposed to build ?
Last year , with energy prices soaring and global warming making headlines , talk of a so - called " nuclear renaissance " was rampant .
Energy experts , utility heads , even presidential candidates called for the construction of dozens of new plants .
Billions were going to be spent .
Investing magazines ran stories on how to get in on the action .
Then the credit crisis struck , energy prices collapsed , and the Democrats won the White House .
Nuclear renaissance seemed all but dead .
But it 's not dead , it 's just on life support .
As the greenhouse gas bill moves through Congress , billions more in taxpayer money could soon be deployed to resuscitate the movement .
Supporters say that 's essential to jumpstart a clean , dependable source of power .
Critics say it will keep the country reliant on a dangerous and expensive technology .
The first plant in 30 years
A hundred miles southwest of Houston , amid the refineries and petrochemical plants that dot Texas ' Gulf Coast , construction on one of the first nuclear plants to be built in this country in the last 30 years could begin soon .
Leading the charge to make that happen is David Crane , the affable chief executive of New Jersey - based power producer NRG Energy ( NRG , Fortune 500 ) .
Standing on the wind - whipped edge of a massive man-made reservoir , Crane lays out the case for more nuclear power .
" What 's important is what you do n't see here , " he said , pointing to the two existing nuclear reactors just behind the reservoir , which is used to cool the plants .
" There 's no smokestack .
This is the green solution the country 's energy needs . "
Crane wants to build two more reactors at this site , doubling its electricity output to 5,400 megawatts -- or enough to power 4 million homes .
But to do that he needs government help .
While nuclear plants are cheap to run once they 're built , the construction costs are huge .
Crane 's two new plants are expected to cost at least $ 10 billion .
And with a history of cost overruns and today 's loan - wary bankers , he knows Wall Street is n't likely to give him the money .
So he 's hoping for a loan guarantee from the federal government , trying to get his hands on part of $ 18 billion in guarantees for nuclear power that lawmakers passed as part of the 2005 energy bill .
Like a lot of people pushing nuclear power , he makes his case largely on the fact that nuke plants do n't emit any carbon dioxide , the main gas behind global warming .
That 's important if the nation wants to cut greenhouse gases while simultaneously dealing with an expected 26 % rise in U.S. electricity demand over the next couple of decades .
" You ca n't hit climate change targets without nuclear , " said Dan Krueger , managing director of global power generation at Accenture , a consultancy .
" And it 's going to require government support . "
That argument is likely to win the industry even more federal dollars as Congress struggles to pass global warming legislation .
Some in Congress like nuclear power because it can be produced domestically and , unlike wind or solar , generates huge amounts of energy day or night .
And environmentally minded lawmakers are likely to hold their noses and approve the nuclear subsidies in an effort to win votes for a broader bill capping greenhouse gases .
The case against nuclear power
But some in the environmental community think a nuclear revival is a bad idea , and point out several risks :
Security : Greenpeace points to a 1980s - era report from the government 's own Argonne National Labs , removed from government Web sites after Sept. 11 , saying a direct hit by an airliner on a nuclear power plant could lead to a meltdown .
The environmental group also likes to highlight holes in security with a 2005 incident where an illegal immigrant was accidentally rolled onto the grounds of a California nuclear plant in a boxcar .
" They 're supposed to be able to stop a band of armed terrorists , " said Jim Riccio , nuclear policy analyst at Greenpeace .
" They could n't even detect a sleeping hobo . "
A spokesman for the government 's Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the Argonne study was old and flawed , and that new studies with better computer models show the plants are safe .
He also noted that the sleeping hobo never came close to any sensitive areas inside the California nuclear plant .
Waste :
The nuclear industry says the amount waste is small enough to be safely stored at the plants until recycling is perfected or a permanent solution is reached , a position backed up by Energy Secretary Steven Chu .
But critics say additional plants should n't be built until a permanent storage place is found .
One solution was to create a waste disposal area in Nevada 's Yucca Mountain , but the Obama administration has indicated that will no longer happen .
Another possibility is to recycle the waste , as the French currently do .
The plutonium and uranium can be separated out of the waste and reused .
But even recycling the fuel leaves a small amount of high - level waste to dispose of .
Nuclear proliferation : Many are also concerned that more nuclear power will lead to more nuclear weapons .
India built its first bomb using reprocessed waste from civilian nuclear reactors .
Iran claims its nuclear program is intended to generate electricity , although many suspect it 's merely cover for a bomb .
Critics fear more nuclear plants in the U.S. could encourage more plants abroad , leaving the door open to weapons proliferation .
Cost :
For many the key issue is cost .
The Natural Resources Defense Council , a mainstream environmental group , has little problem with the safety and waste issues around nuclear power .
But NRDC does n't want the nuclear industry receiving subsidies that will keep the country dependent on this expensive technology , especially if it comes out of funds that could go toward upstart technologies like wind or solar .
" Nuclear had its day .
This is a 50 - year - old technology , we should n't be in the business of subsidizing it , " said Thomas Cochran , a senior scientist in the nuclear program at NRDC .
NRG 's
Crane agrees the government should n't be in the subsidy business for long , but said money for maybe the first 10 or 15 new plants is needed as the new plants are bound to be more expensive until economies of scale are reached .
With the all horse trading over global warming currently going on in Congress , if legislation is passed it 's a good bet Crane will get his additional guarantees .
But with the staggering price tag for nuclear power plants , a full blown renaissance is far from certain .
Top NATO commander General Stanley McChrystal calls training local soldiers and cops " our main effort " in Afghanistan .
But whipping recruits into shape is a whole lot harder when they 're stoned out of their minds .
" You walk into a whole squad of ANA [ Afghan National Army ] smoking hashish .
They do n't understand that the use of drugs , it effects the way that they accomplish their mission , " says one disgusted marine .
" Soldiers come out without helmets , soldiers come out missing a lot of gear . "
Obviously , there are plenty of units that are more professional .
But this is n't the first time red-eyed Afghan troops have been caught on tape .
Commerce Secretary Gary Locke ( above ) was advised on patent issues by Kappos .
Critics raise concerns at Commerce
Two former high - level managers at IBM and Microsoft are playing key roles in the Obama administration ’s patent reform efforts , leading critics to question whether their involvement constitutes a breach of the administration ’s ethics policy .
Opponents of the Obama administration ’s position on patent reform say that David Kappos and Marc Berejka , who recently took top jobs in the Commerce Department , are wielding too much influence over a policy that stands to benefit both of their former companies .

As recently as March , Kappos , who was vice president and assistant general counsel for intellectual property at IBM , appeared before a Senate panel to express the company ’s support for patent reform legislation making its way through Congress .
And for more than a decade , Berejka worked in senior government affairs roles at Microsoft , including eight years as a lobbyist for the high - tech giant .
Now they are once again influencing the debate but from within the Commerce Department , where Kappos has been in charge of the patent and trademark office since August and Berejka serves as a top policy adviser .
As one of the Obama administration ’s chief negotiators on the bill and the main adviser to Commerce Secretary Gary Locke on patent issues , Kappos is a central figure in formulating the administration ’s policy .
Berejka has helped coordinate the department ’s efforts to reach out to stakeholders involved in the debate and has been involved with the department ’s patent reform messaging efforts .
Both officials were among the high - level aides who had a hand in drafting an Oct.
5 letter signed by Locke that announced the administration ’s provisional support for the Senate ’s patent reform bill — the same piece of legislation that Kappos promoted seven months earlier as an employee of IBM .
The letter , addressed to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , who sponsored the patent bill , and the committee ’s ranking member , Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R - Ala . ) , was greeted with public statements of support from both Microsoft and IBM .
At Kappos ’s July confirmation hearing for the Commerce post , Sen. Arlen Specter ( D - Pa. ) grilled him on his ties to IBM .
He pledged to steer clear of any issues that involved the company .
“ To me , it ’s extraordinarily important that I have absolutely nothing to do with any particular decision that involves my former employer if I am confirmed for this job , ” Kappos said at the time .
He added : “ Like other people who are in private industry and move to the government , I will put my previous role behind me and focus entirely on doing the right thing for the United States of America . ”
Berejka ’s job at the Commerce Department did not require Senate confirmation .
The involvement of Kappos and Berejka in the patent reform process provides an example of how former lobbyists and appointees with corporate ties can exert power even in an administration that swept into Washington with promises of curbing their influence .
On his first full day in office , President Barack Obama issued an executive order banning appointees of his administration from working on any matter “ involving specific parties that is directly and substantially related ” to their former employers for a period of two years .
Former lobbyists entering government are subject to even stricter ethics rules .
Still , a number of appointees who did not meet the guidelines managed to find their way into the executive branch ; some were issued waivers allowing them to serve in key roles .
Yet neither Kappos , who was not a registered lobbyist , nor Berejka , who records show was last registered to lobby in 2007 , sought or received waivers .
According to the Commerce Department , that was because no issues have come up that would have required a waiver .
Locke , who previously acted as a lawyer for Microsoft himself , also did not seek or receive a waiver .
“ Everybody ’s experience comes from somewhere , and good people serve the nation in government from all walks of life .
President Obama set an unprecedented standard for ethical conduct , and Secretary Locke has emphasized that standard for everyone at the Commerce Department , ” said Nick Kimball , a Commerce spokesman .
“ The administration is assisting Congress as it seeks to pass patent reform legislation that will encourage innovation and help the economic recovery for all Americans . ”
But critics — including government watchdog groups , a variety of stakeholders in the intellectual property community and some lawmakers — disagree .
They contend that the two officials have brought their corporate perspective to Commerce , providing an advantage to their former employers .
Melanie Sloan , executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , an organization that monitors ethics in government , said that , at the very least , Kappos should have recused himself from the patent reform matter .
“ I do n’t understand why someone who testified on this issue for IBM is working on the exact issue in Commerce , ” Sloan said .
“ It ’s completely in violation of the rules . ”
She added : “ Even if you get past your technical ethics problem , you ca n’t get past your appearance problem .
Appearance counts . ”
While Kappos has recused himself from matters that directly affect IBM , the Commerce Department asserted that his past affiliation should not prevent him from working on patent reform issues .
The department said that Berejka has recused himself from matters directly involving Microsoft .
Both companies , however , have been among the most vocal advocates for patent reform for years , and both are among the country ’s most prolific patent filers .
Records show that , in recent years , Microsoft and IBM have spent millions lobbying Congress , the Commerce Department and other agencies on patent reform issues .
The Commerce Department declined to make Kappos or Berejka available for an interview .
Opponents of the administration ’s policy include some smaller technology and manufacturing firms , universities and individual inventors .
They tend to dislike proposals , as outlined in Locke ’s letter , aimed at changing from a “ first to invent ” to a “ first to file ” system , allowing patents to be awarded to whichever company or inventor submits paperwork faster .
They also oppose an idea , backed by the administration , known as “ post - grant review , ” which would create more opportunities to challenge patents after they are approved .
In general , technology behemoths like IBM and Microsoft are better positioned to take advantage of such changes than smaller firms .
Steve Perlman , a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and inventor and former executive at Microsoft , who is best known for co-founding WebTV , said big technology companies have much to gain from both proposals .
He argued that the process within Commerce has been tainted by Kappos and Berejka , who was a colleague of his at Microsoft .
“ I worked to elect Obama to curtail the kinds of things that Marc Berejka is doing , ” Perlman said .
“ It is astounding to me that he is now in the administration . ”
Perlman said the Commerce Department was “ pushing all sorts of things which are very specific to IBM ’s agenda and to Microsoft ’s agenda , ” like the first - to - file system and post - grant review , “ both of which strongly favor large companies . ”
The interest that IBM and Microsoft have in the patent reform debate is clear : Last year , IBM received more than 4,000 patents — more than any other company — and Microsoft topped 2,000 patent awards .
Last month , Horacio Gutierrez , vice president and deputy general counsel at Microsoft , issued a statement commending Locke for “ supporting balanced patent reform legislation that benefits all segments of American industry . ”
Soon after , IBM followed suit with its own statement urging “ swift passage ” of the bill .
On Oct. 15 , a dozen Republican lawmakers wrote a letter to Senate leaders that was critical of the administration - backed patent bill , saying that it “ threatens to diminish the value and enforceability of U.S. patent rights at a time when America ’s economic recovery is dependent on the strength of U.S. innovations . ”
But opponents are generally reluctant to call attention to Kappos ’s and Berejka ’s past corporate ties , according to one lobbyist who is involved with negotiations over the bill .
“ There is an unwritten code , particularly among large companies , that one company does n’t criticize the other in terms of public policy if they can avoid it , ” the lobbyist said .
Rep. Marcy Kaptur ( D - Ohio ) , an outspoken opponent of the patent reform bill , told POLITICO it did not appear that Kappos and Berejka had sufficiently distanced themselves from their corporate roots to be objective on patent reform issues .
“ I think the president ’s got a problem with his personnel office .
Somebody is not protecting his flank , ” Kaptur said .
“ By moving these people inside , to me , you jaundice the whole process . "
Communications Minister Senator Stephen Conroy 's announcement last week that the Government would legislate a mandatory service provider - level internet filter has galvanised opposition .
The opponents are a loose coalition of many individuals and a range organisations with vaguely common interests , including IT industry and anti-censorship groups , progressive lobby GetUp ! , the Pirate Party and the Australian Sex Party .
These groups have been - and continue to be - ineffective because , unlike those who favour the filter , they do n't understand what it takes to achieve political change .
Since the Rudd Government came into power with an internet filtering policy , opponents have tried to sway the Government and the public against the filter using the two standard tech - geek argument techniques : logic and sarcasm .
Network engineer Mark Newton has consistently and thoroughly stripped the Government 's arguments down to their logical flaws , for example in this recent article on New Matilda .
Jonathan Crossfield 's ' open letter to Senator Stephen Conroy from a concerned parent ' is a devastating deployment of finely crafted sarcasm .
However , politicians are completely unaffected by sarcasm , having developed immunity through countless hours of exposure during Question Time .
And some would argue they have a similar resistance to logic , or at least that they view rhetorical argument as a pliable tool to be used on either side of any proposition , regardless of truth or merit .
These arguments have also failed to convince the public because the anti-filter groups have allowed their opponents to set the terms and language of the debate .
Senator Conroy has consistently framed the filter in terms of protecting children from online nasties such as child pornography .
The mainstream media has almost without exception taken this line uncritically when reporting on the filter .
Politicians do n't get logic or sarcasm ; they only understand two very different things : money and votes .
Not just any votes , either .
Even if GetUp ! achieved its goal of 120,000 petition signatures or hundreds of thousands rallied in the streets , the Government might still not be convinced .
To shift position , a politician needs to see significant blocs of people in specific , relevant electorates who would otherwise have voted for his or her party but now intend to vote for the other guys .
This is where the anti-filter movement is failing .
According to Crikey 's Pollytics blog , introducing the internet filter would have almost no electoral consequences for the Government , save the possibility of losing inner-city Sydney and Melbourne seats to the Greens .
But not introducing the filter would upset one of the best organised and most influential political groups in the country .
Liberal MP
Alex Hawke , a campaigner for Christian values who opposes the filter , believes the legislation is the result of a backroom deal between Senator Conroy and the Australian Christian Lobby ( ACL ) .
The ACL is a seriously hefty lobby group , and the Government owes it favours .
According to its website , the ACL counts among its victories " [ turning ] the tide on issues such as euthanasia " and " [ alerting ] parliamentarians on industry plans to introduce R- rated hand held computer games " .
The ACL has also " positively influenced the debate on homosexual adoption in the ACT and Tasmania " and lobbied local councils on issues such as " the placement of brothels [ and ] offensive advertising " .
Within Parliament , the ACL tells us there are " large numbers of Christian politicians at all levels of Government who value your prayers and support " .
You could count on one hand the number of politicians whose knowledge of technology extends further than using a BlackBerry to Tweet during Question Time .
As a result , it is not enough to demonstrate that a large number of people , even the majority of people , think the filter is a bad idea .
Defeating the filter means convincing Labor that it will have electoral consequences worse than pissing off the Christian lobby .
Filter opponents appear to believe Twitter , online petitions , protests and letter - writing campaigns will be enough .
However , 10,000 people blacking out their avatars , retweeting blog posts and furiously agreeing with each other on Twitter merely adds to the cacophony of the echo chamber ; it has no effect in the real world .
The closed circle of the Australian Twitterati and their friends in the technology and political media might well believe everyone is against the internet filter since everyone they know is talking about it .
But in the mainstream media , the filter was a lower - order news item on the day it was announced and has since almost disappeared .
This level of self - obsession reached the point where filter opponents spent a day debating whether #nocleanfeed or #openinternet was a more useful hashtag , as if nomenclature were the only thing holding the movement back .
Meanwhile Senator Conroy , the ACL's Jim Wallace and almost every mainstream media outlet were implying they were child pornographers .
I strongly believe the anti-filter lobby can succeed , but it must change tactics .
Unless it stops preaching to the choir and starts getting into the serious business of lobbying , it is doomed to failure .

‘ Tis the season to judge your neighbors for their impiety , and this year the Pew Research Center is helping with this time - honored tradition .
The polling organization recently released rankings on the religiosity of the states , based on 2007 survey responses to four questions : the importance of religion in people ’s lives , frequency of attendance at worship services , frequency of prayer and absolute certainty of belief in God .
Based on those responses , Mississippi has the most religious population .
The states whose populations report the least religious behavior are New Hampshire , Vermont , Alaska and Maine .
Mississippi was the top - ranked state in all four polling categories , and several other Southern states also ranked very high on the measures .
For example , 91 percent of Mississippians said they believed in God with absolute certainty .
By contrast , 54 percent of residents of Vermont and New Hampshire ( whose populations were combined because of the small sample size ) said the same .
And in Mississippi , 77 percent of respondents said they prayed at least once a day , compared with 40 percent in Maine .
For more information on the religious traditions in your own state , go to the Pew site .
In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ’s refusal Monday to review a lower court ’s dismissal of a case brought by four British former Guantanamo prisoners against former defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld , the detainees ’ lawyers charged Tuesday that the country ’s highest court evidently believes that " torture and religious humiliation are permissible tools for a government to use . "
The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington , D.C. , had ruled that government officials were immune from suit because at that time it was unclear whether abusing prisoners at Guantanamo was illegal .
Channeling their predecessors in the George W. Bush administration , Obama Justice Department lawyers argued in this case that there is no constitutional right not to be tortured or otherwise abused in a U.S. prison abroad .
The Obama administration had asked the court not to hear the case .
By agreeing , the court let stand an earlier opinion by the D.C. Circuit Court , which found that the Religious Freedom Restoration
Act  a statute that applies by its terms to all " persons "  did not apply to detainees at Guantanamo , effectively ruling that the detainees are not persons at all for purposes of U.S. law .
The lower court also dismissed the detainees ’ claims under the Alien Tort Statute and the Geneva Conventions , finding defendants immune on the basis that " torture is a foreseeable consequence of the military ’s detention of suspected enemy combatants . "
Finally , the circuit court found that , even if torture and religious abuse were illegal , defendants were immune under the Constitution because they could not have reasonably known that detainees at Guantanamo had any constitutional rights .
The circuit court ruled that " torture is a foreseeable consequence of the military ’s detention of suspected enemy combatants . "
That opinion was written by Judge Karen Lecraft Henderson , who was appointed to the federal circuit court by Ronald Reagan in 1986 and to the Appeals Court in 1990 by George H.W. Bush .
The British detainees spent more than two years in Guantanamo and were repatriated to Britain in 2004 with no charges ever having been filed against them .
Eric Lewis , lead attorney for the detainees , said , " It is an awful day for the rule of law and common decency when the Supreme Court lets stand such an inhuman decision .
The final word on whether these men had a right not to be tortured or a right to practice their religion free from abuse is that they did not . "
" The lower court found that torture is all in a days ’ work for the secretary of defense and senior generals , " he added .
" That violates the president ’s stated policy , our treaty obligations , and universal legal norms .
Yet the Obama administration , in its rush to protect executive power , lost its moral compass and persuaded the Supreme Court to avoid a central moral challenge .
Today our standing in the world has suffered a further great loss . "
Center for Constitutional Rights Senior Attorney Shayana Kadidal , co-counsel on the case , told IPS , " In many ways the opinion the Supreme Court left standing today is worse when one gets past the bottom line  no accountability for torture and religious abuse  and digs into the legal reasoning . "
" One set of claims are dismissed because torture is said to be a foreseeable consequence of military detention , " he said .
" How will the parents of our troops captured in future foreign wars react to that ? "
" Another set of claims are dismissed because Guantanamo detainees are not ‘ persons ’ within the scope of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act  an argument that was too close to Dred Scott v. Sanford for one of the judges on the court of appeals to swallow , " he added .
The Dred Scott case was a decision by the United States Supreme Court in 1857 .
It ruled that people of African descent imported into the United States and held as slaves , or their descendants  whether or not they were slaves  were not protected by the Constitution and could never be citizens of the United States .
" The way the case was defended is in some ways emblematic of the Obama administration ’s waffling on national security issues , " Kadidal noted .
" On the one hand they recognize that torture is reprehensible , does n’t work , and is universally condemned ; on the other they do n’t want to prosecute people who ordered , facilitated , or carried it out , and are actively seeking to eliminate other mechanisms for accountability like this case  anything that might lead to a court saying crimes were committed and innocent people were brutally abused . "
The four former detainees  Shafiq Rasul , Asif Iqbal , Rhuhel Ahmed , and Jamal Al - Harith  filed their case in 2004 seeking damages from former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld and senior U.S. military officers for violations of their constitutional rights and of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act , which prohibits infringement of religion by the U.S. government against any person .
Their claims were dismissed in 2008 by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit when that court held that detainees have no rights under the Constitution and do not count as " persons " for purposes of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act .
Last year , the Supreme Court granted the men ’s first petition , vacated the Court of Appeals decision and ordered the D.C. Circuit to reconsider its ruling in light of the Supreme Court ’s historic decision in Boumediene v. Bush , which held that Guantánamo is de facto U.S. territory and that detainees have a constitutional right to habeas corpus .
On remand , the D.C. Circuit reiterated its view that the Constitution does not prohibit torture of detainees at Guantánamo and that detainees still are not " persons " protected from religious abuse .
Finally , the Court of Appeals held that , in any event , the government officials involved are immune from liability because the right not to be tortured was not clearly established .
A second petition filed with the Court in August 2009 pointed out that the Court of Appeals decision stands in conflict with all of the Supreme Court ’s recent precedent on Guantánamo and attacked the notion that the prohibitions against torture and religious abuse were not clearly established in 2002 when the petitioners were imprisoned .

( Newser ) – Fox News seems to be watching Jon Stewart .
After the drubbing Stewart gave Glenn Beck last week for pumping gold on his show , even as he was listed as a " paid spokesman " for Goldline , a company that sells gold coins , the network fired off a letter to Beck ’s reps , “ seeking clarification . ”
It also released a statement saying that its official policy “ prohibits on - air talent from endorsing products . ”
story continues below
Goldline quickly changed the language on its website .
Until a few days ago , Beck ’s picture was accompanied by a footnote reading , “ paid spokesman ” ; the footnote now reads “ radio sponsor . ”
The company says the language Stewart picked up on was a mistake .
It says it ’s merely a sponsor of Beck ’s radio and TV shows , but does n’t pay him any separate fees .
“ We used the term ‘ paid spokesman ’ because we felt it was important to tell people that there is a payment going to somebody , ” said Goldline ’s president .

OAKLAND -- Oakland police and a cadaver dog with the Alameda County sheriff 's office today are searching the home of a software developer whose estranged wife has n't been seen for 10 days , police said .
Law - enforcement officials received a warrant to search the home of Hans Reiser , 43 , on the 6900 block of Exeter Drive in the city 's Montclair District , police said .
Reiser 's wife , Nina " Nenasha " Reiser , 31 , was last seen at about 2 p.m. Sept. 3 at his home , where she dropped off their 6 - year - old son and 5 - year - old daughter .
A police bulletin issued Monday said the woman is " at risk " and could be a victim of foul play .
The children have been placed with Child Protective Services .
Hans Reiser has not been termed a suspect in her disappearance , and police have yet to speak to him , authorities said .
Hans Reiser was n't at home today , but his mother , Beverly Palmer , was present during the search and was being cooperative , said Oakland police Lt. Kevin Wiley .
" We have not spoken to him yet , " Wiley said of Reiser .
A cadaver dog searched a crawl space underneath the home , located on a winding street off Shepherd Canyon Road in a steep wooded canyon .
Also on scene was an agent with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
The Reisers frequently traveled to Russia .
Meanwhile , concerned friends , neighbors and teachers from the Reiser children 's former school , Grand Lake Montessori , have been posting flyers in the Lake Merritt area and other parts of the Montclair district .
On the day she disappeared , Nina Reiser was planning to go shopping at Berkeley Bowl before going to a friend 's house , said Anthony Zografos , her boyfriend .
She never showed up at the house .
Police said they found Reiser 's tan 2001 Honda Odyssey at an unspecified location , but no trace of her .
There were groceries inside the car , authorities said .
The couple married in 1999 and separated in 2004 .
Nina Reiser filed for divorce in 2004 , citing irreconcilable differences , according to Alameda County Superior Court records .
She was granted custody of the children .
The couple 's divorce was never finalized .
She said he was out of the country on business for his firm , Namesys , for nine months out of each year , records said .
Nina Reiser accused her husband of subjecting their son , then 4 , to violent video games and movies .
" This is an activity that Hans does almost obsessively to relax , " Nina Reiser wrote in her divorce filing .
" Hans believes a child should ' know the real world ' and sees nothing wrong with this behavior .
He does n't seem to grasp that children are not little adults . "
Hans Reiser , in turn , denied that movies were to blame and accused his wife of having an extramarital affair and of being mentally unstable and physically abusive to him , court records show .
Hans Reiser 's court filings touched on Sir Francis Bacon , Aristotle , Ralph Waldo Emerson and the scientific method .
He said his son played " more hours of educational games " than those depicting violence and told the court that he was being " scammed " by his wife .
He wrote of Nina Reiser , " She is a product of a KGB - dominated society and is the child of someone who works for the KGB . "
Nina Reiser was granted a temporary restraining order against her husband in December 2004 .
A year later , she agreed not to seek a permanent order .
But earlier this year , Hans Reiser allegedly failed to pay 50 percent medical expenses and child care expenses as ordered by Judge Ronni McLaren , records show .
He pleaded not guilty Aug. 25 on a civil contempt charge and is scheduled for trial in October .
" I would like to think -- and I hope -- that he had nothing to do with this , " Shelley Gordon , Nina 's Reiser 's divorce attorney , said today .
" This has been a very acrimonious divorce , and I 'm very fond of Nina and quite heartsick over her disappearance . "
Nina Reiser , who is trained as an obstetrician / gynecologist in Russia , has lived in the Temescal district in recent years , Zografos said .
Authorities describe Reiser , whose nickname is Nenasha , as 5 - foot - 5 and 114 pounds , with brown eyes , black hair and a fair complexion .
Oakland police homicide investigators have not been called in to assist officers with the missing person 's unit , authorities said .
Police want to look into the possibility that she could have left the country , said Oakland police Capt .
Jeff Loman .
" We do n't have any evidence of foul play , " Loman said Tuesday .
Police ask anyone with information about Reiser or who may have seen her van to call contact investigators at ( 510 ) 777-3333 .
Callers can also leave information on the Police Department 's tip line at ( 510 ) 637-0298 .
