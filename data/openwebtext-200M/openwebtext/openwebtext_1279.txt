Why They Hate Us ( I ) : on military occupation
One of the many barriers to developing a saner U.S. foreign policy is our collective failure to appreciate why military occupations generate so much hatred , resentment , and resistance , and why we should therefore go to enormous lengths to avoid getting mired in them .
Costly occupations are an activity you hope your adversaries undertake , especially in areas of little intrinsic strategic value .
We blundered into Somalia in the early 1990s without realizing that we were n’t welcome ; we invaded Iraq thinking we would be greeted as liberators , and we still do n’t fully understand why many Afghans resent our presence and why some are driven to take up arms against us .
The American experience is hardly unique : Britain ’s occupation of Iraq after World War I triggered fierce opposition , and British forces in Mandate Palestine eventually faced armed resistance from both Arab and Zionist groups .
French rule in Algeria , Syria , Lebanon , and Indochina spawned several violent resistance movements , and Russia has fought Chechen insurgents in the 19th , 20th and 21st centuries .
The Shiite population of southern Lebanon initially welcomed Israel ’s invasion in 1982 , but the IDF behaved badly and stayed too long , which led directly to the formation of Hezbollah .
Israelis were also surprised by the first intifida in 1987 , having mistakenly assumed that their occupation of the West Bank was benevolent and that the Palestinians there would be content to be governed by the IDF forever .
Military occupation generates resistance because it is humiliating , disruptive , arbitrary and sometimes terrifying to its objects , even when the occupying power is acting from more - or - less benevolent motives .
If you ’ve ever been caught in a speed trap by a rude or abusive policeman ( I have ) , or selected out for special attention crossing a border ( ditto ) , you have a mild sense of what this is like .
You are at the mercy of the person in charge , who is inevitably well - armed and can do pretty much whatever he ( or she ) wants .
Any sign of protest will only make things go badly — and in some situations will get you arrested , beaten , or worse — so you choke down your anger and just put up with it .
Now imagine that this is occurring after you ’ve waited for hours at some internal checkpoint , that none of the occupiers speak your language , and that it is like this every single day .
And occasionally the occupying power kills innocent people by mistake , engages in other forms of indiscriminate force , and does so with scant regard for local customs and sensibilities .
Maintain this situation long enough , and some members of the local population will start looking for ways to strike back .
Some of them may even decide to strap on explosive vests or get behind the wheel of a explosives - laden truck , and sacrifice themselves .
It is sometimes said that Americans do n’t understand this phenomenon because the United States has never been conquered and occupied .
But this simply is n’t true .
After the Civil War , a “ foreign army ” occupied the former Confederacy and imposed a new political order that most white southerners found abhorrent .
The first Reconstruction
Act of 1867 put most southern states under formal military control , supervised the writing of new state constitutions , and sought to enfranchise and empower former slaves .
It also attempted to rebuild the south economically , but the reconstruction effort was undermined by corruption and poor administration .
Sound familiar ?
However laudable the aims may have been , the results were precisely what one would expect .
Northern occupation eventually triggered violent resistance by the Ku Klux Klan , White League , Red Shirts , and other insurgent groups , which helped thwart Reconstruction and paved the way for the Jim Crow system that lasted until the second half of the 20th century .
Nor should we forget how long a profound sense of anger and resentment lasted .
I was recently discussing this issue with a distinguished American journalist who grew up in the South , and he told me that one hundred years after the end of the Civil War , he was still being taught songs that expressed a lingering hatred of what the Yankees had done .
Here are a coupl of stanzas from one of them —
“ I ’m a Good Old Rebel ” — written by a former Confederate officer and first published in 1914 :
I hates the Yankee nation , and everything they do ,
I hates the Declaration of Independence too .
I hates the glorious Union , ’tis dripping with our blood
I hates their striped banner , I fought it all I could .
Three hundred thousand Yankees lie stiff in Southern dust ;
We got three hundred thousand , before they conquered us
They died of Southern fever , and Southern steel and shot ,
I wish they was three million , instead of what we got .
Or to take a more recent ( 1974 ) , less poetic example , from Lynyrd Skynyrd :
Well I heard Mr. Young sing about her ,
Well I heard old Neil put her down .
Well , I hope Neil Young will remember ,
A Southern man do n’t need him around anyhow .
This is what defeat in war and prolonged occupation does to a society : it generates hatred and resentment that can last a century or more .
Hatred of the “ party of Lincoln ” kept the South solidly Democratic for decades , and its political character remains distinctly different even today , nearly 150 years after the civil war ended .
( Among other things , Barack Obama has favorable job approval ratings in every region of the country except the South ) .
And do n’t forget that unlike our current presence in Iraq and Afghanistan , the occupying forces of the North spoke the same language and had been part of the same country prior to the war ; in some cases , there were even strong family connections on both sides of the Mason - Dixon line .
Yet defeat in war and military occupation were an enduring source of division for many years thereafter .
The bottom line is that you do n’t need to be a sociologist , political scientist , or a student of colonialism or foreign cultures to understand why military occupation is such a poisonous activity and why it usually fails .
If you ’re an American , you just need to read a bit about Reconstruction and reflect on how its effects — along with the effects of slavery itself — have persisted across generations .
If that ’s not enough , visit a society that is currently experiencing occupation , and take the time to go through a checkpoint or two .
Then you might understand why the local population does n’t view the occupying forces as benevolent and is n’t as grateful as occupiers often think they ought to be .

Dave Leddin of Daves Vintage Guitars in Vancouver was nice enough to answer some of my questions about how pickups work .
I ’ve been using one Dave ’s hand - wound pickups in my Lap - steel and they sound great !
Dave got his training in the Australian military but now he puts his skills to use modifying guitars and winding his own pickups .
Gord
Thank you giving me the opportunity to answer these questions .
Hopefully your readers will gain some good info out of them .
Remember terrible tone is not terminal .
Magnetism .
I thought older pickups were better ( Dearmond , PAFs ) .
So can an old pickup lose magnetism ?
Old pickups sound great for several reasons and magnetism is just one of them .
If a warm sweet vintage tone is what you are after then a weaker magnet is desirable .
As a rule the stronger the magnet , the brighter the tone .
In some cases , modern pickups have insanely strong magnets and the result is an ice - pick like tone .
Magnets do lose their strength over time and they will mellow with age .
A magnet can also lose too much of its strength and then the pickup ’s output will be low and muddy .
Most pre-1970s pickups use Alnico magnets .
Alnico is an alloy of aluminum , nickel , cobalt and steel or iron .
They range from Alnico 2 to Alnico 8 , the former being the weakest and the latter being the strongest .
The percentage of cobalt in the mix is one the most important factors .
Alnico 2 magnets have lower cobalt content while Alnico 5 has almost twice the amount .
For example early ‘ 50s Fender pickups use Alnico 2 or 3 magnets ; in this era cobalt was an important metal to the military .
The type of wire and winding methods of earlier pickups also contribute to their sweet tone .
For example Fender Strat pickups pre-’64 were wound using heavy Formvar wire which is known for it ’s warm and bright tones .
Most pickups in the ‘ 50s were “ Scatterwound ” which means the wire was hand fed onto the bobbin .
Later as technology progressed the wire was then machine fed onto the bobbins ; we will talk about that later .
To sum things up , the sweet tone older pickups have is a result of softer magnets , types of wire and also winding methods .
Depending on the strength of the magnet can a pickup that is too close to the strings affect their vibration pattern and duration ?
Is there a rule of thumb for being too close or too far ?
Good question , I am going to dig deep into this one .
Basically a pickup is comprised of a series of magnets or poles that sit perpendicular to the strings .
The poles are spaced to sit under each string and they are sandwiched in by a top and bottom called the bobbin .
A thin wire is then wrapped around these poles and this is called the windings .
A magnetic field emits from the north and south pole of each magnet and this is called flux .
Imagine flux to be an invisible ball , the size and shape is determined by the magnet strength and width .
When a guitar string is plucked it vibrates in a circular motion , this disturbs the magnetic field and a very small electric current is induced within the coil .
A magnet that is too strong or too close can impede the vibration of the string and can severely dampen the signal .
Each pickup will have its own recommended height and there are some standard rules .
You must depress the top and bottom strings at the last fret to set your pickup height .
For normal vintage Strat / Tele pickups the height should be 6/64th at the base side and 5/64th at the treble .
Humbuckers should be set at 4/64th for both sides .
These are standard recommended heights and each pickup has its own happy spot .
Magnet strength and output are also important factors so it is best to explore .
Phases .
On a Strat type 3 pickup guitar , what difference does reversing the polarity of the middle pickup make when two pickups are combined ?
Reverse wound reverse polarity ( RWRP ) middle pickups have a noise cancelling effect when combined with a traditionally wound pickup .
A traditional Strat pickup is wound around the bobbin in a clockwise direction .
The polarity of the poles will differ between manufacturers .
Pre 1960 Fender pickups are north up and after 1960 they switched to south up .
A RWRP pickup is wound anticlockwise around the bobbin and the magnets will be polarized opposite to the neck and bridge .
The process of noise cancellation is a complicated process to explain so I wo n’t delve into that too far .
All we really need to know is what a RWRP does and how to identify one .
The signal from a guitar string is a collection of sine waves with different amplitudes and different oscillating frequencies .
If we imagine the string signals passing through two pickups with one RWRP the following will happen : two identical signals with opposing phases will cancel each other out , these are the unwanted noise .
Two identical signals with the same phase will strengthen each other , these are good guys .
Hum cancelling pickups do have a drawback in that the signal will be quieter and will also have a drop in volume .
RWRP pickups did n’t really appear until the ‘ 80s and Fender only started using them on their USA Strats in 1986 .
If one of your pickups is too bright , muffled or uneven , what components should you look at , before you do anything to the pickups .
Pots , capacitors , hi / lo cut .
I always advise to change pots and caps before changing pickups .
Basically , a resistor ( the pot ) and a capacitor will filter certain frequencies .
I always describe this to clients as being like the filter for your pool ; if it is the wrong type or made of ‘ shotty ’ parts you will get leaves in your pool i.e. terrible tone .
As a rule , a higher resistance will give a brighter tone .
A single coil , like in a Strat or Tele , already has a bright tone , so 250 k pots are better .
Capacitors work in the opposite way .
The lower the capacitor value , the brighter the tone .
The combination of the pot and capacitor will trim certain frequencies .
As a rule I use a 0.022 uf caps for a bright , modern tone and a 0.047 uf for a more vintage tone .
I always use 0.047uf for my Teles – the bridge is bright enough .
I also use 0.047uf with 500k pots for Humbuckers .
Some Gibson SG etc. use 330 k pots with 0.022 uf capacitors for a brighter tone .
Using a quality capacitor is also a great idea .
It ’s not really the brand , but rather the tolerance which contributes to good quality .
Cheaper capacitors are around 20 % tolerance and better capacitors are around 10 % tolerance .
You do n’t need to run out there and buy the $ 35 snake oil filled , hermetically sealed , titanium cased capacitor .
I always use Sprague Orange Drops as they are cheap and do the job very well .
How do low impedance and active pickups work ?
Both active pickups and low impedance pickups are built for a clear and noise free sound .
Both pickups have a low resistance .
The lower the resistance of the coil , the cleaner the tone will be and it will also have less noise .
Active electronics are similar in construction to passive pickups but they are wound with a lower resistance .
The lower resistance gives the pickup a better frequency response and the result is a very clean , noise free signal .
Active pickups have a low output and require a pre-amp to bring them up to a decent level , but they can be used on their own .
Low impedance pickups have a very low signal and they definitely need a pre-amp to boost the signal before it gets fed into an amplifier .
They also have a very clean noise - free signal due to their great frequency response .
6 ) Can you add magnetism or degauss your pickups ?
The unit for magnetic strength is called gauss and yes you can gauss and degauss your pickups .
This will affect the output and tone of your pickup .
As I explained in question 1 , magnet strength is very important in determining a pickup ’s tone .
If you have a pickup that is weak , you can strengthen the magnets to boost the output and tone .
When I get a pickup that I feel is harsh and shrill , I will degauss it to a respectable level .
I do this to factory wound Tele pickups all the time , especially bridges .
7 ) Why do hand wound pickups sound better than factory wound pickups ?
How does the perfectly consistent wind of a machine wound pickup produce an inferior tone ?
Hand wound pickups sound superior to factory wound pickups for a few reasons .
The most important factor is internal capacitance and resistance within the coil .
As I discussed in question 4 , capacitance and resistance work together to act as a frequency filter .
Within a factory wound pickup the capacitance and resistance are fairly constant throughout the coil .
The value of capacitance is reliant on the lay of the windings and spacing between the wraps .
With a machine wound pickup this is a very uniform pattern from left to right back and forth across the bobbin .
Resistance within the coil is determined by the number of winds and also the cross sectional density of the wire .
A machine will keep a constant tension on the wire so the cross sectional density of the wire will remain constant .
Since we are creating a filter , only a strict band of frequencies from the string will pass through the pickup .
Some of the harmonic frequencies that the string is producing are not coming through the pickup , so you are losing your tone man !!
Myself and many other winders use a method call scatter winding .
This is where the wraps of the coil are random and do n’t follow a strict pattern .
This method creates a varied capacitance within the coil and this is a good thing .
Since I am a man and not a machine I cannot maintain a constant tension on the wire , so I am stretching the wire in some places , therefore I am changing the wires cross sectional density and also the resistance .
Hand wound pickups have a random capacitive and resistive value within the coil – this creates a wider filter .
The result of this relationship is a signal rich in harmonic frequencies or what I call a 3 dimensional tone .
While factory wound pickups are built for quantity , the quality of tone is lost .
Hand wound pickups are based more on quality and the tone is harmonically rich .
When I am winding a pickup I have a specific tone in mind and I have several tricks up my sleeve to achieve it .
The type of wire is important , so is magnet strength and type , the resistance of the coil is also big factor .
When I wind a pickup I aim for a specific coil resistance based on how much bottom end I require at the end .
The amount of high end I need is also determined by the resistance but the magnet type and strength is very important .
In the case of some factory wound pickups the magnets are charged way too strong for the coil and the tone is way too harsh .
With my pickups I have gone back to basics and I charge my magnets at a moderate strength .
For example with my
Tele bridges I am using the original formvar and plain enamel wires that were used in the ‘ 5 os and ‘ 60s .
I am also using wider alnico 3 magnets and the combination produces a pickup that has a tight bottom end with a very nice high end as well .
Pickup winders are always seeking the perfect tone and there is always room for experimentation .
8 ) Does a higher resistance value generally mean more winds or does it have anything to do with the strength of the magnet ?
The resistance of a pickup is determined by the diameter of the wire and the number of turns .
The thinner the wire , the less turns are required to obtain the required resistance .
Wire comes in many gauges called AWG or American Wire Gauge .
The lower the number , then the thicker the wire will be .
The most popular is 42 AWG and 43 AWG .
Most single coils and older PAF style pickups will use 42AWG , high gain pickups and humbuckers tend to have 43AWG wire .
Magnets do not determine resistance .
9 ) How do you test a pickup to see if the magnet is too strong or weak ?
You can test a pickup ’s magnets using a gauss meter – gauss being the unit of measurement for magnetic strength .
Most pickups are around 20 – 40 gauss .
These meters are expensive and not really necessary for most people .
To test the magnets strength touch the poles with a metal object , like a screw driver .
I recommend listening to your guitar plugged in to hear the volume and tone .
If the tone is weak and muffled , and the magnet is weak , it will need to be charged .
If it is sharp and harsh sounding , then adjust the pickup height first before degaussing the pickup .
You can gauss or degauss your pickups using a super strong permanent magnet .
I strongly recommend that you take your pickup to a professional
10 ) For single pickup guitars like the Esquire , what is the best way to get a variety of sounds out of 1 pickup ?
The best way to get the most out of a one pickup guitar is to put the signal through a series of filters such as capacitors and resistors .
The original Esquire of the 50’s did this using a 3 - way switch .
For the first position , the pickup signal was fed through a filter , cutting the highs to simulate a neck pickup with a warmer tone .
For the centre position , the pickup was normal with the tone control active .
The last position of the switch was the pickup fully open with no tone control for a very bright tone .
These early Esquires were very popular for both rhythm and lead .
11 ) Does it matter if the poles are directly under the strings or is there a ¼ ” of leeway ?
The more central a pole piece is , the better it will receive the signal from the string .
The further away it is , the more likely the signal will be distorted .
If you notice on the bridge pickup of most Strats , the poles are usually off a little .
It is not surgical , but definitely a factor
12 ) Why does a Tele pickup sound different on Strat and vice versa ?
Each particular pickup is designed for that particular style of guitar .
Each pickup has a different height , width , output and magnets , these all combine to produce that pickup ’s tone .
For example , the Tele neck also has a narrower spacing then most Strat pickups .
You can put a Strat pickup on a Tele and still get a warm
Tele tone .
The pickup ’s position under the strings is also important , since each area of a string emits a different frequency .
There are no set rules to what pickup can go in what guitar so if it fits and sounds good go with it .

Guttenberg told the Sunday mass - circulation newspaper Bild am Sonntag that Afghanistan 's history and character have long convinced him that Afghanistan will never be a model western democracy .
Lasting peace in the war - ravaged country could only be achieved , he added , if moderate Taliban members were allowed to participate in Afghanistan 's democracy .
" Because we are in a country with such regional diversity , " Guttenberg told the paper , " we ca n't just leave out an entire ethnic group like the Pashtuns if we want sustainable solutions for the future . "
Certain conditions would need to be fulfilled , however , and it would be unacceptable for the Afghan government to ignore universal human rights .
" We must ask ourselves who from the insurgents poses a serious threat to the international community and who is more concerned with the conditions in Afghanistan itself , " he said .
" This issue of human rights must also be taken into account , without ignoring the existing cultures and traditions in Afghanistan . "
Guttenberg has in the past week indicated a willingness to engage in peace talks with non-terrorist Taliban members , marking a change in German policy .

So you ’ve got your AdWords test all set up :
Will people go for the headline “ Code Review Tools ” or “ Tools for Code Review ? ”
Gee they ’re both so exciting !
Who could choose !
I know , I know , settle down .
This is how these things go .
Anyway , the next day you have 32 clicks on variant A ( “ Code Review Tools ” ) and 19 clicks on B ( “ Tools for Code Review ” ) .
Is that conclusive ?
Has A won ?
Or should you let the test run longer ?
Or should you try completely different text ?
The answer matters .
If you wait too long between tests , you ’re wasting time .
If you do n’t wait long enough for statistically conclusive results , you might think a variant is better and use that false assumption to create a new variant , and so forth , all on a wild goose chase !
That ’s not just a waste of time , it also prevents you from doing the correct thing , which is to come up with completely new text to test against .
Normally a formal statistical treatment would be too difficult , but I ’m here to rescue you with a statistically sound yet incredibly simple formula that will tell you whether or not your A/B test results really are indicating a difference .
I ’ll get to it in a minute , but I ca n’t help but include a more entertaining example than AdWords .
Meet Hammy the Hamster , the probably - biased - but - incredibly - lovable tester of organic produce ( click to watch 1m30s movie ) :
In the movie , Hammy chooses the organic produce 8 times and the conventional 4 times .
This is an A/B test , just like with AdWords … but healthier .
If you ’re like me , you probably think “ organic ” is the clear - cut winner — after all Hammy chose it twice as often as conventional veggies .
But , as so often happens with probability and statistics , you ’d be wrong .
That ’s because human beings are notoriously bad at guessing these things from gut feel .
For example , most people are more afraid of dying in a plane crash than a car crash , even though the latter is sixty times more likely .
On the other hand , we ’re amazed when CNN “ calls the election ” for a governor with a mere 1 % of the state ballots reporting in .
Okay okay , we suck at math .
So what ’s the answer ?
Here ’s the bit you ’ve been waiting for :
The way you determine whether an A/ B test shows a statistically significant difference is : Define N as “ the number of trials . ”
For Hammy this is 8+4 = 12 .
For the AdWords example this is 32+19 = 51 .
Define D as “ half the difference between the ‘ winner ’ and the ‘ loser ’ . ”
For Hammy this is ( 8 - 4 ) ÷ 2 = 2 .
For AdWords this is ( 32 - 19 ) ÷ 2 = 6.5 .
The test result is statistically significant if D 2 is bigger than N .
For Hammy , D 2 is 4 , which is not bigger than 12 , so it is not significant .
For AdWords , D 2 is 42.25 , which is not bigger than 51 , so it is not significant .
( For the mathematical justification , see the end of the post . )
So your AdWords test is n’t statistically significant yet .
But what if you let the test continue to run .
The next day you find 30 more clicks for variant A for a total of 62 , and 19 more clicks for B for a total of 40 .
Running the formula : N = 62+40 = 102 ; D = ( 62 - 40 ) ÷ 2 = 11 ; D2 = 121 which is bigger than 102 , so now the measured difference is significant .
A lot of times , though , you keep running the test and it ’s still not significant .
That ’s when you realize you ’re not learning anything new ; the variants you picked are not meaningfully different for your readers .
That means it ’s time to come up with something new .
When you start applying the formula to real - world examples , you ’ll notice that when N is small it ’s hard — or even impossible — to be statistically significant .
For example , say you ’ve got one ad with 6 clicks and the other with 1 .
That ’s N = 7 , D = 2.5 , D2 is 6.25 so the test is still inconclusive , even though A is beating B six - to - one .
Trust the math here — with only a few data points , you really do n’t know anything yet .
But what about the vast majority of people who do n’t click either ad ?
That ’s the “ ad impressions ” that did n’t lead to a click .
Should n’t those count somehow in the statistics ?
No , they should n’t ; those are “ mistrials . ”
To see why , consider Hammy again .
That video was edited ( of course ) , and a lot of the time Hammy did n’t pick either vegetable , opting instead to groom himself or sleep .
( For the “ outtakes ” video and more statistics , see Hammy ’s Homepage . )
If Hammy does n’t pick a vegetable during a particular trial run , it does n’t mean anything — does n’t mean he likes or dislikes either .
It just tells us nothing at all .
Because the AdWords “ click - through rate ” is dependant both on the number of clicks and the number of impressions , you must not use “ click - through rate ” to determine statistical significance .
Only the raw number of clicks can be used in the formula .
I hope this formula will help you make the right choices when running A/B tests .
It ’s simple enough that you have no excuse not to apply it !
Human intuition sucks when it comes to these things , so let the math help you draw the right conclusions .

For the mathematically inclined :
The derivation
The null - hypothesis is that the results of the A/B test are due to chance alone .
The statistical test we need is Pearson ’s chi-square .
The definition of the general statistic follows ( where m = number of possible outcomes ;
Oi = observed number of results in outcome #i ; Ei = expected number of results in outcome # i ) :
In the simple case of the A/B test , m = 2 .
From a 50/50 random process , the expected values are Ei = n/2 where n = O1+O2 .
Taking A = O1 to be the larger of the two observed values and B = O2 to be the smaller , the ( unsimplified ) formula is :
The squared difference between A and n/2 is the same as between B and n/2 ( because A+B = n ) , so we can replace those squared - difference terms by a new variable D2 .
The definition of D in the text above as ( A–B ) / 2 comes by substituting n = A+B into D = A – n / 2 .
Rewriting in terms of D and simplifying yields :
Now we have a simple way of computing the chi-square statistic , but we have to refer to the chi-square distribution to determine statistical significance .
Specifically :
What is the probability this result could have happened by chance alone ?
Looking at the distribution with 1 degree of freedom ( B depends on A so there ’s just one degree of freedom ) , we need to exceed 3.8 for 95 % confidence and 6.6 for 99 % confidence .
For my simplified rule - of - thumb purposes , I selected 4 as the critical threshold .
Solving for D2 completes the derivation :
QED , suckkas !
P.S. Useful side - note :
If D2 is more than double n , you ’re well past the 99 % confidence level .

Analysis
The big difference are that there no longer is a lineup appearance point .
This means that for your Main Team , picking players that win ( rather than that just play often ) matters a lot more .
It also means that Anti-Team is no longer a hunt for players who do not play ( though this is certainly a possible strategy ) .
Thus , your Anti Team could actually be positive if you pick many losers .

Trading Rules
Each week you can trade players ( swap a player for someone you do n't have )
Every player has a trade value , and you can only trade for players of lower value
value
You will be limited to a maximum 2 Main Team and 1 Anti Team trades per week
Trades do not carry over if unused
Each time you trade , your team will be assessed a - 1 point trade tax
Basic Trading Strategy
Check lineups each week !
Players in the lineup , especially twice , are usually worth trading for
Do n't make trades just for sake of making trades , as they cost you trade tax points and you may get stuck with a player you do n't want
The trade price formula takes into account number of matches remaining -- so players with more matches remaining will have higher prices
You must trade for players with less value , but try to minimize the value loss .
For example , if you trade someone worth 30 for someone worth 20 , next week you can only trade the 20 for someone less .
It 's much better to trade the 30 for someone worth 29 .
Groups
You will be able to create and join groups so you can compare your results with a smaller subset of the players , for example there might be a Staff Group , a First Time FPL Group , a USA Players Group , or a group created by you with just your friends .

It 's fun , easy , and makes watching Proleague much more exciting .
You do n't need to spend any time on managing your team during the season if you do n't want to .
If you do n't fully understand the rules , do n't worry .
The basic thing to remember is , pick players for your " Main Team " that you think will do well , and pick players for your " Anti Team " who you think will do poorly .
Regular Game Win : 4 PointsRegular Game Loss : - 2 PointsAce Match Appearance : 2 PointsAce Match Win : 4 PointsAce Match Loss : 0 Points3 - Game Win Streak : 2 Points6 - Game Win Streak : 3 Points9 - Game Win Streak : 4 PointsYour Player 's Team Wins : 1 PointYour Player Does n't Play : 1 Point ( for 3 - 0 or 0 - 3 score ) 3- 0 Victory : 6 Points3 - 1 Victory : 4 Points3 - 2 Victory : 2 Points2 - 3 Defeat : 0 Point1 - 3 Defeat : - 1 Points0 - 3 Defeat : - 2 PointsTrade Tax : - 1 The big difference are that there no longer is a lineup appearance point .
This means that for your Main Team , picking players that win ( rather than that just play often ) matters a lot more .
It also means that Anti-Team is no longer a hunt for players who do not play ( though this is certainly a possible strategy ) .
Thus , your Anti Team could actually be positive if you pick many losers .
You will be able to create and join groups so you can compare your results with a smaller subset of the players , for example there might be a Staff Group , a First Time FPL Group , a USA Players Group , or a group created by you with just your friends .

How exactly are the player costs going to be calculated ?
Is it just going to be their trade value rounded to the nearest integer ?

Yes , it will be based off Round 1 performance but adjusted using the new scoring system ( so its more accurate ) .
Feel free to calculate player costs right now if you wish -- we 'll have a full list out sometime after the Round 1 matches finish tonight .

# 6 oh wow that 's huge changes , player losing now ain't covered with the lineup appearance :o
i really think the changes are good , especially lowering the team scoring a bit .
though choosing a good team is still important as going 2 - 3 now gives nothing and goind 0 - 3 still hurts !
i feel like the changes make this even more difficult , definitely requires more skill now !
when does the R2 actually start ?
like in december or in January 2010 ?

Finaly it will pay off to have players in your anti-team that are in a slump or not playing " Hence to fight and conquer in all you battles is not considered as surpreme excellence , surpreme excellence consists in breaking the enemies resistance without fighting " ;

Before , loss was worth - 1 and lineup appearance worth 1 , so if you picked a player who went 0 - 10 , the best you would get is 0 .
But since lineup point is removed , your 0 - 10 player is now going to score in the negatives , which means if he's on your Anti Team , he 'll score in the positives .
Another way to look at it is that Main Team players can now score in the negatives Before , loss was worth - 1 and lineup appearance worth 1 , so if you picked a player who went 0 - 10 , the best you would get is 0 .

Before the change a player could never go below 0 because the worst that could happen was lineup ( +1 ) and loss ( - 1 ) = 0 .
So now that players can get negativ results , they could give you more points if they are in the anti team since minus minus is plus .

I just thought about this some more ... players ' trade values will fluctuate a lot more than before since point ranges are more dynamic .
How is the trade value formula going to change , if at all ?

BRATISLAVA , Nov 7 ( Reuters ) - Slovakia said on Saturday it would close all but one road border crossing with Ukraine on Sunday because of Ukraine 's flu epidemic .
Vysne Nemecke , the biggest checkpoint , will be the only one to stay open .
" The reason is the continuing worsening of the epidemic situation in Ukraine , " Interior Minister Robert Kalinak told journalists .
" This is intended to minimize any eventual outbreak of the disease . "
Kalinak said the EU member state 's decision was temporary and aimed to protect the bloc .
Doctors and hygienists will be stationed at the border to monitor passengers and have the powers to bar anyone suspected of being infected from entering the country .
Ukraine could delay a January presidential election until May next year because of its outbreak of H1N1 flu , which has killed more than 100 in recent weeks and infected more than 750,000 [ ID :nL695938 ] .

Owners of Toyota Cars in Rebellion Over Series of Accidents Caused by Sudden Acceleration ABC
News investigation finds over 200 accidents ; Toyota owners want answers .
Nov. 3 , 2009  --
Refusing to accept the explanation of Toyota and the federal government , hundreds Toyota owners are in rebellion after a series of accidents caused by what they call " runaway cars . "
Safety analysts found an estimated 2000 cases in which owners of Toyota cars including Camry , Prius and Lexus , reported that their cars surged without warning up to speeds of 100 miles per hour .
CLICK HERE FOR MORE OF THE RUNAWAY TOYOTAS STORY .
Toyota says the incidents are caused by floor mats becoming stuck under gas pedals , but owners say that 's not what happened to them .
Watch the full report tonight on ' World News with Charles Gibson ' and ' Nightline ' .
" I 'm absolutely certain that in my situation , it was not the floor mats , " Elizabeth James told ABC News .
She was driving her Toyota Prius outside Denver , CO when she says it suddenly shot up to 90 miles an hour , even though her foot was on the brake and not the gas pedal .
" I kept going faster and faster , " James said .
" And all of a sudden … my foot was pressing on the brake super , super hard and I was n't slowing down . "
James and some other Toyota owners suspect the accidents have been caused by some kind of glitch in the electronic computer system used in Toyotas that controls the throttle .
Toyota officials refused to talk with ABC News about the incidents , but posted a statement from executive Bob Daly on its website last night that said : " Some news reports suggest there may be other causes of unintended acceleration , speculating about electronic engine control systems , braking performance or electro - magnetic interference among other theories .
There is no evidence to support these theories . "
Click here to watch the video of Toyota 's full statement .
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has done six separate investigations of such acceleration surges in Toyotas since 2003 and found no defect in Toyota 's electronics .
The U.S. Department of Transportation released a statement Tuesday afternoon saying the matter " is not closed . "
The full statement read : " Toyota has announced a safety recall involving 3.8 million vehicles in which the accelerator pedal may become stuck at high vehicle speeds due to interference by the driver 's side floor mat , which is obviously a very dangerous situation .
Toyota has written to vehicle owners stating that it has decided that a safety defect exists in their vehicles and asking owners to remove all floor mats while the company is developing a remedy .
We believe consumers should follow Toyota 's recommendation to address the most immediate safety risk .
However , removal of the mats is simply an interim measure , not a remedy of the underlying defect in the vehicles .
NHTSA is discussing with Toyota what the appropriate vehicle remedy or remedies will be .
This matter is not closed until Toyota has effectively addressed the vehicle defect by providing a suitable remedy . "
Some Toyota Owners Point to Problem Other than Floor Mats
Many Toyota owners remain convinced that an electronic problem is to blame .
Bulent Ezal was driving with his wife of 46 years in their Toyota Camry in central California , when he says it suddenly took off .
The car plunged over a 100 foot cliff into the Pacific ocean , and while he survived , his wife did not .
" All of a sudden the car surged with force and I was thrown back to the seat , " Ezal said .
The last thing he heard was his wife screaming before he blacked out .
Toyota says the accident was caused by Ezal mistakenly pushing the gas pedal , but Ezal is adamant that his foot was " absolutely , positively on the brake . "
There have been other deaths as well , including a fatal accident near San Diego this August that took the lives of California Highway patrol officer Mark Saylor , his wife , daughter and brother - in - law .
The Lexus they were driving , borrowed from a dealer , raced out of control at 100 miles an hour before hitting another vehicle , crashing into an embankment and bursting into flames .
Right before the crash , Saylor 's brother - in - law called 911 from the backseat of the vehicle and said urgently , " Our accelerator is stuck .
We 're in trouble … There 's no brakes . "
Toyota said the problem was the wrong - sized , all - weather rubber floor mat in the car which was caught and held down the gas pedal .
The company ordered a huge floor mat recall for 3.8 million cars .
In Tokyo , the president of Toyota , Akio Toyoda , formally apologized , saying , " Four precious lives have been lost .
I offer my deepest condolences . "
But many Toyota owners remained unconvinced , including Elizabeth James in Denver , CO and her husband Ted .
They organized a YouTube campaign accusing Toyota of gross negligence and cover - up and are demanding answers .

Nearing his ninth decade , formal in vested suit and cufflinks , Rabbi Haskel Lookstein strode purposefully into a classroom of Ramaz High School on Manhattan ’s Upper East Side one recent Monday afternoon .
He checked the presence and location of his 18 students against a seating chart .
He chided one for arriving moments late .
Then he led off the discussion of the homework assignment .
It consisted of an article from the national Jewish newspaper , The Forward , about a married couple who participate avidly in both synagogue and swinging .
“ Are n’t these people just being honest ? ” Rabbi Lookstein asked .
Five or six hands immediately shot up .
So began another day in Jewish Sexual Ethics , the course better known around Ramaz , even to its teacher , as “ Sex With the Rabbi . ”
For the last 23 years , since Rabbi Lookstein devised the class , he has taught it to every 10th grader to pass through Ramaz , a Modern Orthodox institution combining rigorous secular and religious curriculums .
“ This is one of the most favorite things I do in the world , ” Rabbi Lookstein , 77 , said in a recent interview .
“ I love the interaction with students  and being able to open their eyes to the way in which Judaism approaches the basic facts of life . ”
WASHINGTON 
This much is known : About 7:15 Tuesday night , a glittering blonde , decked out in a red and gold sari , holding the hand of her black - tuxedoed escort , swept past the camera crews and reporters camped out to catch the red-carpet arrivals for the first state dinner given by President Obama .
“ Hey , that ’s a Desperate Housewife ! ” one reporter yelled out , alluding to the TV series named for a collection of them .
In fact , the couple  Michaele Salahi and her husband , Tareq  are Virginians who have been auditioning for a possible role in a different housewives TV franchise : “ The Real Housewives of Washington . ”
They swept past the camera crews and followed the trail of other bigwigs attending the dinner .
But neither Mr. nor Mrs. Salahi , best known in the Washington area for promoting wine and polo in Virginia , were on the guest list for the event , a fact first reported Wednesday morning on the Washington Post Web site .

Acquaint you with the most wonders of our country and those wonderful places that everyone should know Rossiyanin .
Election of seven “ wonders of the country ” took place through SMS and Internet voting .
It was finally selected 49 wonders of the 7 federal districts of Russia ( on the 7 wonders of each federal district )
The Valley of Geysers in the Kamchatka region
The Valley of Geysers is the only geyser field in Eurasia – apart from the Mutnovsky geyser field - and the second largest concentration of geysers in the world .
This 6 km long basin with approximately ninety geysers and many hot springs is situated on the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Russian Far East , predominantly on the left bank of the ever - deepening Geysernaya River , into which geothermal waters flow from a relatively young stratovolcano , Kikhpinych .
Temperatures have been found to be 250 °C , 500 m below the caldera ground .
It is part of the Kronotsky Nature Reserve , which , in turn , is incorporated into the World Heritage Site “ Volcanoes of Kamchatka ” .
The valley is difficult to reach , with helicopters providing the only feasible means of transport .
Lake Baikal
Lake Baikal is the world ’s second most voluminous lake , after the Caspian Sea .
It is the most voluminous freshwater lake in the world with an average depth of 744.4 m ( 2,442 ft ) and contains a total of roughly 20 percent of the world ’s surface fresh water .
Located in the south of the Russian region of Siberia ( between Irkutsk Oblast to the northwest and the Buryat Republic to the southeast , near the city of Irkutsk ) , the body of water is also known as the “ Pearl of Siberia ” .
Lake Baikal is the deepest , and among the clearest of all lakes in the world .
At more than 25 million years old , Baikal is also the world ’s oldest lake .
Like Lake Tanganyika , Lake Baikal was formed as an ancient rift valley , having the typical long crescent shape with a surface area of 31,722 km2/12,248 sq mi , less than that of Lake Superior or Lake Victoria .
Baikal is home to more than 1,700 species of plants and animals , two thirds of which can be found nowhere else in the world and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996 .
It is also home to Buryat tribes who reside on the eastern side of Lake Baikal , rearing goat , camel , cattle and sheep , where the regional temperature varies from a minimum of - 17 °C in winter to maximum of 14 °C in summer .
The complex of palaces in Peterhof
Peterhof is a municipal town within Petrodvortsovy District of the federal city of Saint Petersburg on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland .
It hosts one of two campuses of Saint Petersburg State University .
A series of palaces and gardens , laid out on the orders of Peter the Great , and sometimes called the “ Russian Versailles ” , is also situated there .
The palace - ensemble along with the city center is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site .
The dominant natural feature of Peterhof is a sixteen - metre - high bluff lying less than a hundred metres from the shore .
The so - called Lower Gardens , at 1.02 km² comprising the better part of Peterhof ’s land area , are confined between this bluff and the shore , stretching east and west for roughly 200 metres .
The majority of Peterhof ’s fountains are contained here , as are several small palaces and outbuildings .
East of the Lower Gardens lies the Alexandria Park with 19th - century Gothic Revival structures such as the Kapella .
Columns of Erosion in the Komi Republic
Arrange in the Troitsko - Pecherskiy area , in the Komi Republic , the Columns of Erosion , or Manpupuner as they ’re acknowledged in Russia are among the country ’s most cryptic attracters .
The “ 7 Strong Men ” as the locals call it are 7 monolithic rock columns breaking open of a flat tableland .
Their height , that reaches 42 meters , and their abnormal anatomies make them unaccessible to even the most felt cragsmen .
Not much is known about these mysterious “ 7 Strong Men ” and on an international level they are virtually unknown .
Although very hard to reach and set in a harsh environment , Manpupuner offers a great sight to its visitors .
Many say that while there you feel no need of water , food or rest , all you want to do is stare at these masterpieces of nature , where locals say spirits used to gather in ancient times .
Saint Basil ’s Cathedral in Moscow
The Cathedral of Intercession of Theotokos on the Moat is a Russian Orthodox cathedral erected on the Red Square in Moscow in 1555 – 1561 .
Built on the order of Ivan IV of Russia to commemorate the capture of Kazan and Astrakhan , it marks the geometric center of the city and the hub of its growth since the 14th century .
It was the tallest building of Moscow until the completion of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower in 1600 .
The original building , known as Trinity Church and later Trinity Cathedral , contained eight side churches arranged around the ninth , central church of Intercession ; the tenth church was erected in 1588 over the grave of venerated local Fool Vasily ( Basil ) .
In the 16th and the 17th centuries the cathedral , perceived as the earthly symbol of the Heavenly City , was popularly known as the Jerusalem and served as an allegory of the Jerusalem Temple in the annual Palm Sunday parade attended by the Patriarch of Moscow and the tsar
Mamayev Kurgan in Volgograd , Statue of Motherland
The Motherland , or The Mamayev Monument , is a statue in Mamayev Kurgan in Volgograd , Russia commemorating the Battle of Stalingrad .
The repetitive wording in the title “ Mother Motherland ” does not exist in Russian : the word for “ Motherland ” , “ ?????? ” , is derived from “ birth ” and can be literally translated as “ birth place ” .
When the memorial was dedicated in 1967 it was the tallest sculpture in the world , measuring 85 metres ( 279 feet ) from the tip of its sword to the top of the plinth .
The figure itself measures 52 metres ( 170 feet ) , and the sword 33 metres ( 108 feet ) .
Two hundred steps , symbolizing the 200 days of the Battle of Stalingrad , lead from the bottom of the hill to the monument .
The lead sculptor was Yevgeny Vuchetich ( a famous Russian sculptor of Serbian descent ) , and the significant structural engineering challenges of the 7,900 tonnes ( 7,800 LT ; 8,700 ST ) of concrete [ 1 ] sculpture were handled by Nikolai Nikitin .
The statue appears on both the current flag and coat of arms of Volgograd Oblast .
Mount Elbrus
Mount Elbrus is an inactive volcano located in the western Caucasus mountain range , in Kabardino - Balkaria and Karachay - Cherkessia , Russia , near the border of Georgia .
Mt. Elbrus ’s highest peak is the highest mountain in the Caucasus , in Russia , and in all of Europe .
Mt. Elbrus ( west summit ) stands at 5,642 metres ( 18,510 ft ) ; the east summit is slightly lower at 5,621 metres ( 18,442 ft ) .
The ancients knew the mountain as Strobilus , Latin for ‘ pine cone ’ , a direct loan from the ancient Greek strobilos , meaning ‘ a twisted object ’ — a long established botanical term that describes the shape of the volcano ’s summit .
Myth held that here Zeus had chained Prometheus , the Titan who had stolen fire from the gods and given it to ancient man — likely a reference to historic volcanic activity .

Just after 3 P.M. , Zack straps on his headset ( or helmet , as the ex-military jocks call them ) , leans over the controller he will replace and listens as his colleague swiftly briefs him on the status of each plane on his scope .
Because traffic is already heavy , the transfer occurs like a baton pass during a relay race , with Zack fairly jogging in place and then , still settling himself into his chair , emitting a tongue - twisting barrage of instructions to catch up for lost time : " Continental 301 , eight miles from the outer marker , turn right heading 190 , maintain 2,500 feet until established on the localizer , cleared I.L.S. runway 22 left approach . "
Between issuing commands , Zack listens for each pilot to read back his instructions ; asks a nearby controller if he can " borrow " some airspace for one of his planes ; coordinates , over an outside telephone line , a tricky landing with the Newark tower , and writes down on individual " flight strips " every altitude and speed he gives to pilots .
If Zack 's radar goes down -- or he goes down the pipes -- those flight strips are the only way a supervisor , running to bail him out , can figure out which way his planes are headed .
Some controllers , ever fearful of going down the pipes , work only the minimum number of planes before asking their supervisor to hold new traffic .
But Zack wo n't surrender .
" I can take it !
I can take it ! " he yells as the planes stream onto his scope until the supervisor himself decides he 's had enough .
" Around here , I'm the Man , " Zack says , punching his chest .
" That 's ' cause I 'm not afraid of the airplanes .
I always tell my supervisor , ' Put me where the action is . '
' Cause I want it .
I want the traffic . "
Zack emits a percussive , high - pitched laugh .
" We call the weak controllers the Papier - Maches .
You know -- it used to be , guys were made of steel , but now they 're made of papier - mache .
Ha , ha ! "
Zack turns back to his scope , and once again it 's filling with jets : five from the south , two from the west , three from the north -- all heading toward Newark International .
Of the sector 's six radar scopes -- one for Newark arrivals , one for departures , two for the satellite airports and two that feed planes to the other scopes -- the Newark final scope is the hardest , for the goal is to take those 10 jets , arriving from wildly divergent angles , and actually point them at each other so they will converge in a tight line leading to the runway .
According to F.A.A. rules , the Tracon 's controllers must keep jets separated by at least three miles laterally or 1,000 feet vertically .
But because the skies are always filled to capacity , the F.A.A. allows controllers to reduce the space between two planes if one pilot confirms he has the other plane in sight .
That 's what distinguishes the Men of Steel from the Papier - Maches .
A weak controller , spotting two jets six miles apart , wo n't agonize over the unused airspace .
But Zack sees that gap as a chance to push more traffic , looks for a third jet to slide between the two and then -- by using visual separation -- packs the jets even closer in the sky .
On the final descent toward Newark , planes travel one mile every 11 seconds ;
Zack ca n't hesitate or miss a turn , or the entire chain of jets will collapse .
But he does n't .
Like a shrewd billiards player , Zack calculates the angles that will transform his 10 random jets into a 30 - mile chain , then commands the pilots with unassailable authority .
" Pilots are like dogs , " he says under his breath .
" They can smell fear in your voice .
But if you sound confident , they 'll do whatever you tell them to do . "
He pauses to appreciate his handiwork -- 10 blips , each three miles apart , heading like geese toward the Newark runway .
" Now that 's crisp vectoring !
Make a plan , make it work , but do n't think about the plan .
Real educated people , somebody with real smarts , can't do this because they 're always pondering .
I do n't have time for that . "
A criminal smile lights up his face .
" With this job , you will get yourself cornered .
The question is :
How good are you at getting yourself out ?
" The key is picturing the scope in three dimensions , " he goes on .
" Can you picture these blips as airplanes , all making the turn in the sky ?
If you can't picture it , you can't do the job . "
Zack points to one blip .
" Look -- that 's a 737 .
It 's got two engines , two pilots , four attendants and probably 150 passengers reading the paper and drinking their Bloody Marys .
You can actually feel the power of one of those airplanes , and you know what it 'll look like if it crashes . "
Zack appraises the scope , filling once again with blips .
" Jeez , airplanes everywhere -- two here , four there -- you gotta love it ! "

Cool starfish ( purple indicates cool areas , red indicates warm )
One starfish has a remarkable strategy to avoid overheating in the sun , scientists have discovered .
The starfish pumps itself up with cold seawater to lower its body temperature when exposed to the sun at low tide .
It is equivalent to a person drinking seven litres of water before heading into the midday sun , scientists say .
However , global climate change may drastically interfere with this vital mechanism by increasing sea temperatures , the researchers warn .
The ochre starfish or sea star ( Pisaster ochraceus ) is found in the intertidal zone along the Pacific North American coast .
We have discovered a quite novel thermoregulation strategy in the animal kingdom
Dr Sylvain Pincebourde
University of South Carolina , US
It mainly feeds on mussels while underwater .
During low tide it is exposed to the air and cannot move until it is submerged again at high tide .
When exposed to the warm sun at low tide , the ochre starfish can suffer heat stress .
Now scientists based in California , US reveal how it manages this excess heat in the journal American Naturalist .
Pump up the volume " We have discovered a quite novel thermoregulation strategy in the animal kingdom , " says Dr Sylvain Pincebourde , formerly of the University of South Carolina , Columbia but now at the François Rabelais University in Tours , France .
" We found that the weight of the sea stars increased during the days after exposure to high temperature at low tide . "
" The sea stars were not allowed to feed .
So this increase can be explained only by an increase in seawater uptake .
When sucking up water , the body mass of a sea star increases , " he says .
The increase in body mass allows the starfish to be buffered against environmental temperature changes in the subsequent low tide .
" Because its body mass is now higher , body temperature increases more slowly , " Dr Pincebourde explains .
" The thermoregulatory strategy we have revealed in our study indicates that the sea star is well adapted to such a variable environment . "
Water cooled ochre starfish
Dr Pincebourde and colleagues at the University of California , Davis and Bodega Marine Laboratory , Bodega Bay , California , made their discovery by studying the starfish in an aquarium , and replicating tides and environmental conditions .
They used heat lamps to adjust the aerial temperature and an infrared camera to measure body temperature .
Finally , they weighed the star fish to estimate the amount of body fluids .

The scientists were especially surprised by the amount of water the starfish were able to store in a few days .
" It 's as if we decided to suck up more than 15 pounds of cold water in the morning to prepare ourselves to the high temperature we will get at noon , " Dr Pincebourde says .
They were also amazed to see the degree of control the starfish had .
" This quantity of stored water allows a decrease of almost 4 °C in excess body temperature , which is enough to avoid reaching dangerous body temperatures , " he explains .
Hot water Dr Pincebourde is concerned that this novel strategy may have limitations in a rapidly changing world .
" This discovery is quite important for us to formulate expectations on what could be the impact of climate change on the sea star , " he says .
As oceans warm together with air temperature the thermoregulatory mechanism used by the starfish will cease to work , he warns .
" The colder the sea water , the more it is able to lower its body temperature .
The efficiency of this thermoregulation strategy therefore might be annihilated by ocean warming . "
" Sea stars will reach more frequently high aerial body temperatures , leading to higher mortality rates , for example . "

The evolution of New York has been illustrated in photographs in countless ways .
Two of the biggest collections belong to the city .
Between 1938 and 1943 , 700,000 stark black - and - white pictures , known as tax photos , were taken to make property assessments and as a jobs program for the federal Works Progress Administration .
In the 1980s , a second set of 800,000 photos was taken , also for tax purposes .
In both sets , the property 's block and lot number is listed on the photos .
The photos are available for sale by the city .
Fred R. Conrad , a New York Times photographer , returned to 12 of the sites this year .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Life ! ) - Contrary to popular belief , the Internet and mobile phones are not isolating people but enhancing their social worlds , according to a U.S. survey .
A Twitter page is displayed on an Apple iPhone in Los Angeles October 13 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Mario Anzuoni
The survey was sparked by a 2006 study by U.S. sociologists who argued technology is advancing a trend seen since 1985 -- Americans becoming more socially isolated , their social networks shrinking , and the diversity of their contacts decreasing .
But the study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project , titled “ Social Isolation and New Technology , ” found people ’s use of mobile phones and the Internet is actually associated with larger and more diverse social networks .
“ When we examine people ’s full personal network ...
Internet use in general and use of social networking services such as Facebook in particular are associated with more diverse social networks , ” the researchers said in a statement .
“ Our key findings challenge previous research and commonplace fears about the harmful social impact of new technology . ”
The telephone survey of 2,512 adults , conducted by Princeton Survey Research International in July and August this year , found that since 1985 , the extent of social isolation has hardly changed at all .
It found 6 percent of the adult population has no one with whom to discuss important matters but this figure is largely unchanged since 1985 .
The survey , however , did find that people ’s “ discussion networks ” have shrunk about a third in the past 25 years and become less diverse as they contain fewer non-family members .
But people who have mobile phones and take part in a variety of Internet activities are associated with larger , more diverse core discussion networks .
On average , the size of people ’s discussion networks is 12 percent larger among mobile phone users , nine percent larger for those who share photos online , and nine percent bigger for those who use instant messaging .
The diversity of people ’s core networks tends to be 25 percent larger for mobile phone users , 15 percent larger for basic Internet users , and even larger for frequent Internet users , instant messagers , and those sharing photos online .
Internet users were as likely as anyone else to visit their neighbors and take part in local community activities .
“ Cell phone users , those who use the Internet frequently at work , and bloggers are more likely to belong to a local voluntary association , such as a youth group or a charitable organization , ” the study found .
“ However , we find some evidence that use of social networking services ( e.g. , Facebook , MySpace , Linked In ) substitutes for some neighborhood involvement . ”
The researchers said most uses of the Internet and mobile phone have a positive relationship to neighborhood networks , voluntary associations , and use of public spaces .
“ Our survey results suggest that people ’s lives are likely to be enhanced by participation with new communication technologies , rather than by fearing that their use of new technology will send them into a spiral of isolation , ” they concluded .
Microsoft software that is designed to help the police access encrypted data is loose on the web .
The software , known as Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor ( Cofee ) , has been put on file - sharing site , according to reports on the web .
It is illegal for unauthorised people to use the software or download it .
The software helps law enforcement agencies access details about crimes before criminals can wipe the information .
" Cofee brings together a number of common digital forensics capabilities into a fast , easy - to - use , automated tool for first responders .
And Cofee is being provided [ free ] to law enforcement around the world , " said Microsoft .
Police officers with basic computer skills can be taught to use the software in less than 10 minutes .
" This enables the officer to take advantage of the same common digital forensics tools used by experts to gather important volatile evidence , while doing little more than simply inserting a USB device into the computer , " said Microsoft .
Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos said “ The genie is out of the bottle . ”
“ Microsoft and the computer crime authorities will be mightily upset that this was leaked onto the internet for anyone to download via file - sharing sites . ”
“ Some will be worried that unauthorised users may now have access to such a tool for their own nefarious purposes , but I would also worry that computer criminals could analyse Cofee , and write code that would identify that it is trying to run on their computer and intercept it , securely wiping incriminating data from their hard drives . ”
The Nintendo Dual - Screen continues its record of the best software library on the market with its plethora of excellent titles for literally every possible gamer type .
From those that just have fifteen minutes on the train , to those that want to make five hour car trips disappear , it ’s impossible not to find a handful of titles to sate your specific tastes .
But even with a library of thousands , these five games have emerged as the best the system has to offer .

Super Robot Taisen OG Saga : Endless Frontier ( Banpresto / Monolith Soft , Namco Bandai Games )
Winner : Scribblenauts
Nothing on the portable gaming scene has matched that almost - embarassing moment of glee one feels when testing Level 5 ’s immense word compendium .
Sure , attached to the massive in - game dictionary were creative level lay - outs and an amusing art style ; but when you spend hours making fantastic title matches like God vs. Cthulu ( and you will , ) the outside world can disappear around you .
For forcing us to come to grips with the limits of our creativity , Scribblenauts takes home the DS gold for 2009 .
( CNN ) -- Actress Alaina Reed - Amini , best known for her long - running roles as Olivia Robinson on the children 's program " Sesame Street " and Rose Lee Holloway on the comedy " 227 , " has died .
Reed - Amini lost a two - year battle with breast cancer at St. John 's Medical Center in Santa Monica , California , on Thursday , according to reports .
Reed - Amini , who changed her named from Alaina Reed Hall after she married Tamim Amini in 2008 , turned 63 last month .
In 1976 she joined the cast of " Sesame Street " as Olivia , a professional photographer and the kid sister of Gordon the teacher .
She left the program in 1988 for a role on the NBC sitcom " 227 . "
The actress married her " 227 " co-star Kevin Peter Hall in 1988 .
With art imitating life , their characters were married in the final season of the show in 1990 .
Hall died in 1991 from complications from the AIDS virus that he acquired through a blood transfusion .
Her stage credits include productions of " Chicago " and " Hair . "
She also appeared in the inspirational one - woman show " Alaina at the Bijou . "
Her movie credits include " Cruel Intentions " and " Death Becomes Her . "
She guest - starred on television shows such as " ER , " " NYPD Blue , " " The Drew Carey Show " and " Ally McBeal . "
Reed - Amini is survived by her husband and two children from her marriage to Hall .
Maybe it ’s just me , but when I know that people are using my code it galvanises me into improving it .
Following the discovery that people were actually using Perlanet , I ’ve made quite a few releases over the last week or so .
I thought people might be interested in what I ’ve been doing .
Release 0.30 was a big one .
I incorporated a lot of the improvements that Alex had made in his fork .
Most important was probably switching to URI :: Fetch instead of LWP :: UserAgent .
This means that we can now cache the feeds and only re-request them when they have changed .
Release 0.31 documented the caching feature .
It also removed some annoying debugging output unless the program was running in a console .
I also tweaked the output for failed requests and thereby introduced a nasty bug that was n’t fixed for some days .
Release 0.32 added some better help for the ‘ perlanet ’ command line program and added a lot more of Alex ’s fixes and improvements .
I also tried running the code through both ‘ perltidy ’ and ‘ perlcritic ’ and made some changes based on their suggestions .
Release 0.33 featured a much improved test suite .
It also fixed the nasty bug that I introduced in 0.31 .
If you were using a cache and a feed had n’t changed from the previous request then it was n’t processed at all .
I found this bug whilst working on the test suite .
Testing is good , boys and girls !
Release 0.34 went out in the last hour .
Overnight I got a bug report about the caching support .
I ’ve been using CHI to provide caching , and because not everyone wants to use caching I had marked it as an optional dependency in Build .
PL .
But I was loading it in the code whether or not it was being used .
So if you did n’t have it installed , Perlanet did n’t work at all .
I ’ve now made it truly optional – it ’s only loaded if required .
And if you try to use caching but do n’t have CHI installed everything still works – just without a cache .
That got me thinking .
And the version currently in github applies the same principle to OPML support using XML :: OPML :: SimpleGen .
Not everyone wants to generate an OPML file , so I should n’t force everyone to install that module .
That will be in release 0.35 which will go out in the next couple of days .
I ’m also thinking of doing the same for the HTML : : Tidy [ 1 ] and HTML :: Scrubber support .
I still have some more of Alex ’s patches to apply .
But I ’m considering how to make things like filter support into an optional add - on .
I ’ve tried to get some discussion of these features going on the Perlanet mailing list .
If you ’re interested in Perlanet , please subscribe to the list and get involved in the discussions .
[ 1 ] I should point out that Perlanet already has support for HTML :: Tidy , but installing HTML :: Tidy is a bit of a black art currently .
The RT queue seems to imply that the module has been abandoned .
Does anyone want to offer to take it over from Andy ?

Gordon Brown today revealed that he had had a " very friendly " conversation with the Sun 's owner , Rupert Murdoch , after the paper criticised the way he wrote to a mother whose son was killed in Afghanistan .
The prime minister insisted his personal relations with the media tycoon were good , although he appeared to accept this would not stop the paper campaigning against Labour .
Brown made his disclosure in an interview after a senior Tory last night suggested that David Cameron did not approve of the way in which the Sun had covered the complaint from Jacqui Janes , who was unhappy with the handwritten letter she had received from Brown .
Earlier this week , the Sun reported Janes 's comments about the letter very prominently .
It also claimed , in an editorial , that the prime minister 's untidy and badly spelt letter illustrated his disregard for the armed forces .
Brown 's allies thought the attack unreasonable because the prime minister 's handwriting is affected by his poor eyesight .
Many commentators and members of the public also complained that the coverage was unfair .
This morning , when asked about the affair during an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme , Brown said he had spoken to Murdoch since the Sun ran its original story on Monday .
" I talk to Rupert Murdoch on a number of occasions and I talked to him this week .
It was a very friendly conversation , " he said .
" I have got a great deal of respect for what he has done , and I hope that he has some respect for me . "
Asked whether the pair had discussed the Janes story , Brown said : " What decisions the Sun makes through its editor , and then through its British operations , is a matter for them , and I am really not going to get involved in that .
" I want to be able to show that what we are doing and the decisions we make are thought out , they are carefully examined before we announce them , we know what we are doing and we share the sense of pain that all members of the public have when you see loved ones lost and you see casualties . "
Questioned about whether he had been hurt by the coverage , the prime minister said : " The criticism of me and the questioning of me is nothing to what I know parents – and I count Jacqui Janes in that – [ are ] going through . "
He said Janes had " legitimate questions about what happened to her son " and that the government had to answer them .
On the BBC's Question Time last night , the Tory security spokeswoman , Pauline Neville - Jones , praised Brown for taking the trouble to write to the relatives of servicemen killed in Afghanistan and criticised the Sun 's coverage .
" I do n't particularly like what they did with it and I think , actually , their readers clearly did n't – and they are right , " she said .
" Their readers are right .
They made a mistake . "
She said she thought Cameron would agree with her comments " because I think the decent reaction of people is that you do n't go on and on like that " .
" The Sun has its own editorial line , " she added .
" I am quite certain that nobody in the Tory party is actually going to foster this kind of personal attack – because it did become very personal , and I do n't like that .
I think we should fight our politics clean . "

Toronto Star photographer Steve Russell is used to shooting the story , not being shot at .
Midway through the third period of Monday night 's Leaf game , Russell took a shot off his right cheekbone from Sabres goalie Ryan Miller .
Watch the video .
Miller , clearing the puck , shot toward the glass .
In a kind of million - to - one shot , the puck somehow went through a little cutout area in the glass where photographers aim their cameras .
" He was n't shooting it hard , he was just throwing it into the corner , " said Russell , whose camera was slightly lowered at the time while he followed the play .
" If it was a hard shot , I would have got a lot more messed up .
It went right straight through the hole and hit me square in the cheekbone . "
Paramedics established the cheekbone was n't broken and gave him ice .
Miller came over at the whistle to make sure Russell was okay and gave him his goalie stick at the end of the game .
Upper body injury aside , Russell finished shooting the game .

Workers with heavy equipment had cleared all but a few boulders from a rockslide that blocked U.S. Highway 64 , near Ocoee , Tenn. , this morning when , with a tremble and a roar , another huge slide spilled across the road and into the Ocoee River gorge .
But then France was drawn into that same group , along with Uruguay .
How do you say “ lucked out ” in French ?
If any of the three officials on the field in the last qualifying match had been competent or even perceptive regarding Thierry Henry ’s blatant two - touch handball , then France might not be in the World Cup , and Ireland might be .
This theme is not going away .
Within a few minutes , the United States wound up with even more good fortune than France .
Algeria just did slip into the World Cup final tournament , getting by Egypt .
And while Slovenia did escape huge and rich Russia , Slovenia is the smallest nation in this World Cup , if that means anything .
Historically , the United States has trouble with sturdy , disciplined European sides .
But this is a good draw for the United States .
Not only is it a good draw , but it is logistical heaven for the Yanks , who had planned to be based in the Johannesburg - Pretoria area .
The team does not have to travel far around that large country for matches against England in Rustenberg on June 12 , Slovenia in Johannesburg on June 18 and Algeria in Tshwane / Pretoria on June 23 .
“ We can prepare properly , ” said Sunil Gulati , the president of the United States Soccer Federation , who admitted he was quite all right when the England - U.S.A. , Beckham - Donovan matchup popped up in the draw .
The United States has reason to think about a “ result ”  a tie or victory  in its opening match .
England is one of those nations 
Italy is another  that seem to lug a disproportionate amount of angst into group play of the World Cup .
England sometimes develops the urge to make an egregious foul in plain view of the ref .
And look at how the United States tied Italy in 2006 in Germany and almost did the same thing in 1990  in Italy .

Any way they look at it , the Americans cannot feel fate or nefarious plots by FIFA are against them , which has seemed to be the case in some previous World Cup draws .
They have a chance to play more than three games in South Africa six months from now .
But they do not have the offensive star power to think that way .
Finding my first Python reference cycle
I ’ve worked in Python for nearly six years now and , up to this point , I ’ve not had to deal with the king of memory - related gotchas : the reference cycle .
Simply put , a reference cycle happens when two or more objects create a cyclic directed graph in their path of references ( ok , not that simple ) .
The simplest form is the “ I point to you , you point to me , neither of our reference counts get to zero ” scenario .
Usually , this is n’t a big deal .
Although objects do n’t get immediately collected when dereferenced , the garbage collector will eventually notice that there is some wasted memory , do the more expensive cycle detection work , and free the objects .
In many scenarios like single - run scripts , cron jobs , or low - load applications you ’ll never notice ; Python does it ’s job , keeps things clean , and stays out of your way .
If , however , you ’re writing a high performance internet server intended to handle the ever increasing demands of the modern Internet , you just might be screwed .
That GC work will cost you desired though - put and scalability .
In the worst case , the GC wo n’t be invoked in time and you ’ll hemorrhage memory ( or at least gobble it up in competition with other things your system might need to do ) .
I this case , initial numbers left us with a customer - detectable throughput degradation when a particular security feature was enabled .
Without further ado , here is the distilled pattern that ran us into trouble .
class Filter : def __init__ ( self , callback ) : self .
_callback = callback def update ( self , data ) : " " " Override and call parent . " " " self .
_callback ( data ) class AddLF ( Filter ) : def update ( self , data ) : data = data + '
' Filter . update ( self , data ) class AddCRLF ( Filter ) : def update ( self , data ) : data = data + ' \r
' Filter . update ( self , data ) class Foo : def __init__ ( self , dos_mode = False ) : if dos_mode : self .
_filter = AddCRLF ( self .
the_callback ) else : self .
_filter = AddLF ( self .
the_callback ) self .
_filtered_data = list ( ) def update ( self , data ) : self .
_filter .
update ( data ) def the_callback ( self , data ) : self .
_filtered_data .
append ( data ) def all_data ( self ) : return '' . join ( self . _filtered_data )
At a glance , this is n’t an unreasonable design pattern .
If you ’re writing a cross platform tool , or something that needs to listen on a socket and account for variations and flaws in protocol implementations , passing the input through a filter to clean it up is reasonable .
It ’s even somewhat pythonic in that a call - back is used , allowing for various patterns of code re-use and subclassing in both the filters and the consumer .
The usage pattern is something like this : for each chunk of data you receive , call update ( ) , the main class hands the data off to the filter , the filter does its thing , and uses the callback to pass the data back up .
# Many of you will recognize this pattern from crypto digests f = Foo ( ) f . update ( ' asdf ' ) f . update ( ' jklm ' ) print f . all_data ( ) f = None #
At this point ref-counting could have reclaimed the object
Pay attention to that last line : when we assign f = None , under normal circumstances the reference count would hit zero , and all objects should be collected .
Here this is not the case !
Once I realized this region of code was the likely culprit , I started playing with the gc module and its debugging abilities .
Most importantly , using the gc.DEBUG_SAVEALL setting causes the garbage collector to ( instead of completing collection ) store all unreachable objects in a list named gc.garbage .
This can be examined for hints .
import gc , pprint gc .
set_debug ( gc . DEBUG_SAVEALL ) print gc .
get_count ( ) print gc .
collect ( ) pprint .
pprint ( gc . garbage )
Here is the output from that single object creation .
( 249 , 5 , 0 ) 6 [ {' _filter ' : < __main__.AddLF instance at 0x7f23ec3261b8 > , ' _filtered_data ' : [ 'asdf
' , 'jkl ;
']} , < __main__ .
Foo instance at 0x7f23ec326170 > , < bound method Foo.the_callback of < __main__.Foo instance at 0x7f23ec326170 >> , {' _callback ' : < bound method Foo.the_callback of < __main__.Foo instance at 0x7f23ec326170 >>} , < __main__.AddLF instance at 0x7f23ec3261b8 > , [ 'asdf
' , 'jkl ;
' ] ]
You might be able to see the loop already .
We have , left over , a Foo instance , an AddLF instance ( which we know is stored as a member variable of Foo ) , and ( most importantly ) a reference to a bound method on Foo .
This bound method holds a reference back to the Foo instance , completing the cycle .
What the original designer of this code probably did n’t realize is that passing that callback when instantiating a Filter would create that loop ( via the bound instance method , which has a reference to the instance ) .
After a minor refactoring , I ’ve gotten rid of the cycle and reference counts hit zero when the last external reference to a Foo object is eliminated .
Most importantly all the related data is freed as well ; in this case Foo._filtered_data ( which could grow to be very large ) will get freed up as well .
This anti-pattern is only one step away from the simplest case reference cycle , but it had real consequences .
With it gone , memory is managed far more efficiently and this feature is usable in a demanding , high - performance environment .

Ms. Ross had only a limited amount of time to sort through the résumés .
While C. R. England has not been immune to the downturn , it has added significantly to its stable of drivers and continued to hire office staff members to support them .
Ms. Ross was also trying to fill more than two dozen other positions .
The 34 - year - old recruiter decided the fairest approach was simply to start at the beginning , reviewing résumés in the order in which they came in .
When she found a desirable candidate , she called to ask a few preliminary questions , before forwarding the name along to Chris Kelsey , the school ’s director .
When he had a big enough pool to evaluate , she would stop .
Anyone she did not get to was simply out of luck .
She dropped significantly overqualified candidates right away , reasoning that they would leave when the economy improved .
Among them was a former I.B.M. business analyst with 18 years experience ; a former director of human resources ; and someone with a master ’s degree and 12 years at Deloitte & Touche , the accounting firm .
Over the course of four days , Ms. Ross forwarded 61 résumés to Mr. Kelsey , while rejecting 210 others .
The remainder never even got a look .
Many were , in fact , never uploaded to the company ’s internal system because there were too many .

Just before the advertisement was removed , a standard one - page résumé arrived from Tiffany Block , 28 , who lived in nearby Portage and had lost her job four months earlier as an accounts receivable manager at a building company when it closed its Indiana office .
Washington has condemned this assault on all traces of reform - minded opposition and free expression .
It has sensibly done so in measured tones , not wanting to give Mr. Ahmadinejad another excuse to claim that his opponents are agents of the West , and specifically the United States .
Predictably , he has done so anyway .
The viciousness of the current repression is another sign of the government ’s desperation .
But that is no consolation to Iranians at the receiving end of the terror .
Washington is rightly increasing its already substantial efforts to make accurate , uncensored information more widely available through satellite television , radio broadcasts and Internet sites .
Last month , Congress authorized $ 50 million to be spent over the next year on expanded programming , increased transmissions and anti-jamming technology .
An America that stands up for its own values of free , uncensored expression need not worry about the epithets a desperate dictator hurls against it .
We believe that the Obama administration was right to reach out to Iran in an effort to curb its nuclear ambitions .
But we also believe that there have to be limits to that forthcomingness , and time is running out .
After initially agreeing to send much of its current stockpile of low - enriched uranium abroad for conversion into nuclear reactor fuel , Tehran is now backing away .
As long as the centrifuges are spinning , Iran can be expected to drag this on .
Mr. Obama has set a deadline of the end of this year for diplomatic progress on the nuclear issue .
He should keep to that .
If Iran continues to repudiate the exchange deal  which reduces Iran ’s available supply of potential bomb fuel and buys time for further diplomacy  the United States must line up other members of the United Nations Security Council , including Russia and China , for much tougher sanctions .
– SIGHTINGS REPORT –
The Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen is getting precipitously close to it ’s closing remarks , and we ’re now learning what we ’ve already suspected , which is that the best we should hope for from COP15 is just a few pages of a framework to be further negotiated and ratified at the NEXT COP conference …
We would hope !
The irony of making positive forward statements on the effects of Future climate talks , even while a disappointing cause is still unfolding , is further emphasized by the following video fragments …
As World leaders were arriving in Copenhagen on December 17th , we were treated to a decidedly inopportune time for Mother Nature to show us her hand , with a solid covering of up to 10 cm. of heavy snow falling on the city just as the world turned it ’s eyes to Denmark to see how this conference can manage to produce something of value at the 11th Hour .
In a time when legions of dissenters and skeptics are seizing upon every conspiracy imaginable , perhaps this is a chance for Climate Change supporters to suggest that it is the Imperialistic interests of Big Oil and Coal that have seeded this snow for maximum effect !
After all … Russian officials have allegedly claimed that they can prevent snow from falling in Moscow this winter , and China has already had some seriously damaging results from it ’s own efforts to seed precipitation in it ’s drought stricken regions !
While we possibly consider just how far some people will go to assure an orderly progress to establishing a New World ( uhm ) Order … .
Here ’s a quick roundup of some of the other bitter ironies that unfolded during this same 24 hour period :
Let ’s start with a couple of serene and peaceful moments …
… before facing the ironies of fighting against Global Warming , while shoveling through any of the heavier consequences that follow :
CLIMATE NOTE : Denmark has a maritime climate and milder winters than its Scandinavian neighbors .
It has n’t had a white Christmas for 14 years , under the DMI ’s definition , and only had seven last century .
Temperatures today fell as low as minus 4 Celsius ( 25 Fahrenheit ) .
DMI defines a white Christmas as 90 percent of the country being covered by at least 2 centimeters of snow on the afternoon of Dec. 24 .
This blizzard dumped 10 centimeters ( 4 inches ) of snow on the Danish capital overnight .
In this report , we do n’t need to understand the language to grasp the cruel irony of trying to solve Global Warming in a snow covered city .
While peaceful Protesters are being “ managed ” outside , we learned that Connie Hedegaard ( Danish Climate Minister ) has been replaced as President of the COP15 Conference by the Danish Premier .
Although most official news sources carried only a 1 line announcement of this change , we can at least count on The Guardian to provide us with some context , and claims that Ms. Hedegaard was unhappy with the content of the infamous Danish Text which circulated as a 1 - 2 blow of the much ballyhooed ClimateGate scandal .
As you can see in the video below , even in the face of looming setbacks and officially lowered expectations , Ms. Hedegaard ’s unfailing commitment and strength of character on the issues can certainly not be questioned .
So we ’re left to wonder what other ( undisclosed ) facts of this matter might have precipitated her resignation in a diplomatic climate already rife with doubts and negative speculations , and unable to present a face of positive Change to the World .
So long Connie , we barely knew you …
It bears mentioning that Al Gore arrived in Copenhagen during this same period , and we can see that he and his handlers no longer have patience for any “ Inconvenient Truths ” of their own .
The irony of such an obviously trite remark still bears mentioning .
Sorry
Since we ’re on the subject of bitter irony , here ’s one last Truth that simply speaks for itself …
( Even despite the obviously slanted agenda of the source ! )

India has confirmed it worked with China and other emerging nations to ensure there were no legally binding targets from the Copenhagen climate talks .
Facing parliament for the first time since the UN talks last weekend in the Danish capital , Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said India had " come out quite well in Copenhagen " .
He listed what he said were a series of accomplishments , including the thwarting of moves to impose binding targets for global reductions in carbon emissions - something India has always rejected .
" We can be satisfied that we were able to get our way on this issue , " declared Mr Ramesh , who has consistently said India would be one of the countries hardest hit by climate change .
He said India , China , South Africa and Brazil had emerged as a powerful force and said the group had protected its right to continued economic growth .
Mr Ramesh said India would continue to work with its allies " to ensure that the interests of developing countries and India in particular are protected in the course of negotiations in 2010 and beyond " .
He was critical of Denmark 's role as host country .
" From day one , an impression gained ground that a cabal was going to dictate the terms as far as the Copenhagen meeting was concerned , " he said .
British Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband has accused China of hijacking the climate talks .
The Chinese government has denied playing a negative role .
A man walking his dog in Upton Country Park says he saw the incident
Three youths killed a young fawn in Dorset by stamping on it " for a laugh " , a court has heard .
Two 17 - year - olds and a 16 - year - old caught the female baby deer as it waited for its mother in Upton Country Park , on 10 June .
Poole Youth Court heard the teenagers were " egging " each other on .
The teenagers , from Poole , who can not be named for legal reasons , all deny intentionally killing a deer while on land without consent .
They also deny an alternative charge of beating a wild mammal with intent to cause unnecessary suffering .
A post -mortem examination showed the fawn , which was four to six weeks old , suffered several skull fractures , a severed spine and a fractured right leg .
He accepted he had stomped on the fawn 's ribs because he thought it would be fun
Prosecutor Paul Griffin
The teenagers were arrested on 15 June after a police appeal attracted international interest and officers were tipped - off with their names , the court heard .
Prosecuting , Paul Griffin said that one boy swung it by its leg and another karate chopped its head before all three " stomped " it to death .
Reading extracts from their police interviews , he said : " ( one of the 17 - year - olds ) said ' For a laugh break its leg ' .
" The deer was moving , it was trying to escape .
Then they all decided to kill it .
" He admitted that he and ( the other 17 - year - old ) were laughing because ' we thought we were having fun ' .
" He accepted he had stomped on the fawn 's ribs because he thought it would be fun . "
The teenager told police : " I got carried away and was stupid .
I thought it would be a laugh . "
' Karate chopped '
The court heard that the youngest defendant told police he only nudged the fawn once with his foot and did not laugh like the others .
One of the older boys told police the fawn was already injured and they were putting it out of its misery , the court was told .
Dog walker Keith Arthurs , 52 , was so distressed by what he saw he no longer goes to the park .
He told the court : " When I first saw the three youths in the field , I decided then this did n't seem right , that 's when I decided to phone 999 .
" While I was on the phone to the services one of them karate chopped the young fawn across its nose .
" It was still in the other youth 's hands .
His hands were stretched in front of him .
Quite clearly he had an expression on his face of an enjoyment - type expression . "
The trial continues .

The great state of New York has just unveiled a new license plate design .
They 're calling it " Empire Gold , " unlike the current drab white and blue plates that New Yorkers have been affixin ' to their rides since 2001 .
However , 57,000 people have already filed a petition at a website called nonewplates.com .
Already ?
While the new NY plates are n't the best looking we 've ever seen ( black on yellow California plates from the 1950s FTW ) , they are n't that bad .
What gives ?
You , the taxpayer , that 's what .
New Yorkers are required to get the new plates .
And they cost $ 25 .
Want to keep your same license plate number so you do n't have to call and fuss with your insurance company ?
Or let 's say you want to hang onto an existing vanity plate ?
That 's going to cost you an extra $ 20 .
So if you have three vehicles and are happy with your numbers , these new plates will set you back $ 135 .
Out here in the Golden State , we 've tossed people from office ( hello Gray Davis ! ) for similar antics .
Just sayin' .
All in all , the new plate is expected to rake in $ 129 million for the state of NY and they drop in April , just in time for tax season .
OTTAWA : " Thatcher has died , " read the short text message that kicked off a brief diplomatic flurry among members of Canada 's parliament and their advisors at a black tie dinner this week , said local media Thursday .
Upon learning the " news " via Blackberry at a soiree honouring Canadian military families this week , some 2000 shocked Conservatives , said to revere the Iron Lady , and their advisors reportedly huddled to discuss a reaction .
Mistaken identity ... news of Thatcher 's death gave paws .
Credit: AFP
The prime minister 's office called Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing Street to confirm that Margaret Thatcher had indeed passed away -- baffling British officials , CanWest News Service said .
It turned out the message was sent by Canadian Transport Minister John Baird from his home in Toronto to a person at the gala dinner to say his beloved 16 - year - old gray tabby cat , named for Margaret Thatcher , 84 , had died .
The recipient then forwarded it to others .
A spokesman for Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's office was not immediately available for comment .

Mel Gibson pleaded no contest to the drink - driving charges in 2006
Mel Gibson 's conviction in 2006 for drink - driving has been expunged from his record , it has been confirmed .
The Oscar winner 's lawyer requested the dismissal after the star successfully completed the terms of his probation .
The star had been ordered to perform public service work and attend Alcoholics Anonymous for three years .
Gibson 's arrest sparked outrage after a leaked police report quoted him making anti-Semitic comments to the arresting officer in California , who was Jewish .
He has since repeatedly apologised for the remarks , saying his outburst did not reflect his true views .
Gibson had pleaded no contest to driving 87 mph ( 140 km / h ) with an open bottle of tequila in his hand .
He also had a 0.12 percent blood alcohol content , where the legal limit in California is 0.08 .
As a first - time drink - driving offender , Gibson was eligible to have his conviction expunged after fulfilling his probation and maintaining a clean driving licence .
Although it has been removed , the conviction could still expose the actor to more serious charges if he is ever arrested again for driving under the influence .
Gibson did not appear at the Los Angeles Superior Court for the ruling .
The Secret - Spiritual Cinema
A review by Yoga instructor Julian Walker [ 1 ]
OK .
So .
I just finally got around to watching the whole of this movie that has such buzz in the spiritual community .
Yoga teachers are talking about .
My friend is at a massage school where the teacher 's are suggesting that the class watch it together .
Another friend is in a graduate course for Somatic Psychology where the professors think it is an important piece of spiritual cinema ......
Oprah on Larry King talks about The Secret I 've held out for a while , but finally I thought I 'd see what all the fuss was about .
Why have I held out you might ask ?
Two reasons .
The first has just three words :
What the Bleep .
Perhaps you 've heard of it ?
It 's that popular spiritual movie funded by the female cult leader who claims to channel a 35,000 year old warrior king from Lemuria ( little old red flag for ya there .. ) and produced by her ( his ? ) students .
This film takes bad interpretations of quantum physics , puts them alongside junk science claims of water and it's ability to retain the " energy of thoughts " and then drives towards all sorts of misguided spiritual and psychological conclusions that leave it 's audience more confused and ignorant about spirituality , science and the relationship between the two than when they first sat down .... presumably scratching their heads and saying " what the bleep ? "
My second reason , you innocently ask ?
Well that 's a little more complicated and has to do with my having been around the spiritual community my entire adult life and being perennially surprised , amused and infuriated with what people call " spiritual " and with the naivete , superficiality and gullibility of most " spiritual " people , as well as the basically banal nature of the material that gets recycled and marketed to it 's willing consumers year after year .
The Secret takes the cake though .
Seriously .
Let 's begin at the beginning :
The Drama
The movie starts with a dramatization .
A sexy / disheveled aging blond Australian lady is clearly having a rough time - her father has died , her relationships are a mess , she has worked herself to exhaustion .
Then she opens her suitcase and sees book .
A post - it note on the cover says " Mom , this will help xxox ... "
Whatever could it be ?
It turns out ( the montage tells us ) that she is holding in her hands a glimpse of the ancient secret that has been passed down through secret societies along the ages , that people have persecuted and killed for , the knowledge that the power elite have used to keep the masses oppressed and that was known by everyone from Emerson to Shakespeare to Plato to Lincoln to Hugo to Newton to Beethoven !
No hint as to how her daughter or son happened to slide this precious information into her suitcase ...
In her mind 's eye we see Romans and Egyptians , Templar Knights , priests , scheming white cigar - smoking men in boardrooms , all passing the secret document back and forth , chasing it , hiding it - presumably until one of them passed it off on the troubled Australian lady 's child ?
Secrets of the Secret Finally , in a breathless climactic moment , she is lying on her bed , head flung back , - a tight shot of her face , eyes closed , lips glossy as she earnestly and not a little seductively asks " Why does n't anyone know this ? "
After another exhausting rapid research project , our short - lived Australian heroine has found those among us who know the secret today and leaves us now in their able hands .
Pretty exciting , huh ?
What could the ancient secret knowledge be ?
So mysterious .
So powerful .
Who are these modern teachers of the ancient mystery , the wise ones who are the contemporary bearers of the secret knowledge ?
The Masters of The Secret
The set combines beautiful backdrops with state - of - the - art computer graphics , and each speaker has their name in both typeset font and signature form at the bottom of the screen , along with a title that , we assume , qualifies them to be speaking .
Their titles range from " philosopher " to " author " to " quantum physicist " to " writer " to " visionary " to " entrepreneur " to my personal favorite - " feng shui consultant . "
Only one of the " writer / authors " is well known and has his book " Chicken Soup for the Soul " included in the computer graphic backdrop behind him .
One can only assume that none of the others actually have published anything - nonetheless they are writers or authors who are in on " The Secret . "
One of the speakers with the title " philosopher " appears by the letters after his name to be a chiropractor with a degree in science .
OK ...
But while their titles and qualifications may vary , on one thing they are all resolutely in agreement , and this is the ancient secret , shrouded in mystery , repressed , hidden , revered by the best minds of history .
Finally available and delivered by this coalition of the brilliant and the brave .
Are you ready ?
The Secret
Your thoughts determine your experience .
Shocking , is n't it ?
That 's right , you create your own reality .
I know , I know it 's complicated and deep , but we have decoded the golden thread of all the secret ancient wisdom traditions and the knowledge that made Emerson , Shakespeare , Newton et al such great men , and this is it !
The movie goes on to suggest , through well - made video dramatizations and repetitive rhetoric that " the Law of Attraction " is at work all the time responding to your thoughts and your feelings , serving up from the universe whatever you are putting out there .
For example :
That parking ticket , those bills and piling up debt , your cancer , gay people who are harassed by homophobes , lonely folks who can't get a date and so on ... all of these are without exception manifestations of bad thoughts .
If you are focusing on not wanting to be late as you drive to work - guess what , you will be !
If you think about your bike being stolen and are extra careful to lock it up tight - it 'll be stolen .
But if you visualize that rock - star parking in front of the store you need to go to - it will be there !
If you focus on how stressed out you are about your credit card bills - guess what , you 'll only create more debt !
Current Affair expose on one of the people from The Secret
If you spend time thinking about your cancer it will be more likely to kill you and even better , if you just focus on good things , watch funny movies and feel good after your diagnosis , it could take just three months to completely destroy the tumor - hey it did for this lady ...
then there 's the little boy dying of a rare form of hepatitis .
Full recovery because his family ordered up some extra special " gratitude rocks " from one of our " writers ..... "
What 's more all of this has been proven by science .
Cool , huh ?
Not really .
The Problems
The film uses authoritative names , meaningless titles / qualifications , very badly constructed arguments , category errors , logical fallacies etc ..
scientific seeming images that then never go anywhere to strengthen it 's points , and examples / case histories that are anecdotal at best .
And the matter - of - fact " scientific proof " is alluded to by various graphics , impressive looking images of experimental scenarios , and vague verbal references , but never really appears .
What you may ask could be wrong with a hopeful , inspiring film that empowers people to use their minds ?
Well how about the little boy who focuses hard enough on the bicycle so that he gets it ?
Or the young woman who gazes with just the right combination of longing and belief through the jewelry store window until a man magically appears to give it to her ?
How about that woman who cured her breast cancer by laughing ?
Or the little boy in South Africa who magically recovered from near fatal rare hepatitis because his father had gratitude rocks from California delivered to the door ?
How about Jack Canfield implying that he made a million dollars on his first book because he used the Law of Attraction - ie he thought about it a lot ?
How about the assertion that by protesting , say , the war in Iraq , you only perpetuate it by giving it your focus ?
We see a " case history " of a young gay man who is depressed , picked on , constantly humiliated by homophobic co-workers and street thugs .
No more once he applies the secret .
Done .
Expose on the Law of Attraction
In fact the audience at a comedy club cheers his proclamation of being " such an incredibly gay man ... "
Nice .
He is happy and everyone magically either accepts and supports his homosexuality or , - get this - transfers out of his office - so strong is his intention !
You see the makers of The Secret want us to believe that if your mental focus is strong enough and the intentional " joy " in your being is brimming over enough , everything will happen as you want it too .
That 's the highest spiritual truth and the secret to life .
We see scenes from a brutally dysfunctional relationship .
Shoving , yelling , faces contorted in anger and hurt .
The solution ?
Write down what you appreciate about your abusive partner and watch them transform before your eyes to match the energy you are magnetizing them with !
They assure us that the reason a tiny percentage of the world 's population has so much of the wealth is because they know this secret .
Never mind social conditions .
Never mind racism , homophobia , colonialism , world history , psychology , trauma , economic oppression .
Everyone , absolutely everyone could be wealthy , happy and in love if they just knew how to use the Law of Attraction .
Um , what does that mean for people who are not happy , wealthy or in the perfect relationship ?
Well , for lesson number two - see lesson number one .
You 're just not doing it right , silly .
Of course we never hear about the implied ( and clearly flimsy ) connection to the list of historical luminaries .
You should have seen Shakespeare park that horse exactly where he wanted to on opening night ....
Beethoven - died in the black .
Deaf , but solvent - right ?
Newton - never got sick .
Friends , this is not a recipe for anything but a frontal lobotomy .
This is not high spiritual truth passed down through the ages , it 's narcissistic delusion , bordering on the psychotic , plugged into the akashic records by a tinfoil hat .
It is a complete abdication of depth in favor of a supremely superficial analysis of life .
It is a marvelous example of everything wrong with the new age movement and is so insulting of the true nature of suffering , so ignorant of the realities of privilege and oppression , so authoritative in it 's endorsement magical thinking and judgment of those who are not doing it right as to set any nascent spiritual development and self - awareness back a good 5 to 10 years .
So what is the real secret ?
An Intelligent Path
Well there are really three broad areas that need attention , and this movie beautifully illustrates why :
1 ) Critical Thinking
Gotta have it .
Without it spirituality is filled with the unicorns of childhood fantasy and the poison kool - aid of manipulation and dishonesty .
In order to have critical thinking one needs healthy rational development .
Educating the mind by studying actual philosophy , psychology , literature and art that grapples with the universal spiritual themes that great minds have been expressing since at least the ancient Greeks .
A healthy dose of critical thinking will cut through the kind of nonsense these kinds of popular spiritual vehicles are selling .
It will also allow one to side step the very real suffering and delusion that comes from buying into very , very poor interpretations of spiritual reality like these .
Rest assured , if The Secret and What The Bleep sound like deep truth to you , there is either a complete lack of critical thinking , or you have become convinced of the fallacious spiritual argument which says that critical thinking is the enemy of spirituality .
Not so .
Critical thinking is the enemy of false spirituality .
It is the trusted ally of authentic adult spirituality .

2 ) Your Shadow is your Friend
Contrary to superficial and fragmenting prescriptions like those offered by What the Bleep and The Secret , the instruction here is to actually work with your shadow material and learn from it .
Your so called " negative emotions " have value and meaning .
They are communications from your psyche .
Be curious about them .
Compassionate .
Follow a path of inquiry into what lies beneath the surface of your reactions , fears , anger - triggers , unsatisfied feelings , sadness etc .
The way to be free of these is to embrace them and listen to what they might be telling you about your shadow - the part of you that you have disowned and disconnected from .
Working with and ultimately integrating shadow material through a process that takes you beneath the surface into the actual meaning that your triggers have for you is the way toward ending self - sabotage , not just trying desperately to impose a junta of " good thoughts " on your mind from the outside in ...
3 ) Spiritual Practice
Spiritual practice is absolutely distinct from spiritual beliefs or ideas .
Spiritual ideas might give you a map of the territory in preparation for and in analyzing the experience of spiritual practice .
Spiritual beliefs are usually best left alone as they tend to hinder authentic inquiry which is at the heart of spiritual practice .
Spiritual practices actually require that you do the work .
That you sit down and meditate .
That you start a yoga practice .
That you journal .
That you dance your demons and shake your Buddha .
That you be present to your emotions , your body , your mental patterns and learn the art of self observation , introspection and that most harrowing of skills - honest communication .
Spiritual practice requires that you turn to face your shadow .
That you get real about your social conditioning , your political situation , the distinction between what you have power over and what has power over you .
Spiritual practice is inspiring , but it 's also deeply humbling .
It does not tell you that you can have anything , be anything , do anything , without limit .
Sorry .
That 's the kind of fantasy high the Secret promises - and the hangover is a real drag .
But real practice does give you tools and resources to deal with the inevitable disasters , disappointments and struggles that make up every human life .
And this is perhaps what is most problematic about the ideas promoted by movies like The Secret .
Most likely the audience is looking for some real tools , looking for some real practices , techniques and resources to help make sense of life and it's complexities , to help them to grow and feel supported .
Yet what these ideas offer is a short lived illusory hope that fades to reveal only one area of deepening - that of denial , fragmentation and self - judgment .
The Ethical Problem
Not too much searching online reveals that the movie is part of an elaborate advertising campaign to get people interested in working with the various " teachers " it features .
Just like
What the Bleep is a recruitment vehicle for Ramtha 's School of Enlightenment , The Secret is an infomercial for it 's talking heads .
On a purely business level - brilliant .
Too bad this is the last thing it 's target audience actually needs .
1 ) The movie suggests something impossible - not only are there millions of other people out there with their own agendas / intentions , but there are also multiple variables that are not even remotely influence - able at the level of conscious intention - no matter how admittedly valuable a positive attitude might be .
2 ) Gullible and desperate people will try really hard to apply the " Law of Attraction " .
They will have some success with it because intention has a certain amount of impact .
They will have a lot of failure with it , because it is nonsense .
I already know of a few people who are watching the movie obsessively to try and master it 's bogus teachings .
See here for the recent New York Times article on magical thinking , it 's harmless prevalence and problematic implications as a worldview .
3 ) the ones with money will buy the book , attend the events , and contact the teachers for help on perfecting their skills , which of course is , by definition impossible , so they will have a captive audience .
The dynamic described by the above three points is " The Secret " to these hucksters making a mint !
The statement was released in response to widespread reports that the Russian government recalled copies of the game from retailers and placed a ban on future sales .
It was reported that Russian officals reacted with hostility to a level in the game in which the player takes control of a member of a terrorist group and guns down unarmed civilians at a Russian airport .
Russian video game fans and politicians were said to have criticised the game for its portrayal of Russia as the aggressors in the game 's campaign mode .
In the game , Russia attacks the United States after ultra-nationalists take control of the country .
Then and Now
When I was a child I was told by my father that his entire family perished in Auschwitz .
To this day I could not comprehend such a horror .
It was confirmed to me recently that my family was transported from their village in Slovakia to Auschwitz and never returned home .
This confirmation 60 years after the fact was still difficult to comprehend , but it was real .
The State of Israel was founded on this suffering .
A state founded out of guilt , but the wrong ‘ party ’ is suffering today for that guilt .
The Palestinians were not the ones who slaughtered the Jews of Eastern Europe , yet they are the ones being slaughtered today by the zionists .
The FACT that this is denied by so many people is sickening .
Since its inception , the State of Israel has had on its agenda the systematic destruction of not only the Palestinian Nation , but of the Palestinian people themselves .
The same guilt that founded the State has turned a blind eye to this and has allowed it to continue .
I never considered myself to be a ‘ Holocaust Jew ’ .
I never cried that ‘ we suffered therefore we deserve special treatment ’… , but the truth remains , that we did suffer .
I am really getting sick and tired of those that constantly deny this , especially when these denials come from Jews themselves .
I am sick and tired also of those Jews that have ‘ cashed in on this suffering ’ through books movies and lectures .
Organisations have been established under the guise of ‘ nazi hunters ’ , they have proven to be one of the most successful branches of the ‘ Holocaust Industry ’ .
Instead of the crying or cashing in on the past , I decided at a very young age to live the mantra of ‘ Never Again ’ … .
TO ANYONE .
In midlife I chose to move to Israel to do what I could to make sure the Holocaust against the Palestinian people stops .
What happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe does not give a green light for them to do the same to others ..
Gaza Freedom March .
This is what the Holocaust should have ‘ produced ’ as an ‘ industry ’ , an industry that does not allow a repetition of the past … .
NEVER AGAIN !
Seeing a survivor of those horrors struggle against today ’s evils is truly an inspiration .
I am speaking of Hedy Epstein , who as I write this , is on her way to Gaza to take part in the .
This is what the Holocaust should have ‘ produced ’ as an ‘ industry ’ , an industry that does not allow a repetition of the past … .
As we approach the first anniversary of the war in Gaza , known as ‘ Operation Cast Lead ’ , the State of Israel should be hanging its head in shame for the world to see .
Instead , they deny that there were any wrongdoings on their part ….
another form of Holocaust denial .
And again , the world looks silently by despite the UN reports , the soldier ’s testimonies , the FACTS exposing the war crimes against the people of Palestine .
Photos showing the horrors faced by European Jewry in the 40’s and the horrors the Palestinians are facing TODAY are available for all to see … .
just click HERE .
The similarities are frightening .
WHY IS THE WORLD ALLOWING THIS TO CONTINUE ?
STOP THE HOLOCAUST AGAINST PALESTINE NOW !!
Cloning Pong Part 2
This write up is part two of cloning pong , we will modify the pong game we created in part one , to be able to control it with knobs , like the original using Arduino .
Looks like HTML5 Video tag did not work you can download the video here .
To get Java communicate via Serial Port there are two options , JavaComm API and rxtx API .
Arduino uses rxtx so I went with that .
Navigate to you Arduino installation folder , for Mac OS X navigate into the Arduino. app ,
open / Applications / Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java/
From the folder copy ,
RXTXcomm.jar
librxtxSerial.jnilib
to somewhere on your classpath .
Do not compile rxtx yourself , when I compiled it manually and put it on my classpath , Arduino IDE could not connect to the board , use the one supplied with your IDE , Mac OS X users make sure you are using 32 bit Java 1.5.0 otherwise you will get class not found exceptions .
Open Arduino IDE and make a note of your serial port name , on my machine its ,
( def arduino - port " /dev/tty.usbserial-A6008nhh " )
In order to open the serial port for I / O we need to get a port identifier from the API ,
( defn port- identifier [ ] ( let [ ports ( CommPortIdentifier / getPortIdentifiers ) ] ( loop [ port ( .nextElement ports ) name ( .get Name port ) ] ( if ( = name arduino - port ) port ( recur ( .nextElement ports ) ( .getName port ) ) ) ) ) )
Using the identifier we can open the port for I/O , make sure baud rates match between Clojure and Arduino ,
( defn open - port [ ] ( doto ( .open ( port- identifier ) " pong " 10000 ) ( .setSerialPortParams 9600 SerialPort / DATABITS_8 SerialPort / STOPBITS_1 SerialPort / PARITY_NONE ) ) )
Now everything is set to read from the port ,
( defn poll - port [ p ] ( with - open [ in ( BufferedReader .
( InputStreamReader . ( .getInputStream p ) ) ) ] ( .readLine in ) ) )
Arduino will map knob reading between 0 and board size and will send coordinate pairs every 50 milliseconds , when poll - port is called , it will return ,
" 100:200 "
meaning player one is at y 100 and player two is at y 200 .
We modify move - player function to check serial for input , parse the coordinates returned and set the player positions accordingly ,
( defn move - player [ coords player ] ( try ( let [ p1-y ( BigInteger .
( first ( re-split # " : " coords ) ) ) p1-x ( :x ( :1 @player ) ) p1-src ( : src ( :1 @player ) ) p2-y ( BigInteger .
( second ( re-split # " : " coords ) ) ) p2-x ( :x ( : 2 @player ) ) p2-src ( : src ( :2 @player ) ) ] ( dosync ( alter player merge {:1 { :x p1-x :y p1-y :src p1-src } :2 { :x p2-x :y p2-y : src p2-src}} ) ) ) ( catch Exception e ) ) )
Because we do n't listen for key inputs anymore , we need to modify actionPerformed call and move players before every repaint ,
( actionPerformed [ e ] ( move- player ( poll - port serial ) player ) ( move - ball ball ) ( wall - collision ball player ) ( player - collision ball player ) ( .repaint this ) )
Thats all the modification needed in our pong game .
Code for the Arduino is even simpler ,
const int boardheight = 400 ; const int p1 Potpin = 0 ; const int p2 Potpin = 1 ; void setup ( ) { Serial.begin( 9600 ) ; } void loop ( ) { int p1 = analogRead ( p1Potpin ) ; int p2 = analogRead ( p2Potpin ) ; Serial.print ( map( p1,0,1024,0,400 ) ) ; Serial.print ( " : " ) ; Serial.println(map(p2,0,1024,0,400 ) ) ; delay ( 50 ) ; }
We just read read the potentiometers every 50 milliseconds , map the reading between 0 and board height and write it to serial .
Hardware setup looks like the following , fritzing project is also available check below for a list of files .
The movie studies have won another major legal victory in the ongoing war against file sharing , this one against an individual ( Gary Fung ) who ran a number of torrent search sites , including the popular is oHunt .
Although the defendant had argued he was providing just another search engine , the judge has ruled that Fung 's legal team had neglected to rebut the studio's primary arguments , and Fung himself had a history of statements showing that he encouraged copyright infringement .
Although the ruling establishes liability , there 's no word yet on the sanctions that Fung will face .
Granting a summary judgement requires that the judge interpret all the arguments in favor of the losing party , and still find that their opponents have made a winning case , so it 's a pretty difficult standard to meet .
Fung and his lawyers , however , seem to have made the job a bit easier .
" The material facts supporting Plaintiffs ' claims are almost wholly unrebutted , " the judge Stephen Wilson ruled .
" Generally , Defendants ' rest their case on legal arguments and meritless evidentiary objections , and offer little of their own evidence that directly addressed Plaintiffs ’ factual assertions . "
So , for example , the studios brought in expert witnesses to argue that a statistical sampling of the content and server logs showed that nearly all of the content infringed copyrights , and about half of the downloads were made within the US .
The defendants dismissed statistical sampling as " junk science , " but did n't bother bringing in any sort of expert witness to explain why it was n't a valid approach , or was n't widely accepted by statisticians .
( Admittedly , it is widely accepted , so this would have been hard . )
The arguments that Fung 's sites were just another search engine that happened to pick up copyrighted content were torpedoed by a combination of the sites themselves and Fung 's own words .
Evidence was introduced that the search code was specifically tuned to find copyrighted material : " Defendant Fung additionally directs the program to specific web pages containing terms like ' seinfeld - videos , ' which one would infer contains infringing content from the television show Seinfeld . "
One of his sites also displayed a list of the top - 20 grossing movies in the US , with links to copies of each , while another had categories that included " High Quality DVD Rips " and " TV Show Releases . "
Fung caused problems for himself via his blog , which contained entries questioning whether copyright infringement was really theft , and offered advice on how to find movies and prepare the files for burning to DVDs .
He also admitted to using his own site to obtain episodes of Lost , The Simpsons , and The Lord of the Rings .
As a result , Judge Wilson dismissed the search engine arguments as little more than a distraction , and treated the case as if it were the son of Grokster .
" Defendants ' technology is nothing more than old wine in a new bottle , " Wilson wrote , elsewhere noting that " The Fung sites are an evolutionary modification of traditional ' peer - to - peer ' sharing sites such as Napster and Grokster . "
( Designed might be more accurate , although the degree of intelligence involved is a bit questionable . )
Fung 's lawyers were even schooled for using an argument that the Supremes had explicitly rejected in the Grokster case .
So , Fung 's sites were clearly being used for infringement , Fung himself was fully aware of it , and legal precedent pretty clearly indicates that the sites meet the criteria established for inducing infringement .
The last hurdle for a summary judgement seemed to be the Fung team 's argument that a lot of the content on the sites was automatically generated in response to user queries , and thus should fall under the DMCA 's safe harbor provision , which absolves service providers from liability for content posted by their users .
That , however , ignores the text of the safe harbor provision itself , which Judge Wilson quotes : " upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness [ of infringing material ] , acts expeditiously to remove , or disable access to , the material . "
Fung did nothing of the sort .
It 's not clear whether Fung intends to appeal , but any appeal would have to deal with the legal record in the case , and the decision makes it clear that there 's a huge body of unrebutted evidence that will be difficult to overcome .
All that seems to be left at this point is a decision on sanctions .
The judge has scheduled a status conference for the case in early January .

What version of Perl 5 is necessary to run this example ?
say $ message ;
It depends .
The obvious answer is any version newer than 5.10 , at least if you use feature ': say ' ; or use 5.010 ; .
It can also be Perl 5.6 or 5.8 , if you use Perl6 : : Say .
What version of Perl 5 is necessary to run this example ?
sub foo { state $ foo = shift ; say $ foo ; } foo ( 100 ) ; foo ( 200 ) ; foo ( 400 ) ; foo ( 800 ) ;
Again , the obvious answer is any version newer than 5.10 , but I can imagine having written code something like this for Perl 5.6 or 5.8 :
my $ foo ; my @lexicals ; sub state : lvalue { push @lexicals , \( my $ foo ) ; ${ $ lexicals [ - 1 ] } = shift ; return $ lexicals [ - 1 ] ; }
The semantics are n't exactly the same , but that 's the point .
The syntax is similar enough that you can't reliably read the code and determine to which Perl 5 version the original author wrote !
This problem comes up over and over when someone proposes adding a new keyword to Perl 5 .
The likelihood that someone wrote Perl 5 code with this syntax is vanishingly low :
class Foo extends Bar { ... }
... but it 's not entirely impossible .
There is no general purpose heuristic by which the Perl 5 parser can determine the appropriate version of the Perl 5 syntax to use to parse any given piece of code .
( That 's not a problem specific to Perl 5 , but I 'm only talking about the Perl language family now . )
No one wants to break existing code .
Yet if there 's value to adding new features , there are only a few possibilities to find a balance between adding new features which may conflict with existing programs and not adding new features .
The current Perl 5 approach prefers to maintain existing programs unchanged .
It 's possible to take code written for Perl 1 ( and last modified in 1987 ) and run it unmodified on Perl 5.11.2 , released last month .
I repeat , unmodified .
In other words , given a Perl 5 program which does not specifically declare the intended version of the Perl 5 syntax and ( more important ) keyword set , the Perl 5 parser prefers the oldest available keyword set .
( Of course , any syntax which was impossible in older versions and is now available in newer versions may be available ... but that does n't require modifications to existing programs . )
That 's not likely to change soon , if ever in Perl 5 , and I can understand that policy especially given its two - decade history .
That does suggest changing how the Perl 5 community thinks about writing new code and modifying existing code under active development .
I 'll write more about that next time .
Norman E. Borlaug , the plant scientist who did more than anyone else in the 20th century to teach the world to feed itself and whose work was credited with saving hundreds of millions of lives , died Saturday night .
He was 95 and lived in Dallas .
The cause was complications from cancer , said Kathleen Phillips , a spokeswoman for Texas AM University , where Borlaug had served on the faculty since 1984 .
Borlaug ’s advances in plant breeding led to spectacular success in increasing food production in Latin America and Asia and brought him international acclaim .
In 1970 , he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .
He was widely described as the father of the broad agricultural movement called the Green Revolution , though decidedly reluctant to accept the title .
“ A miserable term , ” he said , characteristically shrugging off any air of self - importance .
Yet his work had a far - reaching impact on the lives of millions of people in developing countries .
His breeding of high - yielding crop varieties helped to avert mass famines that were widely predicted in the 1960s , altering the course of history .
Largely because of his work , countries that had been food deficient , such as Mexico and India , became self - sufficient in producing cereal grains .
“ More than any other single person of this age , he has helped provide bread for a hungry world , ” the Nobel committee said in presenting him with the Peace Prize .
“ We have made this choice in the hope that providing bread will also give the world peace . ”
The day the award was announced , Borlaug , vigorous and slender at 56 , was working in a wheat field outside Mexico City when his wife , Margaret , drove up to tell him the news .
“ Someone ’s pulling your leg , ” he replied , according to one of his biographers , Leon Hesser .
Assured that it was true , he kept on working , saying he would celebrate later .
The Green Revolution eventually came under attack from environmental and social critics who said it had created more difficulties than it had solved .
Borlaug responded that the real problem was not his agricultural techniques , but the runaway population growth that had made them necessary .
“ If the world population continues to increase at the same rate , we will destroy the species , ” he declared .
Traveling to Norway , the land of his ancestors , to receive the award , he warned the Nobel audience that the struggle against hunger had not been won .
“ We may be at high tide now , but ebb tide could soon set in if we become complacent and relax our efforts , ” he said .
Twice more in his lifetime , in the 1970s and again in 2008 , those words would prove prescient as food shortages and high prices caused global unrest .
‘A HERO , ’ U CHIEF SAYS
Borlaug initially studied forestry at the University of Minnesota during the Great Depression .
Influenced by E.C. Stakman , a professor in the department of plant pathology , Borlaug changed his area of study and went on to receive his doctoral degree in plant pathology in the 1930s .
University of Minnesota President Robert Bruininks called Borlaug one of the university ’s most distinguished alumni .
Borlaug , he said , was “ a scientist , educator , humanitarian and Nobel laureate whose work made him a hero around the world .
“ From his early wheat research in Mexico to his ongoing advocacy for modern farming practices and policy , he saw the human face of hunger in the world and never strayed from his principles . ”
Borlaug ’s big breakthrough was through his work in developing a variety of rust - resistant wheat .
His legacy lives on at the University of Minnesota .
Faculty in the university ’s department of pathology and the U.S. Department of Agriculture continue research into developing resistance in wheat and barley to a newer aggressive fungus discovered in Uganda in 1999 , which has spread to parts of the Middle East .
It ’s the same rust that caused problems in the middle of the century and the one Borlaug developed resistant varieties against , said Carol Ishimaru , head of the university ’s department of plant pathology .
In most places in the world , these resistant varieties have held up for the past 50 years .
But the world developed complacency in putting new resources into this type of research , Ishimaru said , and now the newer more aggressive strains of rust are gaining ground .
“ In recent years , he was an advocate for a refocusing of our interests into resistance breeding on an international scale . ”
Borlaug ’s career had a single concentration .
“ He became focused entirely on doing something about alleviating hunger , and he ’s never changed on that path , ” Ishimaru said .
Sadly , his name is not well known outside of the scientific community .
“ Dr. Borlaug in his work is not well known , and that is the biggest travesty of all , that his work is not known by every grade school child and high school student .
It ’s our challenge as the next generation of scientists to carry on his work and make sure that the next generation and generations after that know and appreciate the work that he did . ”
Aside from the wheat breeding program his work grew from , at the university his names lives on .
Borlaug Hall is the largest building on the university ’s agriculture - centered St. Paul campus .
In 2007 , the department of plant pathology established the Norman E. Borlaug Fellowship for International Agriculture , which allows graduate fellows a chance to study in underdeveloped countries .
His Nobel Prize was the culmination of a storied life in agriculture that began when he was a boy growing up on an Iowa farm , wondering why plants grew better in some places than others .
His was also an unlikely career path , one that began in earnest near the end of World War II , when Borlaug walked away from a promising job at DuPont , the chemical company , to take a position in Mexico trying to help farmers improve their crops .
The job was part of an assault on hunger in Mexico that was devised in Manhattan , at the offices of the Rockefeller Foundation , with political support in Washington .
But it was not a career choice calculated to lead to fame or honor .
Indeed , on first seeing the situation in Mexico for himself , Borlaug reacted with near despair .
Mexican soils were depleted , the crops were ravaged by disease , yields were low and the farmers could not feed themselves , much less improve their lot by selling surplus .
“ These places I ’ve seen have clubbed my mind — they are so poor and depressing , ” he wrote to his wife after his first extended sojourn in the country .
“ I do n’t know what we can do to help these people , but we ’ve got to do something . ”
The next few years were ones of toil and privation as Borlaug and his colleagues , with scant funding or equipment , set to work improving yields in tropical crop varieties .
He spent countless hours hunched over in the blazing Mexican sun as he manipulated tiny wheat blossoms to cross different strains .
THE SOUND OF WHEAT
To speed the work , he set up winter and summer operations in far - flung parts of Mexico , logging thousands of miles over poor roads .
He battled illness , forded rivers in flood , dodged mudslides and sometimes slept in tents .
He was by then a trained scientist holding a doctoral degree in plant diseases .
But as he sought to coax better performance from the wheats of Mexico , he relied on a farm boy ’s instinctive feel for the plants and the soil in which they grew .
“ When wheat is ripening properly , when the wind is blowing across the field , you can hear the beards of the wheat rubbing together , ” he told another biographer , Lennard Bickel .
“ They sound like the pine needles in a forest .
It is a sweet , whispering music that once you hear , you never forget . ”

Three alleged members of the hacker gang Kryogeniks were hit with a federal conspiracy charge Thursday for a 2008 stunt that replaced Comcast 's homepage with a shout - out to other hackers .
Prosecutors identified Christopher Allen Lewis , 19 , and James Robert Black Jr. , 20 , as the hackers " EBK " and " Defiant , " known for hijacking Comcast 's domain name in May of last year – a prank that took down the cable giant 's homepage and webmail service for more than five hours , and allegedly cost the company over $ 128,000 .
Visitors to Comcast.net had been redirected to a simple page reading " KRYOGENIKS EBK and DEFIANT RoXed COMCAST sHouTz To VIRUS Warlock elul21 coll1er seven . "
A third man , Michael Paul Nebel , 28 , was also charged with helping the duo , though his alleged handle " Slacker " was not credited in the defacement message .
As described in the indictment ( .pdf ) , the hackers got control of the domain with two phone calls , and an e-mail sent to the company 's domain registrar , Network Solutions , from a hacked Comcast e-mail account .
That gave them entry to the Network Solutions control panel for Comcast 's 200 domains .
In an interview the day after the attack , Defiant and EBK told Threat Level that they did n't initially set out to redirect the site 's traffic .
Instead , they merely changed the contact information for the Comcast .
net domain to Defiant ’s e-mail address ; for the street address , they used the " Dildo Room " at " 69 Dick Tard Lane . "
Then , the hackers said , they contacted Comcast ’s original technical contact at his home number to tell him what they ’d done .
It was only when the Comcast manager scoffed at their claim and hung up on them , that EBK decided to take the more drastic measure of redirecting the site ’s traffic to servers under the hackers ' control .
" I was trying to say we should n’t do this the whole damn time , " said Defiant last year .
" But once we were in , " added EBK , " it was , like , fuck it . "
The indictment confirms that the hackers phoned the Comcast official at home .
In the interview last year , the hackers expressed some shock over the attention the attack garnered .
" The situation has kind of blown up here , a lot bigger than I thought it would , " said Defiant , who said he was 19 years old , and that his first name was James .
" I wish I was a minor right now because this is going to be really bad . "

The paper battery can be rolled up tightly with no adverse effects Batteries made from plain copier paper could make for future energy storage that is truly paper thin .
The approach relies on the use of carbon nanotubes - tiny cylinders of carbon - to collect electric charge .
While small - scale nanotube batteries have been demonstrated before , the plain paper approach lends itself to making larger devices more cheaply .
The work , published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , could lead to " paintable " energy storage .
Because of its structure of millions of tiny , interconnected fibres , paper is a good candidate to hold on to carbon nanotubes , providing a scaffold on which to build devices .
However , paper is also mechanically tough , and can be bent , curled or folded , more than the metal or plastic surfaces that are currently used or under development .
Good on paper A team of researchers at Stanford University started with off - the - shelf copier paper , painting it with an " ink " made of carbon nanotubes .
The coated paper is then dipped in lithium - containing solutions and an electrolyte to provide the chemical reaction that generates a battery 's electric current .
Electric cars could benefit from the batteries ' quick energy bursts
The paper acts to collect the electric charge from the reaction .
Using paper in this way could reduce the weight of batteries , typically made with metal current collectors , by 20 % .
The team 's batteries are also capable of releasing their stored energy quickly .
That is a valuable characteristic for applications that need quick bursts of energy , such as electric vehicles - although the team has no immediate plans to develop vehicle batteries .
Liangbing
Hu , lead author on the research , said the most important aspect of the demonstration was that paper is an inexpensive and well - understood material - making wider usage of the technology more likely .
" Standard copier paper used in our everyday life can be a solution in storing energy in a more efficient and cheap way , " Dr Hu told BBC News .
" The experienced technology developed in the paper industry over a century can be transferred to improve the process and performance of these paper - based devices . "
The team says that adaptations to the technique in the future could allow for simply painting the nanotube ink and active materials onto surfaces such as walls .
They have even experimented with a number of textiles , paving the way for batteries made largely of cloth .

What I LOVE about this quote is that it flies in the face if the Rahm strategy , which states that only Conservative candidates can win in reddish districts .
I think that idea SUCKS >
It undermines our ideas , and we as Democrats , progressive , liberal or moderates , would be better served by selling our ideas as BETTER than Conservative ideas , NOT as acceptable enough for Conservative ideas .
The fallacy of the be more like Conservatives idea that Rahm sells and the Bush Blue Dog / ConservaDems enact bites us in the ass when we try to differentiate ourselves before the American voter .
e need to be BETTER than Republicans , in our ideas , in our standards and in our candidates , not acceptable .
Fer Chris Sakes !
BACHMANN is acceptable to Conservatives !
BUSH was acceptable !

We do n't want to be like Republicans " .
To that I say , if we do n't fight back , we do n't win .
You can't be nice to the guy who is calling you a nazi / fascist / socialist / Kenyan supporter .
The fact is this is politics , not softball .
This is a full contact sport .
To those people , or to those of like mind , I might suggest the notion that we will NOT get elected officials with more spine until more Democratic VOTERS get a little bolder , a little more aggressive , and a little more willing to Yell Louder .
Not just Louder , but Smarter too .
Otherwise , we will play nice and lose to cheaters and liars .
I REFUSE to LOSE , and I suggest to those who fell iffy about fighting that you should LEAD , FOLLOW or GET OUT OF THE WAY .
Cause if you can't take the heat you should get out of the kitchen .
The overwhelming majority of us , thankfully , DO want a fight , because we KNOW we can and will WIN .
Our ideas are better , are motives are more benevolent , we want to make our nation and the world BETTER for everyone , not just more acceptable for Conservatives who are locked into 1930 or 1950 or 1980 or 1/19/09 .
To put it a little shorter , Rahm 's idea might win for now or in certain election cycles , but it SUCKS and so do his Blue Dogs lap dogs .
Grayson 's idea is better , be different , be a fighter , and people will love you for telling the truth .
This is the idea I am pushing to everyone .
Fight Harder , Yell Louder , Be Smarter and have BETTER ideas .
What good is MORE if our ideas are only 5 - 10 % different .
We Want CHANGE and we want it NOW , not soon , not in a while , NOW .
As an admin at The Progressive Electorate.com I am looking for new and BETTER candidates for primaries and general elections .
I invite any and all to promote their candidates , their districts and their ideas .
If your congressman is a wingnut that drives you crazy let me know .
If your congressmen is a DINO in need of a primary STAT let me know .
If your congressman is the shiznit and you love em and need help re-electing them , let me know .
Knowledge is power , and in the Darwinian evolution of our party and our ideas , competition and diversity are very , very good things .
We need more Grayson 's , more Weiner 's ( no pun intended ) , more Sherrod Browns and Bernie Sanders and NO MORE Ross 's and Cooper 's and Faucus 's and LIEberman's .
We will win by being distinctively different than Republicans and with BETTER ideas .
We will win by being a big tent with BETTER ideas , not slightly more acceptable ideas .
We CAN NOT WIN by being like Republicans .
If Grayson has laid any wisdom on us , that should be the most important part .
Last week I wrote a diary about Michele Bachmann and you guys and gals raised $ 1000 bucks in a day .
Yesterday our Act Blue page at Progressive Electorate.com shot up almost $ 7000 .
If you can , show these fighters like Grayson and Weiner some love , or show Bachmann and Joe Wilson the back of your hand .
We 're trying to raise $ 1000 for each candidate today , so if you can help it would be very appreciated , and if you want us to add a candidate or challenger let us know in the comments below .
Our candidates so far are Alan Grayson ( D - FL08 ) Anthony Weiner ( D - NY09 ) Rob miller ( SC - 02 ) Joshua Seagall ( AL - 03 ) Joe Sestak ( PA - Sen ) Democratic Challenger to Michele Bachman ( R - MN06 ) Democratic Challenger to John Linder ( R - GA07 ) Donate at Act Blue here
Together we CAN win in 2010 , no matter what the experts say , but we CAN NOT win if we do n't back up candidates who are willing to fight , and we CAN NOT win if we do n't take the fight to them .
In politics , as in football , a good defense is a good offense .
I say we FIGHT !
So Yell Louder ! and Smarter !
Cheers ,
MoT

Jane Hamsher ruffled some feathers last week when she forged a temporary alliance with Grover Norquist to call for an investigation of Rahm Emanuel ’s activities at Freddie Mac .
She also warned us about Treasury ’s plan to raise limits on government backing for Freddie and Fannie .
She was too late to stop the latter ; in fact , Treasury stuffed the fattest , slush fund stocking in history on Christmas Eve .
I do n’t know if Rahm is guilty .
He looks guilty as hell , though that goes for pretty much everyone in that fetid swamp .
But the biggest uproar to come from Ms. Hamsher ’s activities seems to be the rending of garments and gnashing of teeth that comes from purity betrayed .
I do n’t particularly like Grover Norquist .
Then again , i do n’t pay particular attention to Grover , either .
I ’d be interested to know whether he considers the DoD part of “ big government . ”
If he does , i might be willing to shop for bathroom fixtures with him .
In her defense against cries that she is sullying herself and progressivism , Ms. Hamsher pointed out that she a ) did not contact Mr. Norquist directly ; rather , he signed her letter ; and b ) that Mr. Norquist has a pretty decent track record of allying with pinko - liberal institutions like the ACLU .
I do n’t remember Messrs .
Obama , Biden , Emanuel and Ms. Clinton taking principled stands against heinous bouts of anti-Americanism like the god damned PATRIOT Act .
Do you ?
So maybe Ms. Hamsher is going to come away from this with cooties , but you know — if you really stop to think about it — that the fundamental problem facing this nation is that two corrupt institutions manage to keep the American people divided against each other .
There will always be real differences , and i seriously doubt that Jane Hamsher is going to start calling for bathtub violence against the government .
I ’d be greatly surprised if she started writing on the benefits of conservative neo-liberal economic policy .
She ’s no traitor to anyone or anything .
Freedom , as you well know by now , is not free ; the price is eternal vigilance and the willingness to do what ’s right , even when it is n’t the easy thing or the politically expedient thing .
As far as i’m concerned , Ms. Hamsher was doing her patriotic duty and Mr. Norquist saw the same duty to fulfill .
All the rest is just people letting their bumper stickers define them and ending up as hollow as those vinyl platitudes .
Barack Obama was right : it ’s well past time to move past partisanship if we want to save this country .
We missed the part where he explained that what he meant was the two thoroughly corrupt institutions that call themselves political parties would work more closely together to screw the average American , but we do n’t need him for post - partisanship .
We need more people doing what Hamsher and Norquist did .
Partly so that it is n’t gasp inducing , but mostly because we ’ll be fucked without it .

China is in a curious position .
Its auto market is very big , and it 's positioned to get much , much bigger , but the Chinese government does n't want the country 's automakers to move down the traditional path of combustion - engine vehicles .
Rather , it wants to grow an indigenous green vehicle industry .
Some of China 's desire might be attributed to the state of the country 's environment , which is notoriously polluted from China 's little - regulated industrial production .
But the more likely rationale behind China 's plans is that the government has identified hybrids as EVs as the future of automotive travel , and China wants to position its manufacturers at the forefront of that technological shift .
In some ways China may have an easier time of going green than other countries with longstanding auto industries and car - driving consumers like the U.S. Moving American drivers and automakers toward the green end of the scale is a bit like making a left turn in a cruise ship : slow and somewhat treacherous .
China , on the other hand , has the opportunity to plan ahead and move its industry down the green path right from the start ( or at least from earlier in the development timeline ) .
For China to pull that off , however , both car buyers and automakers will need support from the government , and now that support seems to be coming in the form of incentives .
This week , the Chinese government stated that it would hand out rebates to individual car buyers -- a first for the country .
The government also agreed to subsidize the purchase of green vehicles for public transport fleets in up to 20 cities across the country .
Those subsidies -- which could run up to 600,000 yuan ( $ 87,880 ) for large buses -- are designed to cover the cost difference between conventional combustion - engined rides and their electrid , hybrid , or fuel - cell equivalent .
Not much detail about the consumer program was given on the government website where these announcements were made .
However , we expect something on - par with Cash - for - Clunkers , but with a somewhat longer timetable .
We 'll keep you posted .

Double Trouble , Again
Once again , it 's not just that the primary Republican demographic is declining , that demographic is also voting increasingly for Democrats :
Click to enlarge .
Both Christians and non-Christians have been trending towards Democrats over the past 30 years .
The trend among Christians can not be completely accounted for by the increasing number of non-white Christians , either , as slight ( but not significant ) trends can be seen among white Protestants and white Catholics as well :
Click to enlarge .
Basically , McCain barely won Christians in 2008 , and non-Christians are solidly Democratic .
Meanwhile , all the trends are against Republicans .
Changes in Identification
The Pew survey on religion has a wealth of data regarding changes in religious identification , and Gallup has long - term trends .
Looking at people who join and leave certain religions over their lifetime , they found the fastest growing identification was Agnostic , followed by Other ( New Age , Unitarian , Native American ) , Atheist , Nothing in Particular , Buddhist , and Muslim .
Catholic , Jewish , and Protestant groups showed net losses .
Despite losing almost a quarter of their ranks to other denominations , Catholics are maintaining their proportion in the electorate because of immigration , mainly from Latin America .
This is not , however , particularly soothing to Republicans .
Overall , recent immigrants are about the same proportion Unaffiliated ( Atheist , Agnostic , and Nothing in Particular ) as the country as a whole , but about twice as likely to belong to a non-Christian religion ( 8 - 10 % instead of 5 % ) .
They are also far more Catholic - almost 50 % Catholic , and only about a quarter Protestant ; currently the nationwide figures are about 50 % Protestant and a quarter Catholic .
The Numbers
Looking at the bar chart in the introduction , white Mainline Protestants and Catholics ( two diverse groups themselves , mind you ) were essentially split 50 - 50 , white Evangelical Protestants were strongly Republican , and non-white Christians were strongly Democratic .
All together , Christians were split close to evenly , with a slight advantage for McCain .
However , every category of non-Christian voted overwhelmingly for Obama .
Here 's another way to look at the data from Pew , combined with other polls , with more divisions :
Click to enlarge .
There 's really only three bright spots for Republicans : Mormons , White Evangelical Christians , and Orthodox Jews .
More Trends
We have data for a few more religious groups as well :
Click to enlarge .
Mormons may show a weak trend over the years towards Republicans .
The data shown are for Rich County , Utah , which was 85 % Mormon in 2004 ( 95 % in 1989 ) , according to LDS church records ( which may overstate the number ) .
Sadly for Republicans , Mormons make up only about 2 % of the country .
Even in Utah , projections are that less than half the population will be Mormon by 2030 .
Not only that , but the increasingly obvious antipathy of the Republican base towards Mormons in general and Mitt Romney in particular might throw some cold water on this trend .
Especially in light of the appointment of popular Utah governor ( and Mormon ) Jon Huntsman as ambassador to China .
The Jewish vote has not only long been a solid Democratic demographic , but has been an increasingly Democratic demographic , despite quadrennial stories on Republicans making gains with Jewish voters .
In 2008 Obama had the highest support of any Democratic candidate since the measurements began , at 83 % , besting even the Gore / Lieberman ticket .
( Note that because of small samples , this is not significantly stronger support than prior years . )
This in a year of Barack the Scary Muslim emails targeting Jewish voters in particular , which were clearly ineffective .
Once again , however , we see an example of We Are Not All of Us Alike , as Orthodox Jews showed strong support for McCain this year and Bush in 2004 .
( Note that poll results shown in the chart above among Jewish subcategories are based on results from a July poll that have been adjusted to fit the final exit poll results . )
Estimates seen earlier for several Jewish immigrant communities in New York and Americans in Israel also showed strong support for McCain .
The Muslim community showed very strong support for Democrats this year , and among Arab Muslims at least , a dramatic increasingly Democratic trend .
The poll of Muslim voters was completed by randomly selecting names from a list of Muslim voters , so there could be a bias to it depending on how the list was generated .
However , the results are in agreement with the Muslim subsample in the poll of Arab Americans , and the Bangladeshi and Pakistani subsamples in the Asian American poll .
Another demographic slice of the Muslim American community , African Americans , is also strongly Democratic .
The recent development of Muslim American political behavior has been described as occurring in three stages : first , debating whether to participate in elections at all prior to 2000 ; second , whether to increase political power by voting as a block prior to 2004 ; and third , a less organized but perhaps more involved participation prior to the 2008 elections .
It has been a dramatic ten years , from the seeming betrayal by George Bush , who had strong Muslim support in 2000 , to the 2008 campaigns where the Muslim label was used as a rhetorical bludgeon ( a ploy which may have backfired ) , to the election of a man who spent part of his childhood in Indonesia and has family ties to Islam .
White Evangelical Christians show a short - term trend that parallels Rich County , Utah , but there 's really not enough data to make much of it .
More on this group can be found here .
Finally , a brief mention of Baha'i and Zoroastrianism : very small samples in the poll of Iranian - Americans in California indicated Iranian - American members of these faiths have views aligned with the more conservative of Iranian - Americans , and would therefore likely have more or less split their presidential vote .
Clearly , the uncertainty here is very large .

Sadly BlackBerry outages are becoming a common occurrence these days .
This afternoon our tip box was overloaded with users who wanted to know why their BlackBerry Messenger was n’t working .
Then we received more tips that BlackBerry e-mail was down and this outage was also affecting web browsing so we knew something was wrong .
Further investigation indicated that other services were not working like many popular third party apps that need Internet access .
Oddly enough a new BlackBerry Messenger ( 5.0.0.57 ) was released during the downtime .
This is what happened during the last outage which was only a week ago .
In fact this is the third major BIS outage we had this month but this is certainly the biggest .
At this time the BlackBerry outage seems to still be in effect which means BIS has been down for over 4 hours now .
We do n’t exactly know what is causing these problems but expect RIM to release some kind of statement , especially after this one .

SHARE Fatal Care : Fostering reform in child welfare
For complete archived coverage of the story of the death of 13 - month - old Christopher L. Thomas Jr. and its catalyst for change in the child welfare bureau , click here .
By of the
A Milwaukee child - care worker who police say was too drunk to remember putting her infant daughter to sleep on a couch was charged Tuesday with killing the 6 - day - old baby .
Rose Prescott , 30 , told police it was possible she fell asleep on the couch with her daughter , Ceianna Buchanan , according to a criminal complaint charging Prescott with second - degree reckless homicide .
Ceianna 's alleged homicide on March 8 was the third co-sleeping death in her immediate family .
Prescott's 2 - month - old daughter , Brianna Buchanan - Prescott , died while sleeping with Prescott on April 17 , 2008 .
Ceianna and Brianna 's 5 - month - old half - sister , Cierra Buchanan , died while co-sleeping with Cierra 's grandmother in 1993 .
Shortly after Ceianna 's death , the Journal Sentinel reported that the state - run Bureau of Milwaukee Child Welfare was aware of Brianna 's death under similar circumstances less than a year before .
When the newspaper asked what services the bureau provided to Ceianna 's family , child welfare officials said state confidentiality laws prevented them from commenting because no one had been charged with a crime .
A spokeswoman from the Department of Children and Families said Tuesday that , now that abuse had been confirmed , the agency was preparing a public report .
According to the complaint filed in Ceianna 's death , Prescott told police that on March 7 she drank a half - liter of Bacardi Rum Hurricane between 3:15 and 10 p.m .
She told police she took Ceianna to a baby sitter , then went to a family cookout , where she continued to drink .
Prescott told police she remembers picking Ceianna up from the baby sitter .
" Ms. Prescott could not recall what transpired beyond that point in time , " the complaint says .
" Specifically , Ms. Prescott could not remember arriving home , parking the car , or coming up the stairs of her residence , " the complaint says .
Prescott gave investigators conflicting reports of what happened next .
She told an investigator she put Ceianna face up on one side of the couch , put a toddler on the other end of the couch and then slept on the floor .
Investigators noted there were no pillows or blankets on the floor .
Prescott told another investigator that she was drunk , and that it was possible she fell asleep on the couch with Ceianna .
The complaint says Prescott found Ceianna facing the back cushion of the couch and not breathing .
Prescott 's car keys were found beneath the child 's body .
According to the autopsy report , Ceianna died of " asphyxia due to suffocation due to overlaying by adult during co-sleeping on couch . "
Her sister , Brianna , died of " sudden unexpected death in infancy with co-sleeping listed as a significant condition , " the complaint says .
Prescott also had been drinking the night Brianna died , the complaint says .
" At this time , the Department of Children and Families has no information that this tragic death was the result of child abuse or neglect , " the DCF had said in statement issued shortly after Ceianna 's death .
" Therefore , by law , we cannot address any previous history that family may or may not have had with any child protective service agency . "
Their half - sibling , Cierra , died while sleeping in a bed with their grandmother and a 7 - year - old relative .
The Journal Sentinel also reported in March that Prescott appears to have provided Milwaukee County with bogus employment information to qualify six of her children for taxpayer - financed child care at a cost to taxpayers of more than $ 1,300 a week .
After the death of Ceianna in March , Prescott was employed at various day care centers .
She was laid off in September from Ne - Ne 's Child Care Center on N. Palmer St. , according to documents obtained Tuesday by the Journal Sentinel .
The director of the center , Arnitra Swain , said in a letter to county regulators that state regulators insisted Prescott be laid off pending a criminal background check .
Prescott was scheduled to make her initial court appearance Wednesday .
Raquel Rutledge of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report .
Talking Points Memo notes that former SecState Condi Rice and former NSA Stephen Hadley are joining forces to create a " strategic consulting " firm .
May I suggest that this is probably an even bigger farce than former FEMA Director Michael Brown 's decision to start a consulting firm on disaster preparedness following his stellar performance during Katrina ?
I really want to know what clients these two take on , so that I can relentlessly mock their stupidity for hiring the dynamic duo who brought us into the adventures of invading Iraq and Afghanistan without any idea of the resources required or any form of an exit strategy .
UPDATE : In the comments , jenne corrects me :
I think the Cheney " Keep America Safe " Institute is a bigger farce than both Brown and Condi 's thingies put together .
OUCH .
And touche '
In early September , I became aware of something that shocked me as both a skeptic and physics teacher : Edmund Scientific , one of the oldest and most respected outlets for selling science equipment for educational use , has gone over to the dark side .
They are actively marketing and selling paranormal woo - woo on their Web site .
The item that attracted my attention was their self - proclaimed EMF Ghost Meter , which is nothing more than a standard EMF ( electromagnetic field ) detector that detects low - frequency EMFs such as radio and microwaves .
I have no beef with Edmund selling EMF detectors ( I even have one in my classroom ) , but what galls me is that they are actually marketing this device by calling it a ghost detector , implicitly giving credence to pseudoscientific flummery .
As they say on their Web site : “ The preferred unit of paranormal investigators , this Ghost Meter can be used by laymen with professional results .
The unit responds instantaneously to EMF fluctuations and spikes in energy with a detecting range of 50 to 1,000 Hz .
The VLF range is 1,000 to 20,000 Hz .
An easy - to - read LED display and silent on / off push switch make for seamless , simple operation . ”
Such devices are often used by so - called ghost hunters as they bumble around in the dark , freaking themselves out at every cool draft of wind and creaky sound .
In reality , there is absolutely no reason to think that EMF meters are detecting any kind of “ ghostly entities , ” as a simple application of Occam ’s Razor often shows that what the meters are actually detecting is the low - frequency EM waves given off by nearby lighting fixtures , electrical lines , or even the other equipment carried by the ghost hunters themselves .
But it gets worse .
In addition to their Ghost Meter , Edmund is now selling what they call a 3 - in - 1 Paranormal Research Instrument , which is an EMF meter , a digital temperature sensor , and a flashlight .
I suppose Edmund also wants to tap into the gullible “ cool breezes and drafts are evidence for a ghost ” market along their journey down the paranormal rabbit hole .
Edmund has gone even further by selling what it calls a Remote Viewing DVD , which claims the customer can “ learn the history and latest applications of this amazing field of ‘ intuitive science ’ and discover for yourself how to devleop [ sic ] and use your own RV - ESP skills . ”
I recently checked the Edmund Web site , and all of these items are now listed as “ temporarily out of stock . ”
Hopefully , this is because the company is attempting to ( tentatively ) reverse course , but maybe it ’s because they ’ve been so successful in marketing woo - woo to the gullible .
To me , as a physics teacher , this discovery is as bad as opening up their catalog to the biology section and finding products for sale that promote creationism .
The misleading advertisements and products on the Edmund Web site are unacceptable , and until they change course I will no longer purchase any of their products .

Who the lady with the determined chin is , why the most famous painter of her day never finished her portrait , and where she has been hanging for most of the last 400 years , remain mysterious – but she is now valued at up to £ 6 m , as a previously unrecorded work by Rubens .
" It 's a fascinating piece precisely because it is unfinished , so she seems to step into life out of nothingness , " said Alex Bell , an expert on old master paintings at Sotheby 's , where the painting will be auctioned next week .
" Although the face and the hand are finished , you can see how he sketches in the ruff and details of the costume by dragging the paint quickly across the canvas – it gives you a wonderfully immediate feeling of how he worked . "
Sir Peter Paul Rubens probably painted the woman in a magnificent Spanish costume around 1603 , when he travelled from the Netherlands to Italy and Spain and perfected his technique .
It may have been part of a commission from the duke of Mantua , which Rubens mentioned in letters , to add the most handsome women in the Spanish court to his " gallery of beauties " , but the canvas was probably a sketch from life intended to be finished later .
There is no evidence that the duke ever got her or any other beauties .
The only hints of what happened to the painting come from two red wax seals on the back , one proving that it was in Venice in the early 19th century at a time when many church and private collections were broken up and the other showing it was part of the Hanmer family 's collection at their mansion , Bettisfield Park near Wrexham .
Bell believes Sir John Hanmer probably bought it in London in the 1840s , but how and when it left Italy remains one of its many mysteries .
Several visitors to Bettisfield recorded their admiration of the wealth of pictures on his walls , but none seems to have spotted a Rubens and Bell does not think it has been exhibited in public before .
Another lost Rubens set a record for an old master painting seven years ago , when the newspaper baron Lord Thomson paid £ 49.5 m at Sotheby 's for Massacre of the Innocents , which had been wrongly catalogued and kept in store for most of its history because a succession of owners found its blood spattered subject too gruesome for everyday viewing .
The Spanish beauty is not predicted to create such a sensation , but " she 's causing a lot of interest " , Bell said .

More than 100 people have been killed in the cold snap across Europe , with temperatures plummeting and snowfall causing chaos from Moscow to Milan .
In Poland , where temperatures have dropped to as low as - 20C in some areas , police appealed for tip - offs about people spotted lying around outside .
At least 42 people , most of them homeless , died over the weekend .
In Ukraine 27 people have frozen to death since the thermometer dropped last week .
Authorities in Romania said 11 people had succumbed to the chill , and in the Czech Republic the toll was 12 .
In Germany , where temperatures have fallen to - 33C in certain parts , at least seven people are known to have lost their lives in the freezing weather .
For millions of others across the continent , the cold snap has brought severe disruption , with flight cancellations and traffic jams thwarting pre-Christmas travel plans .
The resumption of Eurostar services brought some relief to passengers travelling between France , Belgium and England , but many trains across Europe were delayed or cancelled .
Airports were struggling to cope with icy runways , with Ryanair and Easyjet among several airlines to cancel some flights .
In Frankfurt , where snowfall prompted delays and cancellations , 3,000 people were forced to spend last night inside the terminals at the city 's main airport .
" It is totally chaotic today … no one knows what 's going on – neither us nor the staff , " Dorothee Schaefle , waiting in line , told Die Welt newspaper .
Roads were not exempt from the chaos .
After a weekend that brought the heaviest snowfall in about 100 years , Moscow was gridlocked , with tailbacks snailing around the Russian capital .
In Italy , where winters are usually mild , motorways in the north - east were closed and the Ministry of Defence dispatched helicopters in Sicily to bring medical aid to those in need .
In Milan hundreds of soldiers worked through the night to clear the snow - and ice - covered streets .

Rep .
Peter King thinks the Obama administration 's failure to have either the president himself or one of his officials give a press conference on the attempted Delta airline bombing is somehow the same as Bush not showing up in New Orleans right away after Katrina .
I guess King was n't satisfied that Rep.
Pete Hoekstra was the only one going out there making a fool of himself immediately politicizing this thing .
Sorry pal but President Obama not rushing out to do a press conference about this attempted bombing that they probably do n't even have a lot of answers on yet is not even remotely the same thing as Bush completely ignoring Hurricane Katrina and what was going on in New Orleans to the point where his aides finally had to put together footage on a DVD days later and get him to watch it for him to even have any idea what was happening down there .
Unbelievable .
And CNN's Drew Griffin was more than happy to help King along with this history revisionism .
For a reminder of how Bush reacted to Hurricane Katrina , here 's a timeline put together by Think Progress .
Griffin also pointed out right after King got off the air with him that Janet Napolitano was going to be on State of the Union on CNN Sunday morning .
I guess that 's not soon enough to suit King and of course Griffin did n't bring that up while he still had him on the air either .
The Political Carnival pointed out another problem with King 's hackery here -- Pete King 's Terrible , Horrible , No Good , Very Bad Memory :
See ?
Some there is some change we can believe in .
No , Obama never eliminated the word " terrorism " from the government lexicon .
It was the phrase " war on terror " , one of the stupidest phrases ever concocted by any administration ever .
That 's why this administration is using different words .
President Obama , rightfully , would n't want any association whatsoever with BushCoSpeak .
Just now on CNN , Petey said that the ObamAdministration banned the word " terrorism " , which is , of course , why Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab managed to smuggle explosives on board a jetliner .
Full transcript via CNN below the fold .
GRIFFIN : Let 's turn to politics now , because two of these stories are beginning to collide .
The White House is calling this an attempted act of terrorism but the president is on vacation .
Some lawmakers say they want answers from the commander - in - chief , not just press releases .
One of the critics is joining us now , Congressman Peter King , Republican from New York , the ranking minority member on the House Homeland Security Committee .
Congressman , you know what you 're talking about when you 're talking about security issues .
Why is it important for us to see or hear from the administration ?
REP . PETER KING ( R ) , NEW YORK ( via telephone ) : Drew , this came close to being one of the greatest tragedies in the history of our country .
If we had lost much 300 people on Christmas Day , this would have been remembered forevermore as the Christmas Day massacre .
We avoided by luck and because of a number of very courageous passengers .
This was an assault on the United State and it is important at a time like this that the president of the United States or someone in the administration with stature step forward , whether it would be the vice president or the secretary of homeland security .
But basically , there is no face of the administration on this issue .
And me , I just think of health care and global warming and some of the other issues where there 's always somebody from the administration out there talking .
And I 'm not saying to grandstand it , I 'm saying to be out there and just be a calm and reassuring voice for the country and for the world .
Whether it was President Bush or President Clinton or President Reagan , at times like this , the country looks for a leader .
And I just feel that this administration is much more comfortable in talking about issues other than terrorism .
GRIFFIN : Congressman , we 've heard from Ed Henry , who got a response from the administration , saying , you know , this just not is -- not the president 's style .
He 'd rather let the investigators do the investigating and tell this story .
You seem to say it goes beyond just a terror investigation here .
KING : Yes , it does .
Let me make it clear , from what I know , I agree with what the administration is doing as far as their policies , as far increasing the security , and as far as doing all they can to find out who was behind it and know what the facts are .
I 'm saying , now , there 's more to being a president and more to being an administration than just getting -- just having the technical work done .
It 's important to reassure the country , to show leadership , to show -- you know , to give a sense of confidence to the country .
This is an attack on the country .
And as commander - in - chief , I believe the president should be there or the secretary of homeland security or his homeland security adviser in the White House .
And again , just to -- as a sign of strength for the country , especially , since in virtually every other issue , there 's almost a race to the microphone .
GRIFFIN : I can almost hear the critics coming after you , saying you 're trying to turn this into a political issue .
But let me read what you wrote earlier today .
You said , " They , " meaning , the administration , " do n't feel as comfortable talking about terror as they do global warming and health care . "
You are almost saying -- if I 'm reading this correctly -- that this is a deliberate political move by the administration not to talk about terror .
KING : Yes .
I -- first of all , they started off the first several months of the Obama administration refusing to use the word terrorism .
Janet Napolitano said it would no longer be in the vocabulary of the Department of Homeland Security because they thought that it connoted fear .
And Secretary Clinton is saying that the policy of the administration was not to talk about terrorism .
Even when the president gave his speech at West Point about the troops going to Afghanistan , he did n't use the word terrorism .
He spoke of extremism .
So , no , I do n't think they are comfortable .
And having said , let me make it clear , I think they are doing the right thing as far as their policies .
Since this attack occurred , the FBI and , as far as I can tell , Homeland Security and all the agencies of the United States government are doing the right job .
But the president above all , who is a great communicator , should realize what President Reagan always did .
The country looks for a voice of strength and reassurance , especially with the president being in Hawaii at a time like this .
Listen , think of all the criticism President Bush took because it took him several days to get down to New Orleans after Katrina .
So , people do look for leadership in their president .
GRIFFIN : All right .
Congressman King -- Representative Peter King out of New York , we 'll see if they take up your advice .
Thank you , sir , for joining us tonight .
KING : Thank you very much .
Appreciate it .
GRIFFIN : You bet .
Stay with CNN around the clock for the latest on the terror investigation .
Coming up tomorrow morning on CNN's " STATE OF THE UNION , " one of those administration officials , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , she will be on at 9:00 a.m. with Candy Crowley .
This essay was originally published in The Free Market in April 1993 .
It ’s true that the U.S. health care system is a mess , but this demonstrates not market but government failure .
To cure the problem requires not different or more government regulations and bureaucracies , as self - serving politicians want us to believe , but the elimination of all existing government controls .
It ’s time to get serious about health care reform .
Tax credits , vouchers , and privatization will go a long way toward decentralizing the system and removing unnecessary burdens from business .
But four additional steps must also be taken :
1. Eliminate all licensing requirements for medical schools , hospitals , pharmacies , and medical doctors and other health care personnel .
Their supply would almost instantly increase , prices would fall , and a greater variety of health care services would appear on the market .
Competing voluntary accreditation agencies would take the place of compulsory government licensing — if health care providers believe that such accreditation would enhance their own reputation , and that their consumers care about reputation , and are willing to pay for it .
Because consumers would no longer be duped into believing that there is such a thing as a " national standard " of health care , they will increase their search costs and make more discriminating health care choices .

2. Eliminate all government restrictions on the production and sale of pharmaceutical products and medical devices .
This means no more Food and Drug Administration , which presently hinders innovation and increases costs .
Costs and prices would fall , and a wider variety of better products would reach the market sooner .
The market would force consumers to act in accordance with their own — rather than the government ’s — risk assessment .
And competing drug and device manufacturers and sellers , to safeguard against product liability suits as much as to attract customers , would provide increasingly better product descriptions and guarantees .
3. Deregulate the health insurance industry .
Private enterprise can offer insurance against events over whose outcome the insured possesses no control .
One cannot insure oneself against suicide or bankruptcy , for example , because it is in one ’s own hands to bring these events about .
The Economics and Ethi ...
Hoppe , Hans - Hermann Best Price : $ 42.48 Buy New $ 564.15 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
Because a person ’s health , or lack of it , lies increasingly within his own control , many , if not most health risks , are actually uninsurable .
" Insurance " against risks whose likelihood an individual can systematically influence falls within that person ’s own responsibility .
All insurance , moreover , involves the pooling of individual risks .
It implies that insurers pay more to some and less to others .
But no one knows in advance , and with certainty , who the " winners " and " losers " will be .
" Winners " and " losers " are distributed randomly , and the resulting income redistribution is unsystematic .
If " winners " or " losers " could be systematically predicted , " losers " would not want to pool their risk with " winners , " but with other " losers , " because this would lower their insurance costs .
I would not want to pool my personal accident risks with those of professional football players , for instance , but exclusively with those of people in circumstances similar to my own , at lower costs .
Because of legal restrictions on the health insurers ’ right of refusal — to exclude any individual risk as uninsurable — the present health - insurance system is only partly concerned with insurance .
The industry cannot discriminate freely among different groups ’ risks .
Economic Science and t... Hans -Hermann Hoppe Best Price : $ 6.92 Buy New $ 8.95 ( as of 07:00 EST - Details )
As a result , health insurers cover a multitude of uninsurable risks , alongside , and pooled with , genuine insurance risks .
They do not discriminate among various groups of people which pose significantly different insurance risks .
The industry thus runs a system of income redistribution — benefiting irresponsible actors and high - risk groups at the expense of responsible individuals and low - risk groups .
Accordingly the industry ’s prices are high and ballooning .
To deregulate the industry means to restore it to unrestricted freedom of contract : to allow a health insurer to offer any contract whatsoever , to include or exclude any risk , and to discriminate among any groups of individuals .
Uninsurable risks would lose coverage , the variety of insurance policies for the remaining coverage would increase , and price differentials would reflect genuine insurance risks .
On average , prices would drastically fall .
And the reform would restore individual responsibility in health care .
4. Eliminate all subsidies to the sick or unhealthy .
Subsidies create more of whatever is being subsidized .
Subsidies for the ill and diseased breed illness and disease , and promote carelessness , indigence , and dependency .
If we eliminate them , we would strengthen the will to live healthy lives and to work for a living .
In the first instance , that means abolishing Medicare and Medicaid .
Only these four steps , although drastic , will restore a fully free market in medical provision .
Until they are adopted , the industry will have serious problems , and so will we , its consumers .

The Best of Hans - Hermann Hoppe
Since the Brad Pitt Face post I did two weeks ago , I ’ve received a lot of requests – you could say a sleigh full – for more photos of me .
Readers ’ curiosity is insatiable !
Whoever would have thought !
I was going to do what I do best – ignore them – until I read this article about legislation being introduced in France requiring all digitally altered photographs used in advertising to be labeled as ‘ Retouched ’ .
It got me thinking , a bit , about photo preparation and alteration , retouching , and branding .
Here ’s an excerpt from the article I read …
“ … Some think such a law would destroy photographic art ; some think it might help reduce anorexia ; some say the idea is aimed at the wrong target , given that nearly every advertising photograph is retouched .
Others believe such a label might sensitize people to the fakery involved in most of the advertising images with which they ’re bludgeoned .
Underneath it all is an emotional debate about what it is to be attractive or unattractive , and whether the changing ideals of beauty — from Sophia Loren to Twiggy — have ever been realistic .
Michelangelo painted idealized bodies , so the idea of idealized beauty was already there …
It ’s a fake debate … ”
There was a recent fuss about this bizarre retouching of the model Filippa Hamilton for a Ralph Lauren ad .
Look at these two photos closely – the one on the left is unaltered while the right picture , from ads that ran in Japan , is retouched so weirdly that her waist appears to be the same width as her head :
Personally , I am thoroughly put off by this whole idea of fashionable idealism by artifice , using retouching and airbrushing techniques .
The Botticellianesque counterfeiting of the human body , the rampage of artificiality , the mock run amok , the beau ideal become faux ideal – I find it utterly laughable and yet annoying , even a touch offensive .
Countless magazine covers featuring porcelain - perfect , moleless , pimpleless , hairless , sun spotless , scarless , stretch markless facial and body skin , and hourglass figures where beer barrels once existed , combining to make everything about celebrity , about media - drenched modern society , about pop culture generally , illusory , fake , and shallow .
I , for one , lose all interest in whatsoever is not so real .
Therefore , in answer to your innumerable requests for “ More Daedalus , please ! ” , and in the spirit of authenticity and humble genuiousness , here is my early Christmas present to all of my readers , subscribers , and fans – my full - bodied , actual , unretouched and unaltered photo of myself in high resolution , suitable for downloading , printing , and framing .
Let ’s call this the Christmas season spirit of veracity and full disclosure !
Merry Christmas to you all for 2009 !
The National Library of France ( BnF ) has an amazing collection of prints from 1910 which depict life in the year 2000 .
They are credited to Villemard .
There 's speculation that they were included with " foodstuffs " of the era , much like the German postcards we looked at back in April .
Ten percent of Protestants , 21 percent of Roman Catholics , and 52 percent of Jews do NOT believe in God .
That ’s the surprising word from a new survey by Harris Interactive of 2,306 adults that shows belief in God varies quite widely among different segments of the American public .
How often do we go to a place of worship ?
Not much .
Most people attend a religious service less than once a month .
Still , Americans are far more likely to believe in God and to attend religious services than people in most other developed countries , particularly in Europe .
Who believes in God ?
While 79 percent of Americans believe there is a God , only 66 percent are absolutely certain of it .
Nine percent do not believe in God and 12 percent are n’t sure .
And weirdly , not everyone who calls himself or herself a Christian or a Jew actually believes in God .
Who worships at a religious service ?
Just over half ( 55 percent ) attend a religious service a few times a year or more .
Thirty - six percent attend once a month or more often , and just 26 percent say they attend every week .
Forty - one percent of women and 31 percent of men attend once a month or more .
Protestants ( 47 percent ) are more likely to go to church once a month or more often than are Roman Catholics ( 35 percent ) .
Jews are least likely to go with 16 percent saying they go to synagogue once a month or more .
Church attendance is highest in the Midwest and lowest in the West .
Belief in God by geography and age
Eighty - two percent of Midwesterners and Southerners believe in God , compared with 75 percent in the East and West .
Our beliefs get stronger as we age .
Of those 25 to 29 years old , 71 percent believe in God .
That number jumps to 80 percent for people over 40 , and hits 83 percent for those 65 and over .
Other fascinating facts about who believes in God :
84 percent of women believe in God , compared with 73 percent of men .
91 percent of African Americans believe in God , compared with 81 percent of Hispanics and 78 percent of whites .
87 percent of Republicans believe in God , compared with 78 percent of Democrats and 75 percent of Independents .
82 percent of those with no college education believe in God , compared with 73 percent who went to college .

Ricin is a natural toxin found in castor beans Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
An anti-toxin that protects against ricin poisoning is to move into production for the first time .
It is the result of eight years of work by researchers at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory based at Porton Down in Wiltshire .
The antidote can protect against death up to 24 hours after exposure , according to Dr Jane Holley from DSTL .
Security experts say ricin - roughly 1,000 times more toxic than cyanide - could be used in a bio - terror attack .
Dr Holley told BBC
News : " In the past there has been lots of research carried out using different methods .
But this is the first [ anti - toxin ] that has been moved into production .
The principal scientist in biomedical sciences at DSTL added : " It is anticipated that a product will be available for use in the next couple of years . "
Ricin is extracted from castor beans , which are processed throughout the world to make castor oil .
The toxin is part of the waste " mash " produced when castor oil is made .
It can cause harm if injected , swallowed or inhaled .
A tiny quantity can be lethal , but the amount needed to kill depends on the route of administration .
A combination of pulmonary , liver , renal and immunological failure can lead to death , though people can recover from exposure .
The ricin - filled pellet that killed Georgi Markov was injected using an umbrella
In recent years , the perceived threat of bioterrorism has increased .
Although the anti-toxin developed at Porton Down was initially intended for use by the military , DSTL scientists are investigating its potential use in a civilian environment .
Production of the anti-toxin involves immunising sheep with an inactive form of ricin , which results in the production of antibodies .
These are proteins used by the immune system to neutralise harmful substances .
The antibodies are then harvested from the sheep to produce a freeze - dried product .
This is reconstituted with water for injection into the body .
Dr Holley said that although the anti-toxin is ready to be manufactured , full licensing is likely to take about five years .
Dissident murder Professor Alastair Hay , a toxicologist at the University of Leeds described ricin as " a very potent poison " .
" Having an anti-toxin in the armoury would be very helpful for anyone who has to deal with possible ricin poisoning , " he told BBC News .
Ricin was the poison used for the infamous murder of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov in September 1978 .
Mr Markov , who was an avowed critic of Bulgaria 's communist regime , was waiting at a bus stop near Waterloo Bridge , London , when a stranger jabbed him in the leg with an umbrella .
The rigged umbrella injected a tiny ricin - filled pellet into Mr Markov 's calf .
He was admitted to hospital that evening but died three days later .
Kamel Bourgass was convicted in 2005 of plotting to use poisons
In 2005 , an Algerian man , Kamel Bourgass , was convicted of plotting to use poisons - including ricin - to cause disruption , fear or injury .
He was arrested after anti-terrorist squad officers found a suspected poisons laboratory in a north London flat in January 2003 , though the toxin itself was not found .
There have also been incidents in the US ; in 2004 , an alert was triggered after tests identified ricin in a Senate office building mailroom .
The development of the ricin anti-toxin follows on from work to develop an " antidote " for poisoning with botulinum toxin .
" Although there had been small - scale batches of anti-toxins for botulinum available in hospitals , for military use we needed a large capability in case it was used as a biological weapon .
We developed an anti-toxin against all seven ' serotypes ' of botulinum toxin , " Dr Holley explained .
Serotypes are structurally distinct forms of the toxin .
Dr Holley added : " This has been available for several years now , has been made to good manufacturing practice and is undergoing full licensing studies at the moment . "
Research has also been carried out into a vaccine against ricin poisoning .
While an anti-toxin works by mopping up the poison once it is in the body , a vaccine would prime the body for exposure to the agent .
Its effectiveness would depend in part on the period of time between administration of the vaccine and exposure to the agent .

The gap between rich and poor is a global problem , but how do policy makers measure , track , and evaluate inequality ?
The Growing Gap Between the Rich and Poor
You do n’t have to look hard to find news stories about the ever - widening gap between the rich and the poor in America and the effect it has on the stability and economic health of the nation and its citizens .
This is troubling for a number of reasons and calls into question the American dream which depends on the idea that social mobility exists in society .
Social mobility is the movement of people within or between layers or classes in an open social system .
Equality of opportunity for citizens of a country includes :
Access to quality education and healthcare
Equal employment opportunity
Fair distribution of income across the population
But this is n’t only a problem in America .
Global inequality also remains high .
The financial gap between the rich and poor in most countries is higher than it has been in 30 years .
On average the richest 10 % earn 9.6 times more than the poorest 10 % in today 's economy and the ratio is continuing to rise .
Growing financial inequality is due not only to the increasing wealth of the top earners , but also to the decline in wealth of the lower 40 % .
Problems Associated with Inequality of Income Distribution
When income is too widely or unfairly distributed in a country , it can :
Harm long - term economic growth
Widen the gap in education between " the haves " and " have nots , " thus wasting human possibilities and resources
Limit social mobility
Decrease full - time employment and increase part - time , low - skill and temporary work causing a reduction in earnings , job insecurity and fewer training opportunities for many workers
Limit investment opportunities and therefore growth by fueling economic , financial and political instability
Dampen international trade
The eventual consequence of large income gaps between rich and poor is usually a decline in the economic and social health of the nation and most of its people .
Measuring Inequality
Tthe Lorenz Curve
There are many ways to measure inequality .
One way is the Lorenz Curve .
This is used by economists to measure what portions of the population are responsible for the total income .
The curve helps you measure and make statements like 10 % of the population accounts for 80 % of the income .
Divide the area above the curve by the area below the curve to get the coefficient economists use to compare countries .
The closer the Lorenz Curve comes to a straight 45 - degree line , the more equally distributed the income is .
Other Factors to Consider
The fairness of opportunities is often measured by :
Tracking health , education and training by income group Checking employment trends Examining the ease of access to basic services and opportunities
Income inequality is typically measured by :
Determining the Gini Coefficient of the country ( See below )
Tracking changes in the income portion of various parts of the population Analyzing information on the assets held by the wealthiest
What is the Gini Coefficient ?
Developed by statistician Corrado Gini in 1912 , the Gini Coefficient is a mathematical formula to determine the inequality of income distribution among the population of a nation or group .
The lower the number , the more equally distributed the income within the group ; the higher the number , the less equally distributed the income within the group
Uneven distribution means that the gap between the rich and the poor is really wide .
In a very uneven distribution , the rich are very rich and the poor are very poor , comparatively
Primary Usage of the Gini Coefficient
The primary usage of the Gini Coefficient is to determine how equitable or inequitable the distribution of income is within a nation ( or group ) in order to :
Track movement over time , i.e. , more or less inequality
Compare nations ( or groups )
This information is especially useful in developing governmental policies and laws that affect international trade , national growth and economic stability .
The Current Top and Bottom Five Countries According to the Gini Index 2017
The World Bank 's estimate for the US in 2017 is 45 , making America the 38th most unequal country in the world based on the CIA - recognized Gini index .
Explosive collusion allegations have been published by a US Congress body as part of its examination of a loyalist murder case dating back 12 years .
Members of the US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs were recently addressed by Raymond McCord over the police 's failure to bring his son's UVF killers to justice .
A sub-committee of the Washington body has now published online his written submission to its inquiry , detailing a string of serious allegations .
Using the Congress equivalent of Parliamentary privilege , Mr McCord claimed :
The UVF 's long - standing top commander — named in his written statement as Shankill loyalist John ‘ Bunter ’ Graham — has been a long - term “ agent of the state ” .
The murder of Mr McCord 's son Raymond jnr was carried out on the orders of north Belfast UVF man and Special Branch informer Mark Haddock .
Haddock 's main Special Branch handler — named in Mr McCord 's statement as an ex-RUC Detective Sergeant — spoke up for the loyalist when he was arrested on suspicion of terrorism in 2000 .
Mr McCord also posed questions for ex-Chief Constable Sir Ronnie Flanagan on what he had known about the activities of police informers within the UVF .
His claims have been made to the Congress Committee 's Subcommittee on International Organisations , Human Rights and Oversight , which is examining collusion allegations here .
McCord jnr , a 22 - year - old former RAF man , was beaten to death by a UVF gang in Newtownabbey in November 1997 .
His father has campaigned for years for a public inquiry on the case , and to expose collusion between the police and a vicious UVF unit centred in north Belfast 's Mount Vernon estate .
His chief allegations against Special Branch were vindicated in a damning report issued in January 2007 by Police Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan .
Mrs O'Loan has also given evidence to the Congress sub-committee .
In his now - published written submission , Mr McCord alleged Haddock was “ the leader of Mount Vernon UVF ” and had been “ part of the British security forces ' intelligence services for at least 12 years ” .
He also claimed that John ‘ Bunter ’ Graham has been an agent “ for years ” .
“ He is the man who controls , and has run , the UVF for years , ” the submission added .
“ The list goes on .
Many of the leading UVF men were in fact Special Branch informants , who were also involved in murders , drug dealing , beatings and extortions .
How many innocent lives have been sacrificed so as not to expose these informers ? ”
He also claimed that a suspect in his son's murder , whom he named as Willie Young , was not interviewed by police for eight days despite being “ easily accessible ” .
Mr McCord 's written statement further stated that Haddock was accused of having information likely to be of use to terrorists in 2000 , in relation to possession of a vehicle 's registration details .
He alleged Haddock ’s senior handler , named as Detective Sergeant Phil Scott , “ prepared a confidential document that was forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions ” .
It said there were “ no sinister motives behind the possession of the vehicle registration number ” and expressed the opinion “ that the informant will be of great value in the future ” , he stated .
Mr McCord 's submission to the Congress sub - committee also challenged Sir Ronnie Flanagan , asking : “ Did he not know that Haddock was a major suspect in many murders ?
Why did he continue to allow Special Branch to keep him on as a paid Special Branch informer ?
“ How many more ‘ Mark Haddocks ' were there working for the police ?
How can Ronnie Flanagan wash his hands of all this and pretend he did not know ? ”
Mr McCord acknowledged that changes have been made in the handling of informants as a result of the Police Ombudsman probe .
But his submission added that the Government has still not publicly admitted to collusion .
“ I believe one of the most important aspects of this case is for the British Government to hold up their hands , come clean , and tell the truth .
“ They did collude with terrorist organisations and should now apologise and compensate the victims ’ families , ” he added .

How the Media Misconstrue Jihad and the Crusades
Mr. Furnish , Ph.D. , is Assistant Professor , World History , Georgia Perimeter College .
It 's axiomatic among historians that winners write ( or sometimes rewrite ) history .
How strange it is , then , that on the topic of Jihads and their Western analog , the Crusades , the losers in the post - 1492 struggle for world mastery ( the Islamic world ) and their willing spinmeisters ( academics and media pundits ) are currently foisting their ahistorical views on the rest of us .
That view , a two - sided coin of deceit , consists of the following contentions : 1 ) that jihad almost always means " moral self - improvement in order to please God " and , on the rare occasion that it does take martial form , it only does so as a desperate defensive measure against the Christian West ; and 2 ) that the history of Christian - Muslim interaction is almost entirely one of invasion and exploitation of the latter by the former , exemplified by the Crusades .
As examples , consider these recent propaganda gems :
1 ) MSNBC , in a segment discussing the new PBS video " Muhammad : Legacy of a Prophet " ( Dec. 18 , 2002 ) , runs a graphic explaining that the true definition of jihad is " the struggle to please God . "
2 ) History Channel / A & E's recent ( summer 2002 ) " Inside Islam " special presents the Crusades as the first violent struggle between Christendom and the Islamic world .
3) U.S. News and World Report 's cover story " The First Holy War " ( April 8 , 2002 ) does likewise , claiming that " during the Crusades , East and West first met -- on the battlefield . "
4 ) History Channel / A & E's ( otherwise fine ) 1995 video series " The Crusades " ( hosted by former Monty Python member Terry Jones ) has Salah al - Din , the Kurdish Muslim leader who retook Jerusalem from the Crusaders , telling Richard the Lion Heart that " this land has always been ours " and it also avers that jihad only developed as a response to the rapacious Crusades .
5 ) The PBS video " Islam : Empire of Faith " ( 2001 ) presents Islamic military expansion , both pre-modern and Ottoman , as natural and understandable and never calls it by its true name : jihad .
Such examples could be multiplied many fold , if every self - styled expert on Islam who has been interviewed by any American newspaper since 9/11 were adduced .
But sticking with the five aforementioned contentions , what is wrong with each of them ?
Re : 1 ) As Daniel Pipes and Douglas Streusand so convincingly point out , jihad does NOT mean primarily " the struggle to please God " but indeed -- as both Islamic doctrinal writings ( especially al - Bukhari's ninth c. CE collection of Hadith , or traditions ) and Islamic history demonstrate - -" holy war . "
The so - called " greater jihad , " which emphasizes conquering one 's sins , is actually a minority Sufi ( Islamic mystic ) view that is based on an untrustworthy , probably forged , tradition .
Throughout most of Islamic history most Muslims , lay and scholar alike , have understood " jihad " in its Arabic dictionary -- and Bin Ladinesque -- sense of " holy war . " ( 1 )
Re : 2 ) & 3 ) As Vincent Carroll so eloquently explains , only a historical ignoramus -- or , I would add at the risk of redundancy , a tendentious PBS editor -- could produce the claptrap statement that the Crusades marked the first time Islam and the West met on the battlefield .
Islam began with one man in Mecca and , within less than two centuries , encompassed territory from the Iberian Peninsula to the Hindu Kush .
This expansion did not happen peacefully .
The Arab Muslim armies attacked and conquered Byzantine Christian territories in Syria and Egypt and , a bit later , Arab - Berber Muslim forces conquered the formerly Roman , but still Christian , cities and towns across North Africa and into what is now Spain and Portugal , ruling there for seven centuries .
Muslim armies invaded the Frankish Kingdom , later to become France , in 732 and were defeated by Charlemagne 's grandfather , Charles Martel .
Over the next three centuries the Sunni Muslim Seljuq Turks further dissected the Byzantine Empire , beginning a process that would be completed by their cousins the Ottomans , who conquered Constantinople in 1453 and ruled southeastern Europe for centuries .
( 2)
So the Crusades , far from being the first time Muslims and Christians fought , were actually merely the first time that Christians , after four centuries of defeats , really fought BACK .
( 3 )
Re : 4 ) Salah al - Din 's quote -- " this land has always been ours " -- seems almost an Islamic version of the old Soviet Brezhnev Doctrine : once you go Communist -- or in the case at hand , Muslim - - you can not go back .
" This land has always been ours ? ! "
That would have been news to the two major erstwhile denizens and rulers of the Holy Land , Jews and Christians ( not to mention Romans , Persians , Assyrians , Philistines , Canaanites , etc. ) .
Muslims did n't conquer what is now Israel / Palestine until the mid-7th c. CE .
And , as mentioned earlier , jihad existed in Islamic theory and practice long before the admittedly - nasty Crusaders showed up in the Middle East .
The reason it took so long ( almost two centuries ) for the Muslim world to expel the Crusaders was NOT lack of a militant ideology but rather lack of a sufficiently strong and determined state -- a deficiency which the Egyptian Mamluks rectified in the 13th c. CE .
Re : 5 ) The Ottomans had as one of their long - term , explicit goals the complete conquest of Europe and often declared jihads in order to further this agenda .
In 1529 and 1683 their holy wars took them to the gates of Vienna .
In 1828 they declared an ( unsuccessful ) jihad against the Greeks ' attempt to gain independence .
The Crimean War of 1854 prompted a jihad against France and Russia .
The Ottomans fought World War I as an openly - trumpeted holy war against the British , French , Russians and ( later ) Americans .
Now , one might argue that by the 19th century Ottoman jihads were merely a cynical , defensive propaganda ploy by the leadership of a tottering Islamic empire .
Perhaps .
But when the leading political ( sultan - caliph ) and religious ( shaykh al - Islam ) figures of the planet 's most powerful Islamic state call something a jihad , should we not take them at their word ?
Furthermore , it is worthy of note that far more people ( mainly Armenians ) died as part of that last Ottoman jihad against the Russians than died in all of the Crusades combined .
( 4 )
Two questions , to conclude :
Why are influential segments of the American media perpetuating and , indeed , promoting , historically inaccurate views of two major post - 9/11 issues : Jihad and the Crusades ?
And , more importantly , why does it matter ?
To answer the second question first : it matters because peoples ' view of history shapes their cultural and political views .
We Americans are constantly reminded to pay attention to the " Muslim street , " lest we callously provoke those millions for whom , allegedly , the Crusades of almost a millennium ago are still festering wounds .
Yet , as Carroll observes , " if the impact of the Crusades ' created a historical memory ' for Muslims , why is n't the historical memory created among Christians by the Muslims conquests of the previous five centuries worth mentioning ? "
To that could be added : why are n't the Ottoman conquests and jihads of the subsequent six centuries worthy of report ?
Indeed , for centuries Christian Europe lived in fear of " the Turk " and Luther even had a prayer specifically asking for deliverance from the Ottomans .
1683 is a lot nearer to our time than 1099 .
Attacks have not been all from West to ( Middle ) East , and it is high time the " Muslim street " received the solid food of historically accurate teaching rather than the milk of Islamic propaganda .
This is not merely a tu quoque spat but a matter of accurately and fairly addressing the issues that divide the civilizations produced by the world 's two largest faiths , Christianity and Islam .
( 5 )
Ultimately , of course , modern Americans are in reality no more responsible for the Crusades than , say , modern Mongolians are for the Eurasian depredations of their ancestor Genghis Khan ; less so , in fact ( since many Americans are descended from societies which had nothing to do with the Crusades ) .
What prevents this argument from becoming much ado about nothing are two things : 1 ) that Osamah bin Ladin and his ilk have been playing the " Crusades " card for a decade now , to no small effect ; and , what 's almost as disturbing , 2 ) many American college students have internalized the neo-Marxist , " blame the West first " attitude , presented in high school history classes , along with the requisite guilt .
Garbage in , garbage out then holds sway .
Regarding the Jihads of the last 14 centuries , the useful idiots at PBS and MSNBC also present an ahistorical view but take the opposite tack from that vis -à - vis the Crusades : rather than maintaining that the majority 's erroneous view is accurate , in the case of the Jihads the apologists claim that the majority view of jihad as " holy war " is not the real one and that a minority , suspect view is to be preferred .
Once again Islamic history is whitewashed and the hundreds of Muslim attacks upon , and conquests of , Christians and Christian territory are unquestioned or even glorified .
Once again , Muslims and non-Muslims are force fed a false view of history , from which they then construct a false view of reality : one in which the Christian West has always been the aggressor and the Islamic world the supine victim .
Why ?
Why do educated , allegedly objective members of the media attempt to inculcate such distorted views of history in Americans ' minds ?
Several theories come to mind .
One is that the leftward tilt of the media predisposes them to a critical view of the West , in particular in the realm of religious matters .
Many in the media being themselves irreligious , are appalled by putative Christians fighting a holy war like the Crusades .
And being critical of Western civilization , they automatically defer to non-Westerners when it comes to defining their own concepts , such as " jihad . "
Most journalists are rather ignorant of history but they do have some vague idea that European - American civilization has oppressed and exploited the rest of the world , particularly Muslims ; this makes media types sympathetic to non-Westerners .
None of this , of course , excuses such drivel as PBS , A & E and U.S. News have produced lately .
And in fact " it would be funny , this journalistic malpractice , if it did n't buttress the convictions of the fanatics . "
And , I might add , reinforce the anti-Western prejudices of our own young people .

I recently watched a PBS special called " Empires - Holy Warriors " .
It was made in 2005 .
I learned some interesting bits of history from it about some of the men involved and what they were like .
Nevertheless , I was uneasy about how the Muslims seemed to be portrayed in a more positive light and the " Crusaders " in a more negative light .
I know from reading history that the Muslims started their conquests of Christian lands back in the 7th Century and that their goal was to take over all of Christendom and force the Muslim religion upon the world .
So how is it that it is the fault of the Crusaders that we have these problems with the Muslim world ?
No , the Muslims were the aggressors and still are .
We all know the Crusaders did some very awful things like killing the Jews along the way , but the Crusades were , for the most part , in defense of Christian lands being conquered by the Muslims .
The Media needs to be held accountable for accuracy when they want to tell of historical or religious events .
I am very glad that Mr. Furnish is holding them accountable by exposing their false presentations of history .
Thank you , Mr. Furnish .

What a bunch of crap ; unless Jihad is accomplished with state sanction or is totally spiritual it IS terrorism .
As to the Crusades ; the Muslims tried to invade the West ; now we are allowing them to do it .
Common Sense Government - 10/17/2003
If you have read any of Dr. Furnish 's other works , you would quickly realize that it is his style to take one isolated point and make a broad , sweeping generalization about it .
Nun Yabiz - 10/12/2003
The Crusades were fought because once again the Muslims were trying to take what did n't belong to them .
Documents much older than the Qu'ran make it CLEAR ; Ishmael and his sons were NOT to have the land of Israel .
It is an IMPOSSIBLILITY that the " furthest mosque " was in Jerusalem because NO mosque existed there at the time the Qu'ran was written ( nor was it EVER mentioned if you say it was " revealed " until once again the Muslims wanted to steal what did n't belong to them . )
Nathan Machula - 6/17/2003
The actions of the Fatimid Caliph al - Hakim were some of the main reasons cited for the call to take up the cross by Pope Urban II .
Before 1000 AD , Christians were allowed passage to make pilgrimages to holy sites in Jerusalem and Palestine .
This practice was ceased , Christians were persecuted , and many were killed .
In 1009 AD al - Hakim destroyed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre .
Treatment of Christians ( including Egyptian Copts ) improved significantly under the subsequent Caliphs .
In 1048 the church was rebuilt by the Byzantine Emperor Monomachus .
Later , the Crusaders made several additions to the church .
At the same time , there was fighting in Spain , although not strictly Muslim vs. Christian .
My point is , there were many events in recent memory to fuel religious fervor against Muslims , definitely more recent than 300 years .
Nathan Machula - 6/17/2003
The " fundamental duties " you refer to are not outlined in the Quran .
They are derived from it , but the 5 pillars of faith of Islam were not formulated until after Mohammed 's death .
Greg - 4/24/2003
Perhaps we all read the same article .
However , most of the posts here have seemed to miss the entire point of this article .
The point ( IMHO ) which Dr. Furnish attempts to convey is that the youth ( even a lot of the no-longer - young ) of this nation get the majority of their historical information , specifically on issues of this nature , from the major media outlets .
These organizations continue , more and more , to spout the PC ( politically " correct " ) views rather than the HC ( historically correct - notice the lack of quotes ) when dealing with issues which might just piss people off .
In fact , I 've heard nothing out of these guys which contradicts this PC view .
The dangers of this include the fact that , at some point , the youth are going to become the leaders of our society .
If we continue to innundate them with misinformation and half - truths , how will they be able to confront these types of issues with any shred of clarity , specifically when the truth of history slaps them in the face - inevitably at the most inopportune moment ?
Adding to this is that the misinformation they 've received is specifically proclaiming that the " West " is to blame for the majority of the world 's problems .
Our future leaders will be tripping over themselves to be the first to make reparations to make up for our " gross misconduct . "
Fact is , if the media ( again , I 'm referring to the mainstream outlets ) will not stand up and allow the HC viewpoint to be presented , who will ?
High schools can't , or perhaps simply refuse to , for fear of the repercussions that often arise when issues even remotely related to religion are discussed .
Information sources which do deal in the truth ( such as this forum ) are often difficult to find ( I 've just this moment visited this site for the first time - I happen to be a student of Dr. Furnish - no , he did n't tell me to post , nor did we discuss this article in class ) .
Parents are often as misinformed as their children ( this has been going on for years ) .

Tim Furnish - 1/19/2003
I made a slight error in what I said about the Ottoman jihad during the Crimean War .
That declaration of holy war was actually only aimed at the Russians .
It was during the Greek War of Independence that the Ottomans included the French in their jihad .
Sorry about that , chaps .
Sean Conley - 1/17/2003
Tom , thank you for your compliment !
I feel that perhaps the scope of what Dr. Furnish so eloquently stated was missed in our replies .
His description of the issue is that the media , and in turn , our scholars , are missing the boat on what the muslim jihad is about .
I agree that to take Islam as a whole and make a caricature of them is a sad thing to do .
I do belive that was the point of the article .
Our so called " Free Media " seems to report on what the social impact of the jihad is , as opposed to what the historical and , by rights , the religious definition of the jihad is .
Dr. Furnish further states that not only is the definition clear , as well as dangerous , but it is used for all intents and puposes , as a blanket cover for any atrocity committed by the extremists .
True , the " greater jihad " is used to show the struggle to please god , but it has been twisted to become the militant jihad we are struggling against today .
Again , I think the point Dr. Furnish was making was that our media is the culprit of the confusion .
They can be extremists too !
Jim Grumblatt - 1/16/2003
I would just like to commend the author for elucidating historical analysis in a not - so - friendly political environment .
The fact of the matter is that conquest in the name of Allah has been the mainstay of Islam since its foundation .
The astonishing military accomplishments of seventh century Muslim armies are nearly unparalleled in the course of human history , and they provide overwhelming testimony to the martial character of Islam especially in its infancy .
It is not by some inexplicable coincidence that with the exception of Spain , which engaged the Moors in an epic , unprecendented 800 year struggle , no territory subjugated by force of Muslim armies has ever emerged from its unyielding dominance .
" There is no god but Allah , and Mohammed is his prophet " .
To pronounce this creed was for many a life - saving act ; to renounce it once it was professed meant certain death .
Despite many admirable qualities of the Islamic creed , Islam 's martial historical record cannot be denied .
Thanks for the article .

Richard Dyke - 1/16/2003
And further , Tom , the whole history of it does not matter in a significant way to today 's turmoil .
I respect Muslims , as I do Christians , Buddhists , Hindus , etc. , but if history is appropriate here for anything , it is in pattern rather than who has been aggressive or defensive or owned what turf in the past .
The pattern of history shows that there are lunatic fringes in every age willing to die for their ideas and take as many of us along with them as they can .
One could almost argue that if they did n't have an issue , they would buy one .
Extremist Muslims , extremist Christians ( remember we have abortion clinic bombings and at least one abortion doctor assassinated here ) simply must be dealt with .
There are a few people out there who can not be reasoned with and who would rather die rather than accept things as they are .
Most of us may not like everything , but we tolerate it .
Zealots in every age think God justifies their killings .
I do n't think so and I would guess most people do n't think so .
Certainly governments do n't think so .
If I were bin Laden or a Palestinian suicide bomber , I would be worried about whether I am really going to get those 70 virgins in Heaven for my deed .
God is all knowing , and He probably realizes that every deed has a reaction and a suicide bombing may , for example , result not only in the killing of the target , but even members of the perpetrator 's own group once the wounded government responds .
How will bin Laden answer before God that his bombing of the Twin Towers also directly resulted in the killing of thousands of his own followers in Afghanistan .
( Hard to answer ; that 's why zealots rely on the young to do the killing .
They have n't reasoned that far yet . )
Tom - 1/16/2003
Sean , your reply is eminently rational and non-dogmatic .
That 's what I 'm hoping for .
I am sick and tired of reading on the net cartoonish idiocy from people like Pipes who insist on depicting an entire people , civilization , a 1400 year old religion with a billion believers ( who are incredibly diverse in their degree of faithfulness , historical experience and so on ) as a caricature .
That is my complaint .
I agree that any definition of " jihad " must include its more extreme forms and reject any attempt to reduce the concept to a feel - goody notion palatable to the public .
But people like Furnish only want to focus on the extremist form of " jihad , " and arrogantly dismiss the non-violent interpretation .
His article seemed highly selective to me .
He cites a few selective media sources and then generalizes his argument to brand the entire media as proffering what is in his view an inaccurate view .
The western media I 've been watching and reading has hardly been kind to Islam .
To the contrary .
But then to some people ANY attempt to explain Islam from anything less than a position of hatred automatically brands you as unworthy of attention , and probably a supporter of bin Laden .
I seriously doubt Furnish would 've written such an article if these same sources he cited reduced " jihad " to mean ONLY violent struggle and nothing else , nor if they characterized the Crusades as TOTALLY in self - defense against an unremitting aggressor , undeserving of any condemnation whatsoever
I do not subscribe to his view of the Crusades at all .
I do not for one moment believe that the Crusaders were sweet blameless men fighting in self defense against a uniformly evil aggressor .
Sean Conley - 1/16/2003 Well
Tom , it seems that we must forget the past in order to forge a more beneficial future ?
Nonsense .
Lets take this apart in a systematic way :
1 ) Black vs. White ( or , us versus them , with us as the perfect saintly oppressed ) .
Hmm .
Yes , both sides of ANY conflict always believe that they are right and perfect in the eyes of god .
" Blah blah blah , we will prevail , yadda yadda yadda , god is on our side . "
Ya know what ?
ALL religions have periods in their history that show them to be evil .
Christianity - The Spanish Inquisition , the Infallibility of the Papacy , etc. Muslim - The Armenian genocide , the slaughter of missionaries , etc .
No one here is without blemish or stain .
Yep , we are all evil and all of us have history .
Your position here is weak , and makes little sense .
Dr. Furnish never said that we were saintly , just that the lack of research by the media is creating a false historical viewpoint .
2 ) Christian West vs. Muslim East .
If this was the Warner Bros .
Version , I would completely expect to have Hassan yelling " HASSAN CHOP ! " as he rushed my easily recognizable Bugs Bunny suit .
But this is just not so .
Yep , both ideologies were created in the east .
Your point of the " Christian West " being conquered by an eastern religion is True .
Just do n't forget to add the " Muslim West " as well , as you started to do earlier in the paragraph .
Stating it as you have , it appears that the " West " is ONLY Christian .
As far as stamping out the " pagan " religions of the indigenous peoples , I will not have discourse there , as " Manifest Destiny " is one of the saddest idealogues ever created , but it was not only done by Christians .
3 ) Stalinist Pablum ?
Yeah , most stuff on TV is pablum , and it does seem to have the revisionist feel of a Stalinistc purge .
Overall , your attacks on Dr. Furnish seem to stem from your dislikes of Daniel Pipes .
If this is so , please take your comments to Mr. Pipes .
Dr. Furnish quotes from sources other than Mr. Pipes .
Any stinging barbs for those authors ?
Best Regards , and please , keep reading and debating !
I eagerly anticipate your response !
Tom - 1/16/2003
Firstly , anyone who cites Daniel Pipes as a credible source of historical scholarship automatically disqualifies himself as a serious , careful scholar .
He instantly identifies himself as an ideologue , pure and simple .
Like so much of the idiocy passing for serious analysis about the history of the so - called " Christian West " and the so - called " Muslim East " since 9/11 , this article reduces a very long and complex interaction into a Warner Bros.
cartoon of black hats and white hats .
One side is always , always , unremittingly , timelessly , forever and ever and ever and ever , unchangingly the evil aggressor .
Their viewpoint and concerns and responses are ABSOLUTELY NEVER EVER EVER EVER to be given any weight or legitimacy , not one single shred of credibility .
Their viewpoint is ALWAYS , ALWAYS a pack of self - serving lies , they are ALWAYS uniformly the Dark Super - Villain whose humanity and complexity and dignity are to be dismissed in their totality .
Any attempt WHATSOEVER to question this cartoon is to be dismissed out of hand immediately .
While the other side is of course the ALWAYS TOTALLY blameless , spotless Beacon of Light that is ALWAYS in the right about EVERYTHING , never EVER to be questioned or criticized or disbelieved .
This is scholarship ?
What is ironic about so much of this moronic , Stalinist pablum that passes for debate is the ridiculous notion that Christianity and Judaism are western religions .
They are not .
In fact , these two EASTERN religions successfully imposed themselves on the West , wiping out indigenous European cultures and religions in the process .
If we are to reduce this historical debate to one of purely * extremist religious * conflict ( which is sheer stupidity ) then we must face the historical fact that this so - called purely religious conflict is one between religions all originating from the same region of the world , all originating from the same culture and people , whose practicitioners have far more similarities than they have differences .
The so - called " Christian West " is in fact a culture taken over by an Eastern culture .
For those who prefer to artificially manufacture and twist history to suit their own ideological dogma of ignorance and bigotry , for those who absolutely delight in and NEED to indulge in the Evil Other v. the Wonderful , Saintly We ( out of some primitive emotional desire for a people to Hate ) , there is thus absolutely NO NEED for scholarship , for research or books to read or TV specials to view or discussions to engage in .
Why read anything about this history when all we need to know is that They have always been the Evil Aggressor and always will be , and We are the Saintly Innocents , and always will be .
Why even debate ?
Why even study ?
Why read anything ?
Rod McCaslin - 1/16/2003 Could n't Dr. Furnish 's argument concerning the soft pedalling on the use of the term * jihad * also be used concerning the term Crusade ?
Osama bin Laden and similar militant islamic fundamentalists use the term crusader when referring to Europeans and Americans .
Nevertheless , in recent times the word as used by Christians and non-christians has taken on a less violent meaning than its historical origins imply , eg- the Billy Graham Crusade , the Crusade for Children , the Breast Cancer Crusade , the Patrick Crusade , et al- for the most part non-violent / humanitarian endeavors .
Using Dr. Furnish 's argument , an Islamic fundamentalist would be right in suspecting these programs as covers for Western violent expansionism since historically the term Crusade was used by various Western leaders to justify their imperialist aims .
Thomas Mackie - 1/15/2003
Thank you Dr. Furnish for writing on the pre-crusade years of Islam .
I am not even a midevalist but I knew the battle between West and East goes long before the Crusades .
Numerous PBS specials and shows have passed the edge of propaganda when dealing with Islam .
Who writes their scripts ?
Richard Dyke - 1/15/2003
I enjoy reading the views of historians and history buffs and the public on HNN , but my take on this article is that history is not too helpful in understanding the Osama Bin Laden and friends ' current jihad against the West , except in terms of repeating some historical patterns .
First , no political power on earth is ever blameless or saintly , or they would not be a " power . "
Bin Laden 's group is a tiny enclave with extreme religious views and murderous intent , and they should be dealt with accordingly , as has been done through history .
Action begats reaction .
The murder of 3,000 Americans in the Twin Towers can never be justified and force has and will be met with force .
When you have Muslims like Osama Bin Laden who feels justified in killing thousands , or Saddam Hussein who offers the families of suicide bombers $ 25,000 for their deeds , or ( let 's hit closer to home ) right - wing Christians who think they can kill people because they do n't like legal abortion , then these people have to be dealt with .
And it is not going to be pretty , as it never is .
It surprises me that so many people think the Palestinians are completely without sin , hapless victims of the Jews , when this same group attempted to annihilate the Jews in 1948 in the first Arab - Israeli War because Jews were streaming into Palestine .
The Powhatans tried to annihilate the Europeans in in the colony of Virginia in 1622 for largely the same reason -- concern that they were being overrun .
Both Palestinians and Powhatans paid a dear price to a " Pearl Harbor " style attack .
No , No , none are without sin , and people who use history or other justifications to cover their deeds misunderstand that ultimately and about everywhere , no one has controlled from the very beginning .
History is the story of waves of people overcoming other waves of people , who overcame still other waves of people , and students should be taught the patterns of history , rather than history as justification .
In short , as Mr. Furnish points out , our often incredibly uninformed media push a political line that is often against our own culture and political system , seeing others as victims and us as perpetrators .
Harold Pinter 's recent comments are along this line , suggesting that the West and the United States in particular , is a bully because of our real concerns about developments in Iraq .
He fails to put his comments in either a solid historical or political context .
Mr. Bush can ill afford the luxury of ignoring very serious developments in the Middle East that are a threat to American security .
The public would have his head if he did , and he knows that .
Oscar Chamberlain - 1/15/2003
Thank you for your responses .
I learned something from each of them .
I did reread Furnish 's article , and his argument concerning the use of the Crusades is more nuanced than I had first perceived .
( The facts that others brought up were also important . )
And , again , I agree that too many of the attempts to ( rightly ) show that Islam is not simply about violence have gone way too far .
We need sharp criticism of such simplicities and mistakes .
But I still think that Furnish does some questionable over - simplification himself by flipping the Muslims into the agressors and Christians into defenders .
Up to the Enlightenment , both religions believed in the unity of Church ( or Mosque ) and state .
Depending upon time and location , both had periods of toleration and terrible cruelty .
Both attacked and defended .
I am not sure that this was entirely even , but I do not possess the knowledge to decide who attacked whom most .
As far as the stated Ottoman desire to conquer Europe in the name of Allah up to the end of WWI , that is true , but the fact needs to stand in context with the considerable efforts of Christian nations of the same period to conquer in the name of God , the state , and the economy .
There is a lot of blood being spilled by both sides .
And again , I am not sure that the different meaning ascribed to " jihad " can be termed as legitimate and illegitimate .
In any event , it is more important to know what Muslims actually believe , and I think that varies far more than the writings of Mullahs would indicate .
I know that in discussions like this , generalizations are unavoidable , but I think that many of the generalizations being tossed into the public , are so simplistic ( and so often stated with such a deep tone of contempt -- whether for the West or forIslam ) that all they do is create satisfaction among those that agree , anger among opponents , and confusion everywhere else .
Having said that , I know that a mooshy sort of " we are all killers , we are all saints " rhetoric can create its own problems and misconceptions , particularly when trying to figure out what we should do next .
Still , in times of high emotion , it is useful to look at the facts carefully and interpret them carefully and to not add more anger than the facts require .
Alec Lloyd - 1/15/2003
The causes of the Crusades are many and far too complex for a single article .
Indeed , historians still debate this .
However , at their core , they were defensive in nature .
In 1071 the main Byzantine field army was utterly destroyed at Manzikert .
As a result , central Anatolia ( and its vital recruiting grounds and population centers ) was lost to the Muslims .
The heart of the Byzantine Empire was gone .
In desperation , the Byzantines appealed for aid .
Evidence suggests they wanted nothing more than some mercenaries and money , perhaps some small allied contingents .
Instead , they got a holy war .
Manzikert itself was a defensive battle to repel invaders , but you wo n’t see that anywhere , either .
Bill Heuisler - 1/14/2003 Mr. Chamberlain ,
You wrote , " Over 300 years lies between the Battle of Tours and Pope Urban 's call for the First Crusade . "
Have you forgotten The Byzantine Empire ?
Belisarius and other Byzantine Generals and Emperors defeated Vandals , Ostrogoths , Huns , Bulgars , Greeks and Persians to rule the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East .
When Heraclius concluded peace with the Persians at Ctesiphon in 628 all Persian conquests were returned to them and the Holy Cross was restored to Jerusalem .
But peace in the Middle East was shattered only a few years later when the Arabs under Abu Bakr burst from their Arabian homeland and began to fulfill the Sixth Fundamental Duty set forth in the Koran : Holy War .
From the defeat of Theodore , brother of Emperor Heraclius between Gaza and Jerusalem in 634 to the total subjugation of Syria , Mesopotamia , Persia , North Africa , Spain , the multiple sieges of Constantinople , taking the Balkans and the eventual attacks on Vienna , Arabs / Moslems were constantly on the attack before , during and after the Crusades .
The Crusades were futile reaction to ceaseless Arab aggression .
Arab aggression was reaction to the teachings of Muhammad .

If you have read Prof .
Furnish correctly , your criticism is not amiss .
But I bslieve you have misread him .
As I understand the article , all he is saying is that various politically correct American apologists for terrorism ( or mitigators thereof ) have solemnly asserted that Islam never attacked Christian nations and assumed or suggested that the Middle East and N. Africa are " Muslim " areas .
The simple fact is that the entire area from most of modern Turkey and the Middle East all the way to the Atlantic coast of Africa were Christian until conquered by Islam in the 7th and 8th Centuries .
By the same token , the Crusades were a Christian attempt to conquer them back .
Lest you have any questions : 1 ) I am not a Christian or a Christian apologist ; 2 ) I have no difficulty conceding that 7th - 8th Century Muslim conquerors were at least marginally more civilized and less brutish than the Crusaders ( who were , in their treatment of ordinary people , loathsomely murderous ) ; and 3 ) as between brutal despotisms , I could care less what their religion or lack thereof is .
Today ( though not as late as the 20th Century ) there is no comparison at all in either relative brutality or free and popular government between the West and the Islamic nations .
The worst European or even Latin American nations are at least equal to the best Islamic nations -- today .
As an historical matter , to read the history of Islam is to be steeped in hideous brutality .
Ditto for the history of Christianity .
A pox on both their houses .
Oscar Chamberlain - 1/14/2003
Furnish makes one good point .
The relationship between the term " jihad " and violence has been soft - pedaled .
He is right to point that out .
However , he takes this to an inaccurate extreme by suggesting that it is never used by Muslims to mean a more personal struggle or " self - improvement . "
Terms , particularly religious terms , can change in meaning over time , or mean different things to different people in the same religion and at the same time .
Given the testimony that these documentaries and articles have utilized to support their more pacific definition , either there is a grand conspiracy of liars , or this usage is fairly widespread as one meaning of " jihad . "
The flaw in these pieces is in not admitting that other more violent meanings do n't have legitimacy .
As for the Crusades as a counter - attack , that is a stretch .
Over 300 years lies between the Battle of Tours and Pope Urban 's call for the First Crusade .
Also the first Crusade was not about pushing back boundaries in response to attacks , but about going near the heart of the Islamic World and capturing a hunk of it .
To my knowledge there were no Islamic actions preceding Pope Urban 's call that required taking Jerusalem - - or slaughtering its inhabitants -- as a response .
Again , I am not arguing that the actions of the West in the Crusade provides moral justification for slaughter today .
I am arguing that looking back to the time of Crusades and finding them to be self - defense is as much bad history as the documentaries and articles he denounces .
In short , Furnish does no good to the discussion of Islamic - Western relations by simply taking the distortions of one group of comentators , turning them on their head , and spinning out unnuanced and inaccurate statements of his own .
All that does is add a new layer of distortions to a discussion that simply begs for clarity .
Steven May - 1/14/2003
It should be such a simple part of a journalist 's methodology to get the facts on such relatively exotic stories as Middle Eastern religion , culture , and history .
Why write from the hip ?
Why should a Ph.D. have to post the corrections when the journalists could have contacted him ( or a similarly qualified expert ) , before they posted their stories ?
Thanks for the clear additions and corrections .
They take two years to biodegrade – and Scottish mountains are littered with them
I have climbed Ladhar Bheinn , one of Scotland 's finest peaks .
The view was glorious .
And I threw a banana skin at it .
I have stood on the magnificent Aonach Eagach ridge and gazed down on Loch Achtriochtan .
And I threw a banana skin at that , too .
In fact , there are few mountains in Scotland I have n't thrown a banana skin on .
Forget all those energy drinks : nothing gets you up a ben like a banana .
What 's more , they come in handy biodegradable wrappers .
So I 'm practically doing the mountain a favour , feeding the eco-cycle of nature .
But apparently I 'm not .
The John Muir Trust , which protects many of Scotland 's wild places , has just given banana - skin chuckers a stern ticking off .
The trust estimates that there are now 1,000 banana skins strewn across Ben Nevis .
Walkers , it seems , do n't realise that it takes ages for a banana skin to degrade : two years , in fact .
This comes as a shock .
I have tutted my way round the litter - strewn shores of Loch Lomond and chased Mars Bars wrappers grabbed by the wind .
Now I find that I am part of a " significant minority , who are littering and spoiling the experience for everyone else " .
And it gets worse .
According to Keep Scotland Beautiful , orange peel , another of my happily jettisoned waste products , is pretty bad too .
Still , at least I 've never left a glass bottle .
They last 1 million years , apparently – though I wonder how they know .
A load of rot : how long your litter takes to biodegrade
Paper bag - 1 month
Apple core - 8 weeks
Orange peel and banana skins - 2 years
Cigarette end - 18 months to 500 years
Plastic bag - 10 to 20 years
A plastic bottle - 450 years
Chewing gum - 1 million years

What ’s sad about a dying civilization is that the only people who see it are those who have these traits :
Intelligent .
125 IQ points or above .
It helps to have real - world experience , but that cannot substitute for what Nietzsche calls “ sensitivity , ” or a fineness of discernment .
Sincere .
They believe in the scientific method of finding truth and value truth and believe pursuing it is their salvation .
Moral .
They are , as a great author paraphrased said , at a state of moral attention at all times , being aware of how people ’s actions will impact the world at large as well as other humans .
Everyone else is oblivious to consequences beyond the next paycheck , and cannot predict the outcomes of more than a single factor over more than a few days anyway .
Thanks to the Dunning - Kruger effect , they have no idea they ’re incompetent , so they pick theories that make them sound smart ( to them ) but in fact disregard whole ranges of vital data .
They are quintessential sophomores .
They like to use one - sentence , glib answers where thought is required ; in that alone they reveal they are not sincere , intelligent or moral .
But they think their cleverness hides the truth .
It ’s no wonder these things run in cycles : society gets wealthy , this enables people who are at the moral level of monkeys to become parasites , and then the parasites band together and make it illegal to point out truth , reality or other things that make unstable individuals experience self - doubt .
They make monkeytime , or an age of irresponsible lack of accountability , the law of the land , even though it ’s contrary to the laws of mathematics , information and nature .
As a result , the society plunges into dark ages for a while until a strongman comes along who legalizes reality and boosts people out of denial .
Then the process of civilization can restart .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The White House condemned on Sunday what it called the “ unjust suppression ” of civilians by the Iranian government and said the United States was on the side of protesters .
Four people died in Tehran on Sunday when pro-reform protesters clashed with security forces , Iranian state TV said , in the worst outbreak of violence since June ’s disputed presidential election sparked political turmoil .
“ We strongly condemn the violent and unjust suppression of civilians in Iran seeking to exercise their universal rights , ” White House National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer said in a statement .
“ Hope and history are on the side of those who peacefully seek their universal rights , and so is the United States , ” Hammer said .
“ Governing through fear and violence is never just , and as President ( Barack ) Obama said in Oslo -- it is telling when governments fear the aspirations of their own people more than the power of any other nation , ” Hammer said in a reference to Obama ’s speech this month accepting the Nobel Peace Prize .
Iranian opposition websites said eight people were killed as tens of thousands demonstrated across Iran during the Shi’ite Muslim Tasoua and Ashura festival on December 26 - 27 .
It was the first time people had died in street protests against Iran ’s clerical leadership since the immediate aftermath of the presidential election in which the opposition says more than 70 people were killed .
The unrest that erupted after that June vote is the biggest in the Islamic state ’s 30 - year history .
Authorities deny opposition charges that the voting was rigged .
The turmoil has complicated the international dispute over Iran ’s nuclear program , which the West believes may have military ends and Iran denies .
Tehran has rejected the year - end deadline set by Washington and other world powers to agree to a U.N. - drafted deal to ship most of its low - enriched uranium abroad in exchange for fuel for a research reactor .

On Friday , my friend / colleague Lisa Stolarski and I sat down with Rob Witherell , who is coordinating the United Steelworkers ’ freshly - announced plan to create worker cooperatives in North America .
This will be modeled after , and in partnership with , the Mondragon cooperatives of the Basque Country ( in Spain ) .
Here are some excerpts from our chat :
Q : How did this agreement unfold ?
Who initiated it ?
How did it develop ?
Well , we had a lot of interest in worker ownership in the past .
We ’ve done a lot of work with ESOPs .
We thought of doing some type of coops , both here and in Canada .
Our ESOP experience soured us a little bit because essentially it was short - lived .
By the time we were offered the opportunity to buy the shares the company was so financially strapped that it had a very small chance of success .
Those that did succeed were usually bought out by some other investor , and even earning those shares did n’t actually translate to any accountability to the workers or worker input .
It really did n’t change the nature of work in a lot of cases …
We saved Algoma Steel up in Ontario through an ESOP which was good initially but did n’t work out as we ’d hoped although we did save the plant by doing so .
So yeah there has been a lot of interest going over the last couple of decades and Lynn Williams , one of our International Presidents , has been very interested and active working on this in Canada .
I think they had a little more interested with the coop - stuff in Canada , and being a truly international union , we have lots of members in Canada so it opens us up to another experience .
So Mondragon specifically was somewhat happenstance as these things work out , because of where they are located in the Basque region .
They are near where another company called Gamesa are located in that area as well .
One of the people we had connected with through Gamesa also happens to be the Mondragon North American delegate …
So that ’s how the connection was initially made , just having conversations over the past year about the things that we are interested in doing , and what was important to us – what was important to them …
And they have interest in a North American presence and we have interest in developing a union worker - owner coop model that works , because we are in situations where that ’s going to be more beneficial in the long run for our existing members , or a way to build our membership .
Q : When did it really get rolling ?
When did the serious negotiations for the statement that came out start ?
It ’s hard to say .
It has been a series of conversations and e-mails and some drafts of what we wanted to do .
Ultimately our agreement was pretty basic and broad .
But we figured it was better to start with something that was broad and fairly simple and figure out where to go from there , rather than try to figure out all the details at first and figure out how to make that work .
I think one of the key pieces in making this happen is to build the alliances and networks and making these connections .
So I think Mondragon and the Steelworkers Union both acknowledge that if we are going to make this work , we probably need help doing that …
It ’s one thing for us to have some common goals and say hey , let ’s work together , and then it ’s another thing to actually get it done .
That ’s really the hard stuff for us , so we ’ve got to figure our situation and target and figure out how to make it work …
I think the figures I saw said there are about 14,000 people outside of Spain that work for Mondragon , but only about 10 % are also owners .
That concerns them because they want to grow more of the ownership piece .
They have gone in and taken over a place and set up without finding out what the culture and ideas are from the beginning , they have a hard time getting people to buy into being an owner .
Because ( the attitude is ) “ I ’m a worker , I show up , I get paid , and that ’s all I have to do . ”
So , that ’s really important to them , to make that work .
They understand that ’s not something you can carbon copy – it ’s going to have to be something a little bit different – you have to make some adjustments , but you want to keep the spirit of the workers having a vested interest , so that ’s why , for them , it made sense to work with us because we have a lot of those relationships and can help steer them in the direction that we can really help implement that model .
Our members are not making minimum wage and going from one job to another every six months .
These are folks that are making , hopefully , a living wage at least and are more vested in what they are doing than the population in general .
And so , that ’s important to ( Mondragon ) .
They are looking for somebody that is really going to be committed to the work that they are doing and that plans on staying for the rest of their working lives , essentially .
They create their own insurance for lifetime jobs …
Q : Do you have any projects lined up ?
Not at the moment .
There are a lot of ideas …
It ’s very preliminary and going to take a lot of work to figure out which ideas are going to be the most suited and also because their estimate is that it takes about 8 months , in their experience , from when they start talking to people to changing over to a coop …
Q : Do you have any sort of plan for accepting Request for Proposals ?
I think that we are partly saying this is what we are looking to do , so ( the announcement ) can serve that purpose .
We have gotten a lot of interest from people and are still trying to make as many of those connections as we can to see what possibilities are .
Q : Do you have any financing strategy that you ’ve been talking about for these kinds of conversions ?
Well , this is going to be the tricky part .
Going back to the family business conversion exmple that they have given us .
People become members when they put in something like 14,000 euros , so normally that ’s just a piece of the overall pie , but a substantial piece from the perspective of the workers , but you still have to figure out the rest of it .
Normally , they may have an interested coop interested in investing .
They may have farming an investment fund outside the bank .
That ’s kind of how they piece it together .
For us , we have friends in finance , so maybe there is a way to structure some of that , while still having the worker - owner goal .
There is the National Cooperative Bank in D.C. that is interested in getting behind some of this …
Q : Is the Mondragon Caja Laboral bank is going to invest in this ?
I do n’t know whether it would be the bank or one of the coops – I think there ’s a willingness to maybe participate a little bit , but they have been pretty firm that they do n’t want to be a venture partner …
It goes back to ( a ) It ’s a matter of having the money to do that and ( b ) they do n’t want to essentially just be a business owner and employ workers any more than they already are .
There may be some role for them to play , but I think it would be fairly small .
Q : Just to clarify , they are not planning to work with Steelworkers to create coops to be subsidiaries of their coops .
They want to create a whole Mondragon - type system in America ?
Right – they are looking for , willing to help us implement their model , a worker ownership model that is affiliated with them …
The key part for us is whatever we do first , we want it to be successful even if it ’s 5 people .
You want to be sure that it works right and is successful .
Then you figure out how to do the next one …
Q : Are you aware of other unions that are interested in this ?
Have any contacted you since the announcement and said that they want to get involved ?
Generally the answer is no .
I think our union is a little bit different – we are more willing to try stuff that is a little outside our experience .
I do n’t know that anything else is really invested in this yet …
Q : Do you have plans for educating your members and the public ?
Generally the piece is to pull all of our allies and friends together and figure out where the common ground is , where the common ideas are that we can work together and build from that .
So that ’s really the extent of the education piece because , again , depending on the situation , it could be way different from one piece to another .
A bigger piece is going to be a lot more complicated to create – a couple thousand member owners all at once , right ?
So it really depends on what are the opportunities that come up and how we deal with those .
The analogy that we were drawing on this week is the start - up of the blue - green alliance .
Very few people in the mainstream media– nobody really got it at first , right ?
And so , as it took formation and there was a lot of interest scattered about , it was a way to kind of channel those folks together , and it developed some momentum .
Now there are about 7 or 8 million people who are affiliated with it …
Thanks to Susan McLeod for speedy help with transcription of this conversation .
( Hi mom ! )
The original transcript has been cleaned up with some light editing , and the elipses ( … ) denote longer edits .
How many times have you heard the argument that small green actions lead to bigger ones ?
I 've heard it hundreds of times : habits that might scarcely register in their own right are still useful because they encourage people to think of themselves as green , and therefore to move on to tougher actions .
A green energy expert once tried to convince me that even though rooftop micro wind turbines are useless or worse than useless in most situations , they 're still worth promoting because they encourage people to think about their emissions .
It 's a bit like the argument used by anti-drugs campaigners : the soft stuff leads to the hard stuff .
I 've never been convinced by this argument .
In my experience , people use the soft stuff to justify their failure to engage with the hard stuff .
Challenge someone about taking holiday flights six times a year and there 's a pretty good chance that they 'll say something along these lines :
I recycle everything and I re-use my plastic bags , so I 'm really quite green .
A couple of years ago a friend showed me a cutting from a local newspaper : it reported that a couple had earned so many vouchers from recycling at Tesco that they were able to fly to the Caribbean for a holiday .
The greenhouse gases caused by these flights outweigh any likely savings from recycling hundreds or thousands of times over , but the small actions allow people to overlook the big ones and still believe that they are environmentally responsible .
Being a cynical old git , I have always been deeply suspicious of the grand claims made for consumer democracy : that we can change the world by changing our buying habits .
There are several problems with this approach :
• In a consumer democracy , some people have more votes than others , and those with the most votes are the least inclined to change a system that has served them so well .
• A change in consumption habits is seldom effective unless it is backed up by government action .
You can give up your car for a bicycle - and fair play to you - but unless the government is simultaneously reducing the available road space , the place you 've vacated will just be taken by someone who drives a less efficient car than you would have driven ( traffic expands to fill the available road - space ) .
Our power comes from acting as citizens - demanding political change - not acting as consumers .
• We are very good at deceiving ourselves about our impacts .
We remember the good things we do and forget the bad ones .
I 'm not saying that you should n't always try to purchase the product with the smallest impact : you should .
Nor am I suggesting that all ethical consumption is useless .
Fairtrade products make a real difference to the lives of the producers who sell them ; properly verified goods - like wood certified by the Forest Stewardship Council or fish approved by the Marine Stewardship Council - are likely to cause much less damage than the alternatives .
But these small decisions allow us to believe that our overall performance is better than it really is .
So I was n't surprised to see a report in Nature this week suggesting that buying green products can make you behave more selfishly than you would otherwise have done .
Psychologists at the University of Toronto subjected students to a series of cunning experiments ( pdf ) .
First they were asked to buy a basket of products ; selecting either green or conventional ones .
Then they played a game in which they were asked to allocate money between themselves and someone else .
The students who had bought green products shared less money than those who had bought only conventional goods .
The researchers call this the " licensing effect " .
Buying green can establish the moral credentials that license subsequent bad behaviour : the rosier your view of yourself , the more likely you are to hoard your money and do down other people .
Then they took another bunch of students , gave them the same purchasing choices , then introduced them to a game in which they made money by describing a pattern of dots on a computer screen .
If there were more dots on the right than the left they made more money .
Afterwards they were asked to count the money they had earned out of an envelope .
The researchers found that buying green had such a strong licensing effect that people were likely to lie , cheat and steal : they had established such strong moral credentials in their own minds that these appeared to exonerate them from what they did next .
Nature uses the term " moral offset " , which I think is a useful one .
So perhaps guilt is good after all .
Campaigners are constantly told that guilt - tripping people is counterproductive : we have to make people feel better about themselves instead .
These results suggest that this is n't very likely to be true .
They also offer some fascinating insights into the human condition .
Maybe the cruel old Christian notion of original sin was n't such a bad idea after all .

The Atlas detector will join the hunt for the Higgs boson particle Engineers have sent proton particles all the way round the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) machine for the first time in more than a year .
But they still do not have a stable circulating beam ; this step is expected to happen after 0600 GMT on Saturday .
The LHC is housed in a 27 km - long circular tunnel some 100 m beneath the French - Swiss border .
It will smash together beams of protons in a bid to shed light on the nature of the Universe .
The LHC has been shut down for repairs since an accident in September 2008 .
Operated by the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( Cern ) , the LHC will create similar conditions to those which were present moments after the Big Bang .
We have no idea where the chinks in our understanding of the Universe are going to become apparent
Dr Tara Shears , University of Liverpool
What is the Large Hadron Collider ?
Q&A : Repairs to the LHC
There are some 1,200 " superconducting " magnets arranged end - to - end in the underground tunnel .
These magnets bend proton beams in opposite directions around the main " ring " at close to the speed of light .
At allotted points around the tunnel , the proton beams cross paths , smashing into one another with enormous energy .
Scientists will scour the wreckage of the collisions for discoveries that should extend our knowledge of physics .
On Friday evening , engineers sent a beam around the LHC 's 27 km - long ring for the first time since September 2008 .
Engineers are expected to continue sending protons around the collider overnight .
The beams themselves are made up of " packets " - each about a metre long - containing billions of protons .
The protons would disperse if left to their own devices .
So once beams are circling the LHC , they have to be stabilised .
This involves using electrical forces to " capture " the protons , keeping them tightly huddled in packets .
The LHC was designed to run at energies of seven trillion electron volts .
But the machine will clash together protons at energies of just 3.5 trillion electron volts ( TeV ) in its first few months of operation .
1 - 14 quadrupole magnets replaced 2 - 39 dipole magnets replaced 3 - More than 200 electrical connections repaired 4 - Over 4 km of beam pipe cleaned 5 - New restraining system installed for some magnets 6 - Hundreds of new helium ports being installed around machine 7 - Thousands of detectors added to early warning system
" To get to 3.5 ( TeV ) is fantastic , because that is further than we have ever looked before , " said Dr Tara Shears , a physicist at the University of Liverpool , UK , who will be studying data from the LHC .
" We have no idea where the chinks in our understanding of the Universe are going to become apparent .
Anything which lets us see further than we have already is immensely valuable . "
To much fanfare , engineers first circulated a beam all the way around the LHC on 10 September 2008 .
But just nine days later , an electrical fault in one of the connections between superconducting magnets caused a tonne of liquid helium to leak into the tunnel .
Engineers carried out a " beam test " last month Liquid helium is used to cool the LHC to its operating temperature of 1.9 kelvin ( - 271C ; - 456 F ) .
The machine has been shut down ever since the accident , to allow repairs to take place .
The damage caused to the collider meant 53 superconducting magnets had to be replaced and about 200 electrical connections repaired .
Engineers have also been installing a new early warning system which could prevent incidents of the kind which shut down the experiment .
Cern has spent some 40 m Swiss Francs ( £ 24 m ) on repairs to the collider .

The study , published in the journal Advances in Therapy​ , is said to be the first clinical trial to employ the combination of glucosamine omega - 3 fatty acids in people suffering from osteoarthritis .
UK - based Seven Seas funded the study .
Approximately seven million people in the UK alone are reported to have long - term health problems associated with arthritis .
Around 206 million working days were lost in the UK in 1999 - 2000 , equal to £ 18 billion ( € 26 billion ) of lost productivity .
Talking to NutraIngredients , lead author and president of the CRO which performed the trial , Analyze & Realize , Dr Joerg Gruenwald said : “ In a randomized controlled clinical trial with 177 patients with osteoarthritis , we could prove that the combination of glucosamine sulfate and omega - 3 - fatty acid is superior to glucosamine alone . ​
“ Using the classical WOMAC pain score we could show 27 per cent more responders ( 80 per cent reduction of WOMAC pain score ) in the combination group compared to glucosamine alone , this difference was statistically significant , ” ​ he added .
The joint health market is dominated by glucosamine , which is extracted from the shell of crabs , lobster and shrimps .
Cargill also markets a non-animal , non-shellfish derived product .
The ingredient is often used in combination with chondroitin sulphate , extracted from animal cartilage , such as sharks .
According to the Nutrition Business Journal , US sales for these combined supplements were $ 810 million ( €563 million ) in 2005 .
Study details ​
Dr Gruenwald and his co-workers recruited 177 people with moderate - to - severe hip or knee osteoarthritis and randomly assigned them to receive either a glucosamine sulfate supplement ( 1500 milligrams per day ) or glucosamine plus omega - 3 fatty acids ( providing 444 mg of fish oil , of which 200 mg were omega - 3 - fatty acids ) .
“ Because the patients studied had moderate - to - severe knee or hip osteoarthritis pain , a placebo group was not used for ethical reasons , ” ​ explained the researchers .
After 26 weeks of supplementation , the researchers tested pain levels using the established Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthrosis index ( WOMAC ) score .
While there was no significant difference between the number of responders in each group when a minimal pain reduction of at least 20 per cent was used , significant differences were observed when a higher responder criterion of at least 80 pain reduction was used .
Indeed , the combination product reduced morning stiffness and pain in the hips and knees by between 48.5 and 55.6 per cent , compared to 41.7 to 55.3 per cent in the glucosamine only group .
Commenting on the potential mechanism , Dr Gruenwald and his co-workers note that the ingredient probably acted synergistically .
“ Omega - 3 fatty acids inhibit the inflammation process in OA , whereas glucosamine sulfate further supports the rebuilding of lost cartilage substance , ” ​they stated .

Al Capone is awake in his grave in awe at the criminal racket promulgated by the health care industry : a murderous multi-billion dollar industry that keeps the world ’s Superpower in the sociological Stone Age .
A recent study upped the figure of Americans killed by this enterprise from 20,000 to about 45,000 : that is fifteen 9 - 11 ’s a year of Americans facing a cruel , painful death at the hands of these prolific killers .
Some might say I sound like a demagogue .
When you are used to insipid soundbytes and P.C. - fluff , the truth starts sounding like demagoguery .
The fact of the matter is that the truth is extraordinarily painful in this country ruled by a peculiar Victorian fetish of the marketplace .
Nowhere in the civilized world could one imagine civic leaders fear mongering the populace about the evils of “ socialized medicine ” without getting laughed out of the country .
Unfortunately , these goons of capitalist oppression seem to have been collectively laughed out of the civilized world and into Land of the Free .
Nonetheless , the problem is not this visceral minority .
The problem lies in those that pretend to befriend progress : that grand , archaic organ of political oppression called the Democratic Party .
This increasingly irrelevant union of crooks , hucksters and swindlers has betrayed the American people beyond recognition .
Their failure to enact meaningful health care reform must be the last straw .
From the beginning of the current “ health reform ” debacle , the game was rigged .
Immediately , the only meaningful reform , “ single payer , ” was taken off the table , and progressives were told to rally behind a “ strong public option ” by Democratic front groups like Moveon.org and Health Care for America Now ( HCAN ) .
These two NGO ’s organized numerous “ rallies ” in order to command a feeble subservience to the Democratic leadership ahead of their caving to corporate interests on the issue .
Meanwhile , single - payer activists were placed in the precarious position of having to advocate against the meaningless and amorphous “ strong public option ” and the tea - baggers all at once .
In a country so dominated by trivial soundbytes , you have to be either “ for or against ” everything : no shades of gray , no third way .
Unfortunately , many progressives got caught in the trap and started rallying behind a bill ( Obama ’s Health Care Bill HR 3200 ) that no one knew anything about .
This clever catch all was meant to accomplish exactly that : institute no meaningful reform while tricking a significant portion of progressives into thinking that we were now seeing “ The change we can believe in . ”
Nonetheless , single - payer activists were thrown a couple bones .
One was a promise of a vote on the “ Weiner Amendment ” on the house floor .
This amendment would have replaced the current bill with HR 676 : the single - payer bill .
The other , more meaningful bone was the “ Kucinich Amendment , ” which would have lifted loopholes that prevent individual states from enacting single - payer legislation .
This approach seemed more tactically sound than expecting much of an up - down vote on single - payer on the house floor .
The Canadian health system was enacted province - by - province , and it seemed reasonable to expect the same here : the more “ enlightened ” states lead the way , attract a significant spike in businesses fleeing other states so as to cut health expenses , and gradually the states fall like dominoes .
Kucinich told a crowd in Aurora , IL this summer to focus on his amendment .
He informed us that the Single - Payer vote ( Weiner Amendment ) was a smoke screen doomed to failure because of the lack of adequate time to organize sufficiently for the vote .
I then attended several organizing meetings and stressed the need to emphasize the Kucinich Amendment as the most tactically prescient step forward for single - payer activists .
I suggested that people not bite the Weiner amendment bait .
As a veteran of the NGO industrial complex , I saw the Weiner Amendment for what it was : a chance for progressive Democrats and single - payer NGO ’s to claim victory ( just by bringing the issue to a vote ) , and to thus muster some fund - raising .
I could picture the fund - raising letter : “ Dear Single - Payer Activist , today we scored a major victory in the House of Representatives by bringing Single Payer Health Care to a vote for the first time .
But there remains a lot of work to be done in order to win the vote in the future .
Please help us in this mission by donating today . ”
Unfortunately , many activists bit the bait .
Action alert after action alert instructed people to call their reps and urge them on the Weiner Amendment .
In the end , both the Kucinich and Weiner amendments were removed from consideration by house leadership this past week .
Meanwhile , Democratic cheerleaders have been trumpeting the success at instituting a “ public option ” in both the House and Senate versions of the health reform bill .
The proposed public option will cover about 3 % of the population , while roughly 33 % of Americans are un- or under - insured .
Many progressive democrats inform me that this is the best we can realistically do given the conservative dynamics of the American populace .
I do n’t understand what American populace they are talking about .
As someone who goes out to the bungalow belt of Chicago to knock on doors practically everyday , I can say with full confidence that only an insignificant wacko minority is repelled by the thought of “ Medicare for all . ”
Perhaps we can figure out a way to leave those few people out when we finally do institute a single - payer system .
Progressive leaders have fallen to the right of the American people .
Americans crave and need meaningful health care reform in line with the remainder of the civilized world .
They crave and need leadership in Washington that stands for the interests of their constituents : leaders that are n’t fearful of lifting their heads above the fray , pounding their fists on the podium and declaring “ It is time we shut this racket down .
Let us throw the insurance companies into the dustbin of history once and for all , and end this domestic terrorism that kills 45,000 Americans a year ! ”
Unfortunately , to get to this point , we are going to have to purge the Congress of almost every last one of its members , and stop thinking that the Democrats or the NGO industrial complex will ever bring Americans their cherished Medicare - for - all .
This will be a more frivolous post than usual , in part due to the holiday season .
I recently happened across the following video , which exploits a simple rhetorical trick that I had not seen before :
If nothing else , it ’s a convincing ( albeit unsubtle ) demonstration that the English language is non-commutative ( or perhaps non-associative ) ; a linguistic analogue of the swindle , if you will .
Of course , the trick relies heavily on sentence fragments that negate or compare ; I wonder if it is possible to achieve a comparable effect without using such fragments .
A related trick which I have seen ( though I cannot recall any explicit examples right now ; perhaps some readers know of some ? ) is to set up the verses of a song so that the last verse is identical to the first , but now has a completely distinct meaning ( e.g. an ironic interpretation rather than a literal one ) due to the context of the preceding verses .
The ultimate challenge would be to set up a Möbius song , in which each iteration of the song completely reverses the meaning of the next iterate ( cf. this xkcd strip ) , but this may be beyond the capability of the English language .
On a related note : when I was a graduate student in Princeton , I recall John Conway ( and another author whose name I forget ) producing another light - hearted demonstration that the English language was highly non-commutative , by showing that if one takes the free group with 26 generators and quotients out by all relations given by anagrams ( e.g. ) then the resulting group was commutative .
Unfortunately I was not able to locate this recreational mathematics paper of Conway ( which also treated the French language , if I recall correctly ) ; perhaps one of the readers knows of it ?
A former high - ranking California State University official collected more than $ 150,000 in improper expense reimbursements over three years , including claims for unnecessary trips to locales such as Amsterdam and Shanghai , meals that exceeded allowable amounts and commutes between his Northern California home and Cal State ’s Long Beach headquarters , a state audit has found .
The audit , released Wednesday , also scolds the university for a lack of oversight in approving expenses that were “ unnecessary and not in the best interest of the university or the state . ”
It comes at an especially troublesome time for the system , which recently has taken a series of controversial actions , such as steep student fee hikes , enrollment reductions and drastic cost - cutting measures across the 23 - campus system to help close a half - billion - dollar budget gap .
University officials said the subject of the audit is David J. Ernst , the former chief of information technology services .
Ernst left Cal State in July 2008 for reasons not related to the audit , officials said , and is now associate vice president for information resources and communications at the University of California .
An assistant in Ernst ’s office said he was traveling and could not immediately be reached for comment .
Tony Blair has yet to testify before Sir John Chilcot 's inquiry into the Iraq war , but he must already be squirming after the first week 's evidence .
Contrary to expectations , the mandarins have not pulled their oh - so - elegant punches .
Freed from obligations of loyalty , they appear to be addressing the fundamental questions .
Germany 's Angela Merkel and France 's Nicolas Sarkozy must be congratulating themselves on their choice of EU president .
Had they been blinded by Mr Blair 's stardust , the presidency would already have been badly tarnished .
On day one , we learned that British officials picked up the drumbeats from Washington soon after George Bush 's election but had dismissed overthrowing the Iraqi leadership because " it had no basis in law " .
Sir Peter Ricketts , a former chairman of the joint intelligence committee and now the top official of the Foreign Office , said that up until March 2002 , Whitehall distanced itself from regime change .
Just one month later , Mr Blair told Mr Bush that he would support military action " to bring about regime change " .
On day two , the inquiry heard how Mr Blair was told 10 days before the start of the war that Saddam 's weapons of mass destruction had been dismantled .
In the run-up to war , ministers were repeatedly told of " huge gaps in intelligence " .
This contrasts with Mr Blair 's foreword to the September 2002 dossier in which he wrote that the intelligence had established " beyond doubt " that Saddam had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons .
In fact , there was plenty of doubt .
Then came Sir Christopher Meyer , former Washington ambassador , who said that Blair 's government had decided up to a year before the invasion that it was a complete waste of time resisting the apparently inevitable , but that there could have been a different outcome had Mr Blair succeeded in delaying the invasion by withholding British co-operation .
Not all of these accounts should be taken at face value .
Some , such as Sir Christopher 's , could be self - serving .
But few would doubt the integrity or weight of the judgment that Sir Jeremy Greenstock , Britain 's ambassador to the UN at the time of the war , delivered yesterday .
Revealing that he had threatened to resign at one stage , he said he regarded Britain 's participation in military action as of questionable legitimacy , in that it did not have the backing either of the majority of UN member states or of the majority of people in this country .
No one is on trial in this inquiry , although it might hear evidence that could be used as a basis for criminal prosecution .
Nor should all of Britain 's misfortunes in Iraq be blamed on Mr Blair .
What is already clear from the first week alone is that the decisions , secret or otherwise , that led to war were the product of systemic failure .
Intelligence analysts , diplomats , in fact the entire machinery of the British government , proved supine against Washington 's will .
Under that pressure , almost everyone buckled .
Few in the Foreign Office woke up to the revolutionary effect of toppling a Sunni Arab regime , of which Iran would be the chief beneficiary .
This in itself is a major analytical failure , the consequences of which the FCO is having to grapple with to this day .
The lingering question is not what went wrong in Iraq , but whether the disaster could be repeated .
Next week Barack Obama will commit the US to a troop surge in Afghanistan , a decision in which Britain will once again be in lockstep .
At the same time , plans are now being laid to ratchet up UN sanctions against Iran .
Neither the US nor Britain has kicked the intervention habit , and the conflict in Iraq is also far from over .
So what confidence is there that another major military escalation in Afghanistan is based on sound intelligence , judgment and analysis ?
The chilling aspect of this week 's evidence is that it sounds not so much a description of the past but the present .

The United States has begun talks with Russia and a United Nations arms control committee about strengthening Internet security and limiting military use of cyberspace .
American and Russian officials have different interpretations of the talks so far , but the mere fact that the United States is participating represents a significant policy shift after years of rejecting Russia ’s overtures .
Officials familiar with the talks said the Obama administration realized that more nations were developing cyberweapons and that a new approach was needed to blunt an international arms race .
In the last two years , Internet - based attacks on government and corporate computer systems have multiplied to thousands a day .
Hackers , usually never identified , have compromised Pentagon computers , stolen industrial secrets and temporarily jammed government and corporate Web sites .
President Obama ordered a review of the nation ’s Internet security in February and is preparing to name an official to coordinate national policy .
Last month , a delegation led by Gen. Vladislav P. Sherstyuk , a deputy secretary of the Russian Security Council and the former leader of the Russian equivalent of the National Security Agency , met in Washington with representatives from the National Security Council and the Departments of State , Defense and Homeland Security .
Officials familiar with these talks said the two sides made progress in bridging divisions that had long separated the countries .

More than six months after U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder told reporters that the feds would end their raids and prosecutions of medical marijuana patients , the promise has finally been put on paper and sent out as a policy memorandum addressed to federal prosecutors in the 13 states where the medicinal use of marijuana is legal .
The memo , penned by Deputy A.G. David Ogden and sent out Oct. 19 , advises federal prosecutors to focus pot investigations and prosecutions on " core federal enforcement priorities . "
The Department of Justice is " committed " to enforcing the federal prohibition scheme codified in the Controlled Substances Act – and marijuana distribution in the U.S. is the " single largest source of revenue for the Mexican cartels , " writes Ogden .
But in an effort to make " efficient and rational use " of " limited " funds , " as a general matter " the DOJ policy now states that those funds should not be spent to pursue " individuals whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana . "
The policy makes final a campaign promise made by President Barack Obama ; nonetheless , in the weeks after Obama 's inauguration , raids of California medi-pot dispensaries by the Drug Enforcement Administration had picked up .
In February , Holder promised the practice would not be ongoing : " What the president said during the campaign , you 'll be surprised to know , will be consistent with what we 'll be doing here in law enforcement . "
Now , it appears that will be the case .
According to the memo , people using pot in compliance with state laws should not be put in the crosshairs of federal law enforcers .
" For example , prosecution of individuals with cancer or other serious illnesses who use marijuana ... or those caregivers in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state law who provide such individuals with marijuana , is unlikely to be an efficient use of limited federal resources , " reads the memo .
" On the other hand , " it continues , prosecution of " commercial enterprises that unlawfully market and sell " dope outside the state - sanctioned schemes will not get a pass – and , Ogden 's memo notes , there are those who will use the state medi-mari laws as a " mask " for illegal operations , " and federal law enforcement should not be deterred by such assertions when otherwise pursuing the Department 's core enforcement priorities . "
Unlawful possession or use of a firearm , selling to minors , and employing violence are all among " characteristics " that " may indicate illegal drug trafficking activity of potential federal interest . "
Pot -law reformers were , not surprisingly , pleased with the memo , but Texas ' own GOP U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith was not .
Smith , who is a ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee , instead felt that championing prohibition and sacrificing states ' rights was the way to go – a rather ironic position for any Republican , let alone Central Texas ' Smith , who told San Antonio 's KSAT news in September that medical decisions should be made by the individual and not the government .
Moreover , he said he was against Obama 's health care reform because it would cost too much and do too little .
( As opposed to the drug war , which , ahem , has done so much with so little ? )
The new policy , Smith said in a statement , was as good as telling federal narcos to ignore federal drug laws .
As a result , he said , the Obama administration is " tacitly condoning the use of marijuana in the U.S. " and undermining the plan to attack Mexican drug cartels .
( How that would be the case is unknown since the pot that is legal for medical marijuana must be grown and used in - state . )
The way to " win the war on drugs , " he opined , is to get the narcos to " investigate and prosecute all medical marijuana dispensaries and not just those that are merely fronts for illegal distribution . "
Meanwhile , medi - pot - law advocates say that instituting the new policy is likely to help laws pass in additional states .
" Federal hostility is an objection " to passing medi-mari laws , wrote Bruce Mirken , communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project , in an e-mail .
The objection " is constantly raised by legislators and governors , either in the form of ( unfounded ) fear that states would be violating federal law , or that they would be setting up their citizens for federal prosecution , " he continued .
Bills are currently pending in four states : New Hampshire , New York , New Jersey , and Illinois .
Statement to Employees by Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Mike Hayden on the Associate Director for Military Affairs
July 10 , 2008
Major General John T. Brennan , our Associate Director for Military Affairs , has announced his intention to retire from the Air Force after 32 years of distinguished service .
He will conclude his assignment at CIA on 1 August .
For the past two and a half years , John has led one of our defining missions : to provide accurate , insightful , and actionable intelligence to military commanders and warfighters .
He has been our Agency ’s principal bridge to DoD .
John deserves great credit for the advances we have made in supporting the troops on the ground and integrating our powerful capabilities with those of the military .
Secretary Gates said recently that “ there has never been a better fusion of military operations and intelligence in the history of warfare . ”
John helped get us there while building a strong new ADMA organization during his tenure .
Please join me in thanking him for his important contributions to America ’s security , both through his work at CIA and in his previous posts of duty .
On 2 August , Major General Mark A. Welsh III , USAF , will become our new ADMA .
Mark comes to CIA after serving as Vice Commander , Headquarters Air Education and Training Command at Randolph Air Force Base in Texas , and , before that , as Deputy Commander of the Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence , Surveillance , and Reconnaissance for U.S. Strategic Command .
Mark entered the Air Force in 1976 as a graduate of the Air Force Academy , where he would later serve as Commandant of Cadets .
He is a command pilot with more than 3,200 flying hours and has held a wide variety of operational , command , and staff positions .
CIA has been fortunate to have talented officers guiding our relationship with the United States Armed Forces .
When he arrives , Mark will find a very sound foundation on which to build .
Our collaboration with the military will be in very good hands as we continue to strengthen this vital partnership .
Mike Hayden
Pride
When one prowls the Internet , one encounters not only the raw “ opinion ” of the masses , but one gets it distilled into its simplest emotions , as they tap out a few lines on a forum or in chat .
Thus one gets the prevalent excuses of modern society distilled into their function as support structure for a fragile ego .
Under these circumstances , it ’s good all we see of each other is words on a screen , or anytime humans met through the Internet , mass murder would occur .
Recently I was fortunate enough to see a prevailing criticism of taking pride in one ’s ancestors .
The ingenue in question saunted to a place where he knew his opinions would run contrary to the norm , and in the guise of a question , posed an attack : “ How can you take pride in your tribe if you are n’t responsible for any of their accomplishments ?
Me , I can only take pride in things I ’ve personally done . ”
There were a variety of replies , most confused , because this was an open - access system which means that people come there to learn as well as attack , and one way one learns is by trying out ideas on other people .
But my reply to him is : “ How can you take pride in something you have n’t done ? ”
Of course , this will baffle most people .
“ But — you — said … ”
No – what is important here is that without what your ancestors did , you would n’t have the abilities you do today .
If they had not undertaken the task of creating fire , and hunting larger game animals , and moving north , and doing all the things that made them – and you – what they are , your intelligence , strength and appearance today would be remarkably different .
Thus it ’s foolish to claim pride only in what you have done , as you are a product of your ancestors ; further , pride in ancestors is a separate kind of pride , much as one has pride in family and friends , and it ’s a loving , positive pride .
Only someone lacking such a thing would criticize it in others .
But all of that is by way of argumentation .
I want to talk about pride , specifically the question , “ How can we have pride and healthy self - esteem while being human , and seeing what humans have done ? ”
After all , we ’ve cut down most of the trees , and we ’ve strewn every single yard of open land and open seafloor with trash and toxic remnants of our machinery .
We ’ve slaughtered natural fish resources to the point where they are in decline , and we ’ve eliminated more species than we can count by encroaching upon their unique , natural habitats and replacing them with generic concrete malls , hotels , shopping centers , bus stops and government buildings .
How are we supposed to have pride in a species that is so neurotic about death that it cannot see outside of its own narrow worldview ?
We are told we should have “ pride ” in how our society is now treating the handicapped , mentally ill , women , homosexuals , transvestites , drug users , criminals and minorities , but how can we have pride in something that sacrifices all else for that goal ?
And further , does n’t achieve that goal – while they ’re being treated better , they ’re being forced into a mould of equality that defines us all according to a heavenly ideal , the bureaucratic creation of the average human , and thus denies us all below and above that state , if it can .
Fails the goal , and destroys everything else – this is n’t a source of pride , but of horror .
Furthermore , let ’s look at the products of this society .
Every nice place , filled with a diversity of species and beautiful or even “ rugged beautiful ” landscapes , is rapidly replaced by concrete roads , parking lots , and square , functional buildings with no elegance or pride in their construction .
Just like fast food : if it had to be graded , it ’s a C - or C , but everyone seems to think it ’s OK so it exists , and because it ’s what ’s there , it grows like a cancer .
Every beautiful continent to which humans have brought “ liberating ” modern society is now divided , fragmented , shattered , destroyed by a network of fences and roads and settlements which are strikingly ugly in their metal and plastic , repetitive in their forms and bureaucratic indifference to anyone doing anything different than that mystical “ average ” we received from our God as a commandment to equality .
Where are the free - roving game ?
The unbroken forests ?
And let ’s look at what we ’ve replaced them with .
The person of a modern time is not distinguished by caste , race , or gender , and thus is “ free , ” but they ’ve also conformed to the average .
Ugly , lumpy people , with poor constitutions – what kind of great society requires tons of Viagra and stomach acid medication and anti-depressants and laxatives just to function ?
These people are ill , in part because instead of preserving diversity , we ’ve mixed every tribe and race and caste in people until there is no clear design to their heritage .
They are literally “ spart parts ” people , made of whatever industry could cull from the mass and cram into an average , functional unit which will have a job , owe money on its credit cards , pay taxes and buy tons of stuff that will eventually make it into the landfills .
Some of our neighborhoods are nice - looking , and we have ceremonial museums and “ historic structures ” which show the kind of pride in making functional objects beautiful that clearly belongs to a long - dead time , but get out onto the main road and it is a long channel formed by shops and offices which exhibit the same basic architectural trait : average function .
They ’re square , with lots of heat - sealed windows , fluorescent lighting and other things abrasive to anyone with finer taste , but OK with a population raised on television and plastic - wrapped junk food .
Big plastic signs promising you a new life or new identity if you just slide the card and buy something cluster above the buildings ; trees are raised in nurseries and bred to take up only a certain amount of square footage and “ look pleasant , ” even though an unhealthy tree with no future and no past is about as attractive as our odds - and - ends genetics .
Even worse is the daily life expected of you : you ’re a whore to bureaucracy .
Wait in line for your food ; slide the card .
If it did n’t go through , please step aside , sir , there ’s other people who have a need just as pressing as yours .
Then you go to work , either clock in or mechanically greet coworkers who gossip about those who come in late ; file papers , talk on phones , follow regulations and most of all , do n’t offend anyone .
Even when you do well , and become wealthier than others , this is the reward waiting for you ; this is how you spend your time , which is the one irreplaceable resource you have , and it is servitude .
Even when you succeed , you do it by manipulating others , and being dependent upon them ; even when you are on top , you ’re whoring yourself out to bureaucracy .
We could even mention law .
“ One size fits all ” thus we cannot have both potheads and sober people , but a legally - mandated sobriety ( except for those massive profit centers , alcohol and cigarettes , of course ) which some people break and thus are designated “ bad . ”
We cannot have ethnic communities , as racism might occur , thus every neighborhood and every photograph used in advertising must feature white , black and asian , and increasingly , mixed - race people who are slightly more photogenic than the rest .
We cannot have some who are willing to live conservatively , and some who live liberally , thus a quasi- liberalism is enforced on all and no one is happy .
Here is your speeding ticket , sir , but I ’d take defensive driving if I were you – anyone with $ 40 and eight spare hours can do it .
Happy ?
Not inside .
Those who do not succeed become bitter , and those who do succeed become numb yet imperious to those who have n’t succeeded ; bitterness and hatred results , but since it cannot be shown openly , it is taken within .
This results in more children being molested , more wives being beaten , more friends alienated by unkind words and the “ lack of time ” that all of us legitimately have but also serves as an excuse for simply wanting to be alone , and bitter .
Alcoholism is a problem , but rehab is a huge business .
So is weight loss .
And nicotine patches for those who want to “ quit ” smoking , as if that act involved more than not smoking .
What a neurotic garbage heap of a world .
The bigger issues are the grimmest .
There are no strong leaders , no independent thinkers , no breathtakingly amazing art .
No tradition , except what one finds in churches , that is somehow OK with the entire waste of our world as long as someone mentions Jesus every wartime .
What do we have in place of Shakespeare ?
Endless plays about liberating women , homosexuals , minorities , drug addicts , criminals .
Who is our Milton ?
“ Fight Club ” ?
There is no grace in art , no will toward creation and surpassing the mundane state of mankind , but an embrace of that mundane , which is fortunate since that ’s where the profit lies .
To love the mundane , you must have pity ; to act out pity , you need priests , a bureaucratic government , and endless corporations to provide “ opportunity . ”
Most people are products of this system , and thus profit by it insofar as they are able to perceive , and therefore have no reason to have pride in their ancestors , in nature , in great achievement , or even in themselves .
It creeps up on you .
The road to hell is paved with good intentions .
Lacking a goal , and thus a consensus to our society , we elected for pity instead , and yes , we did bring many of the impoverished and women and minorities and criminals to a higher state of living – at the expense of any hope or future we have of our own .
Because society decided to average itself , and not reward excellence but reward profit and equality , we have effectively destroyed all that made people unique and worthy of self - esteem .
Diversity ?
Indeed , we now have the same mixed - race population that follows every collapsed empire , from Mexico to Egypt to India to Greece .
This society is not just broken , but its core values and assumptions are contrary to any meaningful or natural life .
So how can we have pride ?
For starters , by finding it in things other than our civilization at large ; we look at our own works , usually unrewarded because the best product is not the one that appeals to most people , thus is not the biggest moneymaker ; we look toward our families , who are raised well and bred well despite the onslaught of stupidity and disposable living ; and we look to our ancestors , and ancient knowledge , as a source of strength from the past and a blueprint for our future , once this diseased and neurotic civilization collapses .
Pride in one ’s ancestors is not only a meaningful and healthy mode of thought , but the only one that is opposed to our individualistic - average society .
And so I ask again , to our ingenuous assailant : how can you not take pride in your ancestors ?
and answer : because he is a product of this time , and not working for something better .
Vijay Prozak , 01/18/05
Since my son was born at the end of last year I 've had many , many opportunities to realise how lucky I 've been .
Not only is he an utter joy to be around but he's also a happy , healthy , bouncing little boy who eats pretty much everything and sleeps easily .
Even the arrival of teeth has , so far , been relatively untraumatic – nothing worse than a couple of days discomfort and some teething gel .
I know I 've been lucky because I know how easily things could have been different .
Friends with kids exchange horror stories about the colicky babies who can't sleep for longer than two hours at a time , for months on end .
The ones who will scream for hours every night after being put to bed .
The babies who can't or wo n't eat without elaborate preparation or persuasion .
Every baby is different , for reasons that have nothing to do with parental aptitude .
And even without those complications , a healthy and happy baby is still hard work .
Sleep deprivation means the first three months or more after birth are spent in a zombie 's fog of stumbling misery for both parents .
Minor events turn into major crises – just leaving the house , with or without the baby , takes on the status of an heroic expedition .
Finding time to have a shower or even eat becomes surprisingly difficult .
I can't begin to imagine the additional stress of going through all of that while at the same time recovering from childbirth – and possibly a major operation , if a c-section was involved – and in many cases having to learn to deal with breastfeeding as well as everything else .
We know , of course , that many women do feel overwhelmed by the experience , and that some are unlucky enough to suffer from severe forms of postnatal ( or postpartum ) depression , around one in 10 mothers in the UK and the US .
What is more rarely discussed is that fathers can suffer from many of the same symptoms and a significant percentage – 4 % , in one study – go on to develop depression .
That 4 % figure comes from a UK population - based study by Dr Paul Ramchandani and colleagues , published in the Lancet in 2005 , into paternal depression and childhood development .
It concluded : " Our findings indicate that paternal depression has a specific and persisting detrimental effect on their children 's early behavioural and emotional development . "
Exactly what the " detrimental effect " was is made clearer in a subsequent review by Ramchandani , published in the Lancet in August this year :
Most psychiatric disorders that affect fathers are associated with an increased risk of behavioural and emotional difficulties in their children , similar in magnitude to that due to maternal psychiatric disorders .
Some findings indicate that boys are at greater risk than girls , and that paternal disorders , compared with maternal disorders , might be associated with an increased risk of behavioural rather than emotional problems .
It should n't be surprising that men can suffer from such disorders too .
Looking at the NHS 's guidelines for maternal postnatal depression , the list of possible causes includes worry and anxiety about the responsibility of having a new baby ; relationship worries ; money problems ; having no close family or friends around you ; and mental health problems in the past .
The symptoms include : low mood for prolonged periods of time ( a week or more ) ; feeling irritable for a lot of the time ; tearfulness ; panic attacks or feeling trapped in your life ; difficulty concentrating ; lack of motivation ; lack of interest in yourself and your new baby ; feeling lonely ; feeling guilty , rejected , or inadequate ; feeling overwhelmed ; feeling unable to cope ; and difficulty sleeping .
It 's a rare new parent of either sex who would n't identify with several of those characteristics .
As with depression in general , though , it 's when perfectly normal responses to stress and circumstances are amplified and aggravated that illness can develop .
It 's important to note a couple of things here .
One is that the existence of paternal depression does nothing to diminish the fact of maternal postnatal depression , if anything quite the reverse , as I 'll explain .
The other is that more research needs to be done , although that 's hardly a stunning conclusion to arrive at .
But there is a point : what is it specific to men or fatherhood that can provoke paternal depression ?
What research there is suggests it is strongly linked with maternal postnatal depression .
A recent article in the New York Times noted :
By far the strongest predictor of paternal postpartum depression is having a depressed partner .
In one study , fathers whose partners were also depressed were at nearly two and a half times the normal risk for depression .
That was a critical finding , for clinicians tend to assume that men can easily step up to the plate and help fill in for a depressed mother .
In fact , they too may be stressed and vulnerable to depression .
So , the easiest way to prevent paternal depression would be to prevent maternal depression to begin with , while recognising that paternal depression is also a possibility .
Yet , in the prenatal and perinatal books and classes I absorbed last year , at some point there would be a brief and tactful section entitled " For the partner " , which would usually begin along the lines of : " During pregnancy and after giving birth , many women experience something known as ' baby blues ' .
This is not unusual .
But in a few rare cases ... " followed by a sketch of postnatal depression .
Given the prevalence and seriousness of maternal depression , that 's inadequate .
Looking back , all those classes about childbirth might have been more usefully spent concentrating more on what happens after you both leave the hospital .
Since my son was born , I can't think of a single aspect of my life that has n't been affected by his arrival .
That 's something that can be difficult to come to terms with .
Perhaps in my parents and grandparents ' generations , less was expected of fathers in the earliest months of a baby 's life – and we all know who got the raw end of that deal .
Although we can debate the extent things may have changed , fatherhood is now a different experience .
It 's right that fathers are involved as much as possible in the lives of their children , from the beginning : another reason why I 've been lucky is that the Guardian is an enlightened employer with a sensible attitude to paternity leave .
Other parents , especially here in the US , are n't so lucky .
Penelope Leach 's latest book , Child Care Today , published this year , argues that governments need to recognise the changed role of fathers , and suggests specific ideas for easing the financial pressure to allow families more time together .
That 's useful advice – although in the lonely hours of 3 am , with a crying baby needing to be rocked back to sleep , there 's no better advice for any parents than Leach 's own introduction : " Whatever you are doing , however you are coping , if you listen to your child and to your own feelings , there will be something you can actually do to put things right or make the best of those that are wrong . "
Holiday shopping ( including the hardest part that may be deciding WHAT to buy ) .
Wrapping Gifts .
Paying for gifts .
Decorating your house .
Cleaning your house for holiday visitors .
Sending Christmas cards .
Holiday baking .
Meal preparation .
Struggles with excited children .
A health challenge that is slowing you down .
Dressing for holiday gatherings .
Strained relationships with family members .
The list goes on .
There are many things that can cause us stress around the holidays .
There are also positive , helpful things that can relieve that stress .
Solutions that work !
Making lists and spreading out the tasks that need done can help alleviate being overwhelmed with too much to do .
When we write things down , and make a time plan for accomplishing all that we want to do , it can relieve our minds of the pressure of not knowing how everything will get done .
This year is a good year to simplify the holidays in terms of the material aspect .
With the economy in the state that it is , why not reduce spending and even preparations .
Would n’t the holidays be just as special , and maybe even more so , if we focused more on just gathering together and spending time together with our loved ones ?
When we recognize signs of stress in ourselves or in our children , such as irritability , crankiness , and changes in sleep patterns , we can take steps right away to address them .
Exercise is an excellent way to relieve tension in adults and burn off kids ’ excess energy .
Having a positive attitude and trying not to worry about ‘ everything ’ are two mental ways to reduce stress .
When you are thinking positive thoughts , it ’s harder to be stressed !
Meditation and other stress relieving , or calming , activities help many people manage stress .
Nutrition can play a huge role in how we feel .
That ’s because almost every organ system in the body is affected by stress .
If we target those organ systems with nutrition , we can get fantastic outcomes .
Fat and sugar can both cause havoc in our bodies and with our moods .
Stress - induced weight gain usually goes to the abdominal area – which for many of us causes even more stress !
The scientific reason is that chronic stress causes elevated blood cortisol levels , that in turn cause insulin resistance that prevents blood sugar from getting distributed to the body ’s cells , to be used for energy , as it should be .
Stress depletes vitamins and other nutrients in our bodies which gives more reason than ever to supplement our daily diets so that we are taking in more of our essential vitamins and minerals .
Many people are deficient in these vitamins and minerals and then to lose more from stress can put our health at even more risk .
Our goal is to have more of the following : better sleep , less anxiety , better focus and concentration , improved immune resistance ( to stay well ) , reduced cravings for sugar or alcohol , increased energy , better muscle tone and strength , and an overall better sense of well - being .
Nutrition can help us get there .
From B - Complex ( the happy vitamin ) to Vitamin C , and calcium , we can choose brands that will guarantee that our bodies are getting consistent potency of these ingredients so that they can do their job , providing safe and pure products that deliver the measurable results we are looking for , and that make a difference in our lives .
Adaptogens , in terms of herbs that benefit bodies experiencing stress , can re-charge the main body system that responds to stress – the adrenal glands .
These adapotogens help our bodies relieve the chemical imbalances that stress will cause , and normalize our body functions .
They include ginseng , ashwaganda , L - Tyrosine , Beta - sitosterol , and L - theanine .

George Michael on drug - taking and cruising for sex with strangers on Hampstead Heath : ' It 's just who I am '
George Michael and his boyfriend Kenny Goss :
The couple have an open sexual relationship
George Michael today spoke candidly of his drug use and cruising for sex with strangers , saying ' it 's just who I am ' .
The former Wham !
star confirmed he was caught in possession of crack cocaine when arrested last year in public toilets on Hampstead Heath , a gay cruising area close to his home in north London .
But asked when he had last smoked the class A drug , the singer declined to answer .
He told The Guardian newspaper he had cut back on cannabis and now smokes only ' seven or eight ' spliffs per day instead of the 25 he used to smoke .
The 46 - year - old defended ' cottaging ' on the Heath , saying it was ' nicer ' than picking up men in bars .
' The handful of times a year it 's bloody warm enough , I 'll do it .
I 'll do it on a nice summer evening .
Quite often there are campfires up there , ' he said .
' It 's a much nicer place to get some quick and honest sex than standing in a bar , E'd off your tits ( high on ecstasy ) shouting at somebody and hoping they want the same thing as you do in bed . '
Asked why he cruises for sex when he could get any gay man he wanted , George replied : ' I do get anyone I want .
But I like a bit of everything .
I have friends up there , I have a laugh . '
Over the last decade Michael has had a number of run-ins with the law .
In 1998 , he was arrested in public toilets in Los Angeles for ' engaging in a lewd act ' and was cautioned for possessing cannabis after being found asleep at the wheel of his car on two separate occasions in 2006 .
He said : ' I had a problem with sleeping pills for about a year and a half , and I f***** up really badly .
' I got in the car twice when I 'd forgotten I 'd already downed something to try to get me to sleep .
It does n't matter that it was n't deliberate – ultimately , I did it a second time , and I could have killed somebody .
' But the fact remains I was never accused of driving under the influence .
I got done for exhaustion and sleeping pills . '
George Michael snapped leaving his home at 3.30 am in 2005 .
He returned with three tubs of ice cream and some magazines A view of Hampstead Heath : Michael admitted he cruises for sex on the heath a few times a year - but only on warm nights
Asked about his average day Michael - who rolled and smoked two cannabis joints told how he gets up at about 10 am and after a Starbucks coffee and answer a few e-mails .
He added : ' At the moment I 've got nothing that pressurised other than keeping an eye on the video they 're making for the Christmas single .
Then , if I 'm in the mood , I 'll come up to the office in Highgate , do some work , writing , backing tracks or whatever .
Come home .
Kenny will be here , the dogs are here .
Maybe eat locally , hang out , and then probably go off and have a s**g or have someone come here and have a s** g . "
Asked if he was referring to his partner Kenny Goss , the singer replied : ' If it was s******g with Kenny , I would n't have to invite him round , would I ?'
He continued : ' Kenny gets his , believe me . '
Recently a number of stars have said they fear for Michael 's wellbeing , including Sir Elton John who enlisted the help of Bono .
Bono offered to help Michael after Sir Elton John spoke to him , the singer claimed
He added : ' Geri [ Halliwell ] told Kenny that Bono , having spoken to Elton , had approached Geri to say , " What can we do for George ? "
' This is what I have to deal with because I do n't want to be part of that social clique .
All I 'd have to do to stop it is hang out in London , so people realise I do n't look close to death . '
He continued : ' Elton lives on that .
He will not be happy until I bang on his door in the middle of the night saying , ' Please , please , help me , Elton .
Take me to rehab . '
It 's not going to happen .
' Elton just needs to shut his mouth and get on with his own life .
Look , if people choose to believe that I 'm sitting here in my ivory tower , Howard Hughesing myself with long fingernails and loads of drugs , then I can't do anything about that , can I ? '
He added : ' People want to see me as tragic with all the cottaging and drug - taking ... those things are not what most people aspire to , and I think it removes people 's envy to see your weaknesses .
' I do n't even see them as weaknesses any more .
It 's just who I am . '
What happens when you combine the I Am T - Pain iPhone app , a video - editing program , and “ Charlie Bit Me ” ?
Well , an auto - tuned song of sorts that sounds like a bonafide radio hit .
Video after the break .

The ruling means the archbishop can no longer wear clerical vestments
The former head of the Catholic Church in Zambia , Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo , 79 , has been defrocked by the Vatican .
He was excommunicated in 2006 for marrying and for attempting to ordain four married priests as bishops .
The Church said it needed to take further action because he went ahead and ordained some bishops in July , something only the Pope can do .
" Technically speaking he is now ' Mr ' Milingo , " Paul Samasumo , spokesman for Zambia 's Catholic Church told the BBC .
" When he was excommunicated , what that meant was that he was suspended from his membership in the Catholic Church , but what has happened now is that he has been dismissed from the priesthood , " Father Samasumo told the BBC's Network Africa programme .
The Church hopes that Archbishop Milingo will see the error of his ways
Vatican statement
Zambia 's controversial archbishop " He cannot wear any of those vestments , conduct mass , cannot baptise anyone . "
But the Vatican said his defrocking did not remove the obligation of celibacy .
A statement said the dismissal of a bishop was " most extraordinary " but had been necessary given the ordinations " carried out without pontifical mandate " .
" Nevertheless , the Church hopes that Archbishop Milingo will see the error of his ways , " it said .
His collision course with Rome began in the 1980s when his fellow bishops became uneasy about the popularity of his faith healing activities .
In 2001 , he married a South Korean acupuncturist at a collective wedding ceremony organised by the Moonies in New York .
He has denied that he is a Moonie and after his excommunication said his mission was to be the apostle of married priests .

They are n’t just an efficient way to store and perform functions on the information but also a way to get reports .
Free Support – Free service and maintenance are offered by the majority of the charity management program .
The site from where you have purchased software for your church might also have webinars , video tutorials , etc. to provide a practical demo of how to use the church computer software .
The service is limited for a period of three months .
The software suppliers provide introduction manual which contains directions that are a start - up .
In software , it ’s for understanding the functioning of the program enough .
A number of the applications providers also supply manuals having in - depth details of each aspect that might be in pdf or bodily form .
The treasurers , secretaries , and administrators are aided through an internet forum where they can hold one to one conversations with the experts concerning the financial , accounting , gift aid , etc. functionalities of charity management program .
After your support course is expired you ’ll need to pay for the maintenance and support which can be an annual or monthly contract or a pay per service .
Contract Basis –
This is a cheaper means of dealing as you must pay a fixed sum monthly or annual .
This is the ideal option if you ’re currently dealing with database and your church has software .
This sort of service is based that you might not have the ability to perform .
Let us say signing a contract is acceptable , when you will need an assistant for a very long time span .
Pay Per Service -
The software vendor will charge you for each call or email assistance given .
Training –
The sellers also give training for utilizing their church applications and charity management system which might be available remotely or via physical interaction .
Training sessions are conducted depending on the demand of the trainee .
The training typically is given in areas like finance , donation and gift aid , registration , etc.. according to the program .
The courses are done using desktop or laptop computer .
The courses undertaken create the trainee ideal for handling software they ’re performing the duty of fiscal planner , donation coordinator , membership coordinator , treasurer etc . .

Rumour has it that deep in the heart of the Pentagon is a network of computers which control the US military , the most powerful army on the planet – rather ironically they are controlled by a programming language named after a hard drinking 19th century mathematician and only daughter of Lord Byron .
As all true geeks will know the language is called Ada , after ( Lady ) Ada Lovelace .
In her work with Charles Babbage on a steam driven calculating machine called the Difference Engine , Ada understood , perhaps before anyone else , what a computer might truly be .
As such the Difference Engine is the spiritual ancestor of the modern computer .
Ada , who dined and drank with contemporaries including Charles Dickens and Michael Faraday and who was bled to death by her own physician aged just 36 , has been called many things – the first computer programmer and a prophet of the computer age – but most poetically perhaps by Babbage himself as an ‘ enchantress of numbers ’ .
The Ada programming language was originally designed by a team led by the French computer scientist Jean Ichbiah under contract to the US Department of Defense ( DoD ) from 1977 to 1983 to supersede the hundreds of programming languages then used by the Department .
S Tucker Taft has been heavily involved in the later Ada revisions , and still works with the language today as both a designer and user .
An industry leader in compiler construction and programming language design , he served as the lead designer of the Ada 95 programming language while employed as chief scientist at Intermetrics , Inc. , and helped to direct the efforts of a Language Precision Team .
He was technical leader for development of a Static Interface Analysis Tool ( SIAT ) for Ada on behalf of the NASA Space Station IV&V , and a generalization of this for C++.
Recently , he led the architecture and development effort of the Enterprise - Java - and XML - based ‘ Mass.gov ’ portal for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts .
He has published a number of papers on programming language design , and software development environments .
Tucker graduated from Harvard University , where he has since taught compiler construction and programming language design .
He is chairman and CTO of SofCheck .
Oregon and Washington State already allow assisted suicide
The Supreme Court in Montana has ruled that nothing in the state 's law prevents patients from seeking medical assistance to commit suicide .
The ruling paves the way for Montana to become the third US state alongside Washington and Oregon to allow patients to seek the procedure .
The decision comes a year after a lower court ruled it constitutional .
Doctors will now be able to prescribe the necessary drugs to the terminally ill without fear of prosecution .
The state 's Supreme Court said there was nothing in its precedent showing that doctor - assisted suicide was against public policy .
However , it did not go as far the district court , which ruled last year that the right of terminally - ill patients to ask their doctors to help them die was protected by the state 's constitution .
District Judge Dorothy McCarter ruled in December 2008 that Montana 's rights to privacy and dignity also covered a mentally competent , terminally - ill patient 's right to die .

Joya is on a speaking tour of the U.S. for her book A Woman Among Warlords : The Extraordinary Story of an Afghan Who Dared to Raise Her Voice .
She talked to Deepa Kumar about the situation in her country and the message she hopes to bring to people in the U.S .
Joya was elected to Afghanistan 's parliament from Farah province in 2005 , but was suspended several years later after other representatives claimed she insulted them .
She has continued to speak out against war crimes and warlordism , in spite of numerous attempts on her life .
Malalai Joya has been called the " bravest woman in Afghanistan " for her outspoken opposition not only to the U.S. occupation of her country , but both the corrupt U.S. - backed government of Hamid Karzai and the Taliban - led insurgency .
WHAT HAS been the impact of the U.S. occupation and its puppet government on women in Afghanistan ?
Has the U.S. liberated Afghan women as it claimed it would ?
FIRST , LET me say that after September 11 , the U.S. government threw us from the frying pan into the fire .
Over the last eight years , the U.S. , under the banner of women 's rights and human rights , has occupied my country , and millions of men and women have suffered from injustice , insecurity , corruption , joblessness , poverty , etc .
But women have suffered more -- for them , it is almost as if the Taliban was still in power .
After the war , the U.S. brought to power these misogynist warlords called the Northern Alliance , who are just like the Taliban .
These were the same people who ruled between 1992 and 1996 , and they attacked women 's rights and human rights .
This time , wearing suits and ties , they have again have come into power with the help of the U.S.
That 's why today 's situation for women is worse , especially in many of the provinces .
It is true that in some big cities like Kabul , Mazari Sharif or Herat , you will see that some women have been able to get jobs and an education .
But in most of the provinces , women do not even have basic human rights -- the situation is like hell .

Today , killing a woman is like killing a bird .
Even in big cities , women do not feel secure , and so most of them wear the burqa .
I believe that the burqa is a symbol of oppression .
Yet women have to wear them just to be safe .
So the disgusting burqa today gives life .
Over the last eight years , women in my country have not even regained the limited rights that they enjoyed in the 1960s , '70s and ' 80s .
During that time , women could wear any kind of clothes they wanted to , and they had jobs , they could walk freely on the streets , and they did n't have to worry about being kidnapped or raped .
Then , the warlords attacked women 's rights , and the Taliban continued this .
The U.S. brought the same misogynist warlords back , and the only difference between the Taliban period and now is that all of these crimes are happening in the name of democracy .
The warlord misogynists who are in power cover up , in the name of democracy , countless cases of rape , violence against women , domestic violence , suicide , etc .
And these sorts of attacks are increasing rapidly .
Let me give you a few examples of the situation for women .
I think it will help people in the U.S. to understand the situation better .
For example , recently in Jowzjan province , a 25 - year - old girl burned herself in a hospital .
These sorts of suicides are becoming common .
We recently got a report that there have been 600 such suicides .
Also , a 5 - year - old girl was killed by a 40 - year - old man in Sar-e Pol province as she resisted his attempt to rape her .
A 14 - year - old girl was brutally gang - raped by three men , one of them the son of a member of the parliament .
And this member of parliament , his name is Haji Payinda Mohammad , changed the age of his son in documents to show him to be less than 18 , so he wo n't be punished .
There are many examples like this .
This is a crime against women .
It 's fashionable for the media to say that it's the Taliban , but these are not all the crimes of the Taliban -- there are warlords as well who are continuing their fascism .
Today , Sharia law is guiding the laws that parliament has made .
This is quite similar to the Taliban , and that 's because the warlords are mentally like the Taliban .
WHAT DO you think of the recent elections and of the government of President Hamid Karzai ?
And what about the man who was runner - up to Karzai , Abdullah Abdullah ?
If they formed a coalition government , what do you think would happen ?
FIRST , LET me tell you , the election was just a showcase for the U.S. government .
International observers have talked about widespread fraud .
The so - called independent commission for the election says that around 1.3 million ballots were fixed .
The actual number is higher .
There is no question that an election is the main sign of democracy in a country , but in Afghanistan , they have been betraying democracy for the eight years of the U.S. occupation .
Abdullah is the main candidate of the warlords , and he is seen as a war criminal in Afghanistan because of his activities between 1992 and 1996 .
Abdullah has been a part of Hamid Karzai 's parliamentary system .
Karzai has compromised with people like Abdullah and many other warlords who now have key posts in Afghanistan .
Neither will bring positive changes to the lives of men and women of my country .
Let me say to the people of the U.S. : an election held in the shadow of Afghan warlordism , drug- lordism , awful corruption and occupation forces has no legitimacy at all .
People in my country say that the result of this election will bring back the same donkey , but with a new saddle .
As the old saying goes , " It 's not important who 's voting , it 's important who 's counting . "
That 's our problem .
RIGHT NOW , the Obama administration is trying to decide whether to go with a Pentagon recommendation to send tens of thousands more soldiers to Afghanistan .
What would you like to say to Obama , and what do you think will happen if more troops are sent to Afghanistan ?
MORE TROOPS will bring more conflict and more war .
Obama 's foreign policy regarding Afghanistan is quite similar to that of the Bush administration .
Bush is a war criminal , and now Obama wants to approach the moderate Taliban to join the government as well .
There are no moderate Taliban -- they are putting a soft name on these terrorists in order to bring them into power .
I think that the people of the U.S. would agree with us -- democracy never comes from the barrel of a gun or through war .
Also , Obama is really not being honest with the Afghan people .
First of all , Obama should apologize to my people and put Bush on trial in the international criminal court .
Obama should stop arming the warlords , and he should n't negotiate with the Taliban .
We have many democrats and democratic - minded people in my country , and Obama should support them instead .
If Obama were really to be honest with the Afghan people , he , together with the UN , would stop working with countries like Iran , Pakistan and Russia , who support the Taliban and these warlords .
Let me give my condolences to those families here who have lost their sons in Afghanistan .
I would like to send condolences on behalf of my people , but I also ask them to please raise their voice against the wrong policies of the U.S. government .
The troops are the victims of the policy of their government .
The U.S. is spending taxpayer money and shedding the blood of its soldiers in support of an undemocratic corrupt mafia system .
WHAT DO you think about people in the antiwar movement in this country who now say that we should n't speak out for U.S. immediate withdrawal from Afghanistan ?
They say that the U.S. should stay longer , because if it pulls out , the situation for women will get worse .
What 's your message to them ?
I THINK the people who are saying that should know that the people of Afghanistan do not want more troops in Afghanistan .
First of all , it is the right of my people to say that .
Secondly , we believe that no nation can bring liberation to another nation .
Today 's situation , this eight - year disaster , is a good example of what war and occupation does .
People also say that if the U.S. withdrew , there would be a civil war .
My message to people who say that is that there already is a civil war , and as long as these troops are in Afghanistan , the worse the civil war will be .
The occupation forces are even bombing wedding parties .
In Nuristan , 47 people , including the groom and bride , were killed .
In a bombing in May in Farah province , 150 civilians were killed , most of them women and children .
In Kunduz province , 200 civilians were killed , most of them women and children .
After all of these war crimes , why have n't they apologized ?
We want occupation forces out of Afghanistan as soon as possible .
They must end this tragedy of the so - called war on terror , which is war on innocent civilians .
In the last eight years , fewer than 2,000 Taliban have been killed , and more than 8,000 civilians by U.S. forces .
The occupation forces are not protecting my people or women -- they are doing more harm .
They say they are bringing democracy to Afghanistan .
In reality they have brought warlords and drug lords to power .
They have allowed my country to become the center of drugs today .
Even the White House says that the Taliban have become more powerful since the 2001 war .
These medieval - minded men of the Taliban are destroying the country .
Today , we have two enemies in Afghanistan -- the occupation forces , and the Taliban and warlords .
If one of them is gone , it makes our task easier .
Then we will have only one enemy to fight .
WHAT DOES the resistance or resistances to occupation look like in Afghanistan ?
THERE ARE two kinds of resistances in Afghanistan .
One is of ordinary , democratic - minded people , and the other is of the Taliban .
Most ordinary people hate the Taliban , and so their resistance is not the resistance of the people .
Ordinary people have resisted in many provinces .
They are demonstrating both against the occupation and against the Karzai government .
For instance , I mentioned that in May in Farah province 150 people were killed by occupation forces , most of them women and children .
In response to this , thousands of students in various provinces came out onto the streets to express their solidarity with the victims and to protest their killing .
There are many such examples of students and others are resisting the occupation .
This is happening in big cities -- people are coming out onto the streets in Kabul and also in other provinces .
So there is resistance , but it is n't that big .
Why ?
Because people are tired from war , and they hate the warlords and the Taliban .
But today , there is more resistance than there was eight years ago .
People are starting to stand up against war crimes , and with the passage of time , I think they will stand up and resist more .
CAN YOU describe some of the secular and democratic groups and forces of the resistance in Afghanistan ?
THERE ARE a lot of parties and democratic intellectuals who are risking their lives and struggling to challenge the corrupt warlord government .
RAWA [ the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan ] is one such group .
I met a member of RAWA , Zoya , who told me about the problems and risks they take , and how they have to be underground .
There are many such groups and people , but I would not reveal their names because of a lack of security .
There have been many attempts on my life , and I do n't want to risk the life of anyone else .
But it is these people who are the hope for the future .
WHAT HAS been your experience here in the U.S. as your speaking tour gets underway ?
THERE IS a lot of support among people who have come to the meetings .
People in the U.S. have n't been told the correct story through the media .
They 're told that Iraq was the bad war , and that Afghanistan is the good war .
When they hear about the suffering of my people , some people cry -- some have come up and hugged me and shown their support .
This is n't my first trip to the U.S.
When I was here earlier , I met a group of mothers who lost their sons in Afghanistan .
They , too , hugged me and cried .
Sometimes , people apologize for what their government is doing to my people .
And I reply to them that they should not apologize , because it is their government that is responsible for this , and the government should apologize to them for its war crimes .
I have also come across rich Afghans -- people who are enjoying their lives here in the U.S.
They support the occupation and claim that the U.S. is bringing democracy and freedom to Afghanistan .
They are wrong , and they do n't know what is really happening in Afghanistan .
There are also some corrupt NGOs that support the occupation because they do n't want to lose their contracts and their projects .
But most of the people at the meetings support the cause of my people .
My main message to the democratic people of the U.S. is that you are not the same as your government .
You can support the Afghan people and ask Obama to do four things .
First , end the occupation immediately -- this is not a war on terror , this is a war on innocent civilians .
Second , Obama must apologize to my people and deliver Bush to the International Criminal Court .
Third , he should stop arming the warlords , and not negotiate with Taliban .
Fourth , he should tell Iran , Pakistan , Russia , Uzbekistan and other countries that support Taliban and the warlords to stop .
My message to people in the U.S. is to put pressure on their government to support democratic - minded people in Afghanistan .

An investigation was under way today into how untreated sewage and cyanide made its way into part of one of the country 's major rivers .
Thousands of fish have already died and more wildlife is at risk following the " pollution incident " in the River Trent in Staffordshire .
The Environment Agency yesterday issued a warning for people and animals to keep out of the river between Stoke - on - Trent and Yoxall , after the pollution made it a potential health risk .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A spokeswoman said : " This is due to untreated sewage and cyanide at levels that are potentially a cause for concern , especially with regard to fish , wildlife and animals .
Thousands of fish have already died .
" The warning to stay out of the river applies to everyone , including farmers , anglers , dog walkers , boaters and anyone using the river for work or pleasure .
" We have also received advice from the Food Standards Agency that people should stop extracting water temporarily so water should not be taken out of the river for any reason . "
She said it was also important to keep all animals away from the water , including farm animals and dogs .
" We are tracking the pollution as it moves downstream , " the spokeswoman added .
" It is likely to travel downstream of Yoxall ( today ) , reaching Burton on Trent area late ( this afternoon ) by which time it will have been diluted so the risk may well have reduced . "
She said officers were monitoring the situation .
The Environment Agency was working with " key partners " , she said .
An investigation has been launched into the cause , but she said this could not be discussed for legal reasons .
The RSPCA urged members of the public not to go near any animals in distress but instead to report any sightings to the charity .
A spokeswoman said : " What we 're trying to advise members of the public to do is if they see any animals in distress not to go near them but to report them to our Cruelty and Advice line , like details of where , what and so on .
" We will probably be having a team go to the area and we will be getting involved with the Environment Agency and other agencies .
" We expect there will be quite a big clean - up operation involved .
" For those people with livestock we would remind them to get them away from the area as safely as possible . "
Anyone who spots animals in difficulty is asked to call the RSPCA 's Cruelty and Advice line on 0300 1234 999 .
The Environment Agency manages fisheries , flood defence , navigation , recreation and nature conservation .
In Scotland , the River Purification Boards control river pollution .
The Water Resources Act 1991 allows the Environment Agency to police the use of water in England and Wales .
Just last month in a separate incident , water company Severn Trent Water was fined almost £ 7,000 for allowing pollution to enter the River Trent after a prosecution brought by the Environment Agency .
The company was fined £ 6,700 and ordered to pay costs of £ 2,777.80 at Stafford Magistrates Court after pleading guilty to causing sewage pollution to enter the River Trent .

Progressive filmmaker Michael Moore has called for a boycott of the state of Connecticut if voters there do n’t start an effort to unseat Sen.
Joe Lieberman .
“ People of Connecticut :
What have u done 2 this country ? ” Moore asked in a Tweet Wednesday afternoon .
“ We hold u responsible .
Start recall of Lieberman 2day or we ’ll boycott your state . ”

Lieberman has been the focus of progressive anger since he announced late last week that he would vote against the Senate health care reform bill if the bill included a Medicare buy - in provision that would allow some people aged 55 to 64 to buy into the government - run seniors ’ health care program .
That provision was a compromise that Senate Democrats put forward in exchange for removing a public option for health care from the bill .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid removed that compromise from the bill on Monday night .
But there is one problem with Moore ’s call for a recall of the Connecticut senator :
There is no mechanism to recall US senators , and Connecticut ’s own constitution does n’t provide one .
In calling for Lieberman ’s recall , Moore appeared to be following in the footsteps of House Rep. Rosa DeLauro ( D - CT ) , who called for a recall of the independent senator on Tuesday .
“ No individual should hold health care hostage , including Joe Lieberman , and I ’ll say it flat out , I think he ought to be recalled , ” DeLauro told Politico .

“ Memo to Michael Moore and any other frustrated lefties out there :
There is no such thing as a congressional recall .
So until 2012 , we ’re all stuck with Joe , ” writes Eric Kleefeld at TalkingPointsMemo .
DNS stands for Domain Name Service or Domain Name System .
It can also refer to one or more of the Domain Name Servers that make up the system .
The Domain Name System is a huge distributed database that performs the important task of translating domain names into I.P. addresses
Domain Names vs. IP addresses
Every computer on the Internet has a unique I.P. address .
For instance , the computer that currently hosts cpwebhosting .
net has an I.P. address of 67.18.163.98 .
This type of address is perfectly suited for computers contacting other computers , but people do n't like to deal with long strings of numbers .
Imagine if every web site you used on a regular basis had a 4 to 12 digit number you had to remember to access it !
To solve this problem , memorable and / or guessable domain names are usually used to designate the computers that host web pages .
Another advantage of domain names is that , unlike IP addresses , many domains can be hosted on one server .
If that were n't possible there would need to be a lot more servers in the world and reseller web hosting would be difficult at best .
Using domains , however .
creates a new problem ; unlike I.P. addresses , domain names contain no information about the computer 's actual location on the Internet .
So anytime someone requests a web page from the Internet the I.P. address is still needed .
This is where the DNS comes in to play .
The Steps of a DNS Request
When someone tries to access your website with its domain name a request is sent to a local DNS server which is usually supplied by the ISP .
This DNS server ( and any other ) can respond in one of two ways : if it already has the requested information , it transmits the IP address , if not it replies with the address of a DNS server that is more likely to have the information .
The request now goes to an authoritative server for the top level domain .
This server looks to find what name server is responsible for the second level domain .
The domain registrar will typically maintain this server .
At this point , the name servers that registrants provide to their registrar are found and sent .
Really a good post
Some other DNS Terms are :-
Caching
This is obviously a lot of steps to go through and there are a huge number of requests happening every second .
In order to reduce a load on the system , it 's designers allowed for caching of DNS information .
When a local DNS server finally finds the IP for a domain it stores it in a cache .
How long this cache is used varies from location to location .
There is also frequently caching at the browser and / or operating system levels .
While caching makes the process much quicker and easier , it means that the information may not still be correct .
Propagation
The period of time after completing DNS changes with the registrar and before the DNS servers have quit using the old information is called Propagation .
This is the main reason that changing servers can be such a headache for web hosts .
The administrators of a DNS server can set the cache 's time to live ( or TTL ) and there is no set standard .
Although the authoritative servers are usually updated more frequently , they can also provide another level of delay .
Another factor is how recently you or someone nearby has requested the site .
All of these factors mean that there is no way to know how long propagation will take , and it will happen sooner for some users than others .
A worst - case scenario is 48 hours , but many administrators are starting to use shorter TTLs , and our experience is that most users will usually have to wait 3 to 18 hours .
If you are waiting for a domain to resolve you may also want to flush the DNS cache on your local computer to make sure that that is not out of date .

The test could help to preserve treasured books and documents
The key to preserving the old , degrading paper of treasured , ageing books is contained in the smell of their pages , say scientists .
Researchers report in the journal Analytical Chemistry that a new " sniff test " can measure degradation of old books and historical documents .
The test picks up and identifies the chemicals that the pages release as they degrade .
This could help libraries and museums preserve a range of precious books .
The test is based on detecting the levels of volatile organic compounds .
These are released by paper as it ages and produce the familiar " old book smell " .
The international research team , led by Matija Strlic from University College London 's Centre for Sustainable Heritage , describes that smell as " a combination of grassy notes with a tang of acids and a hint of vanilla over an underlying mustiness " .
" This unmistakable smell is as much part of the book as its contents , " they wrote in the journal article .
Dr Strlic told BBC
News that the idea for new test came from observing museum conservators as they worked .
" I often noticed that conservators smelled paper during their assessment , " he recalled .
" I thought , if there was a way we could smell paper and tell how degraded it is from the compounds it emits , that would be great . "
The test does just that .
It pinpoints ingredients contained within the blend of volatile compounds emanating from the paper .
That mixture , the researchers say , " is dependent on the original composition of the ... paper substrate , applied media , and binding " .
Their new method is called " material degradomics " .
The scientists are able to use it to find what chemicals books release , without damaging the paper .
It involves an analytical technique called gas chromatography - mass spectrometry .
This simply " sniffs " the paper and separates out the different compounds .
Chemical fingerprint
The team tested 72 historical papers from the 19th and 20th centuries - some of which they bought on eBay - and identified 15 compounds that were " reliable markers " of degradation .
" The aroma is made up of hundreds of compounds , but these 15 contain most of the information that we need , " said Dr Strlic .
Measuring the levels of these individual compounds made it possible to produce a " fingerprint " of each document 's condition .
Such a thorough chemical understanding of the state of a book will help museums and libraries to identify the books and documents most in need of protection from further degradation .
The information could also be used to fine - tune preservation techniques .
The method , the researchers say , is not exclusively applicable to books , and could be used on other historical artefacts .

Sen .
Joe Lieberman , former Democrat and now independent from Connecticut , made headlines recently when he said he would join Republicans in a filibuster against a health care bill with a public option .
Keith Olbermann brought it up on his Oct. 27 , 2009 , episode of Countdown .
Olbermann said Lieberman was being hypocritical because , " he will side with the Republicans , denying Americans an up - or - down vote on any health care plan that includes the public option , even though his home state has a public option which covers about 10,000 of its citizens that was introduced by its Republican governor . "
Lieberman is crucial for the Democrats because he usually votes with them and in effect is the important 60th vote so they can overcome a Republican filibuster .
Lieberman has said that he will side with the Democrats on a procedural motion to start debate on the health care bill ( in theory , with Lieberman 's support , Republicans could block bringing the bill to the Senate floor ) .
But because he opposes the public option that 's included in the bill , he has said he will side with Republicans on the ultimate vote to end the debate , which also requires 60 votes .
And that means Senate consideration of the health care bill could stall .
We contacted Olbermann 's staff and found out that the Connecticut health plan he was referring to is the 1 - year - old Charter Oak Health Plan , the state - run program that is designed to compete in the market for individual insurance policies .
That means people who are buying individual health care plans — the unemployed , young college graduates , early retirees — can get coverage under Charter Oak .
The state has contracted with three insurers to offer a variety of coverage options .
Premiums and deductibles depend on household income .
According to David Dearborn , a spokesman for Republican Gov. Jodi Rell , while the plan is " a state - sponsored , state - subsidized and state - administered health coverage program , we contract with private insurers ... as managed care organizations to coordinate the benefits , enroll and set rates with providers , and pay for the services . "
The insurance companies bear the risk for actual medical costs , not the state , Dearborn said .
But the government is involved in the sense that people can get a government subsidy to help them buy private insurance .
So is that a " public option " similar to the one offered in the Democrats ' health care bills ?
We contacted Jacob Hacker , a health care expert at Yale University who is widely credited with coming up with the concept of a public option , for a definition .
Generally speaking , a public option should look a lot like Medicare , Hacker said .
It should be run by the government , and the government should bear the insurance risk .
On the last point , Hacker said Connecticut 's public option " falls into a gray area .
It is not public in the same ways that the public health insurance option under consideration in Congress is .
But it seems more public than , say , the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan , which is often cited as a model for the so - called insurance exchanges . "
So it seems that the Connecticut plan is a hybrid of a public option and an insurance exchange .
It allows consumers to choose from a limited number of health insurance options offered by private insurers , but it is sponsored , subsidized and administered by the state .
Olbermann is correct on his second and third points .
At the one - year anniversary of the program 's existence , Rell , the Republican governor who introduced the program in 2007 , estimated that about 10,000 had joined the plan .
Rell 's name and photograph have featured prominently on information about the program , and she 's gone to bat to defend the plan several times since it was enacted in the summer of 2008 .
So , back to Olbermann 's claim .
The Charter Oak plan does not meet a strict definition of a public option .
In fact , it bears some marks of a health insurance exchange , where private plans compete .
But ultimately , it is sponsored and subsidized by the state of Connecticut and is open to the public , so Olbermann is mostly on the mark with his characterization of the program .
On his other two points — that 10,000 people are enrolled and that it was introduced by a Republican governor — Olbermann is correct .
All in all , we give him a Mostly True .
CLEVELAND -- LeBron James had a big bash to celebrate his 25th birthday .
Anderson Varejao delivered his gift before the party started .
Varejao made his first career 3 - pointer with 17.2 seconds left -- as the 24 - second shot clock was about to expire -- to give Cleveland a disputed 106 - 101 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night , the Cavaliers ' 11th victory in 12 games .
James scored a season - high 48 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for the Cavs , but the MVP would have dropped to 0 - 4 in games on his birthday if not for Varejao .
" That 's a great gift , " James said .
" I had Andy in the gift exchange and so he paid me back .
That 's what friends are for . "
With the score tied at 101 and the shot clock down to its final tick , Mo Williams passed the ball to Varejao on the left wing .
The 6 - foot - 11 forward , who missed his first 18 career 3 - pointers , stepped up and drilled his long shot just before the horn sounded .
When he ran to the other end of the floor , James rushed into his arms .
" I saw that Mo got kind of tied up and I just tried to get open , " Varejao said .
" I just shot it . "
A birthday swish for James .
" That 's what I told him , " Varejao said .
" Happy birthday . "
The shot was initially ruled a 2 - pointer , but after reviewing the bucket on video , the officiating crew determined that Varejao 's feet were behind the line .
After Atlanta 's Mike Bibby missed a 3 with six seconds left , Jamario Moon made two free throws to ice the Cavs ' sixth straight win and 11th in a row at home .
Joe Johnson scored 35 for the Hawks , who were held to just 37 points in the second half and left Quicken Loans Arena shaking their heads .
" This is a game we should 've won , " Johnson said .
" We had some unfortunate events that happened on the court and it happens .
Unfortunately , we have to deal with it . "
Atlanta coach Mike Woodson plans to file a protest with the league , contesting that the Hawks were robbed of a late possession by a shot - clock problem .
Woodson , who spent much of the night complaining about calls and non-calls , was annoyed that the officials did not notice that the 24 - second shot clock was not reset following a miss by the Cavaliers with 1:56 left .
The Hawks , who were leading 99 - 98 , ended up not getting their allotted time and committed a costly turnover while rushing to get a shot off .
During a timeout , Woodson protested to the officiating crew and had a few choice words for the clock operator .
Woodson felt the error cost his team the game .
" We 've got a one - point lead with the ball going the other way and we 're rushing to get a shot because the clock is not in our favor , " he said .
" You figure it out . "
Atlanta 's Josh Smith , charged with a turnover on the controversial sequence , was upset that the play was missed by referees Ken Mauer , Courtney Kirkland and Ed Malloy .
" We were up by one , so that was a momentum swing , " he said .
" I thought one official was supposed to check the clock and not all three of them paid attention to the game . "
Williams shrugged off the Hawks ' planned grievance .
" What can they do ? " he said .
" They should protest , they lost .
If they won , they would n't . "
The Cavs , who spent much of the night looking uninspired and watching James , did n't take their first lead until their superstar 's layup -- off a nice feed from Williams -- with 4:42 left made it 94 -93 .
Trailing by 17 in the third and looking awful , the Cavs finally woke up .
They went on a 22 - 7 spurt , capped by James ' 3 - pointer from the left wing to pull within 76 - 74 .
The run got Cleveland 's crowd into it , but it did n't faze the Hawks , who closed the quarter with a 9 - 3 burst that gave them an 85 - 77 lead entering the final 12 minutes .
In his first quarter century , James has crammed in a lifetime worth of accomplishments .
He has already been a Sports Illustrated cover subject as a high schooler , a No. 1 overall draft pick , NBA Rookie of the Year , five - time All - Star , Olympic gold medalist , league MVP , multimillionaire and one of the most recognizable sports figures on the planet .
" It 's amazing , " Cavs coach Mike Brown said of James ' early body of work .
" You know how they say a young person has an old soul ?
Well , he 's got an old game .
It 's athletic , powerful and energetic .
The whole nine yards .
It feels like he 's been doing it forever . "
Game notes

Management at Vale Inco ’s strikebound mine , mill and smelting complex in Sudbury , Ontario admitted last week that they have been training some non-striking employees to restart the company ’s Copper Cliff smelting operation .
This latest provocation follows on the heels of the company ’s restarting last month of minimal mine and mill operations in an attempt to undermine the now 110 day - old strike .
Vale Inco is using managers , as well as office workers who are organized in non-striking United Steelworkers ( USW ) Local 2020 , to perform mine and mill duties normally done by the strikers .
The moves to restart production during an industrial dispute are unprecedented in the more than century old history of mining operations in the Sudbury Basin .
The 3,100 Vale Inco workers in Sudbury , members of USW Local 6500 , have been on strike since July 13 against company demands for across - the - board concessions .
They have been joined by 120 workers at Vale ’s Port Colborne , Ontario operation and 450 workers at its nickel and cobalt mines at Voisey ’s Bay , Labrador .
Inco workers have a long tradition of militancy .
A nine - month strike in 1978 - 79 by some 20,000 Sudbury miners resulted in the most workdays lost due to a labour dispute in Canadian history .
The Sudbury miners last struck the company for three months in 2003 in a fight against contract concessions .
And only three years ago , the Voisey ’s Bay workers struck for two months against rapacious company demands .
In this dispute , Vale Inco is demanding a three - year wage freeze , the scrapping of the defined benefit pension program for new hires , the dilution of seniority rights and the curtailment of a compensation program that ties bonus payments to the price of nickel .
This “ nickel bonus ” was negotiated by the USW in the 1980s in return for surrendering annual wage increases .
Under its terms , when nickel prices are high , miners share in the increased profits .
During down years in the notoriously cyclical minerals market , no bonuses are earned .
Vale has demanded that the threshold for nickel bonus payments be raised to near impossible price targets .
Corporate management has not been content to simply organize strikebreaking provocations .
Early on in the strike , Vale managers announced that a $ 5 per month “ top - up ” to the smaller pensions collected by the most aged retirees or their widows would be stopped .
Injured workers who were performing light duties before the strike were ordered to cross picket lines or forfeit their supplemental medical payments .
Picket captains and the more outspoken strikers have been the target of a barrage of legal actions launched by the company for “ offenses ” such as maintaining picket lines and circulating leaflets .
Last week , the company announced 24 permanent layoffs amongst office workers organized in USW Local 2020 .
The use of about 50 of these office workers to perform operations in two of Vale ’s mines and its Clarabelle mill was the subject of a grievance hearing last week at the Ontario Labour Relations Board .
USW lawyers argued that by ordering the office workers under threat of discipline to go into the mines , the company has undermined the union ’s ability to conduct a strike and created an “ inherently hazardous workplace . ”
They asked the Labour Board to issue a cease - and - desist order against the company .
Corporate lawyers countered that there was no clause in the office workers ’ collective agreement that restricted their deployment to other duties .
In any event , the board refused to order a stop to the strike - breaking practices .
Instead , they ruled that a full hearing would be held at the end of November to determine the merits of the case .
Headquartered in Brazil , Vale S.A. is the second largest mining company in the world .
Vertically integrated , it owns its own transportation networks , ports and processing plants across the planet .
Its mines and smelters can be found in Europe , Peru , Chile , Brazil , Indonesia , Guatemala , Mongolia , Congo , Guinea , Angola , Australia , New Caledonia , Mozambique and Namibia .
Three years ago , Vale paid $ 19.4 billion to buy Inco , an iconic Canadian company that had mined nickel in Sudbury , Ontario for more than a century .
In the past two years , the Inco operation has produced $ 4 billion in company profits .
The company earned over $ 13 billion globally last year and has doubled the price of its stock in the past 12 months .
At the same time , it has been ruthlessly cutting jobs and capital investment .
Locked in cutthroat competition with its global rivals , Vale is insisting that if its operations are to be “ sustainable in all pricing cycles ” it must impose a “ unified approach to compensation ” across the globe .
This requires , contends Vale , that “ Canadian workers become more competitive with workers in less developed countries . ”
On Wednesday , Vale released third quarter results showing that it made a $ 1.7 billion profit from July through September .
However , the company report also indicated that it lost $ 319 million in nickel and byproducts revenue at its Canadian operations during the same period and that Vale paid an additional $ 209 million in expenses resulting from the “ idling of Canadian nickel operations . ”
The leadership of the USW — whether in Sudbury , Toronto or Pittsburgh — has advised the Inco strikers to be prepared for a very long strike , possibly lasting into next spring .
They offer no perspective to the workers , however , for beating back the company ’s concessionary demands .
The union ’s hope is that as Inco ’s nickel stockpile dwindles and metal prices increase due to the Canadian production cuts , the company will be induced to return to the bargaining table .
In the meantime , the union bureaucracy is continuing to foment reactionary nationalist conceptions amongst the membership .
Last week , the USW welcomed Maude Barlow , a former Liberal Party advisor and the head of the ultra-nationalist Council of Canadians , and Ontario Canadian Union of Public Employees leader Sid Ryan to their picket lines .
Barlow and Ryan are campaigning to erect various trade barriers both nationally , provincially and even municipally — a campaign that serves to divide workers , while promoting illusions in capitalism .
At the same time , the USW leadership cannot ignore the fact that Vale is a giant , transnational corporation .
They have dispatched union officials to Brazil , New York , Europe and Australia to “ raise awareness ” about their strike with their fellow union bureaucrats .
Yet the union leaderships in every country where Vale operates push their own version of the national “ defense ” of jobs .
Thus , after an extensive USW tour of Brazil this past summer in which undying solidarity was pledged by all , Brazilian metal workers officials lobbied the country ’s social democratic president , Luiz Lula , to urge Vale to redistribute future capital investment outlays back to its Brazilian operations .
Last week , after Lula had threatened to raise mining royalties , Vale announced that fully two - thirds of its 2010 $ 12.9 billion capital spending budget will be earmarked for its Brazilian operations .
But the Brazilian labour bureaucrats are no different than their counterparts in Canada or anywhere else .
Leo Gerard , president of the United Steelworkers “ International , ” former national director of the union in Canada and member of Sudbury Local 6500 in his youth , regularly expresses the crude nationalist perspective of the union bureaucracy .
In a speech last year he called for workers to “ assert themselves as economic patriots ” and denounced big business for “ wanting to spend the tax dollars of unemployed Americans to create jobs in China and Indonesia , Korea and India . ”
The statement was clearly aimed at fostering hostility to foreign workers .
Gerard is now championing a “ Buy American ” campaign ( or when he speaks in Canada , a “ Buy North American ” campaign ) to further stoke the fires of trade war .
This perspective serves only to split the international working class by allowing corporations to pit one set of workers against another .
At a USW rally last month in Sudbury featuring New Democratic Party ( NDP ) leader Jack Layton , the demand was raised for the Investments Canada
Act to be revised so as to compel the federal government to make public the details of any agreement it reaches with a foreign company when allowing the takeover of a Canadian - based company .
Currently , the legislation requires that Ottawa make a determination that a foreign purchase of a Canadian - based company will provide a “ net benefit ” to Canada before it can proceed .
Frequently , this involves company pledges to retain some corporate functions in Canada .
The bureaucrats in the trade unions along with their allies in the social - democratic NDP promote the illusion that there are “ good ” homegrown capitalists , who , for the benefit of all Canadians , altruistically refuse to maximize their profits .
This chimera is counterposed to the “ bad ” foreign interlopers who will do their utmost to beggar the Canadian population .
Yet even a casual observer of the history of mining in Canada , let alone of Inco itself , will have no trouble recalling the relentless drive by Canadian owners to maximize their profits at the expense of miners and mining communities and the bitter strikes that followed — including the “ Great Inco Strike of 1978 - 1979 , ” which shortly after its conclusion saw the company permanent lay off thousands of mine workers .
Moreover , the most powerful Canadian - based corporations are also multinational , like Vale , scouring the globe for the best possible return on their own investments at the expense of workers internationally .
Miners must reject the demands of Vale Inco that they pay for the world capitalist crisis and answer the attempts to re-start production by making their strike the spearhead of working class resistance to wage - cutting , union - busting and the dismantling of public and social services .
Workers have absolutely no say in the financial , investment and production decisions of the firms for which they work .
In every country workers face a similar future : rising unemployment , declining wages , economic depression .
The traditions of militant working class struggle associated with cities such as Sudbury must be revived and leavened with a program to mobilize the working class in independent industrial and political struggle against concessions and in defense of the jobs of all workers , the world over .
If capitalism is incapable of providing working people with a decent standard of living — and it can ’t — then working people , those whose collective labor produces society ’s wealth , must advance their own plan to organize production and employment internationally based on human need , not private profit and shareholder value .
“ I would describe Patrick ’s work as like distilling something to the purest form , ” said Kate Mulleavy .
“ Laura and I are so quiet about how we communicate with people .
We like to work in isolation when we are working on the collection .
So the first person we talk to about what we are doing is Patrick . ”
Mr. Li designs the fashion show invitations that are mailed to hundreds of editors and store buyers each season , enticing them to see a collection and sometimes giving them a hint of what is to come .
Ms. Mulleavy said that she and her sister typically fire off a mountain of inspirations .
The spring collection , for example , was based on transformation myths involving a person who is burned alive and reborn as a condor or a vulture .
There was talk of California condors , burnt sand and the wildfires that were spreading around Los Angeles while the Mulleavys were at work .
“ Their references each season are totally off the wall , and sometimes I think they are meant to confuse , ” Mr. Li said .
“ You can leave the discussion thinking , ‘ Oh , I do n’t really know what it means for a California condor to intersect with a Robert Smithson earthwork , ’ but each of those things imparts a certain feeling . ”
Mr. Li described several failed attempts to actually burn the heavy stock used for the Rodarte invitations , ultimately giving up when a printer refused to take the insurance risk .
Instead , he used a silk - screened adhesive that was coated with burned sand .
The Mulleavys liked the idea so much they decided to put sand on the runway as well .
Mr. Li also helped the designers adjust their logo , from a basic all - caps style produced on a typewriter to one that looks slightly more ominous , using a bolded version of a Times font that has been condensed so severely that the letters start to vanish .
Recently , Icrontic got to visit AMD Markham , which is where the ATI brand ( their graphics division ) is headquartered .
While there , we sat down with AMD Senior Marketing Manager Alexis Mather and approached him with many questions regarding workstation graphics cards to get real answers from the source .
Alexis explained that there are five major markets that AMD targets : Digital Content Creation ( DCC ) , Computer - Aided Drafting ( CAD ) , financial markets , oil and gas , and scientific ( which includes medical and research ) .
DCC is arguably the most well known market thanks to VFX - heavy films and computer animation , but this hardware plays a vital role in the other target markets as well .
Take oil and gas , for instance .
At face value , it is difficult to understand why that market would need expensive hardware like this , but the answer makes sense .
Oil companies use extremely high - resolution imaging to analyze possible oil fields .
Workstation hardware is then used to process this imagery so engineers can assess the quantity of raw material in potential deposits , locate new deposits , and make decisions on where to start drilling .
The process is similar to the scene in the beginning of “ Jurassic Park ” where they used subterranean imaging to locate raptor bones on the excavation site .
The point is — you ’re alive when they start to eat yo–err …
The point is : Many different companies rely on workstation hardware to make very important decisions .
The big questions that so many people ask are : “ Ca n’t I do these things with an equivalent consumer grade desktop GPU purchased at a fraction of the price ? ” and “ what is so different about workstation hardware ? ”
The hardware
These questions are understandable given that GPUs like the ATI Radeon HD 4870 and the ATI Fire Pro v8750 appear to have the same GPU ( RV770 ) and hardware configuration , but Alexis explained that there are several significant , but unapparent hardware - level differences .
First and foremost , workstation GPUs are different from desktop GPUs at the ASIC and board level .
If you were to place a workstation ASIC ( the actual GPU chip ) in the equivalent consumer grade board , the card would exhibit different behavior .
In other words , the GPU dies are not simply interchangeable .
Alexis continued by explaining that workstation hardware offers features that ca n’t be benchmarked , but really matter to users and cannot be had on desktop hardware .
Such features include 30 - bit color depth , framelock / genlock functionality , and hardware stereoscopic output .
There are also brand - specific features that carry over from consumer grade GPUs to professional level :
Where the ATI FirePro has exclusive technology like Eyefinity , NVIDIA has features like 3 Dvision and SLI Multi-OS ( the latter found exclusively on NVIDIA Quadro workstation boards ) .
In some cases , both vendors have different implementations of similar technology , like SDI sync .
Reliability
One of the major differences that does n’t get talked about much is the stability and reliability of the hardware .
Workstation GPUs are developed to operate under serious strain for long periods of time .
With a workstation card , your system will simply be more stable in high - stress operating environments like 3D rendering .
To an artist that must make a deadline , reliability can mean the difference between completing a shot , and losing a significant amount of money ( not to mention time ) .
Support
One of the final differences that Alexis explained to us is the high level of support given to workstation GPU owners .
From a development standpoint , AMD works very closely with ISVs and software vendors .
This close relationship between software developers and workstation teams assures that software changes wo n’t compromise hardware performance , and vice versa .
Workstation users also have access to a 24/7 phone support line , so when an artist is pulling overtime and waiting for that final render in the middle of the night , they wo n’t be left alone when support is needed .
This kind of support goes well above and beyond that of the consumer level .
Drivers
Often you will hear people say that drivers alone make the workstation GPUs .
Though that is hardly the only difference , workstation drivers do , in fact , receive a significantly higher amount of developmental time and resources .
The hardware performs as well as it does because the drivers are finely optimized for many different professional software packages .
But what goes into refining the drivers for the professional ?
Alexis explained that there are many engineers on the team that work to optimize the hardware ’s performance in different graphics packages , and they specifically tweak the hardware to function in a manner that best fits the needs of the professional artist and other target markets .
For example , he talked about the OpenGL engineers and their process of developing the driver .
Engineers will actually capture every OpenGL command that is sent to the driver during an application ’s operation and then analyze the log to see what the application is trying to get the GPU to do .
During analysis , engineers will tweak things like the instruction order to optimize the way a program is interacting with the GPU ’s architecture .
Studying these nuances allows the driver to achieve outstanding optimization for software performance .
Pricing
So that brings us to the last big question :
Why is workstation hardware so expensive ?
Despite workstation boards sharing similar hardware configurations to their desktop counterparts , the price may be increased significantly , in some cases four - fold .
If manufacturing costs are as similar as alleged , are these companies price gouging and taking advantage of the professionals in the industry ?
Alexis explained that the additional cost comes from all the exclusive features we have been talking about .
It takes an incredible amount of people and time to work so closely with the ISVs to analyze and optimize the software .
The resulting certifications are not cheap , Alexis told us , and there are many of people in the background making that process happen .
Quite simply , these people need to be paid .
Final thoughts
When you buy a workstation GPU , you ’re buying a lot more than just the hardware .
You ’re buying the peace of mind offered by hardware you know will be stable and reliable , hardware that has been tried and tested not only by its maker and hundreds of engineers , but by the creators of the software you ’ll be running on it .
That is something that cannot be expressed in terms of dollars .
Workstation GPUs are certainly not for everybody , and for that reason , the general public does n’t need to know–and rarely knows –the real differences between workstation and desktop hardware .
But professionals know that there is so much more to a workstation card than just fast numbers on a spec sheet .
When there are thousands on the line in money and expectations alike , these professionals get serious about their tools , and when it comes to graphics hardware , workstation GPUs are worth every single dollar .
Intended for use exclusively by law enforcement teams gathering evidence from computers , initially , Microsoft 's COFEE collection of forensic tools , only appeared on a file sharing site .
Just a short time later , copies were available via bit torrent .
The Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor ( COFEE ) is intended for inexperienced computer users who only need to know how to plug a USB Flash drive into the PC under investigation to extract a comprehensive report .
However , those who expect marvellous things from these tools will be disappointed .
The version available to The H's associates at heise Security included few surprises for computer professionals .
Once the Flash drive has been plugged into the USB port , COFEE starts via autorun and executes a command line script .
Tools such as whoami , autoruns and others generate a basic information snapshot which is then formatted to look pretty in a web browser .
No sophisticated tools for tasks like restoring deleted files or hidden information were found in the collection .
The real value of the collection is its user - friendliness and its focus on gathering evidence that will stand up in court .
The included user manual already indicates the tool kit 's level of technological sophistication .
While the manual was apparently created in September 2009 , the only operating system COFEE is officially suitable for is Windows XP – there is no mention of Vista or even Windows 7 .
The directory tree of the version - specific tools likewise only contains the win2k , win2k03 and winxp folders .
Those who happen to stumble over an alleged copy of COFEE should treat it with extreme caution .
This is not only because the programs are copyright protected , but also because there is no guarantee that the software wo n't introduce any backdoors or spyware .

Bear this thought in mind the next time you revel in the sublime graphics of Assassins Creed II , skid and screech your stolen car through the nigh - on photorealistic streetscape of GTA IV 's Liberty City or get drawn in by the complex plot twists and game play of Dragon 's Age Origins .
In a lot less time than you think , these currently bleeding edge games will appear laughably outdated and unsophisticated .
First off , they will be superseded by better sequels or more impressive rivals .
Then , you will start finding them in the classic sections of your local video store .
Still later , you will get blank looks when you mention the games to youngsters .
And , finally , in the ultimate insult , hobbyist developers will turn them into free - to - play Flash games .
That was the fate of these five games .
But before you collapse in fits of giggles over their risible graphics , clunky game play and ridiculous plotlines , you ought to note that in their heyday , they were every bit as impressive to gamers as the greatest games out there today .
We present to you our Top Five Classic Games that Can be Played in a Browser .
Street Fighter , Five classic games that you can play in your browser , Casual Girl Gamer 1 Street Fighter II
Of our five games , this is undoubtedly the one that has aged the best - the Helen Mirren , if you like , of our little collection .
Despite having none of the bells and whistles of its successors , Street Fighter II remains my favourite game in the series .
It 's perfectly formed : easy for a beginner to get to grips with but at the same time rewarding to those who put many hours into it .
And best of all , you can play it right now in your browser here for free .
Haaaadooouukkeeennnn !
Super Mario ,
Five classic games that you can play in your browser , Casual Girl Gamer 3 Super Mario World First released in 1990 , Super Mario World is one of the most successful games ever , selling more than 20 million copies worldwide , and spawning countless copycat games .
Oh yawn .
Who cares .
What we really want to know is what happens to a multi-million selling game a couple of decades later .
Yes , you 've got it , it gets turned into a little Flash game .
Well , in the case of Super Mario , hundreds of little Flash games , most of them pretty badly done .
One of the least - useless versions can be found here .
Prince of Persia ,
Five classic games that you can play in your browser , Casual Girl Gamer 4 Prince of Persia
To be honest , I have never been much of a fan of the Prince of Persia games .
The latest version , released in 2008 , was absolutely beautiful to look at but its game play was repetitive and dull .
Not everyone agrees , obviously , because someone has taken the time to convert one of the earlier classic versions of the game into Flash .
And , it has to be said , they have done a pretty slick job .
If you are into challenging platformers where every move you make can be the difference between life and death , then , sure , go ahead and play it by clicking here .
I , personally , have better things to do .
Quake ,
Five classic games that you can play in your browser , Casual Girl Gamer 5 Quake After blowing the gamescape apart with Doom , Id Software was always going to have a tough job with its next game .
But those who doubted it could create another classic were quickly proven wrong .
Quake - released in 1996 - took the burgeoning first - person shooter genre to the next level , quite literally , providing far more complex environments than Doom .
There were multiple floors , sloping landscapes , spiral staircases and other clever stuff .
Nothing to mention nowadays but back then , pretty radical .
Click here to play a Flash version of the game .
Have I missed any classic games out of this list ?
If so , please share the game 's humiliation with the rest of us in the comments section below .
TV of the 2000s : 15 Sci-Fi Series That Deserved A Longer Run
It ’s always been a rough go on network television for series which require viewers to think and suspend their disbelief at the same time , but despite this , many brave producers and writers have tried to capture the imaginations of couch potatoes .
Sometimes it works , as evidenced by the long runs of such shows as “ Battlestar Galactica , ” “ Lost , ” “ Smallville , ” and “ Supernatural , ” but more often than not , it does n’t , which is why IMDb is littered with listings for sci - fi series that lasted for only a single season .
Looking back at the decade ( which , if you had n’t noticed , is what we ’re doing with all of these TV of the 2000s features ) , you can also find way too many shows which survived into the second season , proved that their first season was n’t a fluke , sometimes even improving on it , and then got canceled … and , man , does that hurt .
Heck , I even included three - and four - season wonders in this list , one because it had scored such a huge upswing in quality , the other mostly because it seemed like such a gyp when it got the axe .
But , then , you could say that about all of these shows , really …
WARNING ! LIST CAVEAT ! –
To be included within this list , the show cannot have started at any point prior to Jan. 1 , 2000 .
Without that caveat , you can bet that “ Angel ” would ’ve been included … and , yes , probably “ Farscape , ” too .
But definitely “ Angel . ”
15 . Masters of Science Fiction ( ABC ) :
As an anthology series in the 2000s , it ’s not like it ever had a chance in Hell of surviving , anyway , which is why it comes in at the bottom of the list .
Still , it deserves mention here , partially because it was really good , but mostly because it got an even bigger shaft from ABC than “ New Amsterdam ” got from Fox .
Get this : during ABC ’s executive panel during the TCA Press tour of summer 2007 , someone asked Stephen McPherson , the network ’s president of entertainment about the origins of the series , and he responded , “ It was a low - cost initiative that we tried .
We did this series of movies to see if there was a way to spark something different at a really low cost point .
You know , I think there is some good work done there , but it ’s very unseen .
So it ’s just been … it ’s been a little bit problematic . ”
Okay , now , to be fair , he ’s acknowledging that there ’s “ good work ” inherent somewhere in the series , but to put these comments in a better perspective , they were made before the show had even premiered .
And how did he decide to remedy this problem of the series being “ unseen ” ?
By premiering it at 10 PM on Saturday night .
Hey , way to get behind your programming , Steve !
In fairness , I ’m sure no one , not even the series creators , ever expected “ Masters of Science Fiction ” to be anything other than a short - lived midseason entry , but it ’s not like it had to be .
The series harked back to classic dramatic anthologies like “ The Twilight Zone , ” “ The Outer Limits , ” and the like , and while its budget might not be through the roof , the performances – including turns from Malcolm McDowell , Anne Heche , Sam Waterston , Judy Davis , Terry O’Quinn , Elizabeth Rohm , Brian Dennehy , and John Hurt – were top - notch .
But , then , that ’s what happens when you bring in directors like Mark Rydell ( ” On Golden Pond ” ) , Michael Tolkin ( ” The Player ” ) , and Jonathan Frakes ( ” Star Trek : First Contact ” ) to helm adaptations of stories by Robert Heinlein ( ” Starship Troopers ” ) , Howard Fast ( ” Spartacus ” ) , and legendary sci- fi writer Harlan Ellison , who actually adapted his own story , collaborating with Josh Olson ( ” A History of Violence ” ) .
If any of this sounds like it might be up your alley , you can at least take comfort in the knowledge that the entire series is available on DVD , including two episodes that ABC could n’t be bothered to air .
14 . Dark Angel ( Fox ) : Nowadays , it ’s best remembered for the fact that it introduced the world at large to the assets of Jessica Alba ( which , by the way , look damned good in black leather ) , but when “ Dark Angel ” premiered , its high profile came from the fact that it was the first thing that it was produced by James Cameron .
What not nearly as many people remember , however , is that the show also starred Michael Weatherly , who would get a much longer running gig a few years later when he took on the role of Anthony DiNozzo in “ NCIS , ” and Jensen Ackles , now better known as Dean Winchester on “ Supernatural . ”
But I digress .
The slightly - futuristic ( it took place in 2019 ) “ Dark Angel ” was predominantly about Alba ’s character , Max Guevara , a genetically enhanced super - soldier who has escaped from the government that created her and is using her job as a motorcycle courier to cover for the fact that she spends most of her time searching for her brethren , i.e. the other 11 super - soldiers who escaped with her .
She does this with the help of Logan Kale ( Weatherly ) , a.k.a. cyber - journalist “ Eyes Only , ” whose unparalleled computer skills go a long way toward making up for the fact that he ’s paralyzed from the waist down .
The series looked great , and having John Savage serve as one of its primary villains ( Colonel Donald Michael Lydecker ) was inspired , but trying to get the general public to embrace the cyberpunk movement – even the highly diluted version of it that “ Dark Angel ” offered – was a lost cause .
Truth be told , we ’re probably lucky that we got as much of the show as we did .
If Cameron ’s name had n’t been on it , it probably would ’ve been over at the end of Season 1 .
13 . Kyle XY ( ABC Family ) : Ironically , I ’m writing this mere moments after getting word that a copy “ Kyle XY : The Final Season ” has just been sent my way .
Even if you are n’t familiar with the series , you ’ll nonetheless have deduced from the appearance of the word “ final ” in the set ’s subtitle that this is n’t a show that came and went within the span of a single season .
Yes , “ Kyle XY ” actually lasted for three seasons , but it was still going strong creatively when ABC Family decided that it just did n’t match up well enough with their other content , like “ Greek ” or “ The Secret Life of the American Teenager . ”
Now , look , I dig those shows as much as the next thirtysomething who wants to vicariously relive his youth through semi-realistic TV characters , but is that any reason to kill off a great sci - fi melodrama like “ Kyle ” ?
No , sir , it is not .
12 . The 4400 ( USA ) : If I ’m to be completely honest , I ’m much more of a fan of this show ’s concept that I ultimately was of its execution .
When a series kicks off by depositing a group of exactly 4400 people at the foothills of Mount Rainier , each of whom had disappeared at various times from 1946 onward but have n’t aged a moment since then and do n’t remember where they ’ve been … I mean , damn , how can you not be intrigued ?
And the premise further expands to reveal that several members of the 4400 have begun to develop paranormal abilities , that ’s icing on the cake !
But while I loved the episodes which focused on individual members of the group and how they dealt with their return , I was n’t nearly as enthralled with the ongoing storylines with the regular cast members .
Still , when it was good , it was really , really good , and with well over 4300 stories left to be told , I have to imagine that , statistically speaking , there would ’ve been quite a bit more sci - fi goodness yet to come .
11 . Star Trek : Enterprise ( UPN ) :
No series wants to be remembered as the worst in its franchise , but you ’d be hard pressed to find any “ Star Trek ” fan that would n’t use that label on “ Enterprise . ”
The concept of stepping back in time to the pre-Kirk era and exploring the origins of Starfleet Command and the United Federation of Planets was unquestionably an intriguing one , but Rick Berman – who took the “ Trek ” reigns of command when Gene Roddenberry died – seemed insistent on rewriting established canon than putting together a good TV show .
So why should such a mediocre series have continued ?
Because in its 4th season , uber - fans Judith and Garfield Reeves - Stevens came aboard the writing staff and turned things around in a big way , providing tributes to the original series and “ The Next Generation ” every time you turned around .
The ratings did n’t change , though , and “ Enterprise ” was canceled .
Give Berman credit , though : he managed to stab at us from Hell ’s heart one last time by offering up an absolutely crap - tacular series finale .
10 . New Amsterdam ( Fox ) :
When I think of this series , I always think of the panel for the show during the TCA Press Tour , when one of the journalists just absolutely refused to accept that the creators of “ New Amsterdam ” had never seen “ Highlander . ”
I mean , seriously , it was starting to get ugly .
The funny thing , though , is that aside from the fact that the lead character of the series was an immortal , the comparisons really were n’t all that dramatic .
The show was about John Amsterdam ( Nikolaj Coster - Waldau ) , a NYPD homicide detective who ’s 400 years old but looks 35 .
That ’s because , way back in 1642 , Amsterdam saved the life of a Native American girl , who in turn cast a spell that granted him immortality , with the caveat that his aging would resume when he found his one true love … which was darned nice of her , because , really , no one should have to outlive the love of their life .
Though you ’d expect the show to spend the majority of its time on Amsterdam ’s search for his love , “ New Amsterdam ” did n’t take the obvious route .
Instead , it spent a great deal of its time exploring the long life of its titular character , revealing that he ’d been in the Army three times and also did time in the Navy , Marines , and Coast Guard ( but not the Air Force , ostensibly due to a fear of heights ) , served as a doctor during the Civil War , worked for the CIA , taught history , made furniture , and – at some point – became an alcoholic .
( He ’s been in AA since 1965 . )
I ’ve never really gotten a handle on why “ New Amsterdam ” was so disliked by Fox , but it ’s clear that it was .
It was supposed to have premiered in the fall of 2007 , but then they stopped production after the first seven episodes had been completed and proceeded to sit on the series until mid-season ; once it finally got on the air , they did very little promotion on it , making it completely unsurprising when they pulled the plug on it .
I ’m still mystified .
Like “ Journeyman , ” the romantic bent of the show was one which seemed perfect for cross - demographic success , but they never even gave it a chance .
9 . The Dresden Files ( Sci Fi ) :
As someone who stepped into this series without having read any of the Jim Butcher novels which served as its inspiration , maybe I had an advantage , because fans of the literary franchise seemed to universally hate this adaptation .
Me , I thought it was pretty cool .
Paul Blackthorne played Harry Dresden as a cocky wizard who helped out the police department with their more eccentric cases , i.e. the ones that would be classified as supernatural if anyone on the force dared to claim a belief in such things , and the series managed to have a decidedly dark tone while still maintaining a sense of humor .
But when you kick off a TV series by instantly alienating the majority of the people who made it a success as a book series , you ’re pretty much doomed to failure , which is what “ The Dresden Files ” proved to be .
8. Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ( Fox ) :
Here ’s one one that we already detailed elsewhere , but , again , it deserves repeating that , when “ The Sarah Connor Chronicles , ” it did so far too soon .
Season 1 had its highs and lows , but the show ’s sophomore year was consistently intriguing throughout , starting with the season premiere and the introduction of Catherine Weaver ( Shirley Manson ) , the co-founder and current CEO of ZeiraCorp … except that , as we discovered immediately prior to the closing credits , she was n’t actually Catherine Weaver but , indeed , was a shapeshifting T - 1001 .
As the season progressed , however , her physical transformation became less interesting than her emotional evolution , with the T - 1001 being forced to maintain the façade of its new identity in its entirety , which required her to raise Catherine ’s daughter , Savannah ( Mackenzie Smith ) , and try to understand her .
( I have a suspicion that all of the parents in our readership just snorted en masse and said , “ Uh , yeah , good luck with that ! ” )
The T - 1001 was n’t the only Terminator to get a crash course in humanity during Season 2 . Cameron ( Summer Glau ) spent much of the season suffering from a serious chip malfunction , leading her at one point to adopt the approximate memories of future resistance fighter Allison Young , on whom her personality had originally been patterned , but we also saw her interacting outside of the Connor camp ; elsewhere , the Terminator formerly known as Cromartie ( Garret Dillahunt ) had his chip destroyed , but his body was connected to ZeiraCorp ’s artificial intelligence known as the Babylon A.I. , leading him to take on a new name – John Henry – and leading the series to explore matters of spirituality by querying whether his sentience means that terms like “ life ” and “ death ” now apply to him .
Oh , right , and there was also some pretty good stuff with the human characters , too .
Sure , there were moments which defied credibility , but when you ’re dealing with a show that lives and dies by time travel , suspension of disbelief and acceptance of pretty much everything that ’s handed to you is a necessity .
Fortunately , executive producer Josh Friedman found a way to combine the necessary technological components of “ Terminator ” with deep characterization .
It seriously sucked that “ The Sarah Connor Chronicles ” was canceled just as those who ’d followed it from the beginning were really feeling rewarded for their steadfast viewership , but it was just insult to injury when “ Terminator : Salvation ” bombed , taking down any decent chance that the series might be revisited at some point .
7. Miracles ( ABC ) : I feel a little weird about including a show with religious themes in the midst of a list about sci - fi series , but when even the show ’s creator – Richard Hatem – is willing to acknowledge that it bounces back and forth between religious phenomena and paranormal phenomena , it ’s hard to argue against its place here .
Starring a pre -“ Jericho ” Skeet Ulrich , “ Miracles ” introduced viewers to Paul Callan , an investigator of modern miracles for the Catholic Church at the Archdiocese of Boston .
Though he ’s dealing with the inevitable frustration of disappointing groups of believers each time he investigates and disproves the authenticity of their “ miracles , ” Paul ’s faith is restored after he ’s involved in a car accident : not only does he have a first - hand experience with a young boy ’s ability to heal , but when his injuries lead to blood spatter on the windshield , he watches in astonishment as his his blood forms the words , “ God Is Now Here . ”
But , wait , hang on : maybe it actually said , “ God is Nowhere . ”
Either way , these events lead to a schism between Paul and the church when his report on the incidents is dismissed , but he soon crosses paths with Alva Keel ( Angus Macfadyen ) , who propositions him with a job offer at his organisation , Sodalitas Quaerito ( “ Brotherhood in search of truth ” ) .
From there , “ Miracles ” followed Paul , Alva , and Evelyn Santos ( Marisa Ramirez ) as they crossed the globe and investigated various phenomena , some less religious than others but all connected to life , death , and the afterlife in some fashion , rather like a spiritual version of “ The X - Files . ”
Unfortunately , the series was manhandled by ABC , running three episodes , then preempting it for three weeks , then moving it all over the schedule .
No wonder it never caught on .
With that kind of treatment , it would ’ve been a miracle if it had .
6. The Middleman ( ABC Family ) : I used to say that the reason this series failed was that ABC Family was the wrong network for it , but when I spoke with the show ’s creator , Javier Grillo - Marxuach , he set me straight and assured me that they were the right network .
Why ?
Because they let him do it .
“ It would have been very easy for any group of people to pick up the show and say , ‘ Gosh , we really like the idea of this girl fighting monsters , but can you make her sexier and kind of make the dialogue a little bit more accessible and make the sensibility of the show a little bit more accessible ? ’ ” he said .
“ And to ABC Family ’s credit , they never asked me to do that . ”
When you go back and watch the show from start to finish ( which is easy to do , what with Shout Factory having released a complete - series set ) , you really get a feel for the kind of freedom that Grillo - Marxuach was granted , but it still must be said that “ The Middleman ” might have been better served in the ratings if it had aired on a network that more readily catered to unabashed geeks .
Or , then again , maybe it would n’t have .
Given that the dialogue flies fast and furious , like a Kevin Smith movie on speed , and the amount of science fiction and fantasy concepts thrown at the viewer are only matched by the number of references to science fiction and fantasy movies and TV series , maybe it was always destined to be a future cult series .
5. Journeyman ( NBC ) :
What ’s this ?
Another “ Bullz - Eye ” favorite ?
Certainly , several of us on the staff were thrilling to the weekly adventures of reporter Dan Vasser ( Kevin McKidd ) as he involuntarily traveled through time , doing so as much to see the next cool set piece – I particularly loved it when he was on a smoke - filling flight during the 1970s – as to find out how his unexpected disappearances and impossible - to - predict returns would wreak havoc on his life in the present .
It was also unique for a sci - fi series in that it was unabashedly romantic , with Dan trying to reconcile his love for his wife in the present ( Gretchen Egolf ) with the revelation that his former fiancee ( Moon Bloodgood ) , who he ’d believed to be dead , was actually alive , well , and a fellow time traveler .
I talked to producer Kevin Falls at a point when the fate of “ Journeyman ” was in limbo , and he was understandably frustrated at the way the network was treating the series , even if he understood that they obviously had more stake in saving the shows that were produced by NBC - Universal .
( “ Journeyman ” was a Fox production . )
When I pitched the idea of moving from series to movie , a la “ Firefly , ” he was enthusiastic but realistic about the suggestion .
“ I would do anything to keep this show alive , ” he said .
“ If there was interest and somebody wanted to make a movie , nothing would make me happier .
But I have to be realistic : Joss Whedon had quite a following , and I do n’t know that Kevin Falls has quite that following . ”
Unfortunately , it appears that he was right : not only was “ Journeyman ” canceled , but it was n’t even released on DVD after its cancellation .
4. Reaper ( The CW ) : I think this cancellation hurt more folks at Bullz - Eye than any other in this list .
It ’s a bold statement , but when you look back at our TV Power Rankings , you ’ll see that I ’m not kidding .
Of course , its success there is probably – but not definitely – why got it canceled , but , dammit , we had to show our love .
The trifecta of slackers in “ Reaper ” were great , but let ’s not kid ourselves : as much as we laughed at their antics , it was Ray Wise who kept us coming back every week .
It ’s a crime that that man never got an Emmy nomination for his work as the Devil .
Series creators Michele Fazekas and Tara Butters had a lot of battles with The CW about their desire to expand on the mythology of the show ( the network , as is so often the case , was more comfortable with self - contained episodes ) , and given that the duo had departed by the end of the show ’s second season , it ’s a fair bet that Season 3 would n’t have been the same “ Reaper ” that we ’d come to know and love , anyway .
But , man , we sure would like it if Fazekas and Butters could find the backing to do a “ Reaper ” movie …and we have it on good authority that Bret Harrison and Tyler Labine would be back in a flash .
So what are you waiting for , Hollywood ?
Let ’s get moving on this thing !
3. Firefly ( Fox ) : I feel like the majority of what I might have to say about this series has probably already been said somewhere within Bob Westal ’s love letter to Joss Whedon ’s best work of the 2000s … and if Bob himself did n’t say it , then surely one of the folks who commented on it did .
Still , I ’ll go ahead and throw in my two cents worth and reconfirm that , yes , the idea of a Western set in space was indeed a wonderful one … and it would ’ve worked , too , if it was n’t for those pesky network executives at Fox .
As someone who literally grew up in the world of television ( his father , Tom Whedon , was one of the original writers for “ Captain Kangaroo ” and went on to serve as the head writer of “ The Electric Company ” ) ,
Whedon tried to kick it old - school with “ Firefly ” by starting things off with a two - hour pilot to set the stage for the series .
Fox , however , decided it would be a better move to just dump viewers into the deep end and had the series debut with the second episode instead .
I think we all know how well that plan worked .
“ Firefly ” was set in the 2500s and offered a less than upbeat look into the future , suggesting that , although technology had reached a point where gravity - drive engines made travel beyond our solar system possible , things were pretty tough all over .
Earth ’s population was such that people pretty much had to leave the planet if they wanted to survive , but while terraforming had allowed humanity to set up colonies on many different planets , their existence tended toward the rough - and - tumble , not unlike America ’s wild west during the late 1800s .
As such , Whedon took several stereotypes of the era – cowboy , preacher , hooker with the heart of gold , blacksmith , doctor , and even stagecoach driver – and tweaked them to fit his new premise .
Nathan Fillion ’s performance as Captain Mal was such a career - defining role that he spent seven years trying to find another one that worked as well for him ( you can bet that he kissed the sky when he got word that “ Castle ” had received a second - season pick - up ) , and Summer Glau ’s creepy vibe while playing the troubled River was no doubt directly responsible for earning her the later role as a Terminator on “ The Sarah Connor Chronicles , ” but like Whedon ’s other shows , the whole ensemble played well together from the start .
“ Firefly ” had enough of a following to move from cancellation to the silver screen , but while the odds of ever seeing a sequel to “ Serenity ” are pretty slim , hey , it ’s more of an afterlife than any other show on this list had .
2. Invasion ( ABC ) : More love for another favorite of the Power Rankings .
The premise of the show , more or less , was that a race of aliens had begun their takeover of Earth by slowly infiltrating the residents of a small town and possessing them …or bonding with them …or maybe they replaced them altogether but just retained their memories .
I ca n’t quite recall – it ’s been a fair while since I ’ve revisited the series – but I ’m not entirely sure that re-screening all 22 episodes would necessarily provide me with a definitive answer .
There were a lot of mysteries lurking within “ Invasion , ” and creator Shaun Cassidy had big plans to considerably expand upon the mythos of the series in future seasons , but , as we know , he never got that opportunity .
“ Invasion ” was , at its heart , a show about family .
You ’ve got Sheriff Tom Underlay ( William Fichtner ) , whose wife , Mariel ( Kari Matchett ) , is the ex-wife of park ranger Russell Varon ( Eddie Sibrian ) ;
Tom has a daughter from his first marriage ( Alexis Dziena ) , and Mariel and Russell have a daughter ( Ariel Gade ) and a son ( Evan Peters ) , plus Russell is remarried , and he and his wife Larkin ( Lisa Sheridan ) – who ’s expecting – live with Larkin ’s brother , Dave ( Tyler Labine ) , an amiable conspiracy nut who regularly blogs about his theories … which , yes , include the possibility of alien invasion .
Yes , the show had its faults , most notably an insistence on spending too much time on teen angst , but as the season progressed , “ Invasion ” evolved into must - see sci-fi TV .
The concept that the aliens were n’t always successful in their attempts to possess their human hosts was an intriguing one , as was the question posited as the series progressed : what if an alien race wanted to infiltrate Earth but their ranks were divided on how to go about it ?
Unfortunately , this mystery and all of the others within “ Invasion ” remain unsolved .
1. Threshold ( CBS ) : Dr. Molly Anne Caffrey ( Carla Gugino ) is a crisis management consultant for the US government who gets a major surprise when her worst - case - scenario plan for what to do in case of an alien invasion is activated .
Pulls together a team of experts , including microbiologist Dr. Nigel Fenway ( Brent Spiner , “ Star Trek : The Next Generation ” ) , linguist Arthur Ramsey ( Peter Dinklage , “ The Station Agent ” ) , and aerospace engineer Lucas Pegg ( Robert Patrick Benedict , “ Felicity ” ) , the group begin to investigate the aliens in order find out if they ’re hostile or not .
Hey , guess what ?
They totally are !
Produced by Brandon Braga and David S. Goyer , both possessing seriously strong sci- fi backgrounds ( “ Star Trek ” and “ Blade , ” respectively ) , “ Threshold ” did a really good job of building the histories of the characters , exploring the aliens and making them legitimately terrifying , and , perhaps most intriguingly , presenting a realistic view of how the government would probably handle such a situation , with various senators being let in on the top - secret organization out of necessity so that funding would continue .
Although the series only lasted for 13 episodes , “ Threshold ” had actually been designed for three specific plot arcs , with its creators planning to change the title accordingly for each : “ Threshold ” was meant to indicate that the aliens had made contact , and from there it would ’ve moved on to the self - explanatory “ Foothold , ” followed by “ Stranglehold , ” wherein the aliens would ’ve overthrown the indigenous population – that ’d be us – and become the overlords .
With such an awesome cast and a solid creative team , it ’s still shocking to me that the series never took off , especially when you consider that , while it certainly maintained regularly - progressing plotlines , “ Threshold ” had an arguable advantage over the rest of these series by not ending each episode with a cliffhanger …or , in other words , you could miss an episode and not be completely and totally lost the next time you tuned in .
Maybe the problem came from the tussle between the network and the show ’s creative team .
“ It was always intended to be a serialized show , ” said Goyer in a 2009 interview with Bullz - Eye .
“ Once we got going into the series , ( CBS ) wanted episodes to be more closed ended .
And they have had a lot of success with that , but we had n’t really designed it for that , so it felt like we were stalling … and I think the audience unfortunately sensed that as well . ”
That ’s just the sort of thing you ’d expect a frustrated creator to say , and you ca n’t blame him , but the potential for the show was so tremendous that it never occurred to me that they were stalling .
I just thought they were just building anticipation .
Just a little fun here : videos of musicians and other celebrities not taking the Trent Reznor / Lady Gaga approved route , and engaging with their fans in some very negative ways .
Amy Winehouse not only gobbed into the crowd at the Eden sessions , but actually reached out and thumped someone in the crowd at Glastonbury in 2008 .
Akon invites a kid who threw a bottle at him to step up on stage , then proceeds to throw him bodily into the crowd .
A 47 year old Canadian man runs up and pushes a 41 year old English man over at a festival in Toronto .
Cut to 1:30 if you ’ve heard the song before .
But it ’s not just flighty , feisty , musicians ; other professionals are n’t above violence : The George W. Bush ‘ Shoe Incident ’ : a journalist angry about the foreign invasion of his country and the subsequent deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis chooses to express his disgust by throwing a shoe .
Like GWB and the WMD , he can’t find his target .
The politicians get their own back , usually via the taxman and lying about their expenses , but here John Prescott ( deputy Prime Minister at the time ) takes a more direct approach when he is egged hard at point blank range by a protester , and very sensibly reacts by punching said protester in the face .
The sad schoolyard scuffle that ensues does little to enhance either his reputation or that of his bodyguards .
Surely some sunglassed MI5 suit should have Vulcan - nerve - pinched him quietly to the ground .
Arnie handled it a lot better .
If you fancy getting in on a little of the celebrity - scrapping action you can click here to punch Kanye West repeatedly in the face .
Just do n’t be surprised when Lady Gaga knocks you out in the 1st round .
You thought President Obama had his hands full sending 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan ?
That ’s small potatoes compared to the other big military plan on his agenda : returning 200,000 troops from other countries to the U. S. Northern Command in preparation for an imminent civil war at home .
At least that ’s the word from some on the right wing - fringe — in this case , LewRockwell.com and pastor and former presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin .
And from where did they get this surprising information ?
The European Union Times ( EUT ) .
In the likely event you ’re unfamiliar with it , that online publication carries links to American white supremacist publications like American Renaissance ( whose editor says black people cannot sustain civilization ) and carries section headings that include “ European Pride ” and “ Survival . ”
Among the stories in the first category are pieces about Christians in Moldavia tearing down an outdoor menorah , and the decline of mixed marriages in Russia .
Stories featured in the “ Survival ” section include another citizens ’ “ grand jury ” planning to “ indict ” Obama — this time in Tennessee — and the “ great victory ” in Switzerland , where voters recently backed an arguably referendum to ban the erection of minarets .
A third section carries a litany of accounts of black - on - white crimes .
The EUT claims that Obama has issued orders to “ begin immediately ” preparing for a 200,000 - troop increase to the Colorado Springs , Colo . - based U.S. Northern Command , formed seven years ago to oversee homeland defense .
That ’s so it can prepare for “ an expected outbreak of civil war within the United States before the end of winter , ” the EUT claims .
The supposed implosion of the nation ’s banking system will foment this explosion of violence .
“ Russian military analysts ” are the source for this shocking news , as well as “ reports , ” which claim that there are “ over 220 million American people armed to the teeth and ready to explode . ”
Of course , no actual analysts or reports are named .
But that did n’t stop somebody named Michael Gaddy writing for LewRockwell.com , and Chuck Baldwin , the Constitution Party ’s presidential candidate in 2008 , from hyping the story .
Rockwell is a libertarian commentator and blogger and former aide to U.S. Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Tex . ) , as well as current chairman of the Ludwig von Mises Institute , a libertarian think tank based in Auburn , Ala .
Gaddy is a contributor to his website .
Gaddy ’s only qualifications appear to be that he is an Army veteran of Vietnam , Grenada and Beirut .
“ Either the government is anticipating a total financial breakdown , there are plans to confiscate firearms , a new false flag event is in the works , or any combination of the three , ” he concludes from the EUT story .
“ On the minds of many Americans and politicians is exactly how will the military and law enforcement react if told to confiscate firearms or move American citizens to FEMA camps , ” Gaddy added on LewRockwell.com .
“ Brace yourselves and prepare , this is going to get real ugly . ”
Not to be outdone , Baldwin also dug up the FEMA camp canard — a central , and completely groundless , conspiracy theory of the militia movement of the 1990s — in a piece he wrote on his website last Friday .
“ This would help explain the reports of all those potential detention camps that have been constructed ( including the abandoned military installations that have refurbished fences , guard towers , etc. , around them ) , ” he wrote .
Baldwin called for a “ revolution of the individual states : to reclaim their sovereignty and fight for the liberties of their sovereigns ( We the People ) .
Furthermore , such a revolution would be constitutional , lawful , moral , and , yes , in compliance with the laws of Nature and Nature ’s God . ”
Still , the Pensacola , Fla. , pastor hedged on the reliability of the EUT story , saying that Obama “ might be ” worried about a civil war .
That , however , was reason enough for him to write a lengthy , alarmist essay about it .

3 Tall Poppy Interview : Anser
In his ( or is it her ? ) first interview , the street artist responsible for scrawling faces around Toronto talked to Torontoist about the process for picking a spot and painting ( and often re-painting and re-painting ) a portrait there , the line between street art and graffiti , and if there was a real woman attached to one of the city ’s most recognizable faces .

4 Billboard Companies Protest Billboard Tax …On Illegal Billboards
If there are two things that outdoor advertising companies love , it ’s breaking the law and not getting taxed .
That would make 2009 doubly bad , and the future of billboard advertising in Toronto even worse .
5 Not Your Typical Club Anthem
PETA is like the internet ’s version of Beetlejuice : say it a few times , and it ’s best you step back .
Even Joel Gibb of the Hidden Cameras could n’t make it right .
6 I Am CUPE , Hear Me Roar
Wait , did we say PETA was internet Beetlejuice ?
We meant Israel .
Or heck , unions .
We ’d forgive you if you forgot about what happened at the beginning of 2009 , when CUPE Ontario proposed a “ a ban on Israeli academics doing speaking , teaching or research work at Ontario universities , ” presumably because CUPE ’s new year ’s resolution for 2009 was to be really stupid .

9 TTC Kills the Radio Star
In a year of questionable advertising , few ads were worse than Virgin Radio ’s “ Give Your Radio a Reason to Live ” posters , one ad of which featured a radio teetering on the edge of a subway platform , apparently about to commit radiocide .
Worse : those ads were displayed on transit shelters , when it goes without saying that the TTC is resolutely anti-suicide .
And yet , after the TTC told us they planned to take the ads down , the transit organization did n’t do so swell of a job .
10 The Great Torontoist Pun Hunt
11 Putting Parks First
Hey , remember the city workers ’ strike ?
And the residents living near Christie Pits who protested against the park being used as a temporary dump site a little more than a week into the strike ?
And then the strike went on to last another three weeks ?
That was very fun .
11 Evolutionary Psychology
It ’s safe to say that Richard Dawkins is a bit of jerk , even if his jerk - iness is justified .
The question , which we mulled over when he arrived in Toronto for a lecture at the end of September , is whether that helps or hurts his cause .

15 They Heard the News Today , Oh Boy : City Workers ’ Strike Edition
People on the internet sure do like to get angry .
That ’s why we ’ve got a column called They Heard the News Today , Oh Boy , which picks apart the worst of the worst comments on local media sites .
Its very first edition , about the nearly over city workers ’ strike , took out the ( comment ) trash .

On 12 September this year , during the Indian summer of America 's discontent , tens of thousands of rightwing protesters marched on Washington .
The issues at stake were many – Obama 's proposed overhaul of healthcare , high taxes , big spending , feared socialism , abortion – and the venom was extraordinary .
Placards featured Obama as the Joker – in whiteface , with his mouth slashed bloodily from ear to ear , and the caption " THE DOCTOR WILL SEE YOU NOW " .
It was some time around then that the White House launched a war on the Murdoch - owned Fox News Channel – or that Fox launched a war on it , depending on who you think threw the first bomb , and when .
" War " , in any case , was the White House 's word .
Communications director Anita Dunn explained that the cable network – which has more than double the viewers of its closest competitor – was " undertaking a war against Barack Obama and the White House " and that as a result " we 're not going to legitimise them as a news organisation " .
Fox , Dunn went on to say , " often operates almost as either the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican party " .
( Since then , Fox 's ratings have shot up , Obama has altered his strategy by giving an interview to one of its reporters , and Dunn has stepped down as communications director . )
The suggestion that Fox skews right is not new , and not especially contentious .
What is new is its position in a spectacularly energised opposition movement that has taken hold in Obama 's first year .
George W Bush 's senior adviser Karl Rove used to keep Fox in step with a Republican agenda ; now the Republicans are no longer in power , Fox is beholden to nothing other than its own desire to make money .
As the Republican party recovers from its defeat , Fox appears to have stepped into the breach with a conservative , at times renegade agenda .
It has become the galvanising force of a rightwing protest movement the likes of which the country has never seen .
In November 1963 , the American historian Richard Hofstadter gave a lecture at Oxford which became a famous essay : " The Paranoid Style in American Politics " .
" Although American political life has rarely been touched by the most acute varieties of class conflict , " Hofstadter began , " it has served again and again as an arena for uncommonly angry minds " .
He coined the phrase " paranoid style " to evoke , as he put it , " qualities of heated exaggeration , suspiciousness and conspiratorial fantasy " , and explained that he used the term the way an art historian might write of the baroque style or the mannerist style .
He was referring not to the clinical paranoid but to the more or less normal person who speaks in this idiom of persecution .
The clinical paranoid thinks the world is against him and him alone ; the political paranoid believes he speaks for millions .
This is just the style of speech whose renaissance we are witnessing .
In an article published in the New Yorker shortly after the September protests , Hendrik Hertzberg – a leading political commentator and former speechwriter for Jimmy Carter – pointed out that although this administration knew that overhauling the healthcare system would be difficult , what came as a surprise to them was " the predominant tone of opposition " .
" This sort of lunatic paranoia has long been a feature of the fringe , " Hertzberg wrote .
" What is different now is the evolution of a new political organism , with paranoia as its animating principle " .
The protesters – who call themselves the tea party protesters , after the resistance movement that gave rise to the Boston Tea Party in 1773 – differ in crucial ways from leftwing protest movements of the past .
They have the allegiance of Republicans in Congress , rather than operating in counterpoint to government .
They are backed by vast sums of corporate money – in a practice known as " astroturfing " ( fake grassroots ) , corporate sponsors funnel cash into a variety of non-profit groups so that their interests are served by what appears to be a spontaneous populist movement .
And , thanks to Fox , they have a very , very loud voice .
Scattered between the protest signs on 12 September were endorsements of one of the march 's instigators : " WE LOVE GLENN BECK " .
Fox News presenters such as Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly have been part of the inflammatory political landscape for some time .
People invest in them : one weekend in October , five books in the New York Times bestseller list were by conservative pundits either employed by or affiliated with Fox .
But Fox 's newest star , its most artful misinformer , is Glenn Beck .
His 5 pm show on Fox now claims 3 million viewers ; his syndicated morning radio show has 8 million listeners ; he has several bestselling books , including a novel and a children 's book ; he has his own one - man touring stage show and , as of last week , conducts political rallies .
( His earnings in the year leading up to June 2009 were estimated by Forbes to be around $ 23 m , and they are set to increase . )
Until the beginning of this year , Beck – derided as " Satan 's mentally challenged younger brother " by Stephen King – was at CNN .
When Obama was elected , Beck had modest , reasonable things to say about him .
" I think so far he 's chosen wisely , " he told Time magazine .
" I frankly pissed off a lot of my real diehard Republicans when I said : ' He is my president .
He is your president . '
We must have him succeed .
If he fails , we all fail . "
But as soon as Beck moved to Fox and Obama moved into the White House , Beck became a completely different animal – the leader , you might say , of the opposition .
His haranguing of Van Jones , Obama 's special adviser for green jobs , contributed to Jones 's resignation in September .
His opposition to Cass Sunstein , Obama 's choice for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs , helped to delay Sunstein 's appointment by half a year ( more on that later ) .
After Obama 's comment that the police acted stupidly when they wrongfully arrested the Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr , Beck called the president a racist , prompting an ad boycott .
After a programme in which Beck said , with great melodramatic effect , that he was " tired " , Obama appeared to respond directly .
" I want everybody to know who 's standing in the way of progress , " he told a crowd in San Francisco , " I 'm not tired " .
Two weeks ago Sarah Palin announced that she would consider Beck for her running mate should she bid for the presidency .
Unlike his colleagues , who are diehard conservatives , Beck is unpredictable – a rogue , as Sarah Palin might say .
There 's something giddy about watching him : he 's insanely noxious , horribly funny and utterly compelling .
He mocks himself for emphasis .
" I am the most enthusiastic capitalist since Adam Smith , " he said on one recent show , " If I could sell sponsorship on this chin right here , I would .
It would say : ' third chin sponsored by Goodyear ' . "
He convinces people that he really cares .
" I 'm just a guy who cares an awful lot about my country , " he once said , tears of patriotism rolling down his cheeks .
In the expression of one Beck - watcher , he has more going on in his face at any given moment than Jack Nicholson in his prime .
Beck 's personal story is so exquisitely tailored to American dreams of redemption that it seems ( and indeed parts of it may be ) too bad to be true .
He was born in 1964 into a working - class family in Washington state .
His father came from a long line of bakers , and his mother was an alcoholic and drug addict who drowned in 1979 .
In 1977 , Beck 's parents had divorced , and he had landed his first radio gig ( at the age of 13 ) .
Beck later said that his mother committed suicide when he was 13 , though her death was reported as an accident and occurred two years later .
( His wife said that the first she heard of his mother 's suicide was when he told the story on the radio . )
As a child , he was a fan of Orson Welles 's radio broadcasts , and – although Welles 's political position was as far from Beck 's eventual one as possible – Beck modelled his larger - than - life radio character on him .
( His company is named Mercury Radio Arts , after Welles's . )
In 1983 , he married his first wife , and they had two daughters , one born with cerebral palsy .
He became successful as a Top 40 morning radio host ; after the Reagan administration dismantled a lot of the regulatory structure for radio in the mid-80s , Beck became a star of what was known as gonzo radio .
He took to cocaine and alcohol – or , as he puts it in his book The Real America , he succumbed to the ministrations of " Dr Jack Daniels " .
In 1995 , Beck was given six months to live : eight months later he was still an alcoholic .
Eventually , he joined AA , pulled through , divorced , remarried , had two more children , and , at the behest of his disabled daughter , converted to Mormonism .
His experience of suffering and salvation has led him , he has said , to his quixotic brand of libertarianism .
He is against the two - party system altogether .
He does n't want the government telling him what to do .
" When did we become this country where everything is too big to fail ? " he rhetorically asked the CBS TV interviewer Katie Couric , " What about the little guy ? "
In his bestseller Glenn Beck 's Common Sense ( a reference to Thomas Paine 's Common Sense , written in 1776 ) , he addresses his reader .
" I think I know who you are , " he writes .
" You are a person of ' strong beliefs ' , with a ' warm heart ' .
You work hard , you 're not reckless with money , you 're worried about what the economy means for your family .
You 're not a bigot , but you stopped expressing opinions on sensitive issues a long time ago because you do n't want to be called a racist or a homophobe if you stand by your values and principles .
You do n't understand how the government can ask you to make more sacrifices just so that bankers and politicians can reap the benefit .
Dear reader , Glenn Beck can help you .
He will stand up with you and say : ' Do n't tread on me . ' "
One of Beck 's campaigns featured a security system now being offered with some General Motors cars .
It 's called Onstar ; it includes a tracking device in case your car gets stolen , and a speed limit you can impose so a thief can't get away in a high - speed chase .
Beck 's take on this was that since GM is now partly owned by the government , this was the government 's " spy satellite " , its way of knowing where you are at all times .
Yet Beck positions himself as an entirely reasonable , non-conspiracy theorist .
He 's just like you : an ordinary guy who wants to know what 's going on .
He refers to others as " the nut - job fringes " and says : " the fringes are what 's pulling us apart " .
He also holds some surprising opinions .
He has said he would have voted for Hillary Clinton over John McCain ; he 's in favour of gay marriage ; he quotes Martin Luther King all the time .
Beck is known to suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .
" We all feel a wide range of emotions , " Beck writes , " and as a borderline schizophrenic , I assure you my range is wider than it should be . "
What does the proliferation of active and outspoken conservatives mean for America ?
Are they nothing but noise , or are they genuinely powerful ?
And if they 're powerful , are they a threat to Democrats – a force that will steer the Republicans further to the right and take most of the country with them ?
Or are they a threat to Republicans – a movement that will accentuate the fractures in the opposition party and render it unable to govern again ?
When I ask the liberal columnist Michael Tomasky whether we 're looking at a loony fringe , he says : " The fringe is the mainstream .
I think a key point here is that with each passing decade since Ronald Reagan , the Republican party has moved further and further to the right .
In the 1980s , Ronald Reagan seemed really conservative .
If a person of Ronald Reagan 's position and politics were around today , these people would probably call him a sellout .
I could not name you six Republicans in Congress who seem like they 're prepared to negotiate in good faith on anything that 's remotely controversial . "
Tomasky directs me to a poll published last week .
One of Beck 's big targets has been an organisation called Acorn , for which Obama once worked as a lawyer and which helped him get out the vote during his presidential campaign .
Republicans accused Acorn of voter fraud , and this year it has been the subject of embezzlement and other scandals , to which Fox has given a great deal of coverage .
As a result , this poll suggests , a majority of Republicans thinks the election was stolen .
" Only one in four Republican voters thinks Obama won the election legitimately , " Tomasky concludes in amazement .
" What do you do with that ?
It 's like trying to argue with people who think that the grass is blue and the sky is green . "
James Pinkerton , a long - time Fox contributor who worked for Reagan and Bush senior , believes the tea party movement represents the mainstream , not just of the Republican party , but of the country as a whole .
He refers to another recent poll , conducted by Gallup in which 40 % of Americans described themselves as conservatives , 36 % as moderates and 20 % as liberals .
" Conservatives outnumber liberals two to one , " Pinkerton emphasises .
" The tea party movement is simply public opinion registering itself , and it would appear that they 've got the bulk of the country with them . "
So , as for the nutty fringe , he says drily , " I 'm sure in Europe you could find people who'd say America 's at least 40 % nutty , but from an American point of view , this is who we are . "
Then I speak to David Frum , author of Comeback : Conservatism That Can Win Again and a former speechwriter for Bush ( Frum is responsible for the phrase " axis of evil " ) .
He is much more specific about Fox 's relationship to the Republican party ( and , by extension , its possible effect or non-effect on the Democratic party ) .
Frum says : " If you 're someone like me – a Republican who would like to govern the country again – Fox is a gigantic trap .
There is no way this kind of talk is going to govern American public opinion as a whole . "
He quotes a story told by the novelist Tom Wolfe ( a famous Republican ) , about an occasion when he met the German novelist Günter Grass ( who has his own complicated political history ) .
Grass said : " The dark night of fascism is falling in the United States ! " and Wolfe said : " The dark night of fascism may be falling in the United States , but it always seems to land in Europe . "
In other words , Frum says : " This is a highly stable political system .
And the system screens out extremists .
It 's just that the entertainment system rewards extremists .
So there 's a gap .
The real confusion in the Republican party right now , the real danger , is that it will appease the Palinites much more than it needs to . "
Frum cites the example of Cass Sunstein , the legal scholar Obama appointed to head the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs – in Frum 's description , one of the most important jobs in the US government .
Sunstein is in favour of deregulation , and a darling of , among others , David Cameron .
He was endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce , by the Wall Street Journal ; in short , this was a nomination people on the right were very pleased with .
But , Frum explains : " Glenn Beck takes it into his head that this guy is bad news . "
The result is that 33 Republicans vote against confirming him to the job .
" That 's the Fox problem : it pushes the party into doing things that it knows it does n't want to do – that its most important constituencies oppose , that put you on the wrong side of where the potential swing voters are .
In order to appease the Fox audience , you end up being more radical than you need to be . "
" Radical right , you mean ? "
" I 'm not sure I want to use that word .
Radical angry . "
Frum concludes that Republicans " have a lot to worry about " in the face of Fox and its friends .
In the 90s , he says , Republicans would have used something like this healthcare bill to push through changes they wanted without leaving their fingerprints on them , and let the Democrats take the blame if they were unpopular .
Now , however , these televisual carny barkers are in the way , and " it makes it impossible for your leadership to make any kind of deal " .
Essentially , Frum is describing the exact thing referred to by Tomasky , whose political position is diametrically opposed : Republicans in Congress are not negotiating .
But Frum does n't attribute it to the party 's right - wing drift .
He says the party is subject to a powerful force outside its border .
In other words , Fox is changing the face of bipartisanship – that notion by which Obama sets so much store .
The network is neither a meaningless noise machine nor an arm of the Republican party but , you might say , a third party , an active splitter of views and votes .
Glenn Beck , the renegade opponent of the two - party system with his unpredictable agenda and paranoid messages , is therefore not some uncontainable figure on the fringe but the most explicit spokesperson for this exploding purpose .
The White House may have got that line about Fox being a wing of the Republican party backwards :
The Republican party , it seems , is now a wing of Fox .
Via Orac comes this tale of religious kneejerking that shows just how big a problem it is in America .
I urge you to read the whole thing , but the basic story is a band made t- shirts with the theme " Brass Evolutions " using the famous cartoon sequence of a monkey changing into a man .
It 's a cute idea , and no big deal , right ?
Right ?
Not so right .
Some parents complained about the shirts because they depicted -- gasp !-- evolution ( never mind that it's a cartoony version that 's really not even terribly accurate ) .
Assistant Superintendent Brad Pollitt decided to make the students turn in their shirts so as to not offend any parents ' sensibilities .
The sheer dumbosity of this already has my head reeling .
You might think at first that this is n't a huge deal : it 's just another example of narrow - minded thinking we 've seen so much of from creationists .
But in fact it 's a lot worse than that .
From the original article :
Pollitt said the district is required by law to remain neutral where religion is concerned .
I 'm afraid that is simply not true .
Like , really really not true .
First , by taking away the shirts , he was not being religion neutral .
He was kowtowing to a specific religion .
That action immediately contradicted his words .
Second , think about what that sentence means .
If being religion - neutral means not offending any religion , then nothing at all could ever be taught at school .
Certainly not science , which clashes in almost every conceivable way with Fundamentalist creationist doctrine .
You can't teach anything past 6000 years ago under Pollitt 's reasoning .
No astronomy , no biology , no history ( Sumerians were around long before 4000 BC ) .
Some interpretations of Islamic law state that music is forbidden .
Does traife food touch kosher food in the cafeteria ( or is it served on the same plates ) ?
Does anyone wanna go through Leviticus and see what rules from there the school breaks ?
If we are to believe Pollitt , then they 'll have to ban the Pledge of Allegiance because Jehovah 's Witnesses do n't worship idols .
That 'll go over well , I 'm sure .
This whole idea of " religion neutrality " is a crock , and clearly is being used to the advantage of one narrowly - defined religious viewpoint .
There 's a difference between being neutral -- which Pollitt clearly was not being -- and not promoting one religion over another .
Being religion - neutral in the sense Pollitt means is conceptually impossible .
You cannot appease every religion , because many common modern religions contradict each other .
However , we can be religion - neutral by actually refraining from making any decisions based on religion .
That 's what that First Amendment is all about .
So what we have here is yet another shot in the battle over religious freedom ( both of and from ) in this country .
I suspect the band leader could pursue a First Amendment case here .
But if he chooses to pursue it , he may have an uphill climb ... it depends on how many people there hold the same view as band parent Sherry Melby , one of the people offended by the very concept of evolution :
“ I was disappointed with the image on the shirt . ”
Melby said .
“ I do n’t think evolution should be associated with our school . ”
Yes , because teaching the very fundamentals of biology in a school ?
Heaven forbid .

The UO Index rose 0.5 percent in July , and the overall behavior of the Index in recent months continues to indicate that Oregon will exit recession in the second half of 2009 .
Highlights include :
• Initial jobs claims continue to trend downward , but the slow pace of improvement is consistent with a jobless recovery , a situation in which even as the economy emerges from recession , economic growth is not sufficient to support significant net job creation .
Note that the declines in nonfarm payrolls resumed in August as employers shed a net 6,600 workers .
• Residential building permits were essentially unchanged , albeit at very low levels of activity .
Given reports of some stability in housing markets this summer both nationally and locally , the residential construction market may have reached a bottom this summer .
Housing markets , however , are dependent on a wide range of government support that is likely to be curtailed in future markets and still the headwind of tighter underwriting on the part of lenders .
• New orders for core manufactured goods declined for a second month ; while firm investment plans have stabilized , but lack the upward momentum consistent with strong growth .
– Consumer confidence gained , but remains fragile – note , for example , the repaid reversal in car sales in September after the Cash for Clunkers program expired .
• The UO Index is likely to be a coincident measure of activity at the end of the recession ; it will rise as the Oregon economy exits the recession .
Although a one month gain is not by itself conclusive evidence that the recession has ended , it follows a pattern of improvement in the UO Index in recent months that is similar to the improvement that signaled an end to the 2001 recession .
The concern of an anemic recovery with subpar labor market conditions remains as the economy experiences structural adjustment away from the debt - fueled consumer dynamic of recent years .

Tonight , AOL revealed its master plan for cheap content creation : automated assignment editors .
AOL told the Wall Street Journal it is developing an algorithm that will assign freelance writers stories based on user Web searches and the sites AOL ISP subscribers visit .
This week , for example , AOL 's algorithm would have assigned lots of stories about crib safety malfunctions .
Along with reader interest , AOL 's algorithm will also try to predict how much marketers would be willing to pay to advertise next to stories on certain topics .
In this way , when AOL 's algorithm assigns a story , it will also come up with an amount of money AOL would be willing to pay to see it created .
Assignments will be doled out to freelancers through Seed.com .
After freelancers submit content , AOL 's 500 or so editorial staffers will edit it and post it .
The WSJ says fees will " range from nothing upfront , with a promise to share ad revenues the article generates , to more than $ 100 per item . "
CEO Tim Armstrong 's plan for turning around AOL after its December 10 spin - off from Time Warner ( TWX ) is to turn it from a ISP into a next - generation media company .
A big challenge ( among many ) will be convincing shareholders AOL can make that transition while maintaining the ISP business 's wide margins .
Hence tonight 's plans , which , replacing human editors with robot ones , will presumably keep content creation from being as expensive as it usually is .

In a move that ’s sure to make Internet freedom advocates everywhere laugh out loud , Chinese government censors hard - pressed to stem the tide of porn are now offering to pay web users to go searching for it .
Almost needless to say , China ’s interest in pornography has swelled , in a manner of speaking .
Authorities are offering rewards of up to 10,000 yuan ( 1,465 dollars ) to Internet users who report sites that feature pornography , state media reported Sunday .

The scheme , part of a larger Internet porn crackdown that even extends to mobile WAP sites , is being marketed by Chinese officials as a way to protect youths during the holiday .
The porn prohibition even includes advertisements for sex-related products .
Within the first 24 hours , a hotline set up Friday by Internet Illegal Information Reporting Center was flooded with more than 500 phone calls and 13,000 online tips , the official Xinhua news agency reported .
Rewards ranging from 1,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan will go to the first person to report each website , the center said in a notice , adding a committee would review the tipoffs to determine what award was appropriate , Xinhua said .
China has launched several Internet crackdowns on pornography , con artists and political activists in the past .
Earlier this year China threatened to sanction major websites , including search engine giants Google and Baidu , alleging that pornography and other material that could corrupt young people was turning up in search results .

Since June , the government has required all personal computers sold in China to be outfitted with an automated censorship program called the “ Green Dam - Youth Escort . ”

A mischievous biblical bedroom billboard was defaced just over five hours after it was erected in downtown Auckland today .
The controversial billboard , erected by St Matthew - in - the - City Church about 11 am , shows Joseph looking down dejectedly and Mary looking sad .
Underneath is a caption , '' Poor Joseph .
God is a hard act to follow . ''
It was seen defaced with brown paint about 4.10 pm , with both faces and the caption covered .
The church has said it erected the billboard to inspire people to talk about the Christmas story .
However , it has been called offensive and inappropriate by other Christian groups .
As an Afghan woman who was elected to Parliament , I am in the United States to ask President Barack Obama to immediately end the occupation of my country .
Eight years ago , women ’s rights were used as one of the excuses to start this war .
But today , Afghanistan is still facing a women ’s rights catastrophe .
Life for most Afghan women resembles a type of hell that is never reflected in the Western mainstream media .
In 2001 , the U.S. helped return to power the worst misogynist criminals , such as the Northern Alliance warlords and druglords .
These men ought to be considered a photocopy of the Taliban .
The only difference is that the Northern Alliance warlords wear suits and ties and cover their faces with the mask of democracy while they occupy government positions .
But they are responsible for much of the disaster today in Afghanistan , thanks to the U.S. support they enjoy .
The U.S. and its allies are getting ready to offer power to the medieval Taliban by creating an imaginary category called the “ moderate Taliban ” and inviting them to join the government .
A man who was near the top of the list of most - wanted terrorists eight years ago , Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , has been invited to join the government .
Over the past eight years the U.S. has helped turn my country into the drug capital of the world through its support of drug lords .
Today , 93 percent of all opium in the world is produced in Afghanistan .
Many members of Parliament and high ranking officials openly benefit from the drug trade .
President Karzai ’s own brother is a well known drug trafficker .
Meanwhile , ordinary Afghans are living in destitution .
The latest United Nations Human Development Index ranked Afghanistan 181 out of 182 countries .
Eighteen million Afghans live on less than $ 2 a day .
Mothers in many parts of Afghanistan are ready to sell their children because they cannot feed them .
Afghanistan has received $ 36 billion of aid in the past eight years , and the U.S. alone spends $ 165 million a day on its war .
Yet my country remains in the grip of terrorists and criminals .
My people have no interest in the current drama of the presidential election since it will change nothing in Afghanistan .
Both Karzai and Dr. Abdullah are hated by Afghans for being U.S. puppets .
The worst casualty of this war is truth .
Those who stand up and raise their voice against injustice , insecurity and occupation have their lives threatened and are forced to leave Afghanistan , or simply get killed .
We are sandwiched between three powerful enemies : the occupation forces of the U.S. and NATO , the Taliban and the corrupt government of Hamid Karzai .
Now President Obama is considering increasing troops to Afghanistan and simply extending former President Bush ’s wrong policies .
In fact , the worst massacres since 9/11 were during Obama ’s tenure .

" Probably the best biscuits in newly biscuit - crazed New York City . "
Brooklyn Star 33 Havemeyer Street , Brooklyn NY 11211 ( map ) ; 718-599-9899 ; thebrooklynstar.com
Service : Informal , friendly , genuinely helpful
Setting : Tiny , minimally adorned dining room .
Must Haves : Buttermilk biscuits , cinnamon buns , ham steak , shrimp and grits , pork chop
Grade : A-
Brooklyn Star chef - owner Joaquin Baca and I have a history I 'm not particularly proud of .
When he was partners with David Chang at Momofuku Noodle Bar , I raved about their chicken soup in the New York Times in 2006 .
There was only one problem .
I spelled his name wrong in the piece ( Vaca instead of Baca ) , which must have really hurt because it was the first time Baca was mentioned in the media .
The paper published a correction , but the damage had already been done .
Carey Jones was not even aware of this sordid piece of food - media history when she raved about Brooklyn Star 's dinner menu .
So when the Serious Eaters descended on Baca 's restaurant to check out his brunch menu , I found myself face to face with a man not named Vaca , and his wood - burning oven .
Baca grew up in Texas , so Brooklyn Star 's Southern slant can't be considered a surprise .
As for the wood - burning oven , it was left behind by the pizzeria that previously occupied the space .
Southern cooking utilizing a wood - burning oven ?
As Baca himself points out : " My family is cattle ranchers in south Texas , and they cook everything in these big wood grills .
They 'll cook all the shit on them .
It 's not just bread and pizza . "
This turns out to be a good thing .
A very good thing , in fact .
Moist , light , corn-studded bacon and jalapeño corn bread ( $ 4.50 ) comes in a small skillet straight from the aforementioned oven .
The jalapeño and bacon , which could have overwhelmed everything else , are used sparingly but effectively .
I know I 've never used sparingly , effectively , and bacon in the same sentence , but there 's a first time for everything .
The buttermilk biscuits ( $ 4 ) are probably the best biscuits in newly biscuit - crazed New York City .
Serious New
York eaters like me tend to romanticize the biscuits we find ourselves eating here , so we overstate their deliciousness , but these biscuits are the real deal — flaky , moist , light , and just about perfect .
The cinnamon bun ( $ 4 ) , moist , cinammony , and not too sweet , also comes straight from the wood - burning oven in a small cast iron pan .
I tend to be very forgiving about any baked goods served piping hot , but I did n't have to be in a forgiving mood to appreciate these cinnamon buns .
They 're more yeasty than gooey , and that 's a trade - off well worth making when it comes to cinnamon buns .
As they cool they do lose some of their serious deliciousness , but what cinnamon buns do n't ?
Doughnuts ( $ 6 for three ) are deftly fried and flawlessly executed , but they were missing some kind of doughnut magic .
I did like the Concord grape filling in the jelly doughnut , but it could have used more filling and less doughnut .
Biscuits and Sausage Gravy with Scrambled Cheesy Eggs ( $ 9 ) are extremely satisfying , but the cheddar cheese is n't really necessary .
( How many times have you heard me say that ? )
Farm Yogurt , Fruit , and Granola ( $ 7 ) is a must - have , and not because the yogurt is tart , the granola is good and crunchy , the apple slices are prettily fanned atop the yogurt , and the grapefruit is sweet - tart and juicy .
No , it 's necessary as an antidote to all the other rich and filling food that will be on your table .
Ham Steak , Mashed Potatoes , Red Eye Gravy , and Two Fried Eggs ( $ 11 ) is like the blue plate special of my dreams .
The ham steak is thick and juicy , the sunny - side up eggs are cooked perfectly , the red eye gravy has bacon in it as a flavor booster , and the peppery mashed potatoes are really fine .
Fried Pork Chop , Fried Eggs , and White Grits ( $ 11 ) — this is a phenomenal East - meets - South preparation .
The juicy panko - crusted pork chop is greaselesly fried , crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside .
How good is this pork chop ?
It 's the first time I can ever remember Robyn Lee hogging a plate of food in my presence .
( That 's a pun . )
Griddle Cakes with Honey and Thick - Cut Bacon ( $ 9 ) :
The griddle cakes were light and crisp on the outside , moist on the inside , and if they 're not the pancakes of my dreams , they are still pretty damn fine .
Baca 's entry in the New York Fried Chicken sweepstakes comes with a seriously delicious potato pancake and maple butter ( $ 11 ) .
The chicken pieces themselves have crackling skin on the outside and juicy chicken on the inside , but the breast meat is slightly dry and I did find little pockets of flour in the cracks between the skin and the meat .
But overall this is yummy fried chicken .
Shrimp and Grits with Bacon and Fried Eggs ( $ 11 ) is a fabulous bowl of food .
It tastes amazingly shrimpy from shrimp stock , the shrimp are n't overcooked , the creamy Anson Mills grits are oh - so - buttery , and the bacon is crisp and not stiff in the slightest .
In short , it 's everything you could ask for in a plate of breakfast food , and a worthy entrant in the shrimp - and - grits craze sweeping New York 's hipster restaurants .
And the Hot Meatloaf Sandwich on Country White Bread ( $ 9 ) is way better than your school cafeteria's .
All right , Joaquin Baca , you win .
I loved my brunch at Brooklyn Star , and this time I managed to spell your name right .

Stanford scientists are harnessing nanotechnology to quickly produce ultra- lightweight , bendable batteries and supercapacitors in the form of everyday paper .
Simply coating a sheet of paper with ink made of single - walled carbon nanotube ( CNT ) and silver nanowire films makes a highly conductive storage device , said Yi Cui , assistant professor of materials science and engineering at Stanford University .
The paper storage - device can last through 40,000 charge - discharge cycles – at least an order of magnitude more than lithium batteries .
The commercially available paper can be made highly conductive with a sheet resistance as low as one ohm per square ( Ω/sq ) , and when only the mass of the CNTs are considered , a specific capacitance of 200F / g , a specific energy of 30 - 47Wh/kg , and a specific power of 200,000W / kg can be achieved .
Cui had previously created nanomaterial energy - storage devices using plastics .
His new research shows that a paper storage - device is more durable because the ink adheres more strongly to paper .
A paper storage - device may be especially useful for applications such as electric or hybrid cars , which depend on the quick transfer of electricity .
‘ This technology has the potential to be commercialised within a short time , ’ said Peidong Yang , professor of chemistry at the University of California - Berkeley .
‘ I do n’t think it will be limited to just energy storage devices .
‘ This is potentially a very nice , low - cost flexible electrode for any electrical device .
Cui ’s research team includes postdoctoral scholars Liangbing Hu and JangWook Choi , and graduate student Yuan Yang .

Chromosomes have telomeres at the end of each strand
There is a clear link between living to 100 and inheriting a hyperactive version of an enzyme that prevents cells from ageing , researchers say .
Scientists from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the US say centenarian Ashkenazi Jews have this mutant gene .
They found that 86 very old people and their children had higher levels of telomerase which protects the DNA .
They say it may be possible to produce drugs that stimulate the enzyme .
There may be a downside to the plan of boosting the repair processes of DNA because giving the cells more chances to divide may increase the chances of damaging mutations developing and causing cancer .
Professor Tim Spector , King 's College Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the team say they studied the Ashkenazi Jewish community because they are closely related so it is easier to identify disease causing genetic differences .
They took blood samples from 86 very old , but generally healthy , people with an average age of 97 ; 175 of their offspring ; and 93 other people who were the offspring of parents who had lived a normal lifespan and could therefore make up a control group , with which the results could be compared .
Role of telomeres Telomeres are relatively short sections of specialized DNA that sit at the ends of all our chromosomes .
They have been compared to the plastic tips at the ends of shoelaces that prevent the laces from unravelling .
Each time a cell divides , its telomeres shorten and the cell becomes more susceptible to dying .
The importance of telomeres was recognised last month when three scientists received the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for determining the structure of telomeres and discovering how they protect chromosomes from degrading .
Telomerase can repair the telomeres , preventing them from shrinking .
' Strongly heritable '
The team at Einstein found that the centenarians and their offspring had higher levels of telomerase and significantly longer telomeres than the unrelated people in the control group and that the trait was strongly heritable .
The scientists had previously shown that individuals in Ashkenazi families with exceptional longevity have generally been spared major age - related diseases , like heart disease and diabetes .
The centenarians in this study had a lower average body mass index than the controls and higher levels of good ( HDL ) cholesterol .
Yousin Suh , associate professor of medicine and genetics at Einstein and a lead author on the paper , said : " Our findings suggest that telomere length and variants of telomerase genes combine to help people live very long lives , perhaps by protecting them from the diseases of old age .
" We 're now trying to understand the mechanism by which these genetic variants of telomerase maintain telomere length in centenarians .
" It may be possible to develop drugs that mimic the telomerase that our centenarians have been blessed with . "
' Downside ' Professor Tim Spector , from King 's College London , who has been researching telomeres and ageing , said it was an interesting finding but it may not apply to other populations and further research was needed .
He said : " There may be a downside to the plan of boosting the repair processes of DNA because giving the cells more chances to divide may increase the chances of damaging mutations developing and causing cancer .
" Most scientists agree that there is evidence that people with long telomeres have less age - related diseases and this study does suggest that could be one reason why they are living longer . "

Cameron ’s ten pledges : the pretense is over , Thatcherism is back !
02 Oct 2009 , by Adam Lent Guest in Economics , Labour market , Politics , Society & Welfare
David Cameron has made ten pledges to the British people today ( in The Sun , of course ) .
Here are some notable points :
1 . None of the pledges include anything on dealing with the current unemployment crisis .
In the wider interview with The Sun , he does talk passionately of the need to introduce bold measures to deal with the scourge of unemployment but I guess he was n’t quite passionate enough to make reducing it one of his “ key pledges ” .
Nicola has noted already how little the Tories have had to say on dealing with unemployment .
2 . In fact , the boldest thing Cameron does say on jobs is a restatement of his plans to cut the public deficit .
As we have pointed out in detail on this site , a rush to cut spending would only create more unemployment .
He also pledges to freeze council tax for two years – another measure which would risk accelerating the already rising number of job losses in local government .
3 . Alongside this , Cameron makes commitments to cut taxes which benefit the wealthy just at the time when tax revenues are falling and he is planning spending cuts which could throw thousands of public servants and others onto the dole .
In The Sun he mentions cutting corporation tax , restates his commitment to cut inheritance tax and ( in another interview with The Spectator ) he pledges to reverse the 50 p tax rate that was introduced in the Budget .
4 . He says that a Tory Government would reassess everyone on Incapacity Benefit to see if they are fit for work and will expect all benefit claimants to either work or prepare for work .
I wonder where he got those ideas : maybe the fact that they are already Government policy is a clue .
5 . And despite the fact that he says the Conservative Party has changed and is now “ paying attention to the big issues of the future ” , there is not a single mention in his pledges of the environment .
This is all astonishing stuff .
If you needed to sum up these pledges , the following would n’t be an unfair precis : deep spending cuts , tax cuts for the rich , tough on long - term benefit claimants , not much to offer the newly unemployed .
Good to see that Cameron ’s progressive and compassionate conservatives have finally made that break with their Thatcherite past .
My quest for KASL is over and I finally found a reliable and relatively inexpensive way to get it .
A distributor that I saw mentioned on here called Dutch Valley Foods carries it , but it is very expensive after shipping to get a 50 # bag .
When I contacted them , they gave me the website that lists all the retail stores that buy from them .
I simply called the nearest one , which was a small amish bulk food store and they put it on their next order to dutch valley .
I just picked it up my 50 # bag from them today for $ 26.50 .
It 's a little pricey , but well worth it .
The website is http://www.discoverbulk.com if anyone cares to check it out .
Simply call up one of the stores that are listed and ask them if they can special order you a 50 # bag of KASL from Dutch Valley .
Now if only it were that easy for grande cheese ( which I still can't source ) .
According to this chart from Citi's Alan Heap today , gold traders are the most net - long they 've been this decade , as indicated by the yellow line below .
We 'll go out on a limb and bet that they are also the most net - long in decades even given the massive run up in gold over the last few years .
2010 is shaping up to be a potential classic year for gaming .
The first three months of the year are already jammed with what look like must - have games .
Mass Effect 2
I 've already drooled over – and played for an hour , impressions soon - and Bioshock 2 is looking similarly enticing .
But there is one other title due out in the first part of next year that looks equally tasty – Heavy Rain .
The PS3 exclusive is nearing completion and judging by what I saw a few months ago and by the latest previews this is looking very impressive indeed .
Developed by French studio Quantic Dream , Heavy Rain is a heavily narrative - driven title that should appeal to gamers who want a slower paced , deeper gaming experience .
That 's the theory anyway .
I played through Fahrenheit – the developer 's previous title – and found it enthralling and exasperating in equal measures .
The absorbingly atmospheric opening sequence in the diner sticks in the memory .
Sadly so does the repetitive and often random deaths later in the game .
Which way will Heavy Rain go ?
Judging by Eurogamer 's preview things are looking good .
Heavy Rain is n't a mature game because it has unhappy families and moody lighting , it 's a mature game because it anticipates an adult response from the player and is prepared to receive it .
But how does it actually play ?
It 's impossible to dismiss Heavy Rain as a sequence of " quick - time events " once you begin to play it ; the extraordinary visuals , intriguing activities and mature way the game interprets and anticipates your actions transcend the traditional relationship between , say , Lara Croft and the pendulum blade the X button is designed to propel her away from during the heat of an in - engine cut -scene .
The conclusion suggests Heavy Rain is must - see at the very least .
Heavy Rain is racing through virgin territory before you have even finished learning how to steer it , and whether or not it proves to be
a great success , it already stands apart .
What do you think then ?
Excited by Heavy Rain ?
Buying a PS3 just to play it ?
Or are there already just too many good games being released in the early part of 2010 ?

I 'm an atheist , and I love Christmas .
If you think that 's a contradiction , think again .
Do you remember as a child composing wish lists of things you genuinely valued , thought you deserved , and knew would bring you pleasure ?
Do you remember eagerly awaiting the arrival of Christmas morning and the new bike , book , or chemistry set you were hoping for ?
That childhood feeling captures the spirit of Christmas and explains why so many of us look forward to the season each year .
You may no longer anticipate Christmas morning with that same childhood excitement .
After all , even if you still make a wish list , could n't you just go out and buy the items yourself ?
Yet the pleasure of exchanging gifts as a token of friendship and love remains .
Particularly when you receive ( or purchase ) a gift that could come only from someone who knows you well — say , a shirt that broadens your style or a new wine that becomes one of your favorites — it serves as a material reminder of a spiritual bond .
More widely , through cards , telephone calls , parties , long - distance travel , and vacation , Christmas serves as a time to reconnect with cherished family and friends , to share important events of the past year , and to look forward to the next .
It 's a time to enjoy delectable chocolates , spiced eggnog , four - course meals , festive music , and party games .
Christmas is a spiritual holi­day whose leitmotif is personal , selfish plea­sure and joy .
The season 's commercialism , far from detracting from this celebration , as we 're often told , is integral to it .
" The best aspect of Christmas , " Ayn Rand once observed , is " that Christmas has been commercialized . "
The gift buying " stimulates an enormous outpouring of ingenuity in the creation of products devoted to a single purpose : to give men pleasure .
And the street decorations put up by departments stores and other institutions — the Christmas trees , the winking lights , the glittering colors — provide the city with a spectacular display , which only ' commercial greed ' could afford to give us .
One would have to be terribly depressed to resist the wonderful gaiety of that spectacle . "
Before Christians co-opted the holiday in the fourth century ( there is no reason to believe Jesus was born in December ) , it was a pagan celebration of the winter solstice , of the days beginning to grow longer .
The Northern European tradition of bringing evergreens indoors , for instance , was a reminder that life and production were soon to return to the now frozen earth .
This focus on earthly joy is the actual source of the emotion most commonly identified with Christmas : goodwill .
When you genuinely feel good about your own life and when you 're allowed to acknowledge and celebrate that joy , you come to wish the same happiness for others .
It is those who despise their own lives who lash out at and make life miserable for the rest of us .
The commercialism of Christmas reinforces our goodwill .
When you scour the malls in search of the perfect gift for a loved one and witness the cornucopia of goods and lights and decorations , you can't help but feel that your fellow human beings are not enemies to be feared or fools to be avoided but fellow travelers and potential allies in the quest for joy .
It 's no accident that America , the world 's most productive country , is also its most benevolent .
Christmas 's relation to goodwill leads many to believe the holiday is inseparable from Christianity , allegedly the religion of goodwill .
But the connection is tenuous .
A doctrine that tells you that you 're a sinner — that you must seek redemption but cannot earn it yourself and that Jesus , sinless , has endured an excruciating death to redeem you , who does n't deserve his sacrifice but who should accept it anyway — can hardly be characterized as expressing a benevolent view of man .
Christianity from the outset has been suspicious of human , earthly pleasure and joy .
At best , these are seen as unbecoming a sinner , who should be busy repenting and fretting over his fate in an imagined next life .
There once existed a war against Christmas — when religionists held sway in America .
The Puritans canceled Christmas ; in Boston from 1659 to 1681 , the fine for exhibiting Christmas merriment was 5 shillings .
Christmas as we know it , with its twinkling lights , flying reindeer , and dancing snowmen , is largely a creation of 19th - century America .
One of the most un -Christian periods in Western history , it was a time of worldly invention , industrialization , and profit .
Only such an era would think of a holiday dominated by commercialism and joy and sense the connection between the two .
Christmas in America is not a Christian holiday .
And besides , in a country that separates church from state , no national holiday can be regarded as the purview of a religion .
But any celebration can be corrupted .
It 's not uncommon today to hear people say Christmas is their most stressful period .
Pressed for time ( and this year probably for money , too ) , they feel there are just too many lights to put up , meals to cook , and gifts to buy .
Seeking something to blame , they blame the commercialism of the season .
But there is no commandment , " Thou shall buy a present for every­one you know . "
This is the religious mentality of duty rearing its ugly head again .
Do and buy only that which you can truly afford and enjoy ; there are myriad ways to celebrate with loved ones without spending a cent .
But whatever you do end up doing , do n't let the state of the economy rob you of the gaiety of the season .
Perhaps now more than ever , we all need to remind ourselves that reaching joy on this Earth is the meaning of life .
Merry Christmas !
Read why the true spirit of Christmas has been lost , by Rep. Henry E. Brown .
Check out our political cartoons .
Altair Maine said he was so little supervised in his first few years of teaching at North Hollywood High School that he could “ easily have shown a movie in class every day and earned tenure nonetheless . ”
Before second - grade teacher Kimberly Patterson received tenure and the ironclad job protections it provides , she said , “ my principal never set foot in my classroom while I was teaching . ”
And when Virgil Middle School teacher Roberto Gonzalez came up for tenure , he discovered there was no evaluation for him on file .
When he inquired about it , his school hastily faxed one to district headquarters .
“ I ’m pretty sure it was just made up on the spot , ” Gonzalez said .
There is nothing to suggest these teachers did n’t deserve tenure , but the district did little to ensure they were worthy .
A Times investigation found that the Los Angeles Unified School District routinely grants tenure to new teachers after cursory reviews -- and sometimes none at all .
Evaluating new teachers for tenure is one of a principal ’s most important responsibilities .
Once instructors have permanent status , they are almost never fired for performance reasons alone .
The two - year probation period , during which teachers can be fired at will , offers a singular opportunity to weed out poor performers .
It is a chance L.A. Unified all but squanders , according to interviews with more than 75 teachers and administrators , analyses of district data covering the last several years , and internal and independent studies .
Among the findings :
* Nearly all probationary teachers receive a passing grade on evaluations .
Fewer than 2 % are denied tenure .
* The reviews are so lacking in rigor as to be meaningless , many instructors say .
Before a teacher gets tenure , school administrators are required to conduct only a single , pre-announced classroom visit per year .
About half the observations last 30 minutes or less .
Principals are rarely held responsible for how they perform the reviews .
* The district ’s evaluation of teachers does not take into account whether students are learning .
Principals are not required to consider testing data , student work or grades .
L.A. Unified , like other districts in California , essentially ignores a state law that since the 1970s has required districts to weigh pupil progress in assessing teachers and administrators .
“ I ca n’t believe that , ” said Gary K. Hart , California ’s secretary of education under Gov. Gray Davis , when told of The Times ’ findings .
Tenure “ is not something that everyone off the street who wants to be a teacher should be granted . ”
“ The saddest part is that the most critical element of whether our children are successful is being ignored , ” said Julie Slayton , the district ’s former director of research and planning and now a USC professor of education .
“ It ’s ridiculous and should be changed . ”
On Thursday , Supt. Ramon C. Cortines announced that change was coming .
After hearing The Times ’ findings more than a week ago , the superintendent pledged to scrutinize probationary teachers more closely so poor instructors are ousted before they become tenured .
“ Too many ineffective teachers are falling into tenured positions -- the equivalent of jobs for life , ” he said .
An easy path to tenure is not unique to Los Angeles .
Schools across the country have failed to grade teachers , even their rookies , and rarely dismiss poor performers .
In response , the Obama administration has made teacher accountability a key requirement in the competition for $ 4.35 billion in education grants .
Some of the nation ’s major school districts , including in New York City and Washington , D.C. , have already made significant reforms , such as requiring multiple evaluations by expert teachers or objective evidence of student growth .
A task force in Los Angeles has only begun to consider such sweeping changes , which would go well beyond the pledge Cortines made Thursday .
“ It ’s a sign of how backward things are that the superintendent has to make this kind of clarion call , ” said Ted Mitchell , chairman of the task force .
“ There is a little Alice in Wonderland quality in some of this :
You mean you have n’t been doing that ? ”
Wide variations
Now is crunch time for principals .
In the fall months , they must evaluate the hundreds of second - year teachers who are up for tenure in the spring .
Most administrators and experts say it is difficult to judge teachers on their first year -- often a struggle for even the most gifted .
So October through December becomes the narrow window in which most principals must carry out one of their weightiest duties .
The quality of evaluations appears to vary dramatically in the district ’s nearly 1,000 schools .
Some principals say it ’s hard to find the time to get into classrooms .
Others , like Sonia Miller of Samuel Gompers Middle School in the Broadway - Manchester neighborhood west of Watts , make evaluations a priority .
“ I arrive at 7 in the morning and do n’t leave until 7 p.m. , ” Miller said .
Just after 9 a.m. on a recent Thursday , she slipped into the back row of an eighth - grade English class to observe Daniel Leake , a second - year teacher who bounded around the room , quizzing his 19 students about Edgar Allan Poe ’s “ The Raven . ”
“ You have the content of a strong lesson , ” Miller wrote in her notes .
“ However , it would be more effective to have a [ handout ] to help students organize their thoughts / ideas . ”
After 11 minutes , Miller left .
She saw room for improvement : Leake had n’t called on enough students , and he ’d answered most of his questions himself .
The room was clean , but its sky blue walls were nearly bare .
Still , Leake was doing better than in his first year , Miller said , when he struggled to control his class .
She said she would drop in several more times before doing a formal evaluation but thought Leake would merit tenure .
Evaluation is an especially heavy burden at Gompers , where Miller says 31 of 73 teachers are “ probes , ” as probationary teachers are known .
Choosing the right teachers will be essential to stabilizing a campus plagued by low test scores and staff turmoil , including seven principals in the six years before she arrived in 2008 , Miller said .
Probationary teachers are not distributed evenly throughout the district :
Most schools with the highest number of probationary teachers are in poor areas , an analysis of district data found .
“ You ’re putting new teachers who are struggling in with the kids with the highest needs , ” Miller said .
Last year , Miller said , she told three of 13 teachers up for tenure that they would n’t get it .
Other schools with lots of probationary teachers are less selective .
Consider five academically struggling elementary campuses in South Los Angeles : 118th Street , 116th Street , 75th Street , 66th Street and 24th Street schools .
In the last three years , 88 teachers at those schools have been up for tenure , district data show ; only one , at 24th Street last year , was let go by the school board .
District officials noted that other teachers may have known they were going to get a bad evaluation and quit before being fired .
At least 15 % of teachers leave voluntarily after their first year .
Vague , subjective
Teacher evaluations at L.A. Unified are known among staffers as “ drive - bys . ”
Not just quick and infrequent , they are also vague and subjective .
Both tenured and non-tenured teachers are rated on a four - page checklist with such criteria as “ provides an effective classroom environment . ”
The form has three options : meets standards , needs improvement or falls below standards .
There is limited room for an evaluator ’s comments , but they are often absent or sparing , teachers say .
The findings are required to be discussed with teachers in a conference but often are n’t .
District data show that probationary teachers pass evaluations at about the same rate as tenured instructors , despite new instructors ’ inexperience .
They are made permanent automatically unless tenure is vetoed by the principal and ultimately the school board -- something that happened an average of 35 times annually in the last four years .
Gonzalez , the Virgil Middle School teacher who this year won a prestigious Milken award for teaching science , said his new principal carries out rigorous evaluations .
But when he earned tenure in 2005 , he got nearly no feedback .
“ It ’s the culture , ” he said .
“ It did make me angry .
It still does . ”
Maine of North Hollywood , who now leads the school ’s science Olympiad team , could recall only one observation by an administrator in his first few years , “ and that was a couple of minutes . ”
“ Being quickly satisfied that no riot was in progress , he departed , ” Maine said in an e-mail .
Two teachers elsewhere told The Times that their evaluation forms were falsified to show an observer was present when he or she was not .
Both declined to be identified for fear of retribution .
The dearth of feedback has only worsened in recent years , as budget cuts have thinned the ranks of assistant principals , who are often responsible for evaluations .
Michelle Ereckson , a third - grade teacher at 24th Street and the school ’s union representative , said some administrators do n’t even show up for scheduled evaluations .
When evaluators do show up , Ereckson said , some teachers are well - prepared because they practiced the lesson with students the day before .
Evaluators do n’t seem to notice , she said , even when students know all the answers .
Ereckson said she had reported her concerns up the ladder , all the way to the local superintendent .
“ No one does anything about it , ” she said .
“ Nobody cares . ”
She thinks it ’s no accident that the school ’s state test scores fell last year .
“ If the principal does n’t know what ’s going on in the classroom , you ca n’t offer support to the people who need support , you ca n’t offer praise to the people who need praise , ” she said .
Michelle King , District 3 superintendent , said she investigated the matter , attending a meeting at the school in which the entire faculty aired concerns about evaluations and other issues .
“ The principal was able to demonstrate to me that she was following district policy , ” King said .
Glenn Parness , the union representative at Berendo Middle School in Pico - Union , cited other weaknesses in the system .
One probationary teacher at Berendo was chronically late , could n’t control the class and rarely planned lessons , he recalled .
But the teacher knew that a tenure review was coming up and “ shaped up for six months , ” Parness said .
After getting permanent status , the instructor backslid into old habits and is now “ pretty much the same ” as before , Parness said .
Forty - four percent of L.A. Unified principals said they do n’t always try to remove probationary teachers who they think do n’t belong in the profession , according to a 2008 survey conducted for the district by the New Teachers Project , a nonprofit .
Interviews by The Times suggest several explanations : Principals are afraid they ’ll get someone worse ; it ’s time - consuming to prepare and unpleasant to deliver a negative evaluation ; they learned not to be picky during teacher shortages that ended years ago ; or they simply can’t tell who deserves a permanent job and who does n’t .
Most important , L.A. Unified officials say , is a district culture that views struggling teachers almost as “ pupils ” who always have the capacity to improve .
Some officials also say principals have grown gun-shy from fierce battles with permanent teachers -- who are rarely fired and even then , can spend years on the payroll as their cases wind through a byzantine appeals process , as The Times reported in May .
By force of habit , some new teachers are treated with similar deference -- even in the face of alleged misconduct .
In 2000 , Matthew Kim was a probationary special education teacher at Grant High School in Valley Glen when an aide complained that he had made inappropriate comments and touched her breast during class , state documents show .
Several similar complaints followed from students and staff .
About the same time , Kim ’s principal sent Kim , who is severely disabled by cerebral palsy , a memo stating that the teacher had trouble communicating with students and that some students and aides refused to be in his class .
He got tenure anyway .
In 2002 , as complaints mounted , Kim was removed from the classroom , and a year after that , the school board voted to fire him .
Kim denied any impropriety .
Nearly a decade after complaints first emerged , L.A. Unified estimates it is out $ 2 million in salary and legal costs , and the case remains on appeal .
Spotty reform
In California , tenure arose in the 1920s as an effort to protect schoolteachers -- at the time mostly women -- from unfair terminations .
Back then , getting married , wearing a skirt with bare legs or failing to clean a classroom ’s lamps and chimneys were firing offenses .
Eventually , many California politicians and education officials came to believe that the protections provided made it nearly impossible to fire poor performers .
But their reforms have had limited success .
In 1971 , Assemblyman John Stull , a Republican from San Diego , wrote a law requiring districts to evaluate teachers and administrators based on pupil progress , instructional technique and the classroom environment .
Many districts across the state have apparently ignored the first criterion .
No one monitors enforcement of that law “ at the state level or otherwise , ” said Hilary McLean , spokeswoman for state Supt. of Public Instruction Jack O’Connell .
A 1983 law stripped probationary teachers of employment protections , so they could be dismissed without cause .
In exchange , teachers unions persuaded legislators to reduce the probationary period from three years to two .
Most states require three , while some mandate as many as five .
In 1999 , Gov. Gray Davis offered struggling teachers more training , creating a path to remove them if they did not improve .
That program has essentially failed , according to former state education secretary Hart , who was its architect .
It has suffered from chronic budget cuts and inconsistent use , he said .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger took his own stab at the issue in 2005 with Proposition 74 , which would have extended the probationary period to five years and curbed some protections for permanent teachers .
It was soundly defeated after the California Teachers Assn. and others spent nearly $ 17 million to oppose it .
These days , some critics of tenure say it is an outmoded concept , more appropriate to a university setting where it is earned over years , granted more sparingly and serves to protect academic freedom .
Teachers unions counter that it is key to protecting instructors from incompetent or vindictive administrators , some of whom have never taught .
Others say the law is not the problem :
Officials should just make evaluations a bigger priority and give principals the training and support to carry them out .
“ If we changed the law but did n’t change the management at schools , we would n’t be much better off , ” said John Mockler , former executive director of the state Board of Education .
Ironically , many bad teachers are hard to fire because they can point to years of positive evaluations by principals who did not do their jobs , Mockler said .
A tougher stance
Even without changes in Sacramento , schools around the district have found ways to set a higher bar for new teachers .
Gompers , the Broadway - Manchester middle school , is controlled by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa ’s Partnership for Los Angeles Schools , which requires principals to spend three hours a day in classrooms .
Miller said she observes teachers routinely to provide useful feedback , not just an up or down vote on tenure .
As for those who still are n’t making the grade , she said she wants them out before it ’s too late .
Miller took a visitor to the classroom of a tenured veteran who was not in school that day .
Students were out of their seats and chatting while a substitute stood by helplessly .
The teacher “ never comes to work , leaves no lesson plan for the sub , and has a file as thick as everything , ” Miller said , her eyes welling .
“ Students are falling behind .
. . .
Colleagues are upset .
They come to me and say , ‘ Why are n’t you doing anything ? ’ ”
Miller said she has been documenting the teacher ’s failings almost every day for more than a year .
“ I ’m told it will take another year of writing to get [ the teacher ] out , ” she said .
By that , she means out of her school .
Instead of being fired , she said , the tenured instructor will almost certainly land on another L.A. Unified campus .

Doug Smith , The Times ’ director of database reporting , contributed to this report .
Arianna Huffington and Rob Johnson are organizing a big bank boycott .
They want depositors to take their money out of Too - Big - To - Fail banks and put them in smaller , high quality banks .
They ’ve launched a new website and have teamed up with Chris Whalen to give folks other options .
Whalen ’s firm , Institutional Risk Analytics , has a proprietary system that grades banks using FDIC data .
Enter your zip code and Whalen provides a list of high quality banks in your area .
It ’s a potentially powerful combination .
Huffington has wide reach due to her media ubiquity and popular website .
Johnson , once a portfolio manager for George Soros ’s Quantum Fund , is a successful veteran of high finance who ’s spoken out against the danger of derivatives and will head Soros ’ $ 50 million Institute for New Economic Thinking .
Leveraging Whalen ’s data means the two can do more than simply ask folks to move their money .
They can provide better options .
( You can read more about it in this column published at HuffPo . )
I applaud the effort and plan on taking them up on it .
Some of my savings currently reside at a TBTF bank , earning nothing , and I plan to move the account shortly .
When bloggers like me talk about creditors holding banks responsible for the risk they take , that includes bank depositors .
If you have deposits in a bank — a CD , checking or savings account , for example — you are a creditor of your bank .
Moving your deposits out of banks that benefit from too - big - to - fail guarantees is a tangible way you can protest bailouts .
I do have one small quibble with the Huffington / Johnson site , in particular the YouTube video they ’ve produced .
The idea that fat cat bankers — “ Potter ” from It ’s a Wonderful Life stands in — are solely responsible for the crisis oversimplifies the issue .
Plenty of smaller banks have gotten themselves into trouble with irresponsible lending .
FDIC ’s problem bank list now stands at 552 , composed mainly of smaller banks .
That ’s 7 % of all FDIC insured institutions in case you ’re wondering .
It also lets the rest of us off the hook .
Without willing investors and an assist from Alan Greenspan ’s low rates , big banks could n’t have inflated the bubble .
Yeah , many should have known better .
But let ’s face it , Wall Street bankers are n’t the only ones that are greedy .
I also worry that big banker baiting could lead to violence if / when the financial sh*t again hits the fan .
But again , that ’s a small quibble .
Huffington / Johnson / Whalen — all great folks I ’ve had the chance to speak with in the past — are spot on with this effort .
What truly separates community bankers from the big boys is that they can fail .
If they mess up , they end up in FDIC receivership .
If they lose , they pay for their own mistakes .
That ’s why this effort should hold particular appeal to financial conservatives .
If it were n’t for the moral hazard created by deposit insurance , depositors would flock to banks that lend conservatively .
In the meantime , the best thing we can do is take our money out of quasi-public banks like Chase , Citi , Wells , BofA , Ally , et al and move them to banks that operate free of government support .

The tale of Tufts ' official mascot , Jumbo the elephant , dates back to 1885 .
Circus showman P.T. Barnum was an early trustee and benefactor of Tufts and he donated the stuffed hide of Jumbo to the university .
For 86 years , Jumbo stood in Barnum Hall and was a veritable mecca on campus .
Students , parents and other campus visitors would pop pennies in his trunk or give a tug on his tail to bring luck for an upcoming exam or athletic competition .
Jumbo mania came to a fiery end on April 14 , 1975 when Barnum Hall and the beloved elephant were consumed in an electrical fire .
Jumbo's spirit lives on .
Some of his ashes were recovered in a peanut butter jar that has remained in the athletics director ’s office where students continue to rub it for good luck .
Watch this video for more about the life and time of Tufts ’ beloved mascot , Jumbo .
That 's nice .
That 's certainly better than what I 've seen before at an Apple Store .
Now this really happened to my friend and I was right next to him .

" My iPod does n't work "
" Hmmmm .
( looks it over , tries starting it ) I do n't know .

That 's probably killed it .
The dent can damage the iPod .
You 'll have to get a new one .
Did you also leave it in your car ? "
" Yeah . "
" Yeah .
That probably broke it .
I can't do anything . "
" Is there a way to repair it ? "

Olympics chief John Coates has slammed the Crawford report as " disrespectful " and " insulting " to Australia 's Olympic achievements and to gold medal heroes in lower - profile sports such as diver Matthew Mitcham , kayaker Ken Wallace and pole vaulter Steve Hooker .
The Crawford report dismissed the Australian Olympic Committee 's calls for an extra $ 100 million a year for 10 years for elite sports , saying that money would be better spent elsewhere .
It also took issue with the AOC 's quest to reclaim " top five " status on the medal table at the 2012 London Olympics and future Games , saying that target was not sensible and not an appropriate measure of Australian performance .

The Western Australian Government 's stop and search legislation will not pass through parliament this year .
The bill would give police the power to search people for weapons in entertainment precincts without proving grounds for suspicion .
The Police Minister Rob Johnson says he is referring the legislation to an upper house committee for review .
Mr Johnson admits pressure from his Liberal colleagues persuaded him to consider a last - minute compromise on his stop and search legislation .
" I 'm not too upset that it 'll take an extra couple of months or so to get this legislation into law , " he said .
Mr Johnson says it had become clear Labor would filibuster during debate and conceded some of his colleagues had raised concerns about the lack of parliamentary scrutiny of the legislation .
The Minister says he will consider any amendments suggested by the committee .
Today is the last scheduled parliamentary sitting day of the year .
' Embarrassing setback '
The State Opposition says the government 's admission that its stop and search legislation will not pass parliament this year is an embarrassing setback for Mr Johnson .
Labor 's Leader in the Upper House Sue Ellery says the minister has buckled to criticism of the laws from the public and his own backbenchers .
" Rob Johnson is a joke and Rob Johnson has demonstrated that yet again and tried to cover his own tracks by blaming the Labor Party for delaying a debate the government has n't even started , " she said .
Stephen Toulouse is the Director of Policy and Enforcement of Xbox Live .
When gamers need to be banned , his job is to find them and cut off Xbox Live access to their machines .
The latest group to get his attention ?
Gamers using an exploit in Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 to increase their kill counts .
First it was piracy leading to mass bannings , and now Microsoft is tasked with keeping the Modern Warfare 2 servers clean while Infinity Ward works on a patch .
We 're going to explore what gamers are doing , and why this is a somewhat unsettling precedent for consoles .
What 's going on ?
The issue in question is called the Javelin Exploit , and it allows players to detonate a grenade instantly upon death .
Here 's a video detailing the glitch , if you 'd like to know exactly what 's happening on the servers and what it looks like .
" While IW works on getting the MW2 glitch fixed , people we catch using it will recieve suspensions from LIVE .
Play fair everyone , " Toulouse said via Twitter .
He also noted that this policy is n't anything new , and that it 's in place for more games than just Modern Warfare 2 .
If you get caught taking advantage of the exploit , you 'll be banned for 24 hours .
If you 're a particularly bad case , the banning could last up to two weeks .
The ban is n't for Modern Warfare 2 , it 's for the entirety of Xbox Live .
If you 're banned , no new content for you .
No playing online ... in anything .
Major Nelson posted the details on his blog : " Keep in mind , this is n't just a ban on a particular game .
This is a ban on the Xbox Live service as a whole , so you wo n't be able to go online at all during your ban .
Initially , you may be banned for a day , a week , or depending on severity , permanently !
Kiss that $ 50 goodbye , " he wrote .
The troubling aspect about the case of Modern Warfare 2 is that no one is changing the code in the game and no rules are being broken .
They 're simply taking advantage of the behavior of two particular weapons when used in a certain way .
From Microsoft 's side of things , that 's cutting the hair too fine : if you find a glitch and use it in the game , that 's cheating .
Toulouse responded to criticism with a slightly tortured metaphor .
" Wow , some of you think cheating a glitch is OK .
Um .
If I install my car stereo wrong and it disables my door locks , its not ok to STEAL MY CAR , " he posted .
Somehow I doubt cops are out there comparing car theft to grenade kills to Modern Warfare 2 , but we 'll let it slide .
Using a glitch or a bug to gain advantage is against the Terms of Service , and defining glitches , bugs , and that advantage is solely up to Microsoft .
You 're playing on their playground
In many ways , the Xbox 360 is Xbox Live .
It 's nearly impossible to separate the hardware from the service .
Without Xbox Live there are no game patches , you can't grab demos of upcoming games , you can't play online .
Banned consoles have begun to show up on sites like eBay and Craigslist , and there is a risk of unexpectedly picking one up when you buy used from retailers like GameStop .
One pirate I spoke to told me he simply kept two systems : one for Xbox Live , and one for downloaded games .
I told him that 's an expensive set up , and he shrugged .
It 's cheaper than buying new games , he replied .
When a system is banned , the hardware itself carries the stigma ; you can't buy a new subscription , you can't swap out the hard drive .
For most users , the system is basically dead .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation wrote about these bans , noting the power that Microsoft holds over gamers .
If you break the Terms of Service , Microsoft can render your hardware unable to use its online service , which it has made nearly necessary for playing Xbox 360 games and taking advantage of the system 's features .
Bannings are the sole discretion of Microsoft , and there is n't much you can do about it once it has happened to you , short of buying a new piece of hardware .
" Of course , these ' absolute power to terminate ' clauses are in no way unique to the Xbox Live TOS .
While the mass ban provides a useful illustration of their danger , these terms can be found in nearly all TOS agreement for all kinds of services , " EFF Adjunct Attorney Ed Bayley wrote .
" There have been virtually no legal challenges to these kinds of arbitrary termination clauses , but we imagine this will be a growth area for lawyers . "
Where does this leave us ?
Sony stated that it wo n't be banning anyone over cheating in Modern Warfare 2 , but with Infinity Ward controlling all the servers for the game on the PC side of things , bans have been handed down for cheating there , as well .
With dedicated servers there was no way for a company to stop you from playing the game , but the closed nature of IWNet means the developer and publisher control your ability to play the game online .
No one is going to defend cheating , but glitches , exploits , and bugs have long found their way into strategy and helped to move gaming forward .
Would rocket jumpers have been banned from Xbox Live ?
If Valve shut down dedicated servers and sought to control every aspect of their games , would there have been Counter Strike ?
The control Microsoft exerts over Xbox Live , and its ability to block your access to online play remotely , and without appeal , means that you 'll be playing the games how they want .
In the meantime , Toulouse has some advice in his Twitter profile : " Be pure .
Be vigilant .
Behave ! "

News
Climatologists remain sanguine over incident .
As the blogosphere continues to buzz with discussion about e-mails leaked from the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) in Norwich , UK , climatologists are insisting that the controversy will not discredit their science , or hamper a global climate deal .
CRU confirmed on 20 November that more than 1,000 e-mails and documents had been copied from its servers and distributed on the Internet ( see Nature 462 , 397 ; 2009 ) .
Since then , climate sceptics have seized on the material , citing the contents of selected e-mails as evidence that the case for anthropogenic global warming has been over - stated , and US Senator James Inhofe ( Republican , Oklahoma ) has promised an investigation into the affair .
Yet climate experts say the broader impact of the leak will be minimal .
" Any suggestions that these e-mails will affect public and policy - makers ' understanding of climate science give far too much credence to blog chatter and boastful spin , " says Peter Frumhoff , director of science and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
Some , however , are pointing out that certain e-mails highlight a tendency for scientists to respond to critics either by retreating into an ivory tower , or by attempting to quiet dissenting voices .
In an open letter posted on http://climateaudit.org, Judith Curry , a climatologist at Georgia Institute of Technology , Atlanta , wrote last week : " Scientists need to consider carefully skeptical arguments and either rebut them or learn from them .
Trying to suppress them or discredit the skeptical researcher or blogger is not an ethical strategy and one that will backfire in the long run . "
The UEA has launched an independent inquiry into both the security breach and whether CRU has dealt appropriately with the deluge of requests for raw climate data it has received under the UK Freedom of Information Act ( see Nature 460 , 787 ; 2009 ) .
It has also pointed out that more than 95 % of the raw data used in CRU climate models has been publicly available for several years .
What the climate experts say
Thomas Stocker , University of Berne
" Science and science institutions should be transparent , but they are not a 24 - hour help service for climate sceptics who lack fundamental scientific and technical skills . "
Svend Soeyland , of environment group Bellona Foundation , Washington DC
" Only openness will make the buzz go away .
If only the vaguest impression lingers on that studies have been cooked up or that facts have been hidden it will feed conspiracy theories for ages . "
Eric Rignot , University of California , Irvine
" Given the overwhelming scientific evidence for climate change , we should deal less and less with climate sceptics .
Otherwise we should also deal with folks who think Elvis Presley is still alive , that Earth is less than 6,000 years old and that we cannot possibly have descended from monkeys . "
Guy Brasseur , National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado
" It is important that scientists make their studies completely transparent , but the least ethical way to accuse others is to highlight a sentence and ignore the context in which this sentence has been written . "
Mike Hulme , University of East Anglia , UK
" It is possible that climate science has become too partisan , too centralized .
The tribalism that some of the leaked e-mails display is something more usually associated with social organization within pre-modern cultures ; it is not attractive when we find it at work inside science . "
Rajendra Pachauri , chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
" I doubt that negotiations in Copenhagen will be influenced by this unfortunate incident . "

UPDATE : Phil Jones , the director of the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) at the University of East Anglia , stepped aside from his post on 1 December .
In a statement he said : " What is most important is that CRU continues its world - leading research with as little interruption and diversion as possible .
After a good deal of consideration I have decided that the best way to achieve this is by stepping aside from the director 's role " while the university conducts an independent review of data security and its responses to Freedom of Information requests .
The septuagenarian walking slowly through the Novello theatre in London looks like an archetypal American tourist .
Tall and wide , he wears a puffy gilet that makes him seem even bulkier , while a faded baseball cap shades his face .
Yet this ordinary - looking man is one of America 's pre-eminent actors : James Earl Jones .
Over the last 50 years , he has won two Tony awards ( playing a boxer in The Great White Hope , and for his role in August Wilson 's Fences ) , an Oscar nomination ( for the film of The Great White Hope ) , as well as multiple Emmy nominations and awards for his TV work .
You would n't know any of this to look at him , because what Jones is most famous for is his voice .
Deep , rumbling , august : it 's the sound Moses might have heard when addressed by God .
No wonder George Lucas chose Jones for the fearful voice of Darth Vader in Star Wars .
Jones , who is about to star in Tennessee Williams 's Cat On a Hot Tin Roof , likes to be anonymous .
He thinks of himself as a " journeyman actor " , quietly muddling along .
" Denzel Washington , Sidney Poitier , Robert Redford , Tom Cruise : those guys have well - planned careers .
I 'm just on a journey .
Wherever I run across a job , I say , ' OK , I 'll do that . ' "
He 's not too grand to do adverts , either .
" I love doing commercials !
Usually , they have enough money that they can take time and photograph it well .
I 'd like to film a British commercial ; they 're better than American ones . "
His stay in London is long enough – Cat is booked until April 2010 – that he may just get the chance .
The production transfers from Broadway , where its four - month run was hugely successful with audiences , despite reviews that found it sentimental ( the New York Times ) and lacking in soul ( the New Yorker ) .
There have been some key cast changes : Brick Pollitt , the alcoholic around whom the play revolves , is played here by Adrian Lester , who has n't been seen on a London stage since his electrifying performance as Henry V at the National in 2003 .
Jones plays Brick 's father , Big Daddy , and while he's aware that the casting switch is having a subtle effect on his performance , he says one thing remains constant : " Big Daddy loves this other human being .
It 's not like the way I love my own son . . . "
He glances warmly at Flynn , his 26 - year - old son and assistant .
" But I can experience the stage relationship because I have a real son , and that relationship has gone through all kinds of changes and conflicts , but is always enriching . "
For Jones , it 's the family relationships in Williams 's play that count : the fact that this production features a black family , rather than the usual white family , is immaterial .
A change of date has been necessary , because when Cat was written , in the 1950s , black people living in the south did n't have the freedom to be as prosperous as the Pollitt family .
But apart from that , says Jones , " We 're not doing anything to this play that a white family , or a Chinese family , would n't do . "
To argue that Big Daddy is written as a " redneck " , a rough and generally rural white southerner , is spurious , as far as Jones is concerned .
" I am a redneck , too .
I am a Mississippi farm person .
I can be foul - mouthed , I can be inarticulate .
It 's just that my neck does n't get red .
I 've always felt that I understood Big Daddy more than the average northern - American Caucasian actor . "
The New Yorker agreed , relishing the way Jones relaxed into Williams 's poetic language .
Born in 1931 , Jones spent his first five years in rural Mississippi , living with his maternal grandparents while his mother looked for work ( his father , Robert Earl Jones , left before he was born ) .
It was a big household , with 13 people , and for a while it was thought that Jones might live with his paternal grandmother in Memphis " to ease the burden " .
But when he was driven to her house , he clung to the car .
" It was the only way I could express that I wanted to be with them .
They accepted that . "
Soon after , Jones moved with the family to Michigan ; the turmoil was so traumatic he developed a stutter that lasted into his teens .
It was his struggle to overcome the stutter that led Jones into acting in the early 1950s .
It made him appreciate the value of the spoken word .
There were other factors , too : he had just left the army and was n't sure what to do , while his father , whom he had recently met for the first time , was already acting , having given up boxing .
Jones moved to New York to study drama , and lived with his father for a time – not , he says , to reclaim him as a parent , but because he was trying to save on rent .
" It was too late to get to know him as a father : if you do n't learn that from the beginning , there 's no way to catch up .
It took us a time to accept that if we could be friends , that would be best .
He told me , ' I can't make a living doing this , so if you want to enter this world , do it because you love it . '
That was good advice . "
After a few years , Jones considered giving up acting , but two things encouraged him .
The first was his father 's response to one of his performances , in Of Mice and Men .
" He said , ' You can act . '
He did n't say , ' You were great ' , or ' You 've got potential . '
Just , ' You can act . '
Father to son , that 's all I needed to hear . "
The second was winning the lead role in The Great White Hope in 1968 .
" I thought , ' I can raise a family on this kind of work . '
That was the key thing : anyone can bum through as a bachelor , but to raise a family you 've got to make sure you can draw a paycheck . "
Jones 's apprenticeship coincided with a period of experimental and political ferment in New York theatre .
For Jones , it was the " age of everyman " , when people such as Marlon Brando became stars .
" You did n't have to be upper class to be a giant of the theatre . "
In the 1960s , casting black actors in Shakespeare was radical , yet some of Jones 's earliest performances were in the New York Shakespeare festival .
The play that got Jones noticed , in 1961 , was Jean Genet 's piece The Blacks , in which black actors perform in white - face to subvert colonial racism .
That led to a number of roles exploring African - American life , from The Great White Hope , inspired by black boxer Jack Johnson , to a play about Paul Robeson in 1977 ; and , more recently , his portrayal in 2006 of Thurgood Marshall , the first black justice of the US Supreme Court .
Although he has been integral to the development of black theatre in America , Jones is resistant to such categorisation .
" There have n't been enough profound things written about what being black means , and what a black character is .
Nobody knows . "
He has great respect for August Wilson and his examinations of African - American 20th - century experience , but feels troubled that " to cook up his creativity , August piled blackness around himself .
He 's half - white , and I never understood why he had to dismiss that aspect of himself . "
Jones , who has Irish , Native American and African in his makeup , turns questions of ethnicity on their head .
" When you wake up in the morning , before you look in the mirror , do you see an ethnicity ?
I do n't – and if I did , I 'd be in trouble , because that has blinded me to who I might really be .
Even waking up seeing myself as a male blinds me to who I might really be . "
New knees and a farm upstate
He likes theatre to be confrontational : " I do n't think we exist as actors just to make people feel good .
Tennessee Williams believed in that : he wanted to get under the skin . "
Off stage , however , he shuns political engagement , and is wary of expressing political views .
Mentioning his admiration for the way Barack Obama is " giving Afghanistan the consideration it needs " , he immediately apologises for bringing the subject up .
Partly , he feels hampered by his speech impairment : " I 'm still a stutterer .
It affects how articulate I can be in every form of communicating . "
He occasionally searches for words , and questions whether he has chosen the right one , but otherwise you would n't notice .
Yet there is another factor : Jones 's father was blacklisted during the McCarthy era by the House Un- American Activities Committee , and felt " he had wasted a lot of energy in the left , because it was badly managed " .
Jones did n't want to make the same mistake , avoiding Malcolm X's civil rights campaign as he suspected it was n't well planned .
Despite a long career spent moving between Broadway and Los Angeles , Jones remains humble .
Home is a farm in upstate New York , where he lives with his second wife Cecilia Hart , and Flynn , their only child .
He has built the place up , adding barns and cabins whenever he had the cash ; money might have been less of an issue had his voice work on Darth Vader earned a percentage of the profits , rather than one - off payments .
It 's no longer money but his enjoyment of " having a steady job " that keeps him working .
At 78 , there are certain health issues : " I have new knees .
My hearing is going , but I can still see fairly well . "
For now , he is happy to play any old person role that comes along – even if that mostly means playing people who , like Big Daddy , are facing death .
He does have one complaint , though : " Why are people embarrassed about elderly sex ?
I hate it when I 'm given a script in which the guy 's wife is dead .
That 's just an easy way to dispense with having sex .
Audiences do n't want to see Big Daddy and Big Mama in bed – but I like to talk about it . "

CLEVELAND 
This winter , Katie Spotz plans to cross the Atlantic Ocean without a sail or a motor .
Through 50 - foot waves and hurricane - force winds , the only thing propelling her tiny yellow boat will be Spotz ’s arms pulling against two black oars .
In the small but growing sport of ocean rowing , even the smallest sail is considered cheating .
So Spotz , 22 , will row at least 2,500 miles without even a tarp to protect herself from the sun , lest she be tempted to use it to catch the wind .
“ I never thought I could do something like this , ” said Spotz , whose attempt will raise money for Blue Planet Run , a foundation that finances clean drinking water projects around the world .
“ But it ’s not like a rowing machine in a gym , ” she said .
“ You just pace yourself . ”
The journey from Dakar , Senegal , on Africa ’s west coast , to South America is expected to take between 70 and 100 days .
If Spotz succeeds , she will become the youngest person to cross an ocean in a rowboat , and the first American to row solo from mainland to mainland .

INCOME FALLS IN 2008 INCOME FALLS IN 2008 Year Median income Dollar change 2000 $ 52,500 - 87 2001 $ 51,356 - 1,144 2002 $ 50,756 -600 2003 $ 50,711
- 45 2004 $ 50,535
- 176 2005 $ 51,093
558 2006 $ 51,473
380 2007 $ 52,163
690 2008 $ 50,303 - 1,860 Source : Census Bureau WASHINGTON  Americans ' household income last year took the sharpest drop since the government began keeping records in 1947 , the Census Bureau reported Thursday .
Median household income sank 3.6 % to $ 50,303 , after adjusting for inflation , during the first full year of the recession .
INTERACTIVE MAP : Changes in household income UNINSURED : Gov't programs helped keep tally down Income tumbled to its lowest dollar level since 1997 — a decade 's worth of gains wiped out in one year — and things will get worse before they get better , says Sheldon Danziger of the Population Studies Center at the University of Michigan .
" 2009 is going to be dreadful , " he says .
He predicts income will drop at least 5 % this year because of rising unemployment in the recession 's second year .
The Census Bureau 's annual report on income and poverty is one of the most important benchmarks of the U.S. economy .
The income and poverty data reflect the sweeping effects of the recession , which began in December 2007 and has erased 6.9 million jobs .
The report covers a wide range of pre-tax income , such as wages , Social Security payments and dividends .
It does n't count the value of non-cash benefits , such as food stamps or employee health insurance .
The cause of the income decline is clear .
" The economy was slow .
People lost work .
Incomes fell , " says Robert Rector , a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation .
Other key findings for 2008 : • Poverty rate jumps .
The share of people living in poverty rose to 13.2 % in 2008 from 12.5 % in 2007 .
That 's the highest poverty rate since 1997 .
• Health coverage holds steady .
The portion of people in the USA without health insurance was almost unchanged at 15.4 % . • Men and women , still different .
Women earned 77 % of what men made in 2008 , unchanged from a year earlier .
• Seniors fare best .
Of the 25 groups tracked by the Census , only households led by people 65 and older enjoyed income gains — a 1.2 % increase .
Doing worst : the middle - aged .
Households headed by 45 - to 54 - year - olds suffered a 5.4 % drop .
" Social Security and Medicare make a big difference for the elderly , " says Minnesota state demographer Tom Gillaspy .
He says the income report does n't show the wealth lost by the elderly because of falling stock prices .

“ When someone comes in with a vague sense of unease , or a touch of the nerves , or even just more money than sense , you ’ll be there for them – bottle of basically just water in one hand , and a huge invoice in the other . ”
Mitchell & Webb
David Colquhoun published an excellent editorial this week in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) in which he looks back at the last 100 years of “ secret remedies . ”
He points out that a century ago the medical establishment and government regulators tried to protect the public from unscientific patent remedies , but those efforts were anemic , and eventually faded away .
Now we are in the midst of a resurgence of unscientific remedies , and those who should be protecting the public health are not even mounting a half - hearted defense .
David refers to an “ intrepid , ragged band of bloggers ” along with a few journalists who are the only ones pointing out the folly of abandoning the science - based standard of care in medicine .
He writes :
One hundred years on from the abortive efforts to crack down on patent remedies , we need to look again at the efficacy of remedies .
Indeed the effort is well under way , but this time it takes a different form .
The initiative has come largely from an “ intrepid , ragged band of bloggers ” and several journalists , helped by scientific societies .
It has n’t been helped by the silence of the BMA , the royal colleges , the Department of Health , and a few vice chancellors ..
Even the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ( MRHA ) could be helping more .
The response of the royal colleges to the resurgence in magic medicine that started in the 1970s looks to me like embarrassment .
They avoided the hard questions by setting up committees ( often populated with known sympathisers ) so as to avoid having to say “ baloney . ”
The Department of Health , equally embarrassed , refers the hard questions to the Prince of Wales ’ Foundation for Integrated Health .
It was asked to draft “ national occupational standards ” for make believe subjects like “ naturopathy ” ) .
David is writing from a British perspective , of course .
I could say the same , however , about the American Medical Association ( AMA ) and American medical schools .
State and federal governments have been terrible – allowing a few zealots and vested interests to slowly erode the standard of care and protections for the public in favor of quack - friendly laws .
Senators Harkin and Hatch have diverted medical research funds to chase unicorns ( via NCCAM ) .
They have also pushed through laws that cripple FDA regulation of certain health products , like supplements , and create massive loop - holes for the supplement industry to exploit the public .
He also points out the folly of recognizing , through licensure , health professions that are ultimately based on nonsense .
But you cannot start to think about a sensible form of regulation unless you first decide whether or not the thing you are trying to regulate is nonsense .
Unless a practice or profession is based upon transparent evidence , how can meaningful regulation take place ?
If proponents can simply make up their own standards based upon ideology and philosophy , without being held to any external standard , the regulation is a farce .
But there is a glimmer of hope that we may be finally getting through to some elements of the public and the government that science - based regulation is necessary , and the diversions and deceptions of the so - called alternative medicine industry may have begun to crumble .
Talking about a recent committee ’s review of the evidence for homeopathy , David writes :
The committee ’s proceedings are worth watching , if only to see the admirably honest admission by the professional standards director of Boots that they sell homoeopathic pills without knowing whether they work .
12
But for pure comedy gold , there is nothing to beat the final session .
The health minister Michael O’Brien was eventually cajoled into admitting that there was no good evidence that homoeopathy worked but defended the idea that the taxpayer should pay for it anyway .
Boots is a large British pharmacy chain .
The video is worth watching – finally a regulator asking the important questions – does homeopathy work ?
The answer , as David points out , is “ no ” but we do n’t care , we want to sell it anyway , and taxpayers should pay for it too .
Of course , the lame defenses came also .
Then at the end of the session Harper said , “ homeopathic practitioners would argue that the way randomised clinical trials are set up , they do not lend themselves necessarily to the evaluation and demonstration of efficacy of homeopathic remedies . ”
Right – homeopaths are experts at the kettle defense .
They claim there is evidence that homeopathy works , when there is n’t .
When someone is paying attention enough to push them on the details , the least delusional of them must admit there is no evidence , so they retreat to the argument that it is because science is rigged against them .
As David then points out , this excuse for lack of evidence is especially lame when it comes to homeopathy – which is typically given as pills .
Pill - based treatments are the easiest to control and blind with placebos .
David concludes :
“ Imagine going to an NHS hospital for treatment and being sent away with nothing but a bottle of water and some vague promises , ” wrote the Sun ’s health journalist Jane Symons recently .
“ And no , it ’s not a fruitcake fantasy .
This is homeopathy and the NHS currently spends around £ 10 m on it . ”
It is n’t often that a Murdoch tabloid produces a better account of a medical problem than anything the Department of Health ’s chief scientific advisor can muster .
It is a sad state of affairs when not only tabloids , but comedians , are doing a much better job of informing the public about the reality of homeopathy and other fantasy - based treatment than governments , medical organizations , and universities .
Mitchell and Webb capture the essence of homeopathic practice , and alternative medicine in general , better than the BMA , the AMA , and any government official I have ever heard .

Confronted by an impassioned rape survivor at a town hall Saturday night , Sen . David Vitter tried everything from sympathizing to deflecting blame onto the Obama administration for his decision to vote against an anti-rape amendment .
Finally , amid shouts from protesters , the Louisiana Republican simply walked away .
Vitter was one of 30 Republican senators who voted against Sen .
Al Franken ’s amendment , passed in the Senate last month , that would de-fund government contractors who prevent employees from seeking justice when they have been raped .
ADVERTISEMENT
The inspiration for the amendment was Jamie Leigh Jones , who was allegedly gang - raped by co-workers at Halliburton subsidiary KBR while on assignment in Baghdad , and was then prevented from pursuing the matter in courts .
At the town hall meeting Saturday , a woman identifying herself as a “ rape survivor ” confronted Vitter and asked him why he voted against the amendment .
“ I ’m a rape survivor , and it meant everything to me to put [ away ] the person who attacked me , ” she told Vitter .
Vitter responded , “ I ’m absolutely supportive of any case like that , that they are prosecuted criminally to the full extent of the law . ”
“ But there are rape victims that are being silenced , ” the unnamed woman responded .
“ How can you support a company that tells a rape victim that she does not have a right to defend herself ? ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Do you realize President Obama was against that amendment , and his administration was against that amendment ? ”
Vitter asked .
“ But I ’m not asking Obama , I ’m asking you , senator , ” the woman said .
At that point , Vitter walked briskly away from the woman and out of the town hall .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ What if it was your daughter that was raped , would you tell her to be quiet ? ” the woman shouted as Vitter walked away .
“ Would you tell your daughter to be silent ? ”
Vitter ’s assertion that the Obama administration opposed the amendment is only partly correct .
The Pentagon opposed the amendment because it argued it would be virtually impossible to enforce .
The White House stated that it supported “ the intent of the amendment , ” but wanted to see it re-worked “ to make sure it is enforceable . ”

Police say a pair of women accused of stealing two cars and fistfuls of narcotics led them on a Thelma - and - Louise - like chase through Oakville and Burlington Sunday morning before officers tackled them outside a coffee shop .
" I 'm not sure of the nature of ( their ) association , " said Det. Steve Metelsky .
" But obviously they worked together . "
The chain of events began at 10:30 a.m. in a Metro grocery store in Oakville , near Eighth Line and Upper Middle Rd. Witnesses at the store said Tylenol and OxyContin were stolen from the pharmacy before two women hopped into a stolen car from Caledon and fled .
From there , police say , the women tore through Oakville and headed to Burlington , covering 20 kilometres in 20 minutes – " a good stretch of geographic territory , " Metelsky said .
The women were next spotted at a Petro Canada in Burlington on Guelph Line , near New St. , where a woman was assaulted and had her Mazda snatched .
The Mazda driver was left with minor head injuries .
Another car was hit as the pair fled the gas station .
Witnesses watched the woman in the driver 's seat put the car into gear and the other woman lean over from the passenger 's seat to stomp on the gas pedal .
Police say the two took off back to Oakville .
Police chased the stolen Mazda along Highway 407 at speeds near 160 km /h .
The car left the highway and was abandoned at Ford Dr. and Royal Windsor Dr .
Police say the two women hopped out of the car and tried to run , but officers took them down near a Tim Hortons at the intersection .
A witness said one of the women had seizures after she was arrested .
" I can't give a professional opinion on what ( drug ) they were on , " Metelsky said .
" But their behaviour was impaired . "
Two women , whose names have not been released , have been charged with theft over $ 5,000 , possession of property obtained by crime , robbery , dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harm and fleeing police .
The investigation is continuing as police try to sort out all of the suspects ' stops to determine if any other crimes were committed .

Guest Commentary by Andrew Monaghan and Marco Tedesco
Our study published in mid October in Geophysical Research Letters ( Tedesco and Monaghan , 2009 ) documents record minimum snowmelt for Antarctica during austral summer 2008 - 2009 and lower - than - normal melt for several recent years , based on a 30 - year satellite microwave record .
Numerous blogs have cited the results as a challenge to previous studies reporting Antarctic warming , while also steadfastly ignoring other studies with similar results ( e.g. Barrett et al. , 2009 ) .
They have overlooked that these studies show that Antarctic warming has occurred mostly in winter and spring , whereas melting of course occurs in summer .
And they oversimplify the causality and hence confuse our prediction for the future .
We found that the same mechanism that has primarily caused low snowmelt in recent years will likely change in a manner that will enhance snowmelt in forthcoming decades .
A brief summary follows .
Map of Antarctica showing number of melting days in summer 2008 - 2009 .
Our study demonstrates that low melt years during the 1979 - 2009 satellite record are related to the strength of the westerly winds that encircle Antarctica , known as the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode ( SAM ) .
When the SAM is in a positive phase – meaning that the belt of winds is stronger than average – it has a cooling effect on Antarctic surface temperatures .
The SAM was especially strong in austral spring and summer 2008 - 2009 , and subsequently the 2008 - 2009 snowmelt was lower than normal .
During the past 30 - 40 years , the SAM has gradually strengthened during austral summer ( Marshall 2003 ) , due mainly to human - caused stratospheric ozone depletion .
In turn , the increasing SAM has weakened longer - term summer warming over Antarctica .
The SAM index is not strongly positive every year of course , and particularly when combined with other atmospheric circulation changes ( e.g. a strongly positive Southern Oscillation Index ( SOI ) – indicative of La Nina conditions ) may contribute to anomalously high or low summer temperatures in any given year .
The figures shown in our Supplementary Material section in our original paper illustrate this point nicely ( below ) :
Monthly averaged December - January surface temperature anomalies ( K ) for 1998 ( left , strong negative SAM and SOI ) and 1999 ( right , strong positive SAM and SOI ) .
The ozone hole is projected to recover significantly during the next 25 – 50 years due to the Montreal Protocol , which limits ozone - depleting substances used in industrial and household applications .
As the ozone hole ‘ heals ’ , the increasing summer SAM trends are projected to subside .
As this happens , it is likely that summer temperature increases over Antarctica will become stronger and more widespread because the warming effect from greenhouse gas increases will no longer be kept in check by the dynamic
cooling impact of the SAM .
Therefore , the linkage between the SAM and snowmelt leads to our key conclusion : that enhanced snowmelt is likely in Antarctica as the SAM trends subside during the 21st century and summer temperatures become warmer .
Our results agree with studies that have noted cooling and / or slower warming during the past three decades due to increasing SAM trends over the same period .
Additionally , our conclusions do not contradict findings showing strong regional warming on the Antarctic Peninsula and in West Antarctica for the past 50 years , and warming over the entire continent for the past century .
Our record is limited to the satellite era only , during which ozone depletion has dominated Antarctic summer temperature trends , and as already noted above , the observed warming in the last 50 - 100 years has occurred mostly in winter and spring .
This context is important .
HONG KONG ( Reuters ) -
It was fitting that Richard Duncan sequestered himself in Bangkok to write his latest book “ The Corruption of Capitalism , ” a post - mortem of the credit bubble that crippled the world ’s financial system .
Duncan learned first hand from working in Thailand for most of the 1990s in the run-up to the Asian financial crisis that rapid credit growth causes excess capacity and leads to busts .
Then governments have to finance rescue plans -- very similar to what is now taking place around the world .
After predicting in his 2003 book “ The Dollar Crisis ” that the U.S. property bubble would trigger a global recession , Duncan ’s new book argues that governments will have to keep stimulating their economies because U.S. demand for cheap goods will not return to the halcyon days of the 2003 to 2007 boom .
Talk of an exit from the easy money policies in 2010 is entirely premature since investors will most likely see more U.S. stimulus spending next year to prop up demand .
“ This current round of stimulus will begin to wear out and everything will start to weaken again , and that will require another round of stimulus , not just from the U.S. but from China as well , ” Duncan told Reuters .
“ If this stimulus is delayed or withdrawn , we will get significant drops in asset prices and go back into recession . ”
Duncan is part of a group of economists like Marc Faber , Nouriel Roubini and James Grant , who believe the financial crisis is a symptom of something structurally wrong with the United States economy that will not be solved by the end of recession .
The institution of capitalism has been so corrupted by binges of borrowing financed with money printed on demand that governments now indefinitely have to take the reins of economies , Duncan argues in his book .
“ We ca n’t describe this economic system as capitalism , I describe it as statism , ” he said .
THINK AGAIN ABOUT CHINA’S PROSPECTS
For many investors , emerging markets such as China are the wave of the future .
However , Duncan , a partner at Blackhorse Asset Management , a hedge fund in Singapore , said investors were too optimistic about China , which he said is certainly headed for bubble trouble .
He is doubtful the fiscal stimulus and new loan growth amounting to about 40 percent of gross domestic product will lead to structural change in the export - dependent economy .
“ That will just lead to more excess capacity with no one to sell it to , which means product prices will be extremely depressed , companies wo n’t profitable and banks wo n’t be repaid . ”
The real antidote to the cycle of credit - fueled bubble and bust , in Duncan ’s view , is for the U.S. government to spend an additional $ 3 trillion in the next 10 years to reindustrialize .
Stop making things that can be bought cheaply somewhere else and develop solar , biotechnology and nanotechnology products of the future .
That will over the very long term shrink the U.S. trade deficit and provide sustainable growth , Duncan said .
Among his more austere prescriptions , Duncan would fix exchange rates , apply credit controls and only allow money supply to grow in line with population growth .
He would also dissolve the Federal Reserve .
Duncan believes these radical steps are the only way to put the U.S. economy back on a path toward fiscal prudence and sound money , or what he calls economic orthodoxy .
“ They are radical , ” he said .
“ Radically orthodox . ”

Advertisement Wales could get its first court based on Islamic law under proposals from a Muslim body , BBC Wales has learned .
A Sharia law tribunal in Cardiff will help community relations and give some Muslims services they want , supporters have told the Dragon 's Eye programme .
But the Ministry of Justice said that Sharia law " has no jurisdiction in England and Wales " .
A spokesperson said : " Regardless of religious belief we are all equal before the law " .
What we are trying to do is help the third or fourth generation British Muslims who are growing up to give them the services necessary to make Britain their homeland , rather than saying we actually want to ghettoise ourselves
Shaykh Siddiqi , Muslim Arbitration Tribunal Some commentators , such as the think - tank Civitas , say a Muslim arbitration tribunal undermines the concept of one law for UK citizens .
A women 's group said it was not needed and women may not be treated fairly .
A tribunal has been proposed for the middle of next year , and its backers say it will bring the law and Muslim faith together .
There are already seven such tribunals in England when two parties facing marital , financial and other disputes come before experts in Islamic and UK law .
Both parties must agree to allow the tribunal to sit in judgement .
Shaykh Siddiqi , of the tribunal , said : " What we are trying to do is help the third or fourth generation British Muslims who are growing up to give them the services necessary to make Britain their homeland , rather than saying we actually want to ghettoise ourselves . "
Nothing in the law of England and Wales prevents people abiding by Sharia principles if they wish , provided their actions do not conflict with English and Welsh law
Ministry of Justice The Ministry of Justice said : " Communities have the option to use religious councils and to agree to abide by their decisions .
These decisions are subject to national law and cannot be enforced through the national courts , save in limited circumstances . "
" There may be incompatibilities between English and religious laws and the parties should always have the option to refer to the English or Welsh family courts should they wish to do .
" Any member of any community should know that they have the right to refer to an English or Welsh court at any point , particularly in the event that they feel pressured or coerced to resolve an issue in a way with which they feel uncomfortable .
' Shoved to one side ' " We are proud of our diverse society and are committed to ensuring cohesive communities .
Nothing in the law of England and Wales prevents people abiding by Sharia principles if they wish , provided their actions do not conflict with English and Welsh law . "
The ministry said these tribunals were not courts , but instead " a form of " alternative dispute resolution , " and communities had " the option to use religious councils and to agree to abide by their decisions " .
A recent report by Civitas was critical of Sharia courts , saying they were not in keeping with UK legal principles .
Denis MacEoin , of Civitas , said : " It is Sharia law that is given the prominent position and this effectively means that British law is shoved to one side .
" All citizens have the right to be judged under a single legal system , and that we did n't bring in the legal system by the back door and that is effectively what is happening at the moment . "
Some fear that Muslim women may become isolated from their communities if they do not choose the tribunal system .
Marya Shabir , of the Welsh Women 's National Coalition , said : " It 's being advertised as this opt - in system when it actually is n't .
" If a Muslim woman is given the option of using a Muslim Arbitration Tribunal over going through the courts system using the law of England and Wales ; there 's no question as to which system she 's going to use .
" If she does n't go with the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal , she is going to face stigmatisation , she will be ostracised by her community , her peers , her family who believe she is turning her back on the community . "
Dragon 's Eye is broadcast at 2235 GMT on Thursday on BBC One Wales .

Can the Coyotes keep their solid start going ?
And can the Rangers get out of a funk that 's seen them lose three in a row ?
First of two meetings this season between these teams .
The Rangers came away with a 4 - 1 victory against the Coyotes in their only matchup last season .
L.A. snapped the Coyotes ' four - game winning streak with a 5 - 3 victory Saturday .
Overall it 's been a surprisingly effective start to the season , but coach Dave Tippett was n't happy with his team 's performance against the Kings .
" We made some mental mistakes that come back to haunt you , " Tippett told the Arizona Republic .
" You can't give up four goals ( the fifth was an empty - netter ) .
Mental mistakes led to power - play goals against .
We just need everybody on board every night .
We had some guys that I did n't think pulled their weight tonight . "
It was rainbows and lollipops during the Rangers ' seven - game winning streak .
But coach John Tortorella has seen that all change in the past three games , all losses .
He even went as far as benching Brandon Dubinsky and Christopher Higgins for the third period and OT after a handful of crucial mistakes led to Montreal goals Saturday .
" The game 's going our way , and it 's a turnover in the neutral zone by Dubie that just can't happen , " Tortorella told the Daily News .
" We stressed that , especially after the last game .
It 's just a huge momentum swing .
Finally got around to watching a YouTube video someone sent me a while ago and I ’m stunned to find God ’s Checklist 2.0 by Scott ( aka TheoreticalBullshit ) underlines and italicises so much of my argument with religion , particularly Christianity .
God ’s Checklist 2.0
It ’s done in an entertaining , thoughful , and challenging way , but not in a manner that would insult a reasonable theistic viewer .
That ’s a difficult balance to manage .
I expect some people will react to the video negatively ( the video ’s comments section on YouTube is ad hominem central — not that YouTube comments have a habit of being sane or rational at the best of times ) , and others of a mind for apologetics will offer up modern reasons why these Bronze Age inconsistencies exist .
But the fact remains that Scott has done an excellent job in outlining the problem with the “ party line ” of many religions .
I ’m looking forward to checking out more of his stuff .
Today ’s Monday
Five is about one of my favourite styles of game play .
I ’m a really big fan of urban adventures , from the mean streets of CyberPunk to the cobbled together city of New Macross on board the SDF - 1 .
But since most of the games we play are Dungeons and Dragons , I ’m always on the lookout for good city supplements for the game ( or for similar games ) .
And whether you are pirates in Freeport , adventurers in Lankhmar , explorers among the Waterdhavians or whatever pseudo - medieval realm , a few good city maps with some basic descriptions will never go over badly when it ’s time for the group to escort a caravan to new lands .
Over the years I ’ve collected quite the shelf of city books and urban adventure supplements .
And from them here are my top 5 “ must own ” books for the urban gamer .
Lankhmar ( AD & D1e )
Published by TSR in 1985 , the original Lankhmar book is an excellent city setting .
It also has rules for adventuring in Newhon , but those can be ignored and are superfluous to the utility of the city portion of the book .
The city is entirely mapped out district by district along with the highlights for each district .
But the true beauty of the map ( and the poster map ) is that each district ( except for the keep itself ) has square areas that are blank , and a book of urban geomorphs .
You can customize the back alleys of the city to your heart ’s content , even changing areas on the fly as they go through urban renewal , without having to change the overall map or try to explain to the players why the map does n’t match the reality anymore .
The perfect combination of build - it - yourself and pre-designed .
This is an excellent combination of mutability and solid design which even my other favourite city book ( the Night City sourcebook ) could benefit from .
Cities of Harn
The map that I used for this article is from this book .
It contains beautiful maps of seven major cities of Harn ( a very “ realistic ” medieval RPG setting ) ( Aleath , Cherafir , Coranan , Golotha , Shiran , Tashal , and Thay ) .
Published by Colombia Games in 1983 , it was the first truly “ excellent ” RPG city book I had come across .
It has one colour map for each one , one black and white map , and one DM map ( with a key ) as well as basic information about the city and some of its key locations .
The book is further expanded in Son of Cities and then recently in a series of products available online that goes into a lot deeper detail for each city independently .
Even ignoring the enhanced material available , these are great maps for cities to sprinkle throughout your game when players drop into a small city en route to their real destination .
The Great City
0 One games put this set of blue print books together throughout 2008 , and they go to a detail level of mapping that I ’ve never seen before in a city product .
With the full set of PDFs , not only do you get a poster - map of the city broken up by district , but each district is then set with a full set of maps for the major buildings in that district .
Need a map for the tavern ?
The graveyard ?
Any of the temples ?
They are all here , and very cleanly mapped either in blue or black .
There is no better mapped out city in my opinion , and even if you are n’t using the city itself , the number of mapped structures is intensely gratifying and will see use no matter what city you are playing in .
Thieves ’
World
While the Green Ronin Thieves ’
World d20 setting and game is excellent , for pure city awesomeness I ca n’t recommend the original Chaosium Thieves ’
World boxed set enough .
It goes into beautiful detail about Sanctuary and does it all in a mostly game - neutral manner , with game stat information when needed provided for a plethora of systems .
If anything , because of the sheer number of systems they included , they had to keep game material to a minimum and focus on the awesomess that is Sanctuary .
Honestly it ’s worth digging up on eBay just to get the maps .
City Works
While the rest of my recommendations are for books that detail cities , City Works ( a d20 hardcover by Fantasy Flight Games ) is my top pick of resources for running a city campaign and building a city that works if you are n’t going to be using one of these pre-built cities .
Everyone in the d20 scene knows that Mike Mearls writes awesome stuff , and this book is no exception .
Even if you are n’t playing anything related to D&D rules - wise , the last section of the book on building a city – starting with politics and major players and then working all the way down to mapping the individual city blocks – is invaluable .
This is a book that gets pulled down off my shelf pretty regularly – and I have n’t played a d20 - based game in years .
Night City Sourcebook
Yes , I said I was writing this for fantasy / medieval campaigns , but this is the city book ( for the CyberPunk 2020 by R. Talsorian Games ) I constantly go back to .
That ’s why it is also number 6 on this list of top 5 .
Think of it as a bonus city .
Every single building in the downtown region of Night City is detailed here , along with who runs the place , some encounters for that area of the city , compiled listings of gangs and their turf , where the restaurants and hotels are , what public transit routes go through what neighborhoods and so on .
There are sketchier details about the city as a whole outside of the downtown region , so you can add to the city as needed by developping areas South of or West of the core as needed .
Also , each building only lists the one or two more interesting business or residents – so there is plenty of room to add your own material ( like the corporate hit team ’s base of operations above the Jeet Kun Do dojo ) .
This masterpiece , in my opinion , is the template that people publishing fantasy cities should be following .

OK , I am going to try to start a series of FL studio tutorials for those who are struggling with the program or just want to learn it .
I 'm pretty much just winging it on this tutorial , so there 's likely to be lots of editing things in I missed and the like .
Anyways , as any good tutorial series should , I 'm starting the first lesson with the basics of fl , where hopefully someone could come in thats never even heard of fl and begin using it .
First let 's go over the interface .
There are 5 key windows that you should know about , the Step Sequencer , mixer , Playlist , Piano Roll , and the Browser .
If you notice , there are icons for each of these at the top of the screen .
you can click any of these to toggle showing the window it corresponds to .
Some of these are automatically open when you start a new song , however it all depends on the way you set up your environment .
I use two monitors , so I stick the step sequencer , mixer , and playlist on my right monitor , which runs at a considerably lower resolution than the left .
Here 's what my layout looks like , with the windows labeled .
You can see I pretty much cram everything in there to fill up the monitor .
This has really helped me out .
On the off chance the theres another dual monitor user out there , you might try a setup similar to this one .
Now , just for you , I 'll cram the other two windows on to the screen so you can see what they look like as well .
Note that there are 2 versions of the piano roll .
The one on top is a special version that maps out the drums to specific keys .
You do n't need to worry about messing with this , just know that you may see this when making drum patterns .
The one on the bottom is what you are going to be seeing most of the timeSo while we 're on the topic of the Piano Roll , why not go into to detail on it ?
Well first we need to create an instrument to use !
Go to the trusty step sequencer and right click on any of the instrument names .
For this example we 'll use the 3x Osc ( this instrument will be rather familiar to those that have done any amount of synth programming ) .
after right clicking , go Insert , then 3 x OscAfter this you 'll see the purple instrument pop up in the step sequencer , and you 'll see this window pop up ... This is the main instrument window , you can get to this window for each instrument by clicking it 's name in the sequencer .
This is your headquarters for the instrument .
Some more advanced instruments will actually have seperate windows pop up for special control unique to that instrument .
For the simple 3 x Osc , all the controls fit nicely in the plugin page itself .
There are also other tabs which allow an extrodinary amount of control over the sound of any given instrument .
Now I could go into detail on each and every button and knob , but for one thing , there are a few things in there that I still dont have a clue what they do , and for another thing the best way to learn these things is experimentation .
Write yourself a little loop , let it go , and tweak away !
But - you do n't know how to do that yet ?
Well you must be reading this for the first time !
Read on ... OK .
If you go back to the Step Sequencer , you should now see a new instrument named " 3 x osc " !!
Exciting !
Right click on it and select Piano Roll ( the first option ) .
There it is !
This pic may look a little scary at first , but that 's mostly becasue I 'm not much of a graphics designer o_0 .
Just read along and I 'll explain everything .
I happen to be a very visual learner myself so I like to provide aids like this to go along .
The piano roll is something you will be seeing a lot .
It is used in virtually every DAW * for midi sequencing , and no matter which program you pick or move on to in the future , it 's bound to have this little feature in there somewhere .
Pay attention to this next part , because this is a very important concept !
The window is laid out on a 2d plane .
The x axis ( horizontal ) is time , while the y axis ( vertical ) is pitch .
Most of the time there is a friendly piano along the y axis to show you what particular pitch you are using .
If you do n't know where the notes are on a piano , no need to fret , the letter C is marked on each octave with a number indicating it 's octave ( C0 being the lowest , C10 being the highest ) .
you can see C5 right at the edge of the letter h in Pitch .
In most situations , you can click on the keys to trigger them on the affected instrument .
Try it out , you can hear our little organ - like instrument .
This also works on the keys on the main instrument window from earlier , btw !
There is also a tool pallete in the upper left hand corner .
The default is the pencil tool , and you are n't going to be changing it much .
To create a note click anywhere in the grid .
Notes are represented by bars of any given color ( green is the default , try clicking the green box in the upper left corner to change it ! ) .
After your note appears try clicking and dragging it up and down and all around !!
Wow annoying o_0 .
But quite fun sometimes when you 're stuck and very bored .
Anyways , after you finish giving yourself a headache .
Try right clicking the note .
Ah !
where did it go ?!
Good job , you deleted it .
Go ahead and create another by left clicking on the grid again .
OK , this is getting old , I know , but bear with me .
To resize the note , hover over the right edge until your cursor changes to that familiar icon for resizing windows and such .
Click and drag left and right to change the length of your note .
This is the equivalent of changing between an 8th note or quarter note on paper ( except with a lot less erasing ) .
The grid is divided up along the x axis to help guide you in placing your notes rhythmically .
The thickest white lines mark 1 of each measure , the 3 slightly thinner lines between them mark the other beats , 2 3 and 4 , and the very tiny lines in between those mark each sixteenth note .
If you try resizing the note all the way over to the left , you should end up with a small green squre , that fits perfectly into any of the small squares on the grid .
This is a sixteenth note .
Drag it over to two squares .
This is an eigth note .
Drag it to fully extend from one semi - thick line to the next , and you have a quarter note !
Exciting , I know .
Now all you have to do is line the note up accross from the corresponding pitch on the keyboard and place it in the right place in the measure , and you 're all set !
Confused ?
keep reading ... Look at the example in the picture ( yes we are still on that same picture with too much crap written all over it )
Notice how each of the notes lines up with the white notes on the keyboard , starting at C3 , going up to C4 , and then back down .
It 's the good ol ' C Major scale !!
^_^
Notice that the rhythm is straight eight notes until the end where we arrive back on the original note on a quarter note .
Hm , the quarter note appears to be twice as long of a bar as the eighth note - go figure !
If only those darn italians could 've learned to write music this way ** .... then we 'd end instead of a page with a bunch of lines and random circles and flags on it to a page with a grid and a bunch of random stupid bars on it .
Wonderful .
Anyways , so there we go , now hopefully you have an idea of how to write out a musical idea into this sequencer and hear it played .
Note that sometimes complex rhthyms take several tries to put down , it 's not always simple sometimes you may find yourself counting on your fingers to see on the upbeat of what count something happens .
But here 's the beauty !
Go ahead and punch in the piano roll our example from the image here .
Now hit the spacebar .
Wow , muzak !!
You 'll notice that much to your annoyance it continually loops over and over until you hit the spacebar again .
This looping is automatic ( lucky you ! ) and will always play through the last measure containing notes - I know that sounds confusing , but say you through a note in there way on the right edge of the screen , in measure 6 .
When you hit spacebar , FL would play all the way through to that note , finish measure 6 , then loop back to the beginning .
Try it !
OK , I know you 're ready to be done with this god - forsaken window , but there 's one more thing to talk about - that pane on the bottom .
yes can you believe I wrote more crap on there for that too .
This is where various data for each note is shown .
The data is shown in the form of a bar directly under the note to which it corresponds .
The default form of data for this section is velocity , and you wont ' use much else very often .
If you are n't familiar with midi data , values such as velocity are always a number between 0 and 127 .
When you create a note by the previous methods , it automatically gives it a preset velocity , 100 I believe ( not entirely positive ) .
Its about 3 / 4 of the way up , so you have some headroom .
you can easily change the values for any note by simply clicking over the bar at the approximate velocity you want .
In other words , let 's say you wanted the C in the middle to be half as loud as the rest of the notes ( dunno why , but oh well , it 's possible ! ) .
Notice that the note is on the upbeat of 4 in the first meausre .
You can also think of it as the 8th note , or the last note before the 1 bar for measure two - whatever works for you .
Anyways , find the bar in the lower pane corresponding to that note , and click on the bar , about half way up .
The bar shrinks to the size .
Hit spacebar again to see how it sounds .
You can also move the bars by clicking the white squares at the top and dragging them up and down .
After Abdullah Abdullah ’s withdrawal , some say the Afghan run -off poll should be cancelled , to spare the country further political pain and insurgent violence .
However the Karzai camp is resolute .
The President ’s spokesman Waheed Omar said : “ While we commend Dr Abdullah for being very brave , for having run a very good campaign , for having been a very good contender in the elections , we believe it is very unfortunate he has withdrawn his name from the second round , but , all that said , we believe that the elections have to go on , the process has to complete itself , the people of Afghanistan have to be given the right to vote . ”
But , now that the opposition candidate has withdrawn , some see little merit in a second round .
“ If he is not going to participate , then the election loses its legitimacy ” said one man in Kabul .
“ Karzai will not be legitimate and the people will not accept him . ”
“ Abdullah has the right not to participate in the second round of the election because those who were behind the fraud in the first round were not brought to justice , ” another man added .
Afghanistan has been racked by weeks of political uncertainty , with security also a major concern after the Taliban vowed to disrupt the run-off vote on November 7 .
Update : here 's the complaint .
--
This new insider trading bust is not limited to Galleon , though one of the new 7 to be arrested did apparently work there .
According to CNBC , which first got the complaint , there have been arrests at hedge fund Incremental Capital , the Schottenfeld Group , and the law firm Ropes & Gray .
In addition to the 7 arrested , there are , it seems , an additional 7 who have been charged , but not aprehended .
Update : Bloomberg has the full list of names here :
Craig Drimal , who according to court documents worked at Manhattan - based Galleon , was n’t an employee of the firm .
Also arrested were Zvi Goffer , Arthur Cutillo , Jason Goldfarb , Emanuel Goffer , David Plate and Michael Kimelman .
Charges against the men include conspiracy and fraud , according to documents filed in New York federal court .
Names of the other seven defendants were n’t immediately available .

Will health care reform come at the expense of abortion rights ?
The Democrats ’ historic health care bill squeaked through the House on Saturday only after pro-life forces scored a major victory .
Despite months of wrangling over the public option and the price tag , in the end the legislation ’s fate turned on an eleventh - hour push by conservative Democrats to broaden the bill ’s existing limits on government funding of abortion , in the form of an amendment authored by Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) .
Here ’s what happened and what it means :
The Stupak amendment mandates that no federal funds can be used to pay for an abortion or “ cover any part of any health plan ” that includes coverage of an abortion , except in cases where the mother ’s life is in danger or the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest .
The first part of the amendment is n’t new .
The 1976 Hyde Amendment already prevents the use of federal dollars to pay for most abortions .
Where pro-lifers won big was on the second part , which could significantly limit the availability of private insurance plans that cover the procedure .
That ’s because Stupak ’s amendment does n’t just apply to the public option — the lower - cost plan to be offered by the government .
The House health care bill will also provide subsidies to help people and small businesses purchase plans on an exchange .
This represents a lucrative new market for insurers : anyone earning less than $ 88,000 for a family of four qualifies for assistance , as well as certain small companies .
But to gain access to these new customers , insurers will have to drop abortion coverage from their plans .
Around 87 percent of plans cover abortion ( though not all employers choose to actually include it ) .
But under the House bill , the Congressional Budget Office estimates that 21 million people will participate in the exchanges by 2019 and that 18 million of them will do so via government subsidies .
In theory , insurers could create separate plans for women who do n’t qualify for credits but still want to buy a plan on the exchange .
In reality , this is unlikely to happen , meaning that even women who purchase plans entirely with their own money in the new market may be unable to obtain one that offers abortion coverage .
Over time , the goal is for many more people to join the exchanges — the bigger they are , the more effective they ’ll be .
Not only will this put greater numbers of women in the same bind , it could affect abortion coverage in private plans outside the exchanges , too .
“ How big will exchanges have to be in an insurer ’s business model before they decide it ’s easier to standardize their coverage ? ” said Adam Sonfield , senior public policy associate of the Guttmacher Institute , a policy and research organization that focuses on reproductive health .
The Stupak amendment says that women are free to buy an optional rider to their plans that would cover abortion , as long as no money appropriated by the bill is used to pay for it .
Critics call this ridiculous .
People do n’t think they ’ll need coverage for most medical procedures until the day they actually need it ; as detractors of the amendment have pointed out , no one plans for an unplanned pregnancy .
Imagine if all insurance plans worked like a smorgasbord , in which you tried to guess the operations and medicines you might require sometime in the future .
How many procedures would you actually fork out for in advance ?
Five states already have similar “ rider ” laws in place , but according to Sonfield , “ No one seems to have come up with evidence that these plans are ever sold . ”
Proponents of the Stupak amendment insisted that they were simply making sure that health care reform complied with the Hyde Amendment .
But by constricting private coverage for abortions , they expanded Hyde ’s reach .
And Stupak ’s sweeping measure was hardly the only option on the table .
Until around 8 p.m. on the day before the vote , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tried to marshal her caucus around an amendment offered by Rep. Lois Capps ( D - Calif. ) , which would have allowed women to isolate their federal subsidies in a separate account and pay for abortions out of their premiums instead .
But that compromise fell through after a vigorous lobbying push by the Conference of Catholic Bishops , which instructed priests around the country to raise the issue in their churches .
In the end , the Stupak amendment passed 240 - 194 , with 64 Democrats voting in support .
( Twenty - three of those Democrats ultimately voted against the health care bill . )
There are two big questions as the health care reform fight moves to the Senate .
First , will the Senate mimic Stupak ?
So far , its leading proposal contains no equivalent provision , but abortion foes , emboldened by their biggest triumph in years , are sure to push for one .
Second , if a bill passes the Senate , will the Stupak amendment be stripped out in subsequent House - Senate negotiations ?
House Democrats ’ chief deputy whip , Rep. Diana DeGette ( D - Colo. ) , has reportedly collected signatures from 41 Democrats vowing to oppose the final bill if the Stupak provision remains in .
That ’s enough to prevent legislation from passing .
But 41 Democrats supported both the Stupak amendment and health care reform , which is also enough to block the legislation if all of them decided abortion financing was a deal - breaker .
Following the House vote , the White House declined to condemn or support the anti-abortion provision .
There ’s no way to predict what will come next in this high - stakes legislative tussle , but one thing is clear : in the push to provide access to health care for all Americans , abortion is now the official political football .
Update : Obama nudged Congress to revise the Stupak amendment on Monday , suggesting in an interview with ABC News that he thinks it goes too far in limiting private insurance coverage of abortions .
The president explained that his administration is not looking to change the existing ban on the use of federal money for abortion — ie.
the Hyde Amendment — but he wanted to ensure “ we ’re not restricting women ’s insurance choices . ”
Since I was a wee tyke , I 've wanted to take over the world .
My secret santa somehow sensed that and shipped me the beginnings of a mind - control robot .
He( She ) sent me an Arduino NG development board complete with a working power source and a blinking message ( morse code and I suspect the message is my secret santa 's username ) .
A letter , taped to the inside of the box is as follows : To Mr. jhc142002 : Enclosed is an Arduino NG development board .
I sincerely hope it 's still blinking by the time you receive it .
As to what the blinking means , I 'll leave it to you to find that out by yourself .
Naturally , however , feel free to overwrite the program within it you do n't feel compelled to waste time on that .
Also enclosed is a USB cable in the unlikely event that you do n't have one .
Mark sure to visit arduino.cc to get the development tools ( Windows , Mac and Linux compatible ! ) and hack away .
Happy holidays .
- Chris ( your secret santa )
I 've yet to begin decoding the message due to holiday busyness .
I find myself unable to commence building the aforementioned mind - control robot until I 'm able to decode the message ( most certainly not a waste of time ) .
So , to Chris : I sincerely hope you are up to the task of becoming Vice Overlord when the time comes .
Until then , shine on you crazy diamond .
Porfirio Lobo was considered a front runner for president Provisional results in Honduras indicate that Porfirio Lobo , an opponent of ousted President Manuel Zelaya , has won presidential elections .
The poll was held five months after Mr Zelaya was forced out at gunpoint , with an interim government taking over .
Mr Lobo is seen as a unifying figure .
He won 56 % of the vote , with over 60 % of registered voters taking part .
A clear winner and high turnout were what the interim government were hoping for to give the election legitimacy .
But regional powers Argentina and Brazil have said they will not recognise any government installed after the election , arguing that to do so would legitimise the coup which ousted an elected president , and thus set a dangerous precedent .
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva also said that Mr Zelaya will remain in its embassy in the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa - where he has been living since he secretly returned to the country in September - until the government gave assurances for his safety .
The US , meanwhile , said it would accept the election results .
Mr Lobo comes from the centre - right opposition National Party , and was defeated by Mr Zelaya in the last presidential election in 2005 .
The BBC's Stephen Gibbs in Tegucigalpa says although many members of the current interim government belong to the rival Liberal Party , they are expected to welcome the result .
Mr Zelaya is also a Liberal , but alienated many in his own party when he moved the country closer to left - wing leaders such as Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Bolivian President Evo Morales .
' Important step '
The US said Sunday 's vote was important .
" Significant work remains to be done to restore democratic and constitutional order in Honduras , but today the Honduran people took a necessary and important step forward , " State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said in a statement as the results were coming in .
AT THE SCENE Stephen Gibbs , BBC , Tegucigalpa
Hundreds of supporters of Porfirio " Pepe " Lobo , the wealthy landowner with the easy smile , are busy celebrating in a Tegucigalpa hotel .
And members of the Honduran government , even though most are not members of Mr Lobo 's party , are looking quietly satisfied too .
This is the result they were hoping for : a clear winner and a strong turnout .
Armed with that , they will have a stronger argument to put to the international community : that if it does not accept the result of this election , it is going against the will of the Honduran people .
But this crisis is not over .
Mr Zelaya is still making his presence felt from his refuge in the Brazilian embassy .
What to do about him , and his supporters , will test the president - elect 's political skills .
The Honduran government has tried to portray this election as a nationwide demonstration that the country is on a democratic path , after five months of political crisis .
Mr Zelaya described the vote to elect his replacement as a " fraud " and called on his supporters to abstain .
He has not yet commented on the results .
During the day 's voting , several hundred protesters against the election gathered in the city of San Pedro Sula .
They were dispersed by security forces using tear gas .
Mr Lobo said he would encourage regional powers to accept the result of the election .
" We are prepared to approach them and ask them to understand that there is a government which was elected , that it is the precise will of Hondurans at the ballot box , that it is a democracy and we should all respect the leadership of countries , " he said , according to Reuters news agency .
There were some election observers , but the Organisation of American States ( OAS ) , which expelled Honduras following Mr Zelaya 's removal from office , and the European Union did not send monitoring teams .
The political crisis and election have divided the region , with Costa Rica , which has long been the mediator between the two sides in the crisis , saying it would accept the result , but other Latin American countries opposing the vote .
Congress is due to vote on Mr Zelaya 's reinstatement on 2 December .
His term ends on 27 January .
Mr Zelaya was forced into exile on 28 June after trying to hold a vote on whether a constituent assembly should be set up to look at rewriting the constitution .
His critics said the vote , which was ruled illegal by the Supreme Court , aimed to remove the current one - term limit on serving as president and pave the way for his possible re-election .
Mr Zelaya has repeatedly denied this and some commentators say it would have been impossible to change the constitution before his term in office was up .

Abdulmutallab's explosives might have been spotted had agreement been reached , Dutch minister says
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The US blocked Dutch attempts to install full - body scanners for passengers travelling to the US before the failed suicide bombing of a transatlantic flight on Christmas Day , the Dutch interior minister said today .
Authorities at Schipol airport in Amsterdam had wanted to introduce the devices to monitor US - bound flights , but the scanners were not installed because US authorities wanted them to be used on flights to all destinations , said Guusje Ter Horst
The disclosure could put further pressure on Barack Obama , who has come under criticism in the US after the security lapse that allowed a young Nigerian Islamist to board a US plane on Christmas day carrying explosives .
He has been charged with trying to destroy the Northwest Airlines flight , bound for Detroit from Amsterdam .
Following the failed bomb attack , the US has now agreed to the body scanners for passengers to America , Ter Horst said .
They will be ready in three weeks ' time .
Normal metal detectors could not have spotted the explosives , and the use of full - body scanners would have helped prevent Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab from taking them on the aircraft , she said .
Full - body scanners , unlike the standard archway metal detectors , use radio waves to generate a picture of the body that can see through a person 's clothing and spot hidden weapons or packages .
Speaking at a news conference at The Hague , Ter Horst said the attempted plane bombing had been prepared professionally but executed amateurishly .
" If the detonation had been done in a correct manner , then part of the plane would have exploded and a hole in the plane would have caused a great tragedy , " she said .
A preliminary Dutch investigation said all security checks were correctly carried out in Amsterdam before the flight left , and US authorities cleared the passenger list that included Abdulmutallab .
Ter Horst said the Dutch authorities did not know that Abdulmutallab – who was travelling on a Nigerian passport – was on a US security list .
Initial reports said he had been allowed on to the plane without a passport .
She said Abdulmutallab apparently assembled the explosive device , including 80 grams of the military explosive PETN , in the aircraft toilet and had planned to detonate it using a syringe of chemicals .
" It is not exaggerating to say the world has escaped a disaster , " Ter Horst added .
Meanwhile , officials in Somalia said a Somali tried to board a commercial airliner in Mogadishu last month with powdered chemicals , liquid and a syringe that could have caused an explosion .
Abdulahi Hassan Barise , a police spokesman , said the suspect was arrested before the 13 November Daallo Airlines flight left .
It was scheduled to travel from Mogadishu to the northern Somali city of Hargeisa , then to Djibouti and Dubai .
Two international officials in Nairobi said the incident was similar to the attempted Detroit attack .
US officials said they were aware of the incident and were investigating any possible links with the Detroit incident .
Barack Obama today described US intelligence failings as " totally unacceptable " after it emerged that agencies knew leaders of a branch of al - Qaida in Yemen had talked about " a Nigerian " being prepared for a terrorist attack .
The US president interrupted a holiday in Hawaii to speak bluntly about the lapses that allowed Abdulmutallab to board the flight to the US .
A senior official told the New York Times Obama had been briefed that the US had information that would have amounted to a clear warning if shared among agencies .
This included details on where Abdulmutallab had been and what some of his plans were .
" When our government has information on a known extremist and that information is not shared and acted upon as it should have been so that this extremist boards a plane with dangerous explosives that could cost nearly 300 lives , a systemic failure has occurred and I consider that totally unacceptable , " the US president said .
The New York Times reported that although US agencies did not have the name of the 23 - year - old Nigerian , they could have found it by looking at information about him that was already available .
" Had this critical information been shared , it could have been compiled with other intelligence and a fuller , clearer picture of the suspect would have emerged , " Obama said .
" The warning signs would have triggered red flags and the suspect would have never been allowed to board that plane for America . "
Senior US officials told the Associated Press that the intelligence authorities were looking at conversations between Abdulmutallab and at least one al - Qaida member .
The unnamed officials said the conversations were vague or coded , but US intelligence believed that , in hindsight , they may have been referring to the attempted attack in Detroit .
Obama 's homeland security and counter - terrorism adviser , John Brennan , is due to present the president with an early report based on recommendations and summaries from across the government .
John Prescott has become the latest senior Labour politician to voice open doubts about his own support for Tony Blair 's decision in 2003 to place British military forces behind the American - led invasion of Iraq .
In a wide - ranging interview with the New Statesman magazine the former deputy prime minister asks himself : " I do wonder , looking back now , having the privilege of discussing with Tony about all this , how did I go along [ with it ] ? "
Listening to some of Blair 's video - conferences with George Bush was , he admits , a hair - raising experience .
" Bush is crap , you know it , I know it , the party knows it , " he tells the magazine .
At the time there was little dissent in cabinet from the drift towards war , which the Chilcot inquiry is investigating as part of the long - promised overview on what became Britain 's most unpopular military engagement since the Suez affair in 1956 .
Clare Short raised questions , as did Robin Cook .
He resigned as the invasion began , Short did so later .
But most cabinet members said at the time and later that they got all the answers they sought and backed the then - prime minister in the belief that Saddam Hussein did possess weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) and the will to use them .
That view was both widely held – even by France and Russia at the time – but also disputed .
Prescott , who is not expected to be called as a Chilcot witness , tells the New Statesman : " I did listen to some of the video links between Tony and Bush … and I mean , they can be hair - raising , because Bush has got his own kind of approach … it did make you think . "
Visiting the then US vice - president , Dick Cheney , with Christopher Meyer , Britain 's ambassador at the time , he was alarmed by the American approach and later came to feel that Blair had not used British leverage sufficiently .
" I 've often thought , ' Well , you could have just said , ' Sod you … we 're not doing it . ' "
Meyer expressed the same view to the Chilcot panel , whose memoirs were sufficiently offensive about Prescott to prompt a public spat with the man Prescott calls " bloody red socks , that idiot " .
Asked if the then attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , was bullied by Blair into approving the war , Prescott said : " If you say , ' Was Goldsmith a happy man about this ? ' – no , he was n't ...
That 's quite different from saying , ' No , I 'm sorry , my view is that it 's illegal , I 'm not supporting it . ' "
TORONTO  Iran denounced charges by the Norwegian government that it had illegally confiscated a Nobel Peace Prize winner ’s medal and frozen her bank account , the IRNA news agency reported Friday .
Iran called the assertion an interference in its internal affairs and said the Nobelist , Shirin Ebadi , owed taxes to the government .
“ We are surprised that Norwegian officials can make such hasty and biased comments and disregard the laws and regulations of other countries , ” a Foreign Ministry spokesman , Ramin Mehmanparast , was quoted as saying .
Mr. Mehmanparast denied that Ms. Ebadi ’s medal , which she won in 2003 , had been confiscated , but his comments indicated that her assets had been frozen .
A few months later , a veteran Communist Party politician named Cheng Siwei suggested essentially the same thing He Fan had .
Cheng , in his mid-70s , was trained as a chemical engineer and has no official role in setting Chinese economic policy .
But within hours of his speech , a flurry of trading forced the dollar to what was then its lowest level against the euro and other currencies .
The headline in the South China Morning Post the next day was : “ Officials ’ Words Shrivel U.S. Dollar . ”
Expressing amazement at the markets ’ response , Carl Weinberg , chief economist at the High Frequency Economics advisory group , said , “ This would be kind of like Congressman Charlie Rangel giving a speech telling the Fed to hike or cut interest rates . ”
( Cheng , like Rangel , is known for colorful comments — but he is less powerful , since Rangel after all chairs the House Ways and Means Committee . )
In the following weeks , phrases like “ run on the dollar ” and “ collapse of confidence ” showed up more and more frequently in financial newsletters .
The nervousness only increased when someone who does have influence , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao , said last November , “ We are worried about how to preserve the value ” of China ’s dollar holdings .
When the dollar is strong , the following ( good ) things happen : the price of food , fuel , imports , manufactured goods , and just about everything else ( vacations in Europe ! ) goes down .
The value of the stock market , real estate , and just about all other American assets goes up .
Interest rates go down — for mortgage loans , credit - card debt , and commercial borrowing .
Tax rates can be lower , since foreign lenders hold down the cost of financing the national debt .
The only problem is that American - made goods become more expensive for foreigners , so the country ’s exports are hurt .
When the dollar is weak , the following ( bad ) things happen : the price of food , fuel , imports , and so on ( no more vacations in Europe ) goes up .
The value of the stock market , real estate , and just about all other American assets goes down .
Interest rates are higher .
Tax rates can be higher , to cover the increased cost of financing the national debt .
The only benefit is that American - made goods become cheaper for foreigners , which helps create new jobs and can raise the value of export - oriented American firms ( winemakers in California , producers of medical devices in New England ) .
The dollar ’s value has been high for many years — unnaturally high , in large part because of the implicit bargain with the Chinese .
Living standards in China , while rising rapidly , have by the same logic been unnaturally low .
To understand why this situation probably can’t go on , and what might replace it — via a dollar crash or some other event — let ’s consider how this curious balance of power arose and how it works .
Why a poor country has so much money
By 1996 , China amassed its first $ 100 billion in foreign assets , mainly held in U.S. dollars .
( China considers these holdings a state secret , so all numbers come from analyses by outside experts . )
By 2001 , that sum doubled to about $ 200 billion , according to Edwin Truman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington .
Since then , it has increased more than sixfold , by well over a trillion dollars , and China ’s foreign reserves are now the largest in the world .
( In second place is Japan , whose economy is , at official exchange rates , nearly twice as large as China ’s but which has only two - thirds the foreign assets ; the next - largest after that are the United Arab Emirates and Russia . )
China ’s U.S. dollar assets probably account for about 70 percent of its foreign holdings , according to the latest analyses by Brad Setser , a former Treasury Department economist now with the Council on Foreign Relations ; the rest are mainly in euros , plus some yen .
Most of China ’s U.S. investments are in conservative , low - yield instruments like Treasury notes and federal - agency bonds , rather than showier Blackstone - style bets .
Because notes and bonds backed by the U.S. government are considered the safest investments in the world , they pay lower interest than corporate bonds , and for the past two years their annual interest payments of 4 to 5 percent have barely matched the 5 - to - 6 - percent decline in the U.S. dollar ’s value versus the RMB .
Once French women accept that the " pact of fidelity is not natural but cultural " , and that infidelity is essential to the " psychic functioning " of certain men who are still very much in love , it can be a " very liberating " for women , she contends .
Yaakov Teitel 's lawyer said his client was " mentally disturbed " Israeli police have arrested a Jewish settler who they say has confessed to a string of high - profile hate attacks .
These allegedly include the killing of two Palestinians 12 years ago , and the bombing last year of the home of the Israeli academic , Zeev Sternhell .
Yaakov Teitel , a 37 - year - old American immigrant who lives in the West Bank , was detained last month after handing out leaflets condemning homosexuals .
Police said they believed Mr Teitel had acted alone during the hate campaign .
" He is like a serial killer .
This guy was a Jewish terrorist who targeted different types of people , " police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld added .
" He was deeply involved in terrorism in all different levels . "
Mr Teitel 's lawyer , Adi Keidar , told Israel Army Radio that his client was " mentally disturbed " and believed he was an " emissary of the Lord " who was instructed to carry out the attacks by God.
Booby - trapped gift
At a news conference on Sunday , officials said Mr Teitel had been arrested earlier this month in the Har Nof area of Jerusalem following a lengthy investigation by the police and the Shin Bet internal security service .
We are horrified by the fact that there are elements of Israeli society , Jews who feel justified in taking the lives of other Jews because of their beliefs
Leah Ortiz
He had been giving out leaflets in the ultra-Orthodox neighbourhood praising an attack on a gay youth club in Tel Aviv in August that killed two people .
A large weapons cache was later found at his home in the West Bank settlement outpost Shvut Rachel , where he lives with his wife and four children .
During questioning , Mr Teitel confessed to several crimes , saying he had emigrated to Israel to carry out attacks against Palestinians as revenge for suicide bombings which killed Israeli citizens , the added .
The crimes are said to include the murders of a Palestinian shepherd near Mount Hebron in 1997 and an Palestinian taxi driver in East Jerusalem two months later , and the stabbing of an Arab .
More recently , he was allegedly responsible for a pipe bomb attack which wounded Mr Sternhell , a well - known critic of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and opponent of the Israeli blockade of Gaza .
Zeev Sternhell suffered minor shrapnel wounds in one leg in the attack After the September 2008 attack , posters were found offering a 1 m shekel ( $ 294,000 ) reward to anyone who killed a member of the Peace Now Movement , which opposes Jewish settlement activity .
Mr Teitel is also said to have confessed to sending a booby - trapped gift basket in March that year to a family of Messianic Jews , who believe in Jesus as a saviour .
The blast seriously wounded the family 's 15 - year - old son .
Video footage released on Sunday purportedly shows him leaving the bomb outside the Americans ' home in the settlement of Ariel .
He was also suspected to attempting to bomb Israeli police stations and patrols because they provided security for gay pride parades , but not for the attack on the gay youth club , police said .
Responding to the arrest , Mr Sternhell said : " I hope the system deals with this terrorist as it deals with all other terrorists , Jewish and Arab alike . "
Leah Ortiz , one of the Messianic Jews whose home was bombed last year , said she was " horrified by the fact that there are elements of Israeli society , Jews who feel justified in taking the lives of other Jews because of their beliefs " .

Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has said he would have found a justification for invading Iraq even without the now - discredited evidence that Saddam Hussein was trying to produce weapons of mass destruction .
“ I would still have thought it right to remove him .
I mean , obviously you would have had to use and deploy different arguments about the nature of the threat , ” Blair told the BBC in an interview to be broadcast this morning .
It was a startling admission from the onetime British leader , who was President Bush ’s staunchest ally in the decision to invade Iraq in 2003 .
Blair ’s comments were immediately denounced by critics who accused him of using false pretenses to drag Britain into an unpopular war that has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of allied troops and tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians .

Speaking to broadcaster Fern Britton , Blair insisted that ousting Hussein had improved the situation in Iraq by laying the foundation for a more democratic country .
He described the upcoming Iraqi elections as “ probably the single most significant thing that ’s happened to that region for many years . ”
“ I ca n’t really think we’d be better with him and his two sons still in charge , ” Blair said of Hussein .
But he added that he could “ totally understand ” why others opposed the invasion .
Hundreds of thousands of people across Europe , including tens of thousands in Britain , joined protests before the U.S. - led invasion .
“ I sympathize with the people who were against it for perfectly good reasons and who are against it now , ” Blair said .
“ But for me , you know , in the end I had to take the decision . ”

The interview comes just a few weeks after Britain launched an inquiry in the decision to go to war .
Blair is expected to appear before the inquiry committee early in the new year .
The committee has already heard statements from former government officials who said that Blair was willing to join Bush in toppling Hussein with or without the argument that the Iraqi dictator was developing weapons of mass destruction .
The weapons claim was the primary justification for the war , but it proved untrue .
Hans Blix , who led the United Nations team of inspectors looking into the claim , said that Blair ’s remarks gave “ the strong impression of a lack of sincerity . ”

“ The war was sold on the weapons of mass destruction [ argument ] , and now you . . . hear that it was only a question of a ‘ deployment of arguments , ’ ” Blix told the BBC .
“ It sounds a bit like a fig leaf that was held up , and if the fig leaf had not been there , then they would have tried to put another fig leaf there . ”

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Five banks failed late Friday , bringing the 2009 tally to 120 .
The biggest to fall was United Commercial Bank of San Francisco , which had 63 U.S. branches as well as operations in Hong Kong and Shanghai .
The bank held deposits totaling $ 7.5 billion .
East West Bank of Pasadena , Calif. , agreed to assume all of United Commercial 's domestic branches , as well as its international subsidiaries .
United Security Bank of Sparta , Ga. , closed its doors for the last time on Friday .
Moultrie , Ga. - based Ameris Bank will assume control of all United Security 's deposits .
Home Federal Savings Bank of Detroit also failed late friday .
New Orleans - based Liberty Bank and Trust Co. will assume control of its deposits .
Prosperan Bank of Oakdale , Minn. , failed and will be taken over by Grand Forks , N.D. - based Alerus Financial .
Gateway Bank of St. Louis , Mo. , also failed .
Central Bank of Kansas City will take over its deposits .
Customers of the failed banks are protected , however .
The FDIC. , which has insured bank deposits since the Great Depression , currently covers customer accounts up to $ 250,000 .
Customers can access their money over the weekend by writing checks or using ATMs or debit cards .
Checks will continue to be processed , and borrowers should make mortgage and loan payments as usual .
What happens to the banks .
United Commercial 's failure will cost the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund an estimated $ 1.4 billion .
East West Bank paid the FDIC a premium of 1.1 % for the right to assume United Commercial 's deposits , and the two organizations agreed to share losses on around $ 7.7 billion of the failed bank 's assets .
An average of 11 banks have failed per month this year , and the federal coffer is thinning under the massive strain .
The fund now stands below $ 10 billion , down significantly from $ 45 billion a year ago .
When the FDIC factors in expected closures , the agency says the fund is in the red and will likely remain there through 2012 .
Bank failure costs are expected to total $ 100 billion over the next four years .
So far 2009 has seen more than four times the number that were closed in 2008 .
It 's the highest total since 1992 , when 181 banks failed .
Ameris Bank will pay the FDIC a premium of 0.36 % to take control of American United 's $ 150 million in deposits .
United Security had $ 157 million in assets , and the FDIC and Ameris entered into a loss - share transaction on $ 123 million of those assets .
The agreement means Ameris will share in the losses on the assets covered .
The failure is expected to cost the Deposit Insurance Fund an estimated $ 58 million .
The two branches of United Security will reopen Saturday as branches of Ameris .
Liberty Bank and Trust will assume Home Federal Savings Bank's $ 14.9 million in assets and $ 12.8 million in deposits .
The failure cost the FDIC fund $ 5.4 million .
The two branches of Home Federal will reopen Saturday as branches of Liberty .
Alerus Financial will pay the FDIC a premium of 1.02 % to take control of Prosperan 's $ 175.6 million in deposits .
Prosperan had $ 199.5 million in assets , and the FDIC and Alerus entered into a loss - share transaction on $ 173.9 million of those assets .
The failure will cost the FDIC $ 60.1 million .
The three branches of Prosperan will reopen Saturday as branches of Alerus .
Central Bank will assume Gateway Bank's $ 27.7 million in assets and $ 27.9 million in deposits .
The failure cost the FDIC fund $ 9.2 million .
The single branch of Gateway will reopen Saturday as a branch of Central .
In Psalm 109 , King David , who is a major figure in the Old Testament is lamenting .
He says :
For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me ,
speaking against me with lying tongues .
They beset me with words of hate ,
and attack me without cause .
In return for my love they accuse me ,
even while I make prayer for them .
So they reward me evil for good ,
and hatred for my love .
For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me ?
He goes on :
They say , Appoint a wicked man against him ;
let an accuser stand on his right .
When he is tried , let him be found guilty ;
let his prayer be counted as sin .
May his days be few ;
may another seize his position .
May his children be orphans ,
and his wife a widow .
May his children wander about and beg ;
may they be driven out of the ruins they inhabit .
May the creditor seize all that he has ;
may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil .
And then King David says ,
Help me , O Lord my God !
Save me according to your steadfast love .
Let them know that this is your hand ;
you , O Lord , have done it .
Let them curse , but you will bless .
Let my assailants be put to shame ; may your servant be glad .
May my accusers be clothed with dishonour ;
may they be wrapped in their own shame as in a mantle .
With my mouth I will give great thanks to the Lord ;
I will praise him in the midst of the throng .
For he stands at the right hand of the needy ,
to save them from those who would condemn them to death .
For those would quote the Bible for their justifications , would n’t you think they can do a bit better than this ?
The rich irony is that those who have chosen this Bible verse as a slogan clearly have no idea of the context and meaning of that which they quote .
The Bible clearly says the exact opposite of that which they imply .
UPDATE
Thanks to everyone for the recs and the comments .
It seems this touched a nerve .
Christian has come to mean some interesting things .

Why ?
We 're turning corn into fuel — a highly inefficient one , at that — instead of food .
The Mackinac Center for Public Policy points out that " mixing food and fuel markets for political reasons has done American consumers no discernable good , while producing measurable harm . "
However , perhaps summing up the issue most succinctly is Mark J. Perry , professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan - Flint :
Anytime you have Paul Krugman agreeing on ethanol with such a diverse group as the Wall Street Journal , Reason Magazine , the Cato Institute , Investor 's Business Daily , Rolling Stone Magazine , the Christian Science Monitor , The New York Times , John Stossel , The Ecological Society of America , the American Enterprise and Brookings Institutions , the Heritage Foundation , George Will and Time magazine , you know that ethanol has to be one of the most misguided public policies in US history .
But Brazil seems to have made it work .
Using just 1 percent of its arable land , Brazil produced 6.57 billion gallons of sugar ethanol last year , roughly half the annual oil production of Iraq .
Ethanol accounts for about 50 percent of Brazil 's automotive fuel .
General Electric and Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer are working to develop ethanol suitable for powering commercial aircraft , with a test flight possible by early 2012 .
Most importantly , Brazil relies on imported oil for only 10 percent of its energy needs today — due in large part to its ethanol industry .
So , what 's Brazil doing right ?
The answer is simple .
Unlike the United States , Brazil makes its ethanol from sugar , which yields over eight units of energy for each unit invested , whereas corn - based ethanol yields a paltry one and a half units of energy for each unit invested .
Sugar - based ethanol is also cheap to produce , at only 60 cents a gallon .
It seems so obvious .
An alternative fuel that works already exists .
What 's stopping us from using it ?
What 's stopping us is a decision made 36 years ago by a man named Rusty Butz , before ethanol was even a blip on anyone 's radar .
In 1973 , Earl " Rusty " Butz , President Nixon 's USDA chief , did away with the agricultural price supports introduced by the Roosevelt administration .
These supports were intended to protect farmers ' finances by limiting supply when bumper crops would have otherwise flooded the market and to avoid squeezing consumers by releasing the warehoused grain when crop yields were low and prices would naturally spike .
Butz ginned up political support for the administration by encouraging farmers to plant " fencerow to fencerow " while the government provided them with subsidies to cover the difference between market prices and production costs .
Of course , growing " fencerow to fencerow " did exactly what one would expect : production exceeded demand , and prices took a dive .
This did n't sit too well with Archer Daniels Midland ( ADM ) , the nation 's largest corn refiner .
Now , there 's only so much corn one person can eat .
ADM suddenly needed to figure out how to somehow stimulate sales of all that excess food .
Then a Japanese technique called " wet milling " caught the company 's eye .
Wet milling turned corn kernels into what ADM hoped would be a low - cost alternative to sugar — the now - ubiquitous high - fructose corn syrup .
While high - fructose corn syrup was an alternative to sugar , it still was n't possible to manufacture cheaply enough to make it a low - cost alternative .
Enter Dwayne Andreas , who , at the time , was ADM's CEO .
It just so happened that Florida sugarcane growers were in the middle of a push to get Congress to impose a tariff on foreign sugar , which was exerting downward pressure on market prices .
Andreas decided to help fund lobbying efforts by Florida sugarcane growers to convince Congress to impose a quota on non-US sugar , which had been flooding the US market and keeping prices down .
In short , ADM backed its competition 's political agenda and , when Ronald Reagan took office , the sugar tariff was swiftly ushered into place .
Naturally , sugar prices escalated , eclipsing the cost of ADM 's high - fructose corn syrup .
Soft - drink makers like Coca - Cola and Pepsi switched to the cheaper alternative in short order .
Perhaps this is why a statue of Ronald Reagan stands at ADM headquarters .
It is a token of appreciation from one free marketeer to another for promoting what is , essentially , a socialist policy .
ADM 's CEO , Andreas , does n't seem to view our capitalist society through the same lens as most others .
In one interview , he said , " There is n't one grain of anything in the world that is sold in a free market .
Not one !
The only place you see a free market is in the speeches of politicians .
People who are not in the Midwest do not understand that this is a socialist country . "
From the looks of things , " socialism " has done well for Dwayne Andreas .
A report by James Bovard of the Cato Institute notes , " At least 43 % of ADM 's annual profits are from products heavily subsidized or protected by the American government .
Moreover , every $ 1 of profits earned by ADM 's corn sweetener operation costs consumers $ 10 . "
Minyanville professor and Houston fund manager Ryan Krueger says ,
The sugar tariff is the biggest scam since one hour Martinizing .
For the first time in human history , more than a billion people this year will be classified as ' chronically hungry . '
We 'll artificially sweeten prices for US farmers , bankrupting poor farmers in Africa or South America and then turn around and send them food aid .
He continues ,
The world sugar price is 22 cents per lb .
The US price because of the tariff ?
44 cents .
Want to make candy and buy sugar for 22 cents ?
Sorry , no can do — it 's illegal .
If sugar prices plummet ?
Do n't sweat it , Washington 's got that covered , guaranteeing a price of no less than 18 cents .
Surely , there must be more to this story .
Nope .
In Krueger 's words ,
I 'd love all the upside and none of the downside in a game where my competitors are barred from playing against me , yet if I still somehow fail to perform the scoreboard operator nonetheless puts up points for me — as long as I vote for the right referee when his contract 's up .
Okay , so ADM hijacked the sweetener market .
What does this have to do with Brazilian ethanol and our country 's insistence on forging ahead with subpar ethanol made from corn , even though tariff - free cane ethanol would cut gas prices significantly ?
The path leads directly to good old political back - scratching .
You'd be correct to assume that demand for soft drinks drops during the cold winter months .
What would ADM do with idle wet - milling equipment during high - fructose corn syrup 's " off season " ?
It turns out that wet - milling machines also make ethanol .
The federal government provides a 45 cent per-gallon subsidy for domestically produced ( corn - based ) ethanol .
Add to that the crippling sugar policy , plus a 54 cent per gallon tariff placed specifically on foreign ethanol ( sugar based , from Brazil ) , and bang — ADM corners the domestic ethanol market .
Pretty crafty , huh ?
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger says , " The federal government is subsidizing corn - based ethanol and we have a tariff of 54 cents - a - gallon on the most important ethanol to discourage cheap fuel coming in from Brazil .
This is crazy . "
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke says , " As you know , I favor open trade and I think allowing Brazilian ethanol , for example , would reduce costs in the United States . "
And C. Ford Runge , an economist specializing in commodities and trade policy at the Center for International Food and Agricultural Policy at the University of Minnesota , says , " the obvious thing to do is lower that [ sugar ] tariff and let some Brazilian ethanol come in .
But one of the fundamental reasons our biofuels policy is so out of whack with markets and reality is that interest - group politics have been so dominant in the construction of the subsidies that support it . "
Until corporate welfare takes a backseat to real , proven solutions that help stateside consumers save a bundle at the pump ( and help our less - prosperous allies financially ) , corn will remain king .
The New York Times Magazine , not widely known for understated satire , is only the latest of ....
So we 'll just say that Biden is the most powerful vice president in the last 321 days .
You figure it out .
Also , as is well - known by conspiracy theorists ( you know who you are ) , since our corporate parent is a charter member of the MSM , we are ( secretly ) prohibited from saying anything positive about Hamlin 's Grand Old Party or anything even slightly mocking about the current Democratic administration that has so successfully turned the U.S. economy around so quickly .
And all , amazingly , without incurring new deficits or lobbyists .
And only a few hundred billion in new taxes and cuts .
We hesitate to publish the name of the most powerful vice president in American history because Biden called him the most dangerous VP in American history and commenters here get so excited about him , one way or another , even though he 's related to Obama .
You might be wondering who was the most powerful vice president in U.S. history .
In a cover profile with posed photos and everything ( highly coveted in places called Washington ) , the New York Times Magazine reports that , after only 321 days in office , Joe Biden , who was a senator when Barack Obama was only a sixth - grader , has already possibly become the second - most - powerful vice president in the nation 's entire 85,469 - day history .
... several major media outlets to publish its jolting Joe - Biden - is - really - more - powerful - than - it - seems - behind - the - scenes - helping - this - inexperienced - president discovery , all with the less - than - reluctant assistance of Biden 's staff .
( And one can only guess what the reaction is among the loyalists surrounding Obama . )
The article lists a number of areas where Biden has become supremo in the no-longer - fledgling Obama administration .
For example , foreign affairs .
Forget Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , an also - ran who also ran against Obama .
Biden 's the go - to guy for Obama on foreign policy and is charged with finally fixing Iraq .
Everyone remembers Biden opposing the 2007 troop surge and his bang - off pronouncement that Gen. David Petraeus ' counterinsurgency strategy was " dead flat wrong . "
Alas , that Biden pronouncement itself turned out to be dead flat wrong .
( Though you did n't read that here . )
But no less an authority than Biden himself has proclaimed that Biden knows more about foreign policy than anyone else in last year 's field of Democratic contenders .
( See the N.Y. newspaper article here . )
The article states : " Biden has a deep knowledge of , and an intuitive feel for , people and places still new to the president . "
As one result , Biden has been dispatched to such international flash points as Herzegovina to swear his boss knows where they are and to talk about U.S. interests , thus surely maintaining civil calm .
According to the article , while Obama was otherwise occupied in his summer - long hustle for healthcare , Biden was dispatched to Iraq for a July 4 photo op with the troops that produced a particularly good picture that much pleased the White House .
It had Biden within an ethnically and racially balanced gathering of troops beneath a big U.S. flag .
Well worth the long trip .
According to the article , according to an unidentified VP aide , Biden and Obama were not all that close on the Foreign Relations Committee , in part because Biden resented all the attention the upstart Illinois freshman got after his few months in that exclusive Legislature .
Remember during the Democratic primary campaign Biden portraying his young competitor as a neophyte ?
Did we mention Obama was only 11 when Biden was already a senator ?
In fact , Biden still works out in the gym over there , where he 's Obama 's main Senate envoy on such things as healthcare and convincing alleged Republican Arlen Specter to turn .
And , btw , Biden thinks his Senate office was much nicer than the VP 's suite .
According to the article , the two has - been senators now running the chief executive 's house still are n't all that close , even socially , where Biden favors his Wilmington weekends over hanging around D.C. with other elites .
Although , besides Iraq and recently Afghanistan , Obama has turned to Biden to mediate political disputes within the seemingly seamless Obama administration .
We all recall how Obama put Biden in charge of revitalizing the American economy with the Revitalization Act given them by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who , do n't forget , is right behind Biden in presidential succession .
That revitalization has worked out so well that , thanks to $ 787 billion in stimulus money ( much of it not yet spent ) , unemployment has only exploded from about 8 % to more than 10 % .
Without Biden , it probably might be -- what ?
-- 28 %-29 % by now .
Additionally , Pennsylvania native Biden has learned the Chicago way well enough to drive reported stimulus spending and job creation in dozens of congressional districts that do n't even exist .
According to the article , Biden is also successfully reining in his gaffe - prone garrulity .
All of which , frankly , does n't leave much for Obama to do , except the Oval Office photo ops , a speech here and there , bows around Asia , pardoning turkeys and lots of ceremonial proclamations .
Fundraising , of course .
And changing the angry tone of the nation 's capital .
The president 's next speech is Tuesday .
On Afghanistan .
His latest new strategy for the conflict he calls " a war of necessity . "
As everyone recalls , the influential Biden was an early , ardent advocate of long - term nation - building in Afghanistan , where the war is now into its ninth year with American fatalities rising to one every 14 hours or so and poll support waning .
So , less than a year away from congressional midterm elections , forget about any cut - and - run exit talk from the Democratic president , who 's listening so closely to Biden apparently .
Look for cross-country , poppyroots - level reconstruction to be a major part of Obama 's new stick - it - out Afghan strategic package .
Or not .

Congratulations to the following Educators who have been recognised for their efforts :
Dozens of registered nurses who have been convicted of serious crimes including murder , sex offenses , robbery and assault have been identified by California regulators reviewing newly required fingerprints from tens of thousands of caregivers .
The state Board of Registered Nursing expanded its review of nurses ’ criminal records after an October 2008 story by The Times and the nonprofit news organization ProPublica found that regulators often did n’t know about nurses ’ convictions and did n’t act quickly once they learned of them .
At the time , nurses who had received licenses before 1990 were exempt from providing fingerprints , which are used to flag arrests for regulators .
Since March , the board has required those nurses to submit their fingerprints .
Most of the crimes turned up are misdemeanors , such as driving under the influence , petty theft or fraud .
But the records as of November also included two murders , two solicitations for murder , an attempted murder , a manslaughter and a vehicular homicide .
There also were 19 convictions for assault , including five felonies , and 39 for sex offenses , three of them felonies .
The nursing board has referred at least 13 cases to the attorney general to start disciplinary proceedings against the nurses involved .
Regulators wo n’t release the names or details of any nurses ’ crimes unless public accusations are filed .
The board closed its investigation into one murder conviction without taking disciplinary action .
The nurse had been convicted of second - degree murder in 1974 after shooting his sister ’s abusive boyfriend four times , according to board records .
He was initially denied a license .
But the board granted him one in 1987 , finding him sufficiently rehabilitated , and placed him on three years ’ probation , which he completed successfully .
Of the 1,900 conviction reports sent to the board , about 1,300 have been closed without action because of the crime ’s age or nature .
The remaining ones await further investigation .
The board has taken disciplinary action against only one of the convicted licensees .
David Trower ’s license was suspended on an emergency basis after the board learned that he had been convicted four times of drunken driving between 1996 and 2008 .
An accusation to permanently revoke or restrict his license is pending .
Trower could not be located for comment .
The Times and ProPublica ’s review last year found more than 115 cases in which the state did not seek to discipline nurses until they had racked up three or more criminal convictions .
It also turned up cases in which nurses with felony records continued to have spotless licenses -- sometimes while behind bars .
Nurse Haydee Parungao , for example , was sentenced to nearly five years in federal prison after admitting in 2006 that she had bilked Medicare out of more than $ 3 million .
The board filed a formal accusation against her three years later .
The case is pending , but her license expired in November 2008 .
Other examples included an Orange County nurse who continued to renew his license for years even after he was imprisoned for attempted murder and a Redding nurse who racked up 14 convictions over a decade before the board caught up with her .
The charges included driving under the influence , driving with a suspended license and possession of a controlled substance .
Not all nurses convicted of crimes automatically lose their licenses .
Background checks
In 1990 , the board began requiring nurses applying for licenses to provide their fingerprints -- the first nursing board in the country to do so .
But nurses who already had their licenses at that time were not required to submit prints .
That group now numbers 138,500 .
As of Dec. 16 , nearly 64,000 nurses in that group had submitted prints .
More than 400 nurses ’ licenses have been put on hold because they have n’t complied with the new rule .
The rest have not yet renewed their licenses .
The background checks are part of the board ’s continuing overhaul of its operations following reports by ProPublica and The Times about lengthy delays in investigating and disciplining nurses accused of wrongdoing .
The newly discovered convictions are “ opportunities to do our job that we would n’t have had , ” said Paul Riches , deputy director for enforcement and compliance at the state Department of Consumer Affairs , which oversees all health licensing boards .
It ’s been “ a very positive thing , ” he said .
Effort expanded
The fingerprinting effort is being expanded to include all licensed health professionals in the state .
Until now each of the state ’s health regulatory agencies set its own rules about who had to submit prints .
Close to a third of the state ’s 937,100 licensed healthcare workers had not been screened as of December 2008 .
Even within the state , the rules were inconsistent for different groups of health professionals .
Boards overseeing these workers are at various stages of collecting fingerprints .
Riches said the process has been challenging for the nursing board , which is whittling away at a backlog and was forced to upgrade its databases to avoid entering every report manually .
“ With every large group of people , you ’re going to get a broad spectrum of behavior , ” he said .
“ The priority for us is dealing with it . ”

TSUCHIKURE , Japan -- Jeffrey Irish , a 48 - year - old American , is the unlikely village chief of Tsuchikure , a remote farming hamlet in Japan 's southern Kyushu island .
The tall , even - tempered Californian got the position because he satisfies the post 's main requirements :
He hears and sees well .
In Tsuchikure , where the average age is 77 ( if you do n't count him and his family ) , that makes Mr. Irish one of only three residents qualified for the job .
He spends his days keeping track of the physical and mental decline of the 24 elderly ...
Beginning in early 2001 we had a Salon Premium programme that involved gating off a very small amount of content on the site – maybe one or two pieces a day , out of a dozen or more original articles – and removing the ads for paying subscribers .
This programme was moderately successful in keeping some cash coming in the door for our company , which had seen advertising income plummet after the dotcom bust began kicking in in mid-late 2000 .
Immediately after 9/11 , the advertising revenue that was already low went , essentially , to zero .
Advertisers simply did n't want their ads next to coverage of 9/11 and related events , but that was what our readers wanted and our editors wanted to give them .
So we made a risky decision to gate off all our news content at the start of October .
Arts , tech , business coverage and other soft features were still available to all .
You can read David Talbot 's letter to readers explaining the move here .
It " worked " for us in that it provided some revenue for Salon to survive through the leanest period of its existence .
( We 'd already completed the latest of three rounds of layoffs , and the entire staff took pay cuts , three weeks before 9/11 . )
But within a few months , as advertisers began dipping their toes back in the water and the influx of new subscribers who'd flocked to help us out in a crisis dwindled , we could see that the subscription model did n't provide much room for growth .
So we tried something new : we put up an ad over the front door of the site .
Subscribers would n't see it at all ; other readers had to watch a 30 - second video ad , then they got a " day pass . "
The day pass approach was beloved by the advertisers and hated by many , though not all , readers .
More important , by this point the public was , understandably , thoroughly confused about how to get to read Salon content .
It took many years for our traffic to begin to grow again .
Paywalls are psychological as much as navigational , and it's a lot easier to put them up than to take them down .
Once web users get it in their head that your site is " closed " to them , if you ever change your mind and want them to come back , it 's extremely difficult to get that word out .
Salon was and is exclusively online ; magazines and papers have revenue from print or other offline products .
So they often find themselves in a position of balancing tradeoffs : if we do X online , we gain Y online revenue but we lose , or think we might lose , Z in offline revenue .
Salon did n't have those calculations – but then neither did we have the cushion of income from a declining but still substantial old - fashioned media business model .
I start with the assumption that internet - based media will gradually come to dominate news distribution and consumption over the next , say , quarter - century .
TV and print wo n't vanish but they will steadily lose readers , influence and revenue .
They ought to be using their " legacy " revenue to fund the expansion of their online presence and experiments ; instead , they seem today to be eager to squeeze their online operations for revenue to subsidize the old newsroom .
It 's the same kind of short - term thinking that has already allowed so many newcomers and interlopers to seize their readers and advertisers .
As for the question of how " niche " you need to be for a paywall to work – I think it 's pretty simple economics : if you have a product that is scarce , you can charge for it more easily .
Specialised information , information that people need to earn their livings and can't get elsewhere , and so on .
If there are free alternatives , you are not going to get very far , even with an edge in quality .
You can also make it work if you have a relatively low cost structure and a very loyal set of readers who have some commitment to your product as a cause .
Salon Premium , at its peak , brought in about $ 2 m ( £ 1.2 m ) annually , which really was quite an achievement .
We had the loyal reader base but our costs were way too high .
I 'm not hostile to the notion of people paying for online content .
I do so myself .
I 'm glad people stepped up and paid for Salon .
But the value of stuff online is usually tied to how deeply it is woven into the network .
So locking your stuff away in order to charge for it means that you are usually making it less valuable at the moment that you are asking people to pay for it .
And that 's why people so often respond with : " No thanks . "
In recent years , malware authors have developed increasingly sophisticated rootkits that burrow into the operating system itself , modifying basic filesystem and process management code in a way that ensures they are essentially invisible to anyone using the machine : no files visible , no processes apparent .
While some progress has been made in detecting when a rootkit has compromised a system , preemptively blocking an attack has remained challenging , since the malware relies on important system functions .
A team of computer scientists have now described a tool , called Hook Safe , that uses virtualization to preempt rootkits by moving and protecting the kernel functions that they target .
Rootkits burrow their way into an operating system 's kernel using a process called hooking .
The services provided by a kernel — file system and hardware access , memory management , etc. — are accessible through callable functions .
The kernel keeps track of where the functions reside in memory using pointers , which contain the address in memory of the function .
Hooking involves replacing a legitimate function pointer with one provided by malware .
So , for example , the malware might replace ( or hook ) a file system function with one that behaves perfectly normally except when it comes to the areas of the filesystem where the malware lives ; in that case , it returns information that suggests the files are n't there .
Any software that uses the kernel for filesystem access will never know the rootkit is present .
Obviously , the simplest way of blocking a rootkit would be to prohibit this process by marking kernel memory as read - only .
But there are two problems with this approach .
For starters , the ability to perform a kernel hook has many legitimate uses , such as when a new input device hooks into the portions of the kernel that handle mouse or keyboard input .
The other problem is that the function pointers are scattered around the kernel 's memory footprint , and are sometimes created and destroyed as the kernel creates new objects , like networking sockets .
Locking the entire kernel down as read - only would cripple the operating system .
( The authors call this problem the " protection granularity gap . "
It 's possible to lock down a page of memory that contains function pointers but , in doing so , you invariably lock down some dynamic data , which causes problems .
There is currently no technology that provides a fine enough granularity to lock down the parts of a memory page that contain the pointers . )
The authors tackle these two problems separately .
To identify legitimate kernel hooks , the authors run a clean version of the operating system ( in this case , Ubuntu 8.04 ) under a modified version of the QEMU emulator .
Their modified version of QEMU tracks all the kernel hooks that take place in the course of normal operations , and generates a unique signature for each of them .
That allows this activity to be recognized and allowed during normal operations .
They solve the granularity gap by creating a shadow copy of every kernel hook they 've identified , all collected in contiguous memory pages that can be marked as read - only and protected by a custom version of the Xen hypervisor .
Their original location in the kernel gets replaced by a jump statement that shifts execution to what they call a trampoline , which bounces execution to the safe shadow copy , and then returns it to the original execution point .
The variable - sized x86 instructions make this a bit more challenging than it might otherwise be , but the authors manage to compensate .
If the hook is used simply to execute the function , everything should take place as normal .
If it 's used to replace the hook , the protected memory page invokes the Xen hypervisor .
Their modified version checks the signature of the action , comparing it against the list generated when the kernel ran under QEMU .
If the activity is recognized , it 's allowed to go forward .
If not , the shadow copy of kernel hooks is kept unmodified .
The authors solved a number of other potential problems in their paper .
For example , they block writing to hardware registers , and limit Direct Memory Access transfers to kernel space .
Hooks in dynamically allocated kernel objects are tracked using a modified version of the kernel 's memory allocator .
The fact that the system only becomes active after the kernel is loaded into memory is solved by identifying a few key kernel globals , and walking the memory tree below them .
How does it all work ?
The authors tested a variety of Linux rootkits , and found that all of them failed on a system protected by Hook Safe , some being unable to infect the target machine , the rest remaining visible to a user after infection .
For a variety of typical processes , the overhead of the system was negligible .
The worst performance occurred when unzipping a file or using the Apache webserver under heavy load .
Both of these require the allocation of lots of memory within the kernel , which invoked some of the authors ' code in addition to the normal allocation routines .
Still , the worst case was only a six percent performance hit .
The biggest potential problem here , which is recognized by the authors , is that their database of acceptable hooks will end up being incomplete .
This is already a problem in the lab , but could be a nightmare in the real world , where software updates and new drivers may appear on a monthly basis .
Still , it 's easy to envision systems that update the profile of legitimate hooks as part of a software update process , or provides users with the opportunity to approve changes .
A paper describing Hook Safe will be presented at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security .

The highest - ranking woman in the Concord Police Department has sued the city , saying she is being harassed and discriminated against because of her gender .
Lt. Robin Heinemann , a 21 - year department veteran , said in her suit in Contra Costa County Superior Court that she and other female officers are powerless in a " de facto hierarchy " that is based upon a " presumption of male supremacy . "
Concord 's Police Department is " rife with overt hostility and disparate treatment toward female officers , " said the suit , which Heineman filed Wednesday .
Heinemann was promoted to lieutenant in 2001 , two years after the city paid $ 1.25 million to settle a previous sexual - discrimination lawsuit in which she and other current or former female officers were plaintiffs .
Nevertheless , " she has not been permitted to exercise the powers and privileges of her rank to the same extent as male supervisors , " the suit said .
Instead , Heinemann was the target of " trumped - up " internal - affairs investigations alleging she was dishonest and disrespectful to superiors , while male officers who were accused of wrongdoing went unpunished , especially if they were friends of Chief David Livingston and Capt .
Dan Siri , the suit said .
Siri forced Heinemann to write unnecessary memos describing what she would do to carry out certain assignments , which she found demeaning because no male officers were asked to prepare such memos , the suit said .
If Heinemann is being treated this way , " there is really cause for great concern as to how all police officers are treated in this department , " said her attorney , Stan Casper of Walnut Creek .
The suit seeks unspecified damages and names the city , Siri and Livingston as defendants .
The city has not responded to the suit in court .
Livingston is running to replace Warren Rupf as Contra Costa County 's sheriff in 2011 .
Rupf , who is retiring , has endorsed him .
The complaint is the latest in a spate of discrimination lawsuits filed against the city .
In July , Officer Lisa Capocci filed a sexual - harassment suit claiming she had been retaliated against for complaining about comments made by a supervisor , including " I love you " messages on her police - cruiser computer .
Her suit is pending .
For the past few months Guinea has been ruled by a young army captain who led a successful coup .
Not that you 'd necessarily know about it : the regime has only hit the world news twice .
The first time was for shooting 150 pro-democracy demonstrators : international protest at this abuse has now escalated into an arms embargo .
The second time was when the regime signed a $ 7bn resource - extraction deal with the Chinese .
This infusion of money has made a mockery of international pressure .
But to grasp the deeper affront , the sheer scale of the deal must be appreciated .
Guinea is currently a no - go area for reputable resource - extraction companies and so the Chinese faced no competition .
If under these conditions they are prepared to pay $ 7bn for the rights to resource extraction , it is reasonable to suppose that they are worth much more .
Yet the national income of Guinea is only $ 3bn .
These natural assets , vast relative to its income , were the society 's lifeline out of poverty .
They have been disposed of in haste by a regime without legitimacy .
Guinea is an extreme instance , but the disregard of the Chinese for standards of governance in winning resource - extraction contracts has become a leitmotif .
The result has been not only a scramble for Africa , but a race back to the bottom .
After decades of shaming behaviour , by the Millennium the major resource - extraction companies of the OECD were being pressured into decency .
New legislation across the OECD ensured that if they bribed , they committed a criminal offence within their home country .
They became subject to scrutiny from NGOs .
New awareness among young people ensured that employees expected their companies to behave in a socially responsible manner .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative ( EITI ) , launched in 2003 , rapidly gained over 30 signatories from governments and companies committed to transparent reporting of their activities .
China is not party to the EITI and so has a massive competitive advantage over firms constrained by honesty .
Yet Chinese involvement in African resource extraction can be a force for good .
They have provided a welcome infusion of competition , raising prices for African resources and reducing prices for the construction projects on which many Chinese firms now bid .
The Chinese innovation of offering a package of infrastructure in return for extraction rights can also be socially useful .
It ensures that the natural assets are replaced by some other asset instead of being used exclusively for consumption .
Resource extraction in Africa has been problematic because of the way in which the rights to extract natural resources have been sold , and because African governments have not been sufficiently accountable to their citizens .
Wherever rights are sold through secret bilateral negotiations , the outcome is suspect due to problems of agency and asymmetric information .
The agency problem is that the citizens who are the rightful owners of the rights to natural assets cannot adequately control their political representatives who conduct the negotiation .
The information problem is that companies know far better than governments what extraction rights are worth .
There is a simple solution to these problems : auctions between informed bidders , properly verified , are not subject to corruption and reveal fair value .
Addressing the lack of accountability of government to citizen is more difficult .
Elections are not enough : typically in resource - rich countries they work very badly as politicians divert resource revenues to finance the patronage systems that keep them in power .
Citizens need to understand the chain of decisions involved in harnessing natural assets for development .
New technology has made the information problem less daunting .
Historically , Africa 's natural resources have been plundered .
The few have stolen from the many , and the present has stolen from the future .
The foreign companies and governments that extract Africa 's resources in circumstances in which the revenues are unlikely to benefit ordinary people , alive and to come , connive at plunder .
By any reasonable assessment that is what the Chinese have done in Guinea .
In all African societies there are brave people struggling for change : 150 of them were just murdered in Guinea .
The international community has a responsibility to ensure that their bravery is not in vain .
Paul Collier , CBE is director for the study of African economies at Oxford University
Hero US Airways pilot Chesley Sullenberger of Danville told “ NBC ’s People of the Year ” that he has enjoyed ” rock - star sex ” since safely landing his crippled jet with 155 on board in the Hudson River .
“ He does n’t know I ’m going to say this , but I had joked the other day that … the hero sex really helps a 20 - year - old marriage , ” Sullenberger ’s wife Lorrie said during the interview , which is scheduled to air Thursday .
“ Rock star sex , ” Sully then said , according to a report on nbcnewyork.com .
Sullenberger became a national hero after safely landing the plane , which had hit geese shortly after takeoff from LaGuardia airport .
Everyone on board escaped safely .
Other “ People of the Year ” featured in the special hosted by Matt Lauer are Taylor Swift , “ Octomom ’ Nadya Suleman , Susan Boyle and Kobe Bryant .
The show is scheduled to air at 9 p.m. EST Thursday on NBC .
Sorry for the horrible subject line .... but I would really like to know how others cope with the other women that play wow , and by other women I mean the ones that use the fact that they are female , use photos and the promise of god - knows - what in order to advance themselves ?
Am I the only one who this annoys and frustrates ?
Last night , I was happily chatting and hanging out with my boyfriend and his friends on vent when I went afk for a few minutes .
I came back and they were talking about this new girl in our guild who exchanged naked photos of herself with one of the guys ( a core raider ) for gold , crusader orbs etc etc .
He had put the image links as his vent comment .
I let out a squawk of indignation and they all went silent and a bit sheepish .
The guy who gave her the wow stuff in exchange for her pictures mumbled something and then logged off , whereby I lectured them all about it for a few minutes .
Apparently they did n't want me to know as they thought I would be " upset " .
Now , the guy who ' bought ' the pictures is all of 17 , this girl is about the same age , so yeah I know they are just silly kids but I 'm offended both as a wow player and as a woman .
I 'm also concerned about this girls underage explicit photos , which is illegal in Australia .
I'm offended that women are using themselves to get ahead like that in the game , I 'm offended that my boyfriend and others thought it was funny and I " m offended that this guy then thought it was ok to DISTRIBUTE these images after receiving them .
I feel some sympathy for her now that pretty much everyone in our guild and server knows about her , however , I want to kinda slap her upside her head for putting herself in that position to begin with .
This is not the first time I 've seen this happen on my server , a wow friend of mine ( no longer clearly ) once offered to send my boyfriend photos of her breasts and have cyber - sex with him in order to secure a raid invite .
How does everyone else cope with this ?
Just ignore it ?
Has anyone ever exchanged photos or msn contact details or whatever in order to get something ?
I had a further talk with my boyfriend about it this morning and he pointed out that just by being women on this game we get things that other guys do n't .
He asked me if I had honestly never used the fact that i'm a ' girl irl ' to get ahead or to get something .... and you know what ?
I suppose I have .
I 've never gone to the extent where I gave away online sexual favours or photos but I 've let guys who I know have had online crushes on me help me out - give me relics of ulduar , farm some herbs or something for me etc .
Am I just as bad as these other girls ? .

A Times Square bloodbath was narrowly avoided because the machine - pistol - toting thug who fired at a cop flipped the gun on its side like a character out of a rap video , causing the weapon to jam after two shots , law - enforcement sources said yesterday .
When scam artist Raymond “ Ready ” Martinez held the MAC - 10 - style gun parallel to the ground , it caused the ejecting shells to “ stovepipe , ” or get caught vertically in the chamber , the sources said .
The gun is designed to be fired only in a vertical position .
If he had fired the weapon — which had another 27 rounds in the clip — properly , Martinez , 25 , could have killed the hero cop pursuing him and countless others walking through the swarming tourist mecca Thursday morning .
Instead , Sgt. Christopher Newsom was able to return fire — killing Martinez with four shots before anyone was hurt .
The fatal gun battle erupted after Martinez bolted from cops who approached him for aggressively peddling his own rap CDs to tourists and shaking them down for cash .
Newsom gave chase and shouted for Martinez to put up his hands .
Martinez instead pulled the machine gun from a sling under his coat and turned to fire as he ran into the parking breezeway within the Marriott Marquis Hotel .
One of the shots shattered a gift - shop window and a second struck the car of an out - of - town couple coming to see the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall .
In rap songs on his Web page , Martinez boasted of taking aim at a police sergeant .
“ If they call the cops , then I ’m aiming at the sergeant , like aiming at my target , ” said Martinez , who raps under the name “ Ready . ”
“ And sure that f- – - ing dirty pig will feel it the hardest . ”
But the boast was empty as Newsom ’s better training bested Martinez ’s drummed - up bravado .
In the end , Martinez unwittingly rapped about his own fate .
“ Tell forensics to bring the chalk , ” he said , describing the outline that detectives draw around a body on the street .
Investigators are still trying to figure out where Martinez — who had a warrant for failing to show in court on charges he beat his wife — got the high - powered Masterpiece Arms - built weapon .
The gun had been stolen from its owner , a woman named Jordan Kelsey - Stewart , 25 , who bought it from Dale ’s Guns in Powhatan , Va. , on Oct. 18 , sources said .
It was stolen from Kelsey - Stewart ’s car on Oct. 28 in Richmond , Va .
What happened next is unclear , but the feds want to talk to her to see if she had any connection to the shooter .
A business card of the gun shop was found on Martinez .
Meanwhile , cops found another gun at his house last night , a . 22 - caliber revolver .

Abstracts and Bios of Speakers
Banner CNN day : Wolf Blitzer apparently really distinguished himself yesterday by asking Nidal Hasan 's military lawyer , retired Colonel John Galligan , how on earth he could do such a thing :
A lot of folks , when they heard I was interviewing you , they asked me how could a retired U.S. military officer , a full colonel , go ahead and represent someone accused of mass murder ?
And I want you to explain to our viewers why you 're doing this .
GALLIGAN : Wolf , I will tell you what I have told consistently anyone who asks that same question , and that is as a military -- former military JAG officer , former military judge , former prosecutor , former defense counsel , and now currently actively involved , also , in the civilian practice of criminal defense work , I fully appreciate the importance of ensuring that everybody has a fair trial .
I think that 's particularly important when it applies to anyone in uniform , officer or enlisted ....
... I also tell people that I 'm a firm believer in the military justice process .
Sadly , because so few people do serve in the U.S. Army and sister services today , there 's an increasing -- a diminishing number of people who really understand the military justice system .
If properly applied , it can ensure that an individual has a fair and just hearing .
If allowed to run its course , without being perverted along the way , I 'm confident that most people will say we arrived , at the end of the day , with a fair , impartial and just result .
My purpose in representing the major is to ensure that we keep the military justice procedures on track .
I 've told people it 's a great system if it works right , but it 's a system that , if you have problems in it or difficulties along the way , be careful , get out of the way ...
... BLITZER : I 'm sure he will get a much fairer hearing than those 13 Americans who were brutally gunned down the other day .
I 'm sure he will get all of the rights that are applied by the U.S. Military Code of Justice .
Thank you .
GALLIGAN : Well -- OK , thank you .
Thank you very much .
BLITZER : All right .
Go ahead .
If you want to say anything else , go ahead .
GALLIGAN : No , I -- it 's -- the difficulty that I have , of course , is when people , in discussions with me , with references like the one that you just made , in the criminal justice field we often are dealing with victims .
The annual Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival has been held since 1963 .
It had been interrupted for a number of years during the Cultural Revolution until it was resumed in 1985 .
Harbin , the capital of Heilongjiang province of People ’s Republic of China , is one of the sources of ice and snow culture in the world .
Geographically , it is located in Northeast China under the direct influence of the cold winter wind from Siberia .
The average temperature in summer is 21.2 degrees Celsius , - 16.8 degrees Celsius in winter .
It can be as cold as – 38.1 degrees Celsius in winter .
Officially , the festival starts from January 5th and it lasts one month .
However often the exhibitions open earlier and last longer , weather permitting .
Ice sculpture decoration ranges from the modern technology of lasers to traditional ice lanterns .
There are ice lantern park touring activities held in many parks in the city .
Winter activities in the festival include Yabuli alpine skiing , winter - swimming in Songhua River , and the ice - lantern exhibition in Zhaolin Garden .
Snow carving and ice and snow recreations are world famous .
We Recommend :
It is not your job to do what the generals tell you to do .
We are a civilian - run government .
WE tell the Joint Chiefs what to do , not the other way around .
That 's the way General Washington insisted it must be .
That 's what President Truman told General MacArthur when MacArthur wanted to invade China .
" You 're fired ! , " said Truman , and that was that .
And you should have fired Gen. McChrystal when he went to the press to preempt you , telling the press what YOU had to do .
Let me be blunt :
We love our kids in the armed services , but we f*#&in ' hate these generals , from Westmoreland in Vietnam to , yes , even Colin Powell for lying to the UN with his made - up drawings of WMD ( he has since sought redemption ) .
So now you feel backed into a corner .
30 years ago this past Thursday ( Thanksgiving ) the Soviet generals had a cool idea -- " Let 's invade Afghanistan ! "
Well , that turned out to be the final nail in the USSR coffin .
There 's a reason they do n't call Afghanistan the " Garden State " ( though they probably should , seeing how the corrupt President Karzai , whom we back , has his brother in the heroin trade raising poppies ) .
Afghanistan 's nickname is the " Graveyard of Empires . "
If you do n't believe it , give the British a call .
I 'd have you call Genghis Khan but I lost his number .
I do have Gorbachev 's number though .
It 's + 41 22 789 1662 .
I 'm sure he could give you an earful about the historic blunder you 're about to commit .
With our economic collapse still in full swing and our precious young men and women being sacrificed on the altar of arrogance and greed , the breakdown of this great civilization we call America will head , full throttle , into oblivion if you become the " war president . "
Empires never think the end is near , until the end is here .
Empires think that more evil will force the heathens to toe the line -- and yet it never works .
The heathens usually tear them to shreds .
Choose carefully , President Obama .
You of all people know that it does n't have to be this way .
You still have a few hours to listen to your heart , and your own clear thinking .
You know that nothing good can come from sending more troops halfway around the world to a place neither you nor they understand , to achieve an objective that neither you nor they understand , in a country that does not want us there .
You can feel it in your bones .
I know you know that there are LESS than a hundred al - Qaeda left in Afghanistan !
A hundred thousand troops trying to crush a hundred guys living in caves ?
Are you serious ?
Have you drunk Bush 's Kool - Aid ?
I refuse to believe it .
Your potential decision to expand the war ( while saying that you 're doing it so you can " end the war " ) will do more to set your legacy in stone than any of the great things you 've said and done in your first year .
One more throwing a bone from you to the Republicans and the coalition of the hopeful and the hopeless may be gone -- and this nation will be back in the hands of the haters quicker than you can shout " tea bag ! "
Choose carefully , Mr. President .
Your corporate backers are going to abandon you as soon as it is clear you are a one - term president and that the nation will be safely back in the hands of the usual idiots who do their bidding .
That could be Wednesday morning .
We the people still love you .
We the people still have a sliver of hope .
But we the people can't take it anymore .
We can't take your caving in , over and over , when we elected you by a big , wide margin of millions to get in there and get the job done .
What part of " landslide victory " do n't you understand ?
Do n't be deceived into thinking that sending a few more troops into Afghanistan will make a difference , or earn you the respect of the haters .
They will not stop until this country is torn asunder and every last dollar is extracted from the poor and soon - to - be poor .
You could send a million troops over there and the crazy Right still would n't be happy .
You would still be the victim of their incessant venom on hate radio and television because no matter what you do , you can't change the one thing about yourself that sends them over the edge .
The haters were not the ones who elected you , and they can't be won over by abandoning the rest of us .
President Obama , it 's time to come home .
Ask your neighbors in Chicago and the parents of the young men and women doing the fighting and dying if they want more billions and more troops sent to Afghanistan .
Do you think they will say , " No , we do n't need health care , we do n't need jobs , we do n't need homes .
You go on ahead , Mr. President , and send our wealth and our sons and daughters overseas , ' cause we do n't need them , either . "
What would Martin Luther King , Jr. do ?
What would your grandmother do ?
Not send more poor people to kill other poor people who pose no threat to them , that 's what they 'd do .
Not spend billions and trillions to wage war while American children are sleeping on the streets and standing in bread lines .
All of us that voted and prayed for you and cried the night of your victory have endured an Orwellian hell of eight years of crimes committed in our name : torture , rendition , suspension of the bill of rights , invading nations who had not attacked us , blowing up neighborhoods that Saddam " might " be in ( but never was ) , slaughtering wedding parties in Afghanistan .
We watched as hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians were slaughtered and tens of thousands of our brave young men and women were killed , maimed , or endured mental anguish -- the full terror of which we scarcely know .
When we elected you we did n't expect miracles .
We did n't even expect much change .
But we expected some .
We thought you would stop the madness .
Stop the killing .
Stop the insane idea that men with guns can reorganize a nation that does n't even function as a nation and never , ever has .
Stop , stop , stop !
For the sake of the lives of young Americans and Afghan civilians , stop .
For the sake of your presidency , hope , and the future of our nation , stop .
For God 's sake , stop .
Tonight we still have hope .
Tomorrow , we shall see .
The ball is in your court .
You DON 'T have to do this .
You can be a profile in courage .
You can be your mother 's son .
We 're counting on you .
Yours ,
Michael Moore

The failed attempt at a terrorist attack in Detroit over the weekend has caused Republicans to revive their claims that Democrats are weak on national security .
On CNN ’s State of the Union today Mary Matalin claimed that George W. Bush inherited 9/11 from Bill Clinton , even though 9/11 happened 8 months after Bush took office .
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :
Matalin said , “ I was there , we inherited a recession from President Clinton and we inherited the most tragic attack on our own soil in our nation ’s history .
And President Bush dealt with it and within a year of his presidency within a comparable time , unemployment was at 5 percent . ”
Advertisements
Of course , this is n’t the first time that has former member of the Bush / Cheney team has distorted the 9/11 timeline .
Last month former Bush press secretary Dana Perino claimed that the U.S. did not suffer a terrorist attack during the Bush presidency .
Here is the video of Perino ’s November 24 appearance on FNC ’s Hannity :
Perino said , “ They want to do all of their investigations .
I do n’t know .
All of the thinking that goes into it .
But we did not have a terrorist attack on our country during President Bush ’s term .
I hope they ’re not looking at this politically .
I do think we ought it to the American people to call it what it is . ”
Of course this absurd because George W. Bush took office in January of 2001 , and the 9/11 attacks occurred on September 11 , 2001 , months after George W. Bush took office .
Anyone who knows how to use a calendar understands that September comes after January .
The motivation for both Matalin and Perino to tell such obvious lies is simple .
They are trying to reclaim the post 9/11 “ glory days ” of the Republican Party .
The objective is to convince the American people that only Republicans can keep them safe , and when a historical fact like the date of 9/11 challenges their claims , then they rewrite history to blame Bill Clinton for 9/11 .
The Republicans are still treating the American people like they are complete idiots .
Everyone knows that Bush was president during 9/11 .
Their pathetic attempt to change the facts should be an insult to every American .
This latest great lie of the right is a shallow attempt to revive the politics of fear that carried the GOP to victory in 2002 and 2004 .
South Waziristan Taliban leader Mullah Nazir .
Click to view .
Forces under the command of a leader considered to be one of the “ good Taliban ” by the Pakistani military destroyed an Afghan Army camp .
Taliban forces commanded by Mullah Nazir blew up an the Afghan Army base , which was just across the border from the Angoor Adda region in Pakistan .
The region is under the control of Nazir , a Pakistani Taliban commander .
“ Sources said the Taliban planted explosives all over the base and blew it up , destroying bunkers and installations , ” Dawn reported .
The based was destroyed after “ a contingent stationed there moved out of the fortified compound . ”
The Taliban and “ a group of tribesmen ” then looted the base .
The destruction of the Afghan base by Nazir ’s forces follows the Dec. 6 attack on a Pakistani Army checkpoint at a bridge in Wana , the main town in South Waziristan , which is also under the control of Nazir .
The attack resulted in one one soldier killed .
The Taliban suffered six of their own killed after the Pakistani Army counterattacked .
The military did not take further actions against Nazir .
Pakistan ’s military and intelligence services consider Nazir and his followers “ good Taliban ” as they do not openly seek the overthrow of the Pakistani state .
However , Nazir openly supports Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden , and wages jihad in Afghanistan ; more senior al Qaeda leaders have been killed in Nazir ’s tribal areas during the US air campaign than in those of any other Taliban leader in Pakistan .
Earlier this year , just prior to launching a military operation against the Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan in the Mehsud tribal areas in South Waziristan , the military agreed to a peace deal with Nazir as well as with North Waziristan Taliban commander Hafiz Gul Bahadar .
Nazir and Bahadar are not members of the Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan .
Bahadar and the Haqqani Network , which is also based in North Waziristan , are also considered “ good ” Taliban by the Pakistani government and military .
The peace agreement allows for the Pakistani military to move through Nazir and Bahadar ’s tribal areas without being attacked .
Another condition of the agreement prohibits Bahadar and Nazir from providing shelter to fleeing members of the Mehsud branch of the Taliban .
But Taliban fighters from the Mehsud tribal areas have sought shelter with Mullah Nazir in the Wazir tribal areas , and the rearguard fighters still opposing the Army ’s advance are receiving support from Nazir ’s forces , US military and intelligence officials have told The Long War Journal .
Bahadar and the Haqqanis are also providing shelter to fleeing Taliban fighters and covert support to the Mehsud Taliban , and they also shelter al Qaeda leaders and fighters .
The covert US air campaign in Pakistan ’s tribal areas has zeroed in on North Waziristan .
Since the Aug. 5 strike that killed Baitullah Mehsud , the former leader of the Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan , 14 of the 18 reported airstrikes have taken place in North Waziristan .
And nine of those 14 attacks in North Waziristan occurred in territory administered by the Haqqani Network .

RSS and BitTorrent are a great match , but despite the good fit between the two technologies there is no standardized format for BitTorrent feeds .
Much to the surprise of many torrent site owners , RSS inventor Dave Winer has offered a helping hand to fix this problem .
For those not familiar with the term , RSS is an acronym for ‘ Really Simple Syndication ’ .
It ’s a really convenient mechanism which allows you to receive regular automated updates from your favorite sites .
Most news sites have RSS feeds that let you automatically receive updates when a new article is published .
Similarly , most BitTorrent sites also publish RSS feeds for their content , allowing users to download or receive notifications on new torrents without having to search for files manually .
Most of the popular torrent clients support RSS downloading which works well with the RSS feeds produced by most torrent sites .
However , nearly every site uses a slightly different format which does n’t do the usability of the RSS feeds much good .
Dave Winer , the original designer of RSS , has noticed this ‘ mess ’ as well and has opted to change it .
Although Winer saw BitTorrent winning at the 2003 Wired Awards where RSS was also nominated , he does n’t hold a grudge against the popular file - sharing protocol .
“ After Mininova shut down their main service , I decided to look into how BitTorrent might be better decentralized , ” Winer told Torrent Freak .
‘ One of the keys to that will be to improve the RSS the various sites produce .
It ’s pretty much a mess , but that ’s understandable because there have always been good search engines to do the centralization .
Now that that ’s in doubt , let ’s clean it up , ” Winer added .
To help BitTorrent ’s move forward , Winer started by reviewing the RSS output produced by a few torrent sites and wrote up some comments and suggestions on how the various implementations can be improved .
His writing was soon picked up by is oHunt ’s Gary Fung and EZTV ’s NovaKing , who have already implemented some of Winer ’s suggestions and started discussing a more standardized RSS output , as well as a BitTorrent RSS namespace .
Although the technicalities may not be of interest to most users , everyone who uses RSS feeds on BitTorrent sites will eventually benefit from standardization .
Winer encourages torrent site and application developers to join the discussion , add comments and come up with suggestions .

During the last few months , our team has been working hard to support extensions in Google Chrome 's beta channel .
Today , we are getting one step closer to this goal ; developers can now upload their extensions to Google Chrome 's extension gallery .
We are making the upload flow available early to make sure that developers have the time to publish their extensions ahead of our full launch .
You can find all the info to write an extension in our docs .
Once your extension is ready for the gallery , you 'll need to upload a zip file of your code and an icon that helps users distinguish your extension .
You 'll also have the option to submit text , screenshots and / or YouTube videos that describe the functionality of your extension .
All types of extensions are welcome in the gallery , provided they comply with our Terms of Service
For most extensions , the review process is fully automated .
The only extensions we 'll review manually are those that include an NPAPI component and all content scripts that affect " file : / / " URLs .
For security reasons , developers of these types of extensions will need to provide some additional information before they can post them in the gallery .
Once an extension is uploaded , our gallery takes care of packaging and signing .
Updating an extension is also incredibly easy — all a developer needs to do is to upload a new file in the gallery .
Finally , to further help developers , in the next few days , we plan to open up the gallery to a small group of trusted testers .
They will provide developers with insights and bug reports that will help them polish their extensions ahead of our beta launch .
We can't wait to share all the great extensions that you 'll submit with all of Google Chrome 's users .
In the meantime , we encourage you to submit any bugs you find in the upload process to our Issue Tracker and to ask all relevant questions in our discussion group

A Lancashire police worker has been sacked for being a member of the British National Party ( BNP ) .
The civilian staff member was suspended a year ago when his name was found on a list of party members by a professional standards review team .
A police spokesman said membership of the BNP " conflicts with our duty to promote equality " .
The worker was based at the force 's Eastern Division , covering Ribble Valley , Longridge and Clitheroe .
The man was suspended in November 2008 and an investigation started .
The worker 's contract has now been terminated , a spokeswoman said .
" Membership or promotion of the BNP by any member of the police service , whether police officer or police staff , is prohibited as it conflicts with our duty to promote equality , " she added .
Date : 21st November 2009 Stern Pinball
Inc has a new investor and partner who hopes to turn the business around and halt the decline in sales over recent years .
Dave Peterson of merchant bank and private equity investment firm Hagerty Peterson and Company is the new partner in the business and is believed to be working on a fresh business plan to improve the company 's fortunes .
Gary Stern remains the primary owner of the Stern Pinball and continues as its President and CEO .
The Stern Pinball factory A new Director of Marketing , Jody Dankberg has been brought in to the company to work with Dave and he has already been hitting the phones to find out what various customers want from the pinball manufacturer .
In addition , a questionnaire has been set up and customers who entered their details on the Stern website have been requested to give their thoughts about Stern products .
Barrington , IL - based Hagerty Peterson invests in companies it believes can benefit from its management expertise to give them a new direction and grow the value of the business .
It also provides additional capital to help achieve that and has invested in a diverse range of companies from medical records , through customer loyalty schemes and even jewelry stores .
Stern Pinball is a new direction for Dave Peterson , though he is unlikely to invest in the company unless he thought it had the potential to be turned around .
Not all of Stern 's problems have been of its own making , however .
Without a reversal in the fortunes of the whole coin - op amusement sector - which the company has long held to be its core market - a change in focus , combined with changes to the product and an improved marketing push could be ways to secure the future of the business and bring that all - important growth .
One immediate sign of better marketing appeared on YouTube last week when Stern released three promotional videos of their most recent models - NBA , CSI and Batman .
Stern 's new promotional videos on YouTube
The 1 minute 45 second promos feature in Stern Pinball 's own YouTube Channel , suggesting they intend to create more such commercials for future pinball products .
So expect some changes and some new ideas coming out of the Melrose Park company over the next few months .
We will , of course , bring you all the latest developments - first and free - here at Pinball News .
We asked for your comments and they are published below .
Comments for this article are now closed .
53 comments : Spike :
Thank 's encouraging news .
I saw the YouTube vids the day they were posted , and it's a massive improvement on the laughable ' promotional ' flyers which seemed to be the only promotional item Stern used to flog a £ 4,500 pinball machine .
Great if you wanted the dimensions - do they ever change with Sterns ?
I know they do n't do widebodies :-)
Nick M :
Good work Stern , it seems Gary is n't as insular as people think .
He 's taken on board someone 's comments in order to get this guy in .
New investment might equal new ideas and new markets .
Obviously Dave Peterson sees something worthwhile and he 's obviously good at what he does ( well I hope he is !!!)
Hopefully getting software as finished as possible prior to release of a game will be one of his main things :o) Ping :
I heard this news already , just was n't sure of who it was that had invested .
I think this is a great way forward , lets face it , its forward and optionally bang with a new ideas company or slow death the way its currently going .
Great to see the new games they will make in future !
EricPinball :
Great news .
Thanks for the information .
Ndiniz :
I do n't know what anyone else thinks , but this is great news !
Stern needs to make more new pinball machines , and I think it 's great that there 's a new director of marketing .
I 've been a big fan of Stern since I played their Casino pinball machine .
Ca n't remember the name though .
I thought it was quite incredible of them to come out with Monopoly !
( Love what happens if you get a match on that machine at the end of the game ! )
Pinball is a dying art , and Stern pinball is what keeps this wonderful object alive & living !
Pingeek :
Thanks as always for keeping the pinball community up to date .
Regarding the promos , I think it 's a step in the right direction .
JackTaddeo :
Whatever Gary does , it 'll be good for the business because right now he IS the pinball business .
Perhaps more direct - to - consumer sales and marketing is in order .
Jay Richardson Pinball Inc. :
This is great news .
Changes that need to be made .
1 . Game code properly finished as mentioned above .
Games that could have been great have failed because of unfinished code .
2 . LCD or Plasma color display .
Time for the Dot Matrix to go .
It 's been around since 1992 .
This would compete with today 's video game market graphics .
3 . Information released with brochures and promo videos before the game comes out .
4 . Two - sided brochures again with more details .
Proper detailed game manuals again like Indiana Jones , Batman etc. 2009 manuals are bad .
5 . Listen to the ideas of operators and people who have been in the business many years .
6 . Change the distributor plan .
Allow smaller companies to buy from STERN .
Note : Some distributors do n't have a vested interest in pinball like others .
Hooked :
Internet hype will draw crowds and press releases will keep them on the line , but we need some great pins to turn it around .
As VanHagar once sang " come on baby finish what you started " ... finish the code in the production games that continue to sell ( TDK ) .
Would rather see 2 - 3 finished games released than 4 incomplete .
People will buy and pay to play great games .
New investors with a passion for the hobby will be a huge step in the right direction .
TBK :
This is fantastic news and should ward off the " Pinball is dead ! " cries for a while .
The new videos are a big step in the right direction .
Perhaps they could partner with the Elwin brothers and include Pinball 101 DVDs with each pin as an added value feature .
The future of pinball seems a little brighter with this news - let 's hope Peterson has some viable answers and methodology for turning Stern into the company it once was in its glory days !
Pinball Wizard :
I do think Stern should be careful about where they source help from .
Apple almost went bankrupt after pulling in John Sculley .
The person may know business but they really need to know the industry .
John Sculley knew how to run business but did n't know the computer market and after 10 years in the company almost sunk it .
It is true that this new guy is n't running business but there will always be the scary thought in my mind .
I do indeed hope this turns stern around , I also hope the learn to come out with an UNLICENSED title not all these licenses .
Pinball Gary :
That is good news about Stern Pinball we operaters need a pinball mfg .
They build a good reliable product .
Not every title is a great earner but we take our chances .
Our locations need pinball , ask for it and we set minimins of collections .
A clean good working pinball will earn money not as much today but it will come back , I hope .
SingleDutch :
Pinball Wizard already mentioned unlicensed games for a change .
I do agree .
But if Gary want licensed games he should pick them for the better .
If you want the youngsters to get into pinball pick a license they do like .
Not one ( like e.g. CSI ) where DAD is watching TV for and not the children .
It 's still a guess what will happen but at least something is happening .
Can only hope for the best .
I 'm shure Martin ( and I ) will ask Gary about more details during his visit to London in January .
Lee :
Made in China ?
Kevin @ Strictly Pinball :
I had heard that this was in the making for some time and here it is .
I think it 's about time that they tried a new approach .
I bought my first new Stern , a NASCAR four years ago and at that time I was surprised to find they were still in business .
It 's sure a struggle on the street to operate pinball these days .
I 've got 11 pins on location and another 27 assorted video games out there and the pin earnings are soft compared to most video games .
I started my own local pinball league this year to try and get more play out of my pinballs on location and it does n't hurt that I love to play too ... I wish and hope for the best with Stern .
Svengooli7 :
Have a City Themed game , like Chicago , with some Blues songs .
I agree , 2 - 3 complete games are far better than 4 incomplete games .
Alot of Evangelical churches have youth groups as do many other Christian denominations .
Keep it Scriptural , not religious and pitch out that idea amongst the faithful , this is a country Under God .
Tails :
This is great news for a community that is getting far too accustomed to bad news .
This idea has some potential , but there are great flaws with this -
The first problem being the economic and entertainment climate .
I understand that this company only invests in companies that it believes can be turned around , but coin - op is such a tough business these days .
There need to be a lot of changes to the design of machines , from physical design to software .
Better materials need to be used .
I 've played two different NBA machines , one of which was on location right after it was purchased , and it was covered in rubber dirt .
If they could use better materials , it would make a pinball machine a better investment for those unwilling to deal with the hassles of a pinball machine .
If Gary Stern can see the importance in completing software for machines before they 're released , then there is potential .
If they can institute some simple technologies that Williams / Bally were employing forever , then there is potential .
An example of this would be switch compensation :
Why does it not exist ?
I 've never owned a Stern , so for all I know it could have this built into the software , but after 1,000s of hours playing on location , it seems to be a forgotten feature .
That 's a simple way to make a machine more reliable .
What happened to non-licensed themes ?
This could drop the cost of a machine considerably , the savings of which could be reallocated to design , software , materials , etc .
If we are forced to play licensed machines from here on out , why not something more accessible to a wider audience .
CSI , 24 , and Big Buck Hunter are not as popular as Stern seems to think , and if you 're relying on a theme to generate revenue , why would you want something that 's not attractive and accessible ?
Star Trek , Star Wars , Nintendo , Disney movies , Pixar movies , James Bond -
These all have a broad appeal , and while some have been done , it will still be played and / or collected .
Furthermore , pinball needs to stay relevant in the 21st century .
A good friend and I were having a conversation about the future pinball , and he brought up the idea that pinball has always tried to stay relevant with pop culture , and now it needs to keep up technologically .
The idea of replacing the DMD is good , but cost is too high .
Why not have Internet capability for a global leader board ( NuCore , XBox Live , PSN , etc. ) ?
How about an iPod Dock and headphone jack if someone wanted their own music to play behind the sound effects ?
Instead of licensing themes , why not license the PB2 K system from WMS Industries ?
Why not rethink the overall design of the machine ?
Does every cabinet have to be exactly the same ?
Here 's a random idea that is terrible , but demonstrates what I mean : Let 's make a " 1984 " pinball machine , and in addition to the DMD , there 's a DMD / small CRT at the top of the backbox with Big Brother watching .
Also , why not keep the Williams / Bally designers on board ?
I hear word that John Borg is the last designer working in house , and last time I checked , he was n't one of the great designers that worked for the # 1 Pinball manufacturer ( During the golden ages of pinball ) -
We need those who understand the philosophy of pinball design , and only them ( No input from Gary or anyone else ) to design for us .
I digress .
I have a ton of other ideas and thoughts , and could go on forever because I want Stern Pinball to succeed !
On the original subject at hand , I hope that this works wonderfully .
This deal has all of the ingredients for success , now we just need an Iron Chef to bring it all together -
Do you think Gary Stern can take kitchen stadium and keep pinball alive ?
I hope he 's the one , because there is not another Skywalker .
Dan Horne :
Great news .
I hope they will care more about there home use only buyers as well .
My last game Indiana Jones , came with a badly damaged head .
You could tell it was done during manufacturing .
I was told to take it the way it was , or send the hole game back for a new one .
That is not very good customer service .
It has a Gary stern autographed backglass .
I currently own 4 stern games all home use only 3 I bought new in box .
the last one almost made me re-think buying the LOTR LE GOLD .
I hope it arrives undamaged .
Keep pinball alive .
PeterGEvans :
Do n't underestimate the power of the home market .
Increase the amount of potential home buyers by offering no interest financing .
Nebraska Furniture
Mart has made an absolute fortune throughout the Midwest by routinely offering as high as 36 - month no interest financing on their furniture and electronics .
Many people cannot scrape together $ 4 k for a game all at once , but if you let them pay for it $ 100 or so per month for three years then you suddenly have a lot more potential buyers .
I have used NFM 's financing to buy tens of thousands of dollars worth of goods over the years without paying a single penny of interest .
If it were n't for their financing , I 'd probably still have an older refrigerator , an older TV , an older washer / dryer .
Those were purchases that were n't necessities , but because of the no interest financing option I pulled the trigger and paid them all off over time .
I would gladly buy a New Stern or Two if I had the ability to finance it interest free for 36 months .
There would be a new LOTR LE on its way to my basement right now for sure .
But as exist today I 'm slowly building my pinball fund to buy a used one .
I 'm one of many potential customers that they could snag by offering a longer term no -interest financing option .
Anyone else interested ?
Scooter :
Great news !
I hope they come out with some very good new pins like Spiderman !
finished codes would help , also I like the idea of LED'S and plasma to put pinball ahead of the technology curve .
Some fresh ideas might help too , as long as it stays true to pinball .
A Carpenter :
As a WOF owner , STERN you need to win my confidence back before I purchase again .
When you take a game into production you have made the commitment to build the game complete .
To knowingly leave a product incomplete is punishing the people that have invested in the product .
Follow this up with incomplete games and there becomes a pattern .
It has been said there is nothing to gain for completing WOF .
Is your credibilty not worth the money it would take to complete the game (s ) ?
I am a small collector who has purchased 5 STERN games since 2003 .
Not a lot but I have shown a commitment to support a product I believe in .
I do not believe your product any longer .
Add up the lost sales from collectors that feel the same and this issue does become larger .
I hope this new vision includes rebuilding STERNs credibilty .
I will not come back without it .
LOTRguy :
This does sound like good news , unless Stern ends up like Bally and goes off in another direction .
I too started a pinball league this year and we now have 16 pins at our location .
It would be great to see some new Stern offerings !
Mr Tobias :
I 'm not sorry this has happened , but whether it is great news as many are claiming depends entirely on what happens from now on .
If the bean counters simply take over , it will not do pinball any favours .
Stern 's approach needs to change as several recent products have evidenced a downward slide despite significant price hikes , and those who believe otherwise are living in the past .
There have been some terrible choices of license and some lacklustre games of late .
Continuing to rely on distributors and operators to ' market ' a product that has largely dropped off the public 's radar is dated thinking .
There is already some evidence they are starting to address this at long last , which is positive .
Stern Pinball needs new blood and fresh ideas to work with established industry personnel to create a product that is as relevant to today 's market as it is appealing to those who have followed pinball over the years .
Phil :
Great news , long overdue , Stern Pinball needs a new injection of ideas and technology that better reflects the interest of the current consumer market .
Lcd back glass with live video feeds from the motion picture and tv titles would add huge fan appeal , as well as more innovative playfield design , which was much better in 90's williams bally pinball games .
Pinball still has a place in bars , family centers , bowling alleys etc .
The recent indianna Jones pinball would have been a smash hit if we could have scenes from the movies in the backglass , not 25 year old dot matrix animation .
Pinball technology should reflect the 21st century not 1980 .
Flipper - Maniac :
For me as a pinball collector and player these are very good news .
I hope Stern survives this bad times .
Nothing can be more sad to hear , that pinball machines are not produced anymore .
I hope more pinball machines like spider - man or lord of the rings will appear .
Also a new machine without licenced theme would be very great .
Rich Young Sr :
Is Dave Peterson a Pinball addict like most of us ?
Is he investing for love of the game or strictly a business investment ?
Have them search the RGP archives there are plenty of threads with suggestions discussing what Stern should do .
I would like to see them make the pin more modular , make the cabinet neutral art like old pins .
Then make the playfield disconnect completely with plugs like Pin2k and offer just playfield kits like Pin2k .
( playfield , translight and downloads for ROMS programming ) .
No need for new Cabinet art each time .
Space is always an issue ,
You could put the playfield kit boxes under your pins for storage .
Get the cost of the kit down somehow , China ?
And as other said complete the code !!!
Get Steve involved again and head his advice .
Oh and put a couple extra coats of clear on the playfields .
Hope the new investors turn this around to allow Stern to live on .
Dallas :
Regarding the coin - op side : in the 80's you 'd go into a location and clean and strip a playfield and replace the rubbers in 1.5 hours .
Then the game would play nicely again for weeks .
That and easy accessibility to replace bad parts needs to be considered .
As do new players enjoying the game .
If you want the coin - op market not all games can be made for the wizards on rec.games .
pinball .
I hope Stern gets stronger with this news .
GL gang !
Super Dave Osbourne :
Hopefully this will lead to more than mediocre releases and interesting modern pinball for the masses .
Pinball Fan :
I think that you should do a Price Is Right pinball machine .
I have always loved pinball since i was young .
I hope I can work their some day .
Please try and make this pinball machine .
Keep making pinball machines .
MattyB :
The first thing Peterson needs to do is stick Gary in a broom closet with a jar of bees to keep safe . :)
Jules :
Stern could turn there fortune just by having a decent online parts store instead of using there **** distributor system .
EricBall :
Stern 's first focus needs to be on the operator market - getting more pinballs in more locations .
Lower the cost of the machine ( unlicensed themes , less exterior cabinet artwork , fewer toys ) and the maintenance while increasing the appeal ( LCD display ) .
The target is to double the number of machine sales each year for the next 3 years .
One other place I think Stern could make more sales is by continuing to make models for a longer time .
For older models the cost of development has already been covered , so that is additional profit .
The only times a pinball should not be made is if the license has expired or if parts are no longer available .
Pinlicious :
10 things that obviously need to be addressed ... and Jody , thanks for * not* getting back with me , I could have gave you a list of 100 + things over the phone ... new people ... same old Stern ...
Yes , I am yelling on purpose !!!
1 . ) THE BALL IS WILD !!!
Lower ball times !
2. ) Offer enough " front end candy " so all players can see what the game has to offer !
3. ) Learn to promote your product , this is n't rocket science !
4. ) Lessen flipper power and lose play field items that require rocket flippers & stop designing games that destroy themselves !
5. ) Stop putting things on the play field that break so quickly .
6. ) Lose the drawn out story lines and make it about points !
7. ) Stick to comic themes , this is your bread and butter , they appeal to your target market and almost EVERYONE !
8. ) Screw resale value , build a game that makes ops money now !
9. ) Stop giving free games , extra balls , and price deals !
Stop coddling players and show ops the money !
10 . ) Lose expensive play field toys that end up breaking , stop putting so much code in games that 99 % of players never see , lose all the dot animations and get the price of games down to 3k !
BONUS !
11 . ) Figure the hell out who your target market is already !
Is it the ops or the homeowner ?!
If you answered the latter , your already DEAD !
Pinball Wizard :
To add to someone 's previous comment on why not keep the Williams / Bally designers ...
Steve Ritchie used to work for Stern and was later laid off .
Listening to him at Pinball Expo there was so much freedom to the point that as long as they made " money machines " they were free to do anything they wanted .
Stern pinball is just the opposite , Gary goes through each pinball design and tells them to cut things .
I had the opportunity to talk to John Borg one on one for over an hour and he says that Gary cuts a lot out of his designs .
An example is that he has been trying to put on a lower " sub- playfield " ( think Haunted House ) but every time he does , Gary has it cut out .
2010 :
Bring back the 2000 concept easy to change a game easy to upgrade easy to maintain low costs toys that cant break only a projected image with the way computers are today you can just imagine what could be done .
Victor Murphy :
As a LOTR owner , fantasy themed games are needed to stir the imaginations of the player .
I like surprises !
New gadgets are great but I think the theme of the game needs the most attention .
Joe :
This may seem like good news , but it also indicates how tragic the current Stern situation is .
I could give a list of things how they got to this point , but that has been beat to death over the past years .
Now I do n't know the personal reasons why this investor got involved , but I assume it is to make a profit .
( what else ? )
Gary could n't sell the company , so this was probably the next best thing .
So things will need to change else you will get the same result as before ( which got Stern in this situation ) .
The question on the long term is : what will happen if the investor can sell his part / share in the company for enough profit ?
Than a new partner comes in , or Gary is back on his own .
For now the company probably can continue to make pinball games , but the new direction could also involve making slot machines , or other gaming devices .
Basically we 'll just have to wait and see .
I can only hope for more interesting pinball games than have been put out the past 10 years .
Correction : the past 25 years from that factory .
Alex :
I say aim for titles that make sense like Gears of War , were in console gaming .
Make some games with titles everyone knows and cares about ( CSI WTF ? ) and lessen the cost of course !
Pinball Player and Collector :
Sounds like great news with Stern .
Some things that would be nice to see are : Remaking of older plastic sets ( sega stern data east )
As some of the older 1990 machines are hard to find the missing plastics etc. should be easy to make , and a return in profit .
Also with the newer machine now comming out from stern , How about more clear coating on the playfield and a better plafield plywood ?
as with the ones at the moment , there to easy to be dinted by the ball itself .
Maybe less movie release machines and spend the money towards better material and playfield graphics etc .
Lcd colour screen insead of the old dmd .
Keep up the great work and hope to see you for another 30 years plus !
JBscar :
One last ' kick at the kitty ' for stern .
Advertisement would just be a waste , you could advertise the S*** out of stern pinball and maybe you might get 100 more sales .
75 % of machines they sell go to us pinheads and collectors .
How about some innovation , and not knock - off license type of games , since that 's all you make .
It 's last call Stern !
BB :
Until someone convinces Gary Stern to give up on the coin - op market ( which does n't exist , for all practical purposes ) and start focusing on the home collector market ( which is the only market left for pinball ) , there is no way Stern Pinball can survive .
Rvdv :
Glad to hear that someone is trying to keep pinball alive .
Me as a collector , it would be better if not mass produced pinballs hit the market but limtited nrs .
Limited nrs keep the price steady .
Also titles as CSI , 24 , NBA , Batman are not themes we want to see Sales nrs prove this i believe .
Perhaps themes such as a : 60,70,80ths game would be better ?
Most people into Pinball are older age , new generation is more into x-box games Three Sterns and going :
First of all I own 3 Stern machines , a TSPP a LOTR and a SM and they are great games .
Im glad that Stern is still making games and I hope to see some great new games in the future .
I do have a few gripes about the company and the process .
1 Keep Gary Stern out of the pinball designing process .
The most successful games he has put out are the ones where he has been kept out of the design process and the designers have been left alone .
2
Get rid of the photoshopped playfields .
3
Use higher quality components including cab art .
4
Hire back your designers especially Steve Ritchie and Dennis Nordmann .
You cant build pins without good designers .
5
Complete the software before you ship the pins out .
NuAtari :
That is Great news to hear that others will support the arcade industry specially Pinball manufacturing .
I agree with many of the ideas and thoughts that others are commenting on this site .
What I would like to see with the pinball industry is as follows , some maybe duplicates of others .
1 . As stated before LCD or Plasma color displays would be nice .
What would be better would be to replace the whole back glass and DMD with a thin low cost LED panel like a TV screen without the tuner .
You will have one whole screen to display the video and score plus the pinball s theme when not being played .
Even better the whole Back glass entertainment panel could be used to play music as a jukebox , or show promos , show the news , or other important establishment information .
This would compete with today 's video game market graphics .
2 . Have companies support layaway financing for new pinballs 3 .
Let people input their thoughts for new themes and or wants and if you choose their idea they will get a free pinball when produced .
4 . Allow people to offer their ideas for new toys for a playfield or new mechanisms or designs they create , If their ideas are used they will get a new Pinball once produced .
5 . Allow other retail companies besides SEARS to be distributors of their pinballs .
6 . To save money , Stern can produce pinball kits allowing consumers to build their own pinball machine .
The consumer will be able to assemble a pinball they buy from stern or distributors .
This will lower the cost to produce the pinballs .
It will allow families to assemble their own machine , with the exception of the pinball wire loom which still must be produced by Stern ; the rest of the pinball can be put together saving thousands off the cost .
7 . Have Blank kits for consumers or pinball fans to make there own designs , once they have finalized their plans have Stern review and help the consumer process their design with help from their preferred manufactures .
8 . I have more ideas but I am tired now give your feedback .
Joe :
One thing is for sure : the less Gary Stern is involved , the better products get .
As long as Gary is in charge , nothing will change .
There is a coin - up market , but they 're fed up with Stern pinballs due to lack of innovation , low earnings and high costs to maintain them .
I do n't want to criticize Jody , but the survey being held is almost a joke .
It will be hard to set a new course based on the incoming results , although it does show more interest in selling games to home - users ( which is new for Stern ) .
cyBORG :
Wow the youtube channel idea was a good one - like 5 + years ago .
Unless Stern gets with the times they deserve whatever happens to them .
Using marketing strategies from 1970 is n't working and has n't worked for almost 20 years .
I seems it 's about time they step it up and try something new .
What that means for the product , who knows .
Hopefully it pans out .
BeSerious :
Anything regarding someone investing in pinball is great news .
I do hope though they do not cheapen the production value any more than it is becoming though .
Crap plastic parts and unfinished code is a hurting the industry .
If people have to repair a machine every week , they wont make money .
I wish I had a crud load of money and invest myself .
Juba :
good luck Gary , the gotten passionate ones for pinball of Brazil we are here in twisted this yes is the good news .
Steve :
Stern needs to look at the old Williams Machines .
Remember Fun House , how cool it was to have a talking dummy with eyes that moved , and with great game play .
The stern machines look like someone went to Toy R Us and bought a box of Lord of the Rings Action figures and then wire tied them to the playfield .
The stern graphics look like they used a bunch of small colored dots to make the machine side art .
They are not solid nice rich colors .
This is also the same if you look at the playfields .
They just look like they cut corners everyplace they can .
Then there is the pinball games .
Cool Stern is going to do a Shrek Pinball , oh wait this looks EXACTLY like Family Guy , oh wait it is .
How many Nascar versions can we release by changing the backglass .
It 's like they look around the warehouse and find an old box of parts and then figure out how to add that part into the game .
Oh , hey guys I found these left over pop bumpers from Austin Powers , let 's use them on our next pin .
There seems to be no money spent on creating something new .
How about a color display , instead of the dot matrix ?
I have to figure these have to be pretty close in cost now a days .
But then you have to get someone to do new color graphics I guess and then we get into investing back into Stern .
I just an not wowed by a Stern machine like I use to be by almost every Williams machine .
It 's all the same , nothing innovative , nothing new .
The prices on a used Stern pinball vs a good classic Williams game are not even close .
Look at Addam's Family which is how many years old now , and then look at a used auction price for World Poker Tour , Spiderman , Monolopy , etc .
I really wish Stern would turn around and take some risk and release something that I just had to have for one of my locations or for home .
Keith E :
This is great news !
My pov is that for Stern to turn the tide they need to return to deeper rule sets and better titles .
In other words , hire ( re - hire ) world class game designers ... George Gomez , Pat Lawlor , the list goes on .
It would also be interesting to see the company develop some new stand alone titles / themes not based simply on the popular movie set .
At the end of the day , innovation will be a key success driver .
Pick up the ball where Pinball 2000 left it :) and now with Nucore the future of this type of platform is limitless .
Eddie M :
Great news of the investment in Stern from Dave Paterson and the focus on marketing .
Stern are doing a lot right and making great games but it needs great marketing , not just for itself but for pinball the game .
I hope this news will be followed up by a pinball themed game .
Why not use a production run to promote pinball rather than pool , basket ball or films etc .
Every 5 years there should be a pinball themed game .
A Game Operator :
i believe going after the coin - op market is ultimately a dead end .
that 's not to say it will go away .
they will always buy some .
i have lost money on almost every pinball i was effectively forced into buying for a location .
( which is the only way i will get one , these days , when i will lose the location if i do n't buy one . ) it is very rare to find a place where even a brand new pinball makes any significant money .
it is even hard sometimes to get the real estate to try one out at a location .
when a $ 3,500 pinball makes next to nothing and is high maintenence to boot , i'll buy anything else , before i'll get a pinball , and make a better return on my investment .
this is the primary reality of the coin op market , these days .
and i enjoy pinball !
maybe they have to be made in China , in order for them to be less expensive .
what if that is the only hope for pinball ?
developing the home market is the key to pinball 's future , just as home arcade systems have been what has secured the future of video games .
however , they are too expensive for most people .
i love that idea someone had here about factory financing : that would be a huge success .
i would be first in line for that .
Jdhaemers :
Great !
Hope everything works out .
Antoshka :
I hope that stern realizes that if they turn around and change the philosophy from movie advertising to costumer orientated business they would improve the number of sales !!
I am surprised that Twilight zone is still in the top 3 and has remained there for 17 years !!!
( on the other hand 16000 units produced !!)
Another Game Operator :
When a Stern pinball from 2001 or 2002 earns the same amount of money ( or more in my case ) than one from 2010 why buy new when the industry is hurting ?
Pinball machines are made for locations hence the coin door .
When people on location make a comment to me asking if they still make pinballs or thought they havent made pinballs since the 1990's its scary when the game they are playing was built a matter of weeks ago ( WoF when it came out ) .
Pinball and home / portable gaming systems = dinosaurs and humans walking together .... its a new concept and one is beating the other .
No wonder my typewriter / phonograph / record store is hurting , maybe these guys can bail me out .
Who needs computers and iphones right ;)
Youtube isnt going to help the games make more money for the everyday pinball player at the bar .
It will give the collector something to do online while they are in their hobby high frenzy .

© Pinball News 2009
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- The U.S. Postal Service reported a $ 3.8 billion loss in the 2009 fiscal year , and plans to propose to Congress in 2010 that it drop Saturday delivery .
The agency already reduced expenses by $ 6 billion during the year ended Sept. 30 .
Those measures included eliminating 40,000 jobs , however the cash - strapped agency still employs over 712,000 people .
The Postal Service also reduced overtime hours and lowered transportation - related costs .
Additionally , the USPS lowered the payments it made for retiree health benefits by $ 4 billion in fiscal 2009 .
" To say this was a difficult year might be a bit of an understatement , " said the USPS chief financial officer Joseph Corbett , on a conference call with the media .
Corbett blamed the agency 's difficulties on the recession and " the continued migration [ of customers ] to electronic means . "
Big changes
Corbett also said on the call that the Post Office will formally propose to Congress that it drop Saturday delivery .
" We need more flexibility in our delivery schedule .
We 've talked a number of times about reducing from 6 to 5 days of service , " he said .
That move alone would save $ 3.5 billion .
But even a 5 - day delivery schedule wo n't be enough to put the USPS into the black , Corbett said .
So the agency will also propose to Congress that it reduce the $ 5.5 billion in annual payments to pre-fund retiree health benefits that it is slated to make until 2016 .
Ongoing losses
This is the third year in a row that the agency has posted a loss ; it lost $ 2.8 billion in fiscal 2008 , and $ 5 billion in 2007 .
The USPS is a self - supporting government agency that receives no tax dollars .
It relies solely on the sale of postage and products and services to generate sales .
The Postal Service reported operating revenue of $ 68.1 billion , down 9 % from last year , while its operating expenses fell to $ 71.8 billion , down 7 % from 2008 .
The service 's total mail volume plunged by more than 25 billion pieces , or 12.7 % , to 177.1 billion pieces .
That drop was twice as much as any mail volume decline in the Postal Service 's history .
There is a strong correlation between unemployment and mail volume , according to Corbett , which means that mail volumes will continue to decline as the unemployment rate climbs .
Spotlight On : Bandai Vinyl Godzilla & Gamera
| By
All this week we ’ve been looking at Kaiju or Japanese Giant Monsters and that continues here tonight with a special look at a handful of my favorite Bandai vinyl figures .
Some from Bandai ’s American branch , Bandai Creation and some from Bandai Japan .
We ’ve got some heavy hitters here , so let ’s dive right in !
We begin with the original himself , Godzilla 1954 !
This sculpt has been released both in Japan as well as through Bandai Creation although it ’s slightly different .
I did n’t pick up the Bandai Creation version ( though now I wish I had ) because I have this version from Japan .
It ’s basically the same mold , although it ’s been upscaled a bit and slightly changed around .
His arms for example seem leaner on the Creation version .
The tag is pretty spiffy and I must confess this figure looks incredibly on model .
Godzilla looked pretty different in his first appearance , most notably he had ears !
This Bandai figure reflects all the subtle details that were on this specific version .
I ’m sure Raymond Burr would be proud .
The paint work is decent but I ’m not a big fan of the white wash on the chest and knees .
What ’s up with giving Godzilla a big patch of paint on his chest ?
Maybe the Imperial Godzilla was n’t so off model after all ?
The paint work is a little sloppy on the nails and fins , which seems to be a trend with Bandai .
They sort of spray paint the figures and it gives an often uneven look to them .
People rag on Bandai Creations , but they tend to paint their figures better than most .
Godzilla has articulation in the arms , legs and tail .
Next up we have Gamera from the 1999 film , Gamera III : Incomplete Struggle or Revenge of Iris depending on what version you ’re watching .
Personally this was probably my least favorite Gamera design , despite being probably the best Gamera movie .
In this film Gamera has fully evolved or mutated to the point where he looks like a big nasty snapping turtle .
This is one of the easier Bandai vinyls to get from Japan , but it ’s a great sculpt .
There are a plethora of versions of this figure , mostly repaints or ones molded in different colors .
If you look around you can find some really pretty cool versions out there .
For my money this was the best version because it was the most normal .
Despite being one of the most normal versions of Gamera from Gamera III , his shell is still painted in an odd metallic green .
It ’s bright and kind of annoying .
His chest is painted in a metallic gold as well , but that actually works better than the shell .
It ’s a shame the paint is n’t better because the figure is very impressive .
Gamera moves at the head somewhat , legs , arms and tail .
It ’s nothing fancy and the arms are in a position that you do n’t have a great range of poses , but with Gamera ’s design they always seem to struggle to make him poseable .
This is still a good figure if you ’re into Bandai vinyl .
Finally we have Godzilla 68 .
This Godzilla is based off of his 1968 appearance and for many this is the definitive 60 ’s Godzilla .
Some prefer the Japanese version of this figure , but I ’m actually more fond of the Bandai Creation take on it .
The colors on both the Japanese and American version are identical , with a slightly too dark skin tone and pink inside the mouth .
Some collectors do n’t like that , but it is what it is .
If I was a talented painter , I ’d put a real light dry brush of green over his whole body and I think that would make him pop .
The only area I prefer the Japanese version is the eyes .
Bandai Creation had some slop with the eyes .
All in all I find this Godzilla encompasses a lot of the 60’s look without being an identical model to 68 .
I enjoy that element but your mileage may vary .
Regardless , this is a great Godzilla figure and can still be found at most local TRUs .
He moves at the legs , arms and tail .
Training
Let me start by saying I am not a licensed or certified trainer .
I am just a guy who has spent the better of the last 24 years in a gym , training with weights , and who has developed a way of training that works for me .
This will only be a general explaination of my theory of training .
I think the biggest problem people face in the gym is over training .
This is a strange concept for people to grasp .
More people are of the more is better philosophy .
Over training is a result of people not knowing how to train .
Unfortunately most workout advice comes from muscle magazines , and famous body builders .
This is a problem because , with very few exceptions , all of these people are on steroids .
Steroids enable your body to recover quicker from training , thus enable you to train harder and more frequent .
If you train this way and are n't on steroids , your body will fatigue from over training , and you wo n't get your best results .
Sometimes less is more .
Contrary to popular belief , I am not on steroids , nor have I ever been .
The angle I did with Candito , and Dreamer , when I claimed to be the best built professional athlete , this side of a negative drug test was a shoot , as least as far as the negative drug test part .
If you plan on using steroids my way of training wo n't be for you , for everyone else let me say avoiding steroids is a wise decision , steroids only provide very short term results , and they come with a very high price , not the least of which being inevitable injuries .
I believe best results are achieved when you train your body once to twice a week , and you must provide it with lots of rest , so it can grow .
I divided my body into three training days ; chest & biceps , shoulders & legs , back & triceps .
I try to get to the gym about 3 maybe 4 times a week ( I wish it were more but unfortunately that is n't the case ) .
So I train my body 1 to maybe 1 1/2 times per week .
After training those muscle groups , which takes about 1 hour , I alternate abs and cardio .
1 day abs the next cardio .
If I 'm really pressed for time or feeling lazy I skip the abs and cardio .
This is n't really a good idea but hey , no ones perfect , least of all me .
This with wrestling 4 days a week is about all my body can handle .
The key to my training ; is very strict form , I do n't worry about lifting heavy weights , I worry about lifting them properly , and always use a full range of motion , with a slower stricter form .
You need to avoid the urge of using too heavy of weight .
Many people take long rest periods between sets so they can lift heavier .
This is a waste of time , in my opinion .
The muscle does n't know the difference between 50 and 10 lbs , it only knows how hard it is working .
If you train the muscle to failure , that 's training heavy .
What is too heavy and too light ?
I 'm a firm believer in reps between 6 - 12 .
Choose a weight , then with strict form do as many reps as you can .
If you can do more than 12 , it 's too light , go heavier with your next set .
Your first set should be 10 - 12 reps .
If you can't get 10 reps , it 's too heavy to start .
As long as you can get a strict 8 - 10 go a bit heavier next set .
If you can only get 6 on your last 2 sets , that 's cool , stay with that weight .
If you can't get 6 reps , lower the weight .
That 's pretty much it , pretty basic really .
This should give you a general idea as to the way I train .
Please if you decide to try my training method , be sure to stretch and warm up the muscles before training .
Always consult with a licensed trainer or doctor if you have any pain or discomfort while training .
Muscle pain during training can be good , but any joint pain should be looked at seriously .
The theory of " no pain , no gain " is often misunderstood .
I always train the biggest muscle first .
Large muscles , such as Chest and Back , I do four exercises with 4 sets of each .
Smaller muscles like Biceps and Triceps only 3 exercises with again 4 sets of each .
Legs I train different from most people , I train legs with high reps and ligher weights .
This is n't favourable for most people , but when I train legs heavy I lose my vertical leap , not to mention the fact that with 4 bulging discs in my lower back heavy squatting is not advised .
My speed and mobility is too important too me , so I train light legs and only do 3 or 4 exercises for them .
Shoulders are important and something very easy to injure in the gym .
Overhead presses of some kind are a must for big shoulders , but they are very hard on you as well .
My keys to taking care of the shoulders are ; stretching , rotator cuff strengthening , and doing presses late in the workout .
Most people do presses first , so they are fresh and can lift heavier .
I disagree .
I do lateral raises for the three deltoid heads first .
This strengthens and tightens the muscles first , and helps stabilize the shoulder joint for the presses .
You wo n't be able to press as heavy , but remember this does n't matter .
The muscle will still be working hard .
Supplements
I do n't use any supplements anymore but I did use a couple of supplements when I was working full time , Creatine Monohydrate , and Vanadyl pH .
I still use protein shakes and bars on occasions , but I consider them a diet supplement not a training supplement .
For people who are just starting to train , I do n't recommend supplements .
I think it is important to get as much out of your body , on its own , before trying anything .
I was training about 12 - 15 years before taking my first supplement .
This is of course excessive but if you get everything out of your body that you can first , you will then be better able to judge what the supplements are actually doing for you .
It is also along this same vain , why I suggest only taking 1 supplement at a time .
If you take more than one , who is to say which is working for you , all bodies react differently .
Both of the supplements , I took , were recommended to me .
Rob Rooksby is a friend and local gym owner , and I get all of my diet and supplement advice from him .
It 's important to find someone you trust when buying supplements , as there is a lot of crap out there .
Diet
I do n't have a very complex diet .
A diet to me is n't something you are on , or off , it 's simply your eating habits .
I do n't keep track of the amount of fat , protein , or carbohydrates that I eat .
My only rule of thumb is , avoid processed foods and eat as many whole natural foods as I can .
I do n't eat anything that is low fat , low carb , etc. because they replace the fat with sugar and calories with other artificial chemicals I do n't want to consume .
I try to eat things that are grown or raised .
Fruits , vegetables , meats / fish , and grains .
Grains being the smallest portion of those if I can .
I keep my deserts and junk food to a minimum , but believe that now that I 'm off the road , treats are fine as long as kept in moderation .
I always try to consume most of my carbohydrates earlier in the day .
Avoid huge carb intake right before bed .
Try to eat as many times a day as you can .
Frequent meals increase your metabolism .
Some people have a binge day , where they can eat things they usually do n't .
I disagree with this .
I feel this only keeps your cravings alive .
I find if you go long enough without something you quit craving it , and for the most part , no longer want it .
Many people view eating as a source of enjoyment .
I do n't eat for enjoyment .
I eat to fuel my body .
That 's it in a nut shell , the world of Diet and Training as seen through the eyes of a guy who has been training for almost 3 / 4s of his life .
WOW I feel old !
Two members of Dublin Fire Brigade are being treated in hospital following a fire at the Guinness brewery site in Dublin .
Watch footage of the fire
11 units of Dublin Fire Brigade and three aerial fire fighting vehicles attended the scene at St James 's Gate this afternoon .
The two firefighters are stable condition at St James 's Hospital .
It is understood that they may have come into contact with ammonia .
The fire broke out in a storage building for empty containers at the lower end of the brewery near the Victoria Quay entrance at 12.10 pm .
Repairs were being carried out on the roof of the building , which was partly made of felt .
The area in question was not in regular use and was successfully evacuated .
It is believed significant damage was caused to the building .
In a statement , Diageo said production continued elsewhere on the site throughout the incident .
Services on the Luas Red line between Blackhorse and Smithfield are now running as normal following earlier disruption .
Gardaí and Diageo have both launched investigations into the cause of the blaze .

In case of updating , delete the previous files used by the plugin , before placing the new contents .
Adding more items :
To add more items , you need to : Edit the / addons / sourcemod / configs / TF2_ItemList.cfg list and follow the same model as the other items , adding the correct flags for each item .
MAKE SURE YOU SETUP AN INDEX TO YOUR CUSTOM HATS .
This is obligatory since version 1.1.6 .
To create new items , you 'll have to create them through a 3D creation tool ( I use 3D Studio Max 2009 ) , and skin the model to the the correct bone ( for hats , bip_head , for example . )
Changelog : 1.1.8 . - Adapted plugin to work with voogru's extension .
Changed body groups calculation method .
Included a Pedobear hat as custom hat example .
Decreased slot size from 3 to 2 .
This is due the workaround method used for other players to be able to see custom hats .
1.1.7 . - Fixed gamedata to use the latest update virtual offsets .
Made a temporal fix to prevent crashes on Windows servers when a spy disguises as another player with a hat created by the plugin .
The disguised spies wo n't be wearing the plugin hats anymore .
1.1.6 . - Added support for clientprefs ( Individual for each class ) .
Switched to post_inventory_application event to determine when to equip the items .
Cleaned up code and changed the variable name convention to the Hungarian Notation .
While at it , I 've made some fixes here and there , minor things .
Setting a item index is now obligatory even for custom hats , needs to be set to one of the values found in the the sample indexes table ( configs file ) .

Richard Colvin 's repeated warnings to the Canadian government about detainee torture in Afghanistan were an expression of the common concerns of like - minded Western nations , not the baseless ramblings of a rogue diplomat , a European colleague says .
Michael Semple , former deputy head of the European Union 's mission in Afghanistan when Colvin was second - in - command of the Canadian embassy , said his own records from his time in Kabul are littered with the same findings that the senior Canadian envoy shared with a House of Commons committee this week .
Colvin , now a top intelligence officer at the embassy in Washington , expressed concerns that were " absolutely credible , " said Semple , now a research fellow at Harvard University 's Carr Center for Human Rights .
" We all worked on it , and we appropriately compared our notes , in terms of understanding what was happening on torture inside the Afghan intelligence service , " he told the Star .
The Canadian government should have heeded Colvin 's allegation that detainees transferred by Canadian soldiers to local authorities likely were abused , Semple said .
Colvin told a special Commons committee on Afghanistan Wednesday that Canada took vastly more battlefield prisoners than either the British or Dutch militaries operating in southern Afghanistan .
He said that those detainees were , by and large , innocent taxi drivers and farmers rather than Taliban operatives , and that abuse was the " standard operating procedure " of Afghan authorities , regardless of the intelligence value of a prisoner .
The implements of torture were wire cables , electrical shocks and physical and sexual abuse , he said .
Colvin says his verbal and written warnings , sent far and wide to Canadian diplomats and military officials between May 2006 and October 2007 , were at first ignored .
Once newspaper reports in April 2007 brought the problems to light , Colvin said he was instructed to keep quiet by David Mulroney , a senior official who had responsibilities to report on Afghanistan to Prime Minister Stephen Harper , then - foreign affairs minister Peter MacKay and Gordon O'Connor , who was the defence minister before he became the first political casualty of the detainee scandal .
Under Mulroney 's tenure , diplomats were told not to put torture allegations on paper , Colvin said .
But a senior government official with knowledge of the file told the Star yesterday there was a simple – and not a nefarious – explanation for Mulroney 's instruction .
" Under instructions from Mr. Mulroney , regular phone calls were instituted that connected Ottawa with the field , Kabul with Kandahar , and civilians with military , " the source said .
" That 's why some people were reminded to use the phone instead of simply sitting in an office writing out the same report . "
The same source , who answered the Star 's question on condition of anonymity , said Colvin 's allegations were reviewed by departmental officials , not political officials .
The timing of that review was not exactly clear , but the source suggested it was in 2007 .
" A complete and thorough review of everything that was alleged was done , and a whole government team set to design a monitoring system still in place now .
No detail was hidden , every relevant fact was brought to light . "
Mulroney is said to be willing to testify in front of the parliamentary committee , to counter Colvin 's allegations , which the Conservative government dismissed as " not credible " and " entirely suspect . "
" I do n't believe it 's backed up by fact , and what we have to deal with in a parliamentary hearing , as we do in a court of law or another judicial or public inquiry , is evidence that can be substantiated , " MacKay , who succeeded O'Connor as defence minister , said in Halifax Friday .
" The evidence and the suggestion that every single Taliban prisoner that was taken into custody and turned over ( to be tortured ) is simply not credible . "
Semple said the burden of proof should not be on Colvin to show that every detainee was sent to Afghan torture chambers .
He also said Colvin never complained to him about Canadian officials in Ottawa or Afghanistan ignoring his advice from the front lines , nor did he mention , as he did in his testimony , that he was being asked to keep his explosive findings out of written reports to his superiors to avoid a scandalous paper trail .
" My reading of this is that he was discreet and did not discuss internal Canadian affairs with people outside his office , " Semple said .
Like the defence department earlier this week , the foreign affairs department urged patience to let the Commons committee 's hearings run their course .
Department spokesman Jamie Christoff said in an email to reporters that current and former foreign affairs employees will provide testimony in the weeks ahead that " will provide important context and information about this issue . "

MacKay has acknowledged it was based on the reports of Colvin and others in 2007 that Canada signed a new transfer agreement with the Afghan government that allowed Canadian officials to visit and interview prisoners .
Opposition parties continued to call on the Tories Friday to investigate Colvin 's allegations , and the possibility that Afghan detainees may have been abused in the full knowledge of senior Canadian military and diplomatic and political leaders .
That , they say , would violate international law , which prohibits a country from knowingly placing individuals in a situation where they will be tortured .

Gregory Headley , who was released from prison in July , makes minimum wage cleaning sidewalks during his quest for permanent employment .
Ex-convicts participate in mock job interviews at the Fortune Society .
Stressful jobs that pay badly View photos
High stress and a meager paycheck are just another day at the office .
Here are 15 of the most overworked and underpaid professions out there .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
If you think it 's tough getting a job during a recession , imagine what it 's like for an ex-convict .
Gregory Headley , 29 , knows exactly what it 's like .
The Harlem resident was released from prison in July after serving two years and eight months for the criminal sale of a firearm .
Now that he 's out , he said , the conviction is dogging his attempts to land a full - time job .
" There 's no nice way of saying , ' I sold a gun , ' " Headley said recently as he headed to his part - time job cleaning sidewalks .
Headley was placed in the temporary , minimum - wage job by the Center for Employment Opportunities , a nonprofit organization in Manhattan that helps ex-convicts transition into law - abiding lifestyles .
" I 'm not going to lie : $ 40 a day hurts , " said Headley , feeling the squeeze of the $ 28,000 in child support debt that he accumulated in prison .
" But what I need to do is stay on the path I 'm on , try to get used to the struggle instead of trying to beat the odds . "
Terrence Mason , assistant director of participant services at the employment center , described Headley as a " good guy " and a " go - getter . "
But he acknowledged that many employers will look no further than his rap sheet .
" His conviction is a tough sell to employers , " said Mason .
At the back of the line
For everyone right now , the job market is tough .
The U.S. unemployment rate jumped to 10.2 % in October , its highest level in more than 26 years , according to the Labor Department .
Nationwide , 15.7 million people are out of work .
That is really bad news for the hundreds of thousands of ex-convicts who are released from prison every year .
" They 're always at the back of the line , and the line just got a lot longer , " said Glenn Martin , vice president of the Fortune Society in Queens , a nonprofit that trains ex-convicts in job hunting skills .
" On top of that , our folks are losing jobs just like anyone else , but it 's more difficult to replace those jobs , because of the stigma of criminal conviction .
Our folks can't get through the door these days . "
In the most recent available figures from the U.S. Department of Justice , 713,473 prisoners were released from incarceration in 2006 .
There are no nationwide numbers reflecting unemployment rates among ex-convicts .
But up to 60 % of the formerly incarcerated in New York state are unemployed after one year of their release , according to a study from the Independent Committee on Reentry and Employment , of which Martin is a member .
The number is even higher for parole violators , at 89 % .
The temptations of the street can be overwhelming during a recession , said Martin , who was released from prison in 2000 after a six - year sentence for armed robbery .
He said that his first post - prison job paid $ 16,000 a year , which paled compared to his ill - gotten gains .
" I used to make $ 16,000 a day when I was on the street , " Martin said .
" I used to rob jewelry stores for a living .
Obviously , it would have been a lot easier for me to go back to the street to do what I was doing .
But the idea is to move away from instant gratification . "
Michael B. Jackson , an ex-convict and author of " How to Do Good After Prison : A Handbook for Successful Reentry , " said the risks of recidivism during a recession cannot be overstated .
" Formerly incarcerated people and drug addicts , we do n't need a lot of excuse to go back to what we were doing before , " he said .
" In these hard times , when ex-offenders can't get jobs ... they 're going to be robbing people . "
The conviction question
During a two - week job - hunting class at the Fortune Society in Queens , employment specialist Mitchell McClinton grilled 19 ex-convicts in a series of mock interviews .
After coaching his students on how to present themselves , market their job skills and answer the dreaded " conviction question , " he posed as an employer and put them in the hot seat .
" I noticed that you checked ' yes ' on the conviction , " he said to one of the ex-convicts .
" Explain . "
" Basically , I learned from the mistakes of my past , [ that they ] jeopardize my present and my future , " replied the interviewee .
McClinton moved on to the next ex-convict , but she mumbled through the interview and would n't speak up until he threatened to skip over her .
When she finally opened her mouth to speak , McClinton saw something he did n't like .
" Is that a tongue ring in your mouth ? " he said .
" You can't wear a tongue ring to an interview . "
Many of the ex-convicts are seeking cleaning jobs , based on the skills they outlined in the interviews , and some of them are working towards their high school equivalency degrees .
Headley , during his citywide clean - up rounds , said his heart is set on college and eventually an office job at the Center for Employment Opportunities , where he could help other ex-convicts transition into the job market .
But for the short term , he said he 's gratified to be a sidewalk sweeper .

The mind boggles .
Who ever would have thought , even in their darkest , most paranoid dreams , that the Copenhagen climate change talks would be hijacked by a handful of rich nations seeking to give themselves more power and riches while imposing new burdens and new injustices on the rest of the world ?
And that amongst this avaricious , duplicitous elite one would find the government of a man who now bears the Nobel laurel for his unstinting dedication to the welfare of all humanity ?
Yet as unlikely as it may seem - the rich screwing the poor ?
What next ?
– that 's exactly what has happened at the great international conference that opened this week in Denmark with the avowed intent of pulling the planet back from the brink of a potentially fatal disequilibrium .
America , Britain , and , er , Denmark are among the handful of rich nations who have drawn up a secret draft agreement that they hope to impose on the conference in its closing days , when the elite 's heavy hitters like Barack Obama and Gordon Brown swan in to take a bow .
The plan would let rich nations emit twice as much per capita pollution as developing countries , while the latter will be subject to stiff new dictates from the rich in order to receive technical assistance for climate change programs .
The elite plan also calls for completely bypassing the UN – the only international forum in which poor nations feel they stand on a slightly more equal footing with the elite – and turning over climate change funding and future negotiations to an " independent " board … most likely run by that reliable appendage of empire , the World Bank .
As the Guardian reports :
The UN Copenhagen climate talks are in disarray today after developing countries reacted furiously to leaked documents that show world leaders will next week be asked to sign an agreement that hands more power to rich countries and sidelines the UN 's role in all future climate change negotiations .
The document is also being interpreted by developing countries as setting unequal limits on per capita carbon emissions for developed and developing countries in 2050 ; meaning that people in rich countries would be permitted to emit nearly twice as much under the proposals ....
The draft hands effective control of climate change finance to the World Bank ; would abandon the Kyoto protocol – the only legally binding treaty that the world has on emissions reductions ; and would make any money to help poor countries adapt to climate change dependent on them taking a range of actions .
The so - called Danish text , a secret draft agreement worked on by a group of individuals known as " the circle of commitment " – but understood to include the UK , US and Denmark – has only been shown to a handful of countries since it was finalised this week .
... " It is being done in secret .
Clearly the intention is to get [ Barack ]
Obama and the leaders of other rich countries to muscle it through when they arrive next week .
It effectively is the end of the UN process , " said one diplomat , who asked to remain nameless .
And as noted in a follow - up story by the Guardian :
A spokesman for Cafod , a development charity with close links to some of the poorest countries in the world , said : " This draft document reveals the backstage machinations of a biased host who , instead of acting as nonpartisan broker , is taking sides with the developed countries .
" The document should not even exist .
There is a UN legal process which is the official negotiating text .
The Danish text disrespects the solid , steady approach of the UN process . "
Another shock !
Elites clubbing together in secret , seeking to circumvent legal processes for their own corrupt advantage ?
And , and , and .... Americans being involved in such dirty business ?!
Say it ai n't so , O !
The Copenhagen talks have become captive of what we might call the " Reform Syndrome " ; i.e. , the absolute , urgent imperative to put together a crappy deal that gorges the rich and hobbles the poor in egregious ways -- but which can be palmed off on a compliant media and a diverted public as some kind of " reform . "
The important thing is that an illusion of positive action be created -- while the same - old same - old keeps grinding on behind the scenes .
This scenario has been playing out in the most crude and brazen fashion during the " debate " over health care " reform " in the United States , which has seen a " progressive " administration literally sell its " reform " agenda to the very corporate interests that are the ostensible target of the reforms , allowing them , again literally , to write most of the " reform " legislation themselves .
And this has been the modus operandi of most of the international climate change efforts , which have seen no appreciable reduction in the pollution that is driving the destabilization of the planet -- but has seen the creation of vast new " carbon trading " markets an other speculative ventures for the rich and powerful to feast upon .
Genuine climate change experts like Sir David King of the UK have been saying that no deal would be far better than the kind of bad deals that are brewing in Copenhagen .
And that was before the secret agenda of the " circle of commitment " was revealed .
( The same dynamic applies to health care reform , of course : better no bill at all than the monstrosity now wending its way through Congressional intestines .
Back off , buckle down , and start again . )
The details of the elite 's Copenhagen agenda will now doubtless now be modified -- or plastered over with a new coat of PR paint -- in the light of the firestorm the revelations have provoked .
But the true intention of the rich nations in these negotiations -- as in all others -- is clearer than a shining stream pouring down from a melting ice cap : the weakest go to the wall .
II .
But as Arthur Silber pointed out last month in his articles on global warming , this is what our " complex , intricate ... corporatist system , " with its " dizzyingly numerous interconnections between " private " business and government , " does .
This is what it 's for .
And , as he notes , this is the system that we are trusting to resolve the globe - wrenching problems of climate change .
Silber also makes the pertinent point that while this system goes on its merry way , profiting both from its unceasing pollution of the planet -- which may have already reached the point of no return -- and from the fitful and co-opted attempts to mitigate its effects , millions of people are absorbed by their anxiety over these potential dangers ... even as they ignore , or in some cases , celebrate , vast , man -made catastrophes that could be dealt with today , right now -- and with a bare minimum of cost .
For example , Victoria Brittain details a vast , man -made environmental disaster that could be resolved this afternoon with a single phone call .
From the Guardian :
Among all the complex and long - term solutions being sought in Copenhagen for averting environmental catastrophe across the world , there is one place where the catastrophe has already happened , but could be immediately ameliorated with one simple political act .
In Gaza there is now no uncontaminated water ; of the 40,000 or so newborn babies , at least half are at immediate risk of nitrate poisoning – incidence of " blue baby syndrome " , methaemoglobinaemia , is exceptionally high ; an unprecedented number of people have been exposed to nitrate poisoning over 10 years ; in some places the nitrate content in water is 300 times World Health Organisation standards ; the agricultural economy is dying from the contamination and salinated water ; the underground aquifer is stressed to the point of collapse ; and sewage and waste water flows into public spaces and the aquifer .
The blockade of Gaza has gone on for nearly four years , and the vital water and sanitation infrastructure went past creaking to virtual collapse during the three - week assault on the territory almost a year ago .
What would it take to start the two UN sewerage repair projects approved by Israel ; a UN water and sanitation project , not yet approved ; and two more UN internal sewage networks , not yet approved ?
Right now just one corner of the blockade could be lifted for these building materials and equipment to enter Gaza , to let water works begin and to give infant lives a chance .
Just one telephone call from the Israeli defence ministry could do it – an early Christmas present to the UN staff on the ground who have been ready to act for months and have grown desperate on this front , as on so many others .
As Brittain notes , the Israelis have already lifted another part of their strangulating blockade , after a bold intervention by U.S. Senator John Kerry , who in March of this year demanded that the Israelis lift their prohibitions on ... pasta .
But apparently , no American politician can be bothered to pick up a phone to stem the poisoning of the Gaza Ghetto :
Gaza 's huge pale sandy beaches used to be society 's playground and reassurance of happiness and normality , with families picnicking , horses exercising , fishermen mending their nets , children swimming and boys exercising in the early morning , but these days they are mainly empty , and not just because it is winter .
Between 50 m and 60 m litres of untreated sewage have flowed into the Mediterranean every day this year since the end of the Israeli invasion in January , the sea smells bad and few fish are available in the three nautical mile area Palestinians are allowed in .
This resource seems as ruined as the rubble of Gaza 's parliament and ministries .
.... " We have run out of words to describe how bad it is here , " says John Ging , director of operations for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in Gaza .
Ging heads a team of 10,000 mainly Palestinian workers who run the aid supplies that are all that stand between the vast majority of Gazans and destitution .
" We have 80 % unemployment , an economy at subsistence level , infrastructure destroyed , etc , but even worse than the humanitarian plight is the destruction of civil society . "
Ging 's great preoccupation is " the 750,000 children susceptible to an environment where things are moving rapidly in the wrong direction , where the injustice is bewildering , and every day worse " :
There is a big problem of insecurity and violence here , and it is getting worse .
Most adults display stoic resilience , and cling to a belief in traditional values , but there is a compelling narrative by extremists which becomes ever more difficult to combat .
Only lifting the siege would change the dynamic .
III .
Or what about the vast , spreading , man -made disaster that is Afghanistan ?
As Silber notes , many people who decry the potential disasters of climate change actively support the catastrophic intervention in Afghanistan -- which , as we pointed out here , produces the very ills that is ostensibly designed to reduce ( just as Israel 's choking of Gaza does ) .
Yet here too , the vast suffering and degradation of millions of people could be addressed more effectively at a modicum of the cost it now takes to kill and plunder them .
Jeffrey Sachs ( via the Angry Arab ) takes up this theme at the Huffington Post , while noting the aforementioned inherent disabilities of our present system to address the problems it ostensibly seeks to resolve :
The framing of Afghanistan 's governance problems with the simplistic gloss of " corruption " is yet another trivialization of reality , exceeded only by the idea that Afghan President Hamid Karzai can and will turn off corruption at will , and notably in response to US pressure .
Former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski was on the mark when he questioned the ability of Washington , itself in an era of rampant corruption , to clean up corruption elsewhere .
A worthy role for Richard Holbrooke , now the special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan , would be to root out flagrant financial mismanagement at the staff of AIG , where Holbrooke had served on the Board during the buildup of the recent financial bubble .
The war industry itself , replete with powerful corporations like Fluor and DynCorp that receive billions of dollars in no-bid Pentagon contracts , are also a likely part of the Washington political momentum .
The fact of the matter is that Afghanistan is in urgent need of the basics for survival in one of the poorest countries on Earth -- seeds , fertilizer , roads , power , schools , and clinics -- much more than it is in the need of another 30,000 troops or added military contractors .
Development aid directed to Afghanistan 's communities , through the UN , could stabilize Afghanistan far more effectively at one - fifth to one - tenth the cost of the coming $ 100 billion or so per year that will be spent on this military debacle .
Yet such support is not forthcoming .
...
As Friedman reports , Obama has disdained " nation - building " as " mission creep , " thereby disappointingly echoing the Bush administration .
In fact , the US Government 's long - standing disdain is for the Afghan people themselves , since there has been not the slightest effort for decades to think through their real needs and wants .
As in Vietnam , this mission is all about us .
And as in Vietnam , the US escalation has the possibility of causing much broader destabilization in Central and South Asia and the Middle East .
Yes , who could possibly have foreseen that the avatars of such a system would seek to exploit the growing anxiety over climate change to augment their own dominance ?
Whatever happens to the planet -- or to the Iraqis , or to the Afghans , or to the millions of people going down in the flood of financial flim - flam and health care " reform " scams -- the elites will remain as they are now : well - wadded , well - protected , and well - connected in their fortified enclaves of privilege and power .
In the end , it took Senator Stephen Conroy and the Department of Broadband , Communications and the Digital Economy a whole year to manage a six - week trial of ISP - level filtering .
Coincident with the 215th anniversary of the US Bill of Rights , swamped in news coverage of Copenhagen and office Christmas parties , Conroy finally released the report he ’s been sitting on since September .
The timetable blowout was n’t a good sign and anyway , I ’d been telling people that the results were a given before the trial even started .
It seemed to me inevitable that the trial would find that net censorship is made out of unicorns and rainbows .
And , would n’t you know it , the document claims that everything is sweetness and light and that every internet user will get a free pony .
Or does it ?
The trial , part of the Government ’s Cyber Safety Plan , did n’t get off to a flying start .
Not only did it face staunch criticism from pretty much everyone in the internet business in Australia , its terms of reference were so loosely defined that it seemed unlikely to deliver conclusive evidence one way or the other .
Officially , the trial sought to assess the technical feasibility of ISP - based web filtering — would censoring content have any impact on performance and productivity ?
Unfortunately , the authors of the report , which is based on trials managed by independent testing laboratory Enex Testlab , have withheld some of the data about participating users needed to make sense of the results .
For example , we know from comments made by one of the ISPs involved in the trial , Nelson Bay Online , that only around 15 of their customers chose to participate .
Their performance testing results were likely to be close to perfect because their Marshal8e6 R3000 system was never placed under any significant load .
But what of the other ISPs who took part in the trial ?
Primus has a much bigger customer base than Nelson Bay Online — did their testing involve just a handful of users ?
And if so , were they the ones that suffered a 27.2 per cent performance degradation — or was Primus one of the ISPs using the imaginary magical censorbox that apparently made the internet 17.32 per cent faster ?
We do n’t know the answers to these questions and that makes it hard to assess the technical findings of the report .
Nonetheless , it ’s clear that claims that the clean feed will have a " negligible " impact on performance are preposterous nonsense .
The loose terms of reference for the trial are matched by Enex ’s loose and fearless definition of the term " negligible " ; it ’s one with which I ’d wager most internet users in Australia would take issue .
Another performance question that ’s unanswered by the report is so simple even Senator Conroy should be able to understand it .
Conroy has spent two years telling Australia that the only important factor that would justify or inhibit a censorship regime was network performance .
Why , then , did his trial fail to test network performance at any speed faster than 8 megabits per second ?
Since April , Conroy has been touting a National Broadband Network which runs at 100 megabits per second — over 12 times faster than the fastest speed tested by Enex Testlab .
None of the trial ’s technical specs , published in Appendix 1 of the report , approach that speed .
Most of them actually show notable " flat - spots " between 7 and 8 megabits per second that are indicative of bottlenecks .
What is the nature of those bottlenecks ?
We do n’t know because the report does n’t tell us .
So we ’re now confronted with the prospect of a Government marching into a 100 megabit future — with absolutely no idea whether their mandatory censorship system will be able to keep up .
So — at best — the jury is still out on whether the clean feed inhibits performance and the explosive responses online yesterday suggest that the smart money is n’t with Conroy .
Let ’s move to cyber -safety .
Does this trial suggest that it ’s possible to successfully filter internet content ?
Can the clean feed clean up the net or can the filter be circumvented ?
Again , conclusions are stymied by the lack of data in the report .
We ca n’t tell whether WebShield , the ISP with arguably the most practice at running censorship systems , was the one that could only block 8.1 per cent of users trying to worm their way through the filter — or whether they were at the other end of the spectrum and able to block 94.5 per cent of circumvention attempts .
It is clear that the filter is far from impenetrable , doubly so if even the very best censoring ISP in the marketplace can be thwarted by anyone who ’s clever enough to search for the method on Google .
There ’s a bigger question still lingering unanswered , however , and it ’s one that the Government has been disinclined to answer for the two years I ’ve been asking it :
What , exactly , are they hoping to achieve with the clean feed ?
Sometimes they tell us that it ’s to protect children from net nasties but the fact that the notorious ACMA blacklist only contains 1300 - odd nasties — of which only half are nasties that have been refused classification ( RC ) — suggests that this is a marginal endeavour .
If their position is that the trillion - URL - internet only hosts 600 –700 blockable URLs , perhaps there ’s a better solution than mandatory filtering ?
If the list of blockable URLs is so small , is there any point to the whole exercise ?
Could the Government use its law enforcement clout to achieve the same result without spending $ 44.5 million on censorboxes ?
Sometimes the Department claims that the clean feed will prevent " accidental exposure " to RC content , whatever that means .
But I ’ve been using the internet virtually every day since 1989 and I ’ve not only never stumbled upon RC content , I ’ve never met anyone else who has done so .
And sometimes Conroy et al assert that we need net censorship to stop the distribution of child porn .
If that is so , this report suggests that stopping the distribution of child porn is an unlikely outcome of the clean feed , given that every single one of the tested systems was able to be circumvented , and , more importantly , that none of them work for any protocol except HTTP .
While Senator Conroy has failed to explain in coherent terms why the Government wants the clean feed , there are plenty of reasons why it ’s a terrible idea :
There ’s no real problem to solve online .
Even if there was , I ca n’t see any serious public demand to solve it .
Even if there was public demand to solve the problem , Conroy ’s report , incomplete as it is , indicates that a clean feed wo n’t do the job .
Even if the clean feed was a workable solution to a problem that does n’t seem to exist , it will be both expensive and unreliable .
Even if the clean feed was a magically technically perfect system , it will be administered by public servants who have trouble spelling HTTP — let alone controlling the content it carries .
And finally , even if a functional net filter was scrupulously administered by experts , it ’s highly likely the blacklist will leak again .
All of which gets us to the crux of the matter : the Government ’s own report demonstrates that easily circumvented censorware is ineffective , and their own experience shows that they ’re , well , completely hopeless at maintaining blacklist confidentiality .
After two years of back and forth on net censorship , it ’s astonishing to find this is the best that Stephen Conroy has got to offer .
Every time you hear someone utter the words " child pornography " in defence of the net filter , remember this : if Conroy seriously wanted to tackle the distribution of child pornography , there ’s no way in hell he ’d propose this policy .

Portland , Oregon , is now an open city .
Following in the footsteps of open cities like San Francisco , Chicago , and Vancouver , BC , Portland ’s Mayor Sam Adams and the City Council today unanimously approved a resolution that directs the City of Portland to open data to outside developers and encourages adoption of open source solutions in technology procurement .
With the ratification of the Portland Economic Development strategy , the City officially recognized the value of the open source in Portland .
Now , with the adoption of the open data and open source resolution , the City has prescribed specific objectives for the municipal government that will help Portland begin the transformation into a government that more willingly embraces open standards , transparency , and more collegial interaction with its open source community .
What does the resolution do ?
At its most basic , it ’s designed to give open source and open data a seat at the table .
The resolution strives to :
Mobilize and expand the regional technology community of software , hardware and service professionals by promoting open and transparent government , open data , and partnership opportunities between the public , private and non-profit sectors , academia and labor
To what end ?
Well , the City hopes to stimulate development and increase the City ’s participation in the vibrant local open source community — as well as the broader open source community for which Portland has served as a de facto — yet rarely officially recognized — hub .
“ It is a collaborative spirit the City is seeking to promote , ” said the Mayor Sam Adams during today ’s council meeting .
To achieve these ends , the resolution calls for the City to publish structured standardized data , adopt open standards , support and encourage the development of open source curricula in Portland schools , and consider open source solutions .
( Need more details on the resolution ?
The entire text of the resolution can be found in the original post , “ Mayor Sam Adams and the City of Portland to open source , open data , and transparency communities : Let ’s make this official . ” )
What if you do n’t really care about the whole open source thing ?
Well , it ’s still going to have an effect on you .
Because opening data to the public brings with it the hopes the public will engage with the municipality to ensure more transparency and great efficiency for your municipal government .
“ This [ resolution ] will increase efficiency in local government … democratize public data itself … and it will foster innovation among Portland ’s world class software community , ” said Skip Newberry with the Mayor ’s Office in his testimony .
No matter which way you look at it , making the decision to be more open is a momentous move by the City .
And one that should bode well for the open source community that calls the City of Portland home .
Now , the hard work begins .
Both from the City ’s perspective in terms of making this data accessible and from the perspective of those who would like to access that data .
But at the very least , the City is marching forward — and defining objectives .
Here ’s hoping that effort continues to gain momentum .
Well done , Portland .
And congratulations on your new status as an open city .
Once again , I ’m swelling with pride at what you ’ve been able to accomplish .
Now , let ’s roll up our sleeves and get to work .

CPJ survey finds at least 68 journalists killed in 2009
Family members of journalists killed in the Maguindanao massacre .
( Reuters )
New York , December 17 , 2009 — At least 68 journalists worldwide were killed for their work in 2009 , the highest yearly tally ever documented by the Committee to Protect Journalists , the organization said in its year - end analysis .
The record toll was driven in large part by the election - related slaughter of more than 30 media workers in the Philippine province of Maguindanao , the deadliest event for the press in CPJ history .
The worldwide tally surpasses the previous record of 67 deaths , set in 2007 when violence in Iraq was pervasive and media fatalities there were common .
CPJ is still investigating 20 other journalist deaths worldwide in 2009 to determine whether they were work - related .
“ This has been a year of unprecedented devastation for the world ’s media , but the violence also confirms long - term trends , ” said CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon .
“ Most of the victims were local reporters covering news in their own communities .
The perpetrators assumed , based on precedent , that they would never be punished .
Whether the killings are in Iraq or the Philippines , in Russia or Mexico , changing this assumption is the key to reducing the death toll . ”
The enormity of the Philippine massacre is unparalleled .
Twenty - nine journalists and two support workers were among the 57 people brutally murdered in a November ambush motivated by political clan rivalries .
The deadliest prior event for the press came in Iraq in October 2006 , when 11 employees of Al - Shaabiya television were killed in an attack on the station ’s Baghdad studios , CPJ research shows .
The Maguindanao killings , while extreme , reflect the deep - seated climate of impunity in the Philippines , where long - term law enforcement and political failures have led to high numbers of journalist murders and low rates of convictions over two decades .
For two years running , CPJ has identified the Philippines as one of the world ’s worst nations in combating violence against the press .
“ The killings in the Philippines are a shocking but not entirely surprising product of a long - term reality :
The government has allowed unpunished violence against journalists , most of it politically motivated , to become part of the culture , ” said Bob Dietz , CPJ ’s Asia program coordinator .
“ The Maguindanao massacre could serve as a turning point for the Philippines if its leaders can gather the political will to see that the perpetrators are brought to justice .
If it is business as usual , we will continue to see journalists killed in the years to come . ”
Already , CPJ and other press freedom groups are concerned about the integrity of the Maguindanao investigation .
A report by four local press groups found that the crime scene had not been well preserved , that potential witnesses had been intimidated , and that the investigation was poorly coordinated .
One law enforcement official told CPJ that he and his colleagues have insufficient resources and inadequate security to carry out the probe .
In its worldwide analysis , CPJ also found notable shifts in the risks in combat zones .
Deaths in Iraq continued a significant downward trend : Four Iraqi journalists were killed during the year , the lowest annual tally since the war began in 2003 .

But violence soared in Somalia , where nine local journalists were murdered or killed in combat situations .
Throughout 2009 , Al - Shabaab militants waged a terror campaign against the Somali press , murdering journalists and seizing news outlets .
Among the victims was Said Tahlil Ahmed , director of the independent broadcaster HornAfrik , who was gunned down as he and other journalists were walking through Mogadishu ’s Bakara Market to a press conference .
“ The nine deaths in Somalia are a tremendous loss for the tiny band of journalists who risk their lives every day just by stepping out into the street , ” said CPJ Deputy Director Robert Mahoney , who helps oversee CPJ advocacy in the region .
“ Their courageous reporting exposes them not just to crossfire and random violence but to targeted killing by Islamists who want to control the message . ”
Four journalists were killed in Pakistan during the year , among them Musa Khankhel , a local television reporter known for his critical coverage .
Abducted while covering a peace march in a militant - controlled area near the town of Matta , Khankel was tortured and then shot repeatedly .
As in past years , murder was the leading cause of work - related deaths in 2009 .
At least 50 journalists were targeted and slain in retaliation for their work , representing about three - quarters of the deaths in 2009 .
Eleven journalists were killed in crossfire while in combat situations , while seven died while covering dangerous assignments such as police raids or street protests .
Many of the deadliest nations for the press in 2009 have long - term records of violence against journalists and high rates of impunity in those attacks .
At a Moscow rally on journalist killings , a woman holds a sign that says “ Speak Up ! ” ( CPJ )
Three journalists were murdered in Russia , which has had a high media fatality rate over two decades .
The 2009 victims included Abdulmalik Akhmedilov , a Dagestani editor who sharply criticized government officials for suppressing religious and political dissent .
He was found shot , contract - style , in his car .
In September , CPJ issued a report , Anatomy of Injustice , that examined the high number of unsolved journalist murders in Russia and prompted government pledges to re-examine several cases .
Two journalists were slain in both Mexico and Sri Lanka .
In Durango state , Mexico , assailants abducted crime reporter Eliseo Barrón Hernández from his home as his wife and two young daughters watched .
His body , a gunshot wound to the head , was found the next day in an irrigation ditch .
Barrón had just broken a story about police corruption .
Retribution was also the suspected motive in the slaying of Lasantha Wickramatunga , a Sri Lankan editor known for his critical reporting on the government .
Eight helmeted men on four motorcycles forced Wickramatunga ’s car to the side of a busy street outside Colombo and beat him with iron bars and wooden poles .
Here are other trends and details that emerged in CPJ ’s analysis :
• The 2009 toll is up more than 60 percent from the 42 deaths recorded in 2008 .
• All but two of the 2009 victims were local journalists .
While local reporters have long been more vulnerable to deadly violence than their foreign counterparts , the divide has never been wider in CPJ ’s annual assessment .
• Print journalists constituted 56 percent of the toll , indicating that print media continue to play a front - line role in reporting the news in dangerous situations .
Although CPJ research has found a notable decline in the number of print journalists in jail , it has charted no comparable drop in fatalities among print reporters , editors , and photographers .
• In addition to the murders in Maguindanao , CPJ recorded three other work - related deaths in the Philippines in 2009 .
In all , 32 journalists and two support workers were killed in the country during the year .
• Two journalists died of neglect or mistreatment while imprisoned on work - related charges .
Novruzali Mamedov died in an Azerbaijani prison after being denied adequate medical care , while Iranian blogger Omidreza Mirsayafi died in Evin Prison under circumstances that were never fully explained .
• At least two journalists were reported missing during the year , one in Mexico and the other in Yemen .
• Nine freelance journalists were among the 2009 victims .
The proportion of freelancers was consistent with past years .
• Other places with media fatalities were : Afghanistan , Colombia , El Salvador , Indonesia , Kenya , Madagascar , Nepal , Nigeria , the Occupied Palestinian Territory , and Venezuela .
CPJ began compiling detailed records on all journalist deaths in 1992 .
CPJ staff members apply strict criteria for each entry ; researchers independently investigate and verify the circumstances behind each death .
CPJ considers a case work - related only when its staff is reasonably certain that a journalist was killed in direct reprisal for his or her work ; in crossfire ; or while carrying out a dangerous assignment .
If the motives in a killing are unclear , but it is possible that a journalist died in relation to his or her work , CPJ classifies the case as “ unconfirmed ” and continues to investigate .
CPJ ’s list does not include journalists who died in accidents — such as car or plane crashes — unless the crash was caused by hostile action .
Other press organizations using different criteria cite higher numbers of deaths than CPJ .
CPJ ’s database of journalists killed for their work in 2009 includes capsule reports on each victim and a statistical analysis .
CPJ also maintains a database of all journalists killed since 1992 .
A final list of journalists killed in 2009 will be released in early January .
At Bryan Caplan ’s blog this morning there was an odd comment that stirred up a 40 - year old memory :
A single sentence in the Durants ’
The Age of Napoleon makes me wonder whether I can trust a word they write on economic policy :
The memory is that it was reading another part of the Durant ’s Story of Civilization ( of which tAoN is volume 11 ) back in grade school , I stumbled on a passage which was the very first in any book of any kind in which I realized that the authors could let their political preconceptions alter their interpretation of their subject .
What they wrote , as I recall it very inexactly 40 years later , was to the effect that western civilization had progressed in a grand upward sweep since the time of the ancient Greeks , pausing only in the years 1952 - 1960 — which of course the Eisenhower administration .
( This was written before Nixon was elected . )
I had previously believed that if something was written in a book , it was authoritatively true .
This little gem was so blatantly silly that you could n’t possibly take it seriously .
Books were n’t Truth , after all .
It was a defining moment in my intellectual life , something like learning the truth about Santa Claus .
I had some of the same feelings , roughly a decade ago , to learn that the scientific establishment would attack ideas , in this case the notion of diamondoid machinery and mechanosynthesis , using blather , appeal to authority , and various other fallacies , when they knew they did n’t have valid scientific arguments .
It was all in aid of getting funding and retaining prestige , and not the search for truth .
There was never a “ nanogate ” so we will probably never know to what extent the nanotech “ in - group ” fudged , colluded , or simply used the old - boy network to marginalize their rivals .
It would be just as clueless as the Durants to claim that there was a broad sweep of progress in nanotechnology except from 1996 to 2005 .
But it ’s also a bit disingenuous to claim , as some commentators have , to be “ shocked — shocked ! ” to find that kind of thing going on in climate science .
Unlike some people , we at Foresight have n’t been overly focussed on the sturm und drang of science politics .
A major reason is that in the long run , it does n’t matter .
If diamondoid machines can be built , and it ’s highly likely they can , there is little chance that they wo n’t be sometime in the coming century .
So no matter what the specifics of any given debate , it ’s a good idea to look at things like the Industrial Revolution to understand the coming century of technological innovation .
One thing that Climategate does is give us an opportunity to step back from the details of the AGW argument and say , maybe these are heat - of - the - moment stuff , and in the long run will look as silly as the Durants ’ allergy to Eisenhower .
And perhaps , if we can put climate arguments in perspective , it will allow us to put the much smaller nano arguments ( pun intended ) into perspective too .
So let ’s look at some ice .
I ’m looking at the temperature record as read from this central Greenland ice core .
It gives us about as close as we can come to a direct , experimental measurement of temperature at that one spot for the past 50,000 years .
As far as I know , the data are not adjusted according to any fancy computer climate model or anything else like that .
So what does it tell us about , say , the past 500 years ?
( the youngest datum is age =0.0951409 ( thousand years before present ) — perhaps younger snow does n’t work so well ? ) :
Well , whaddaya know — a hockey stick .
In fact , the “ blade ” continues up in the 20th century at least another half a degree .
But how long is the handle ?
How unprecedented is the current warming trend ?
Yes , Virginia , there was a Medieval Warm Period , in central Greenland at any rate .
But we knew that — that ’s when the Vikings were naming it Greenland , after all .
And the following Little Ice Age is what killed them off , and caused widespread crop failures ( and the consequent burning of witches ) across Europe .
But was the MWP itself unusual ?
Well , no — over the period of recorded history , the average temperature was about equal to the height of the MWP .
Rises not only as high , but as rapid , as the current hockey stick blade have been the rule , not the exception .
In fact for the entire Holocene — the period over which , by some odd coincidence , humanity developed agriculture and civilization — the temperature has been higher than now , and the trend over the past 4000 years is a marked decline .
From this perspective , it ’s the LIA that was unusual , and the current warming trend simply represents a return to the mean .
If it lasts .
From the perspective of the Holocene as a whole , our current hockeystick is beginning to look pretty dinky .
By far the possibility I would worry about , if I were the worrying sort , would be the return to an ice age — since interglacials , over the past half million years or so , have tended to last only 10,000 years or so .
And Ice ages are not conducive to agriculture .
… and ice ages have a better claim on being the natural state of Earth ’s climate than interglacials .
This next graph , for the longest period , we have to go to an Antarctic core ( Vostok ) :
In other words , we ’re pretty lucky to be here during this rare , warm period in climate history .
But the broader lesson is , climate does n’t stand still .
It does n’t even stand stay on the relatively constrained range of the last 10,000 years for more than about 10,000 years at a time .
Does this mean that CO2 is n’t a greenhouse gas ?
No .
Does it mean that it is n’t warming ?
No .
Does it mean that we should n’t develop clean , efficient technology that gets its energy elsewhere than burning fossil fuels ?
Of course not .
We should do all those things for many reasons — but there ’s plenty of time to do them the right way , by developing nanotech .
( There ’s plenty of money , too , but it ’s all going to climate science at the moment .
🙂 )
And that will be a very good thing to have done if we do fall back into an ice age , believe me .
For climate science it means that the Hockey Team climatologists ’ insistence that human - emitted CO2 is the only thing that could account for the recent warming trend is probably poppycock .
And that , if you will allow me to return full circle , means that the Fat Fingers argument is probably poppycock too .
U.S. leadership is crucial .
That is why I am encouraged by the spirit of compromise shown in the bipartisan initiative announced last week by John Kerry and Lindsey Graham .
Here was a pair of U.S. senators — one Republican , the other Democratic — coming together to bridge their parties ’ differences to address climate change in a spirit of genuine give - and - take .
We cannot afford another period where the United States stands on the sidelines .
An engaged United States can lead the world to seal a deal to combat climate change in Copenhagen .
An indecisive or insufficiently engaged United States will cause unnecessary — and ultimately unaffordable — delay in concrete strategies and policies to beat this looming challenge .
Leaders across the globe are increasingly showing the engagement and leadership we need .
Last month , President Barack Obama joined more than 100 others at a climate change summit at U.N. headquarters in New York — sending a clear message of solidarity and commitment .
So did the leaders of China , Japan and South Korea , all of whom pledged to promote the development of clean energy technologies and ensure that Copenhagen is a success .
Japan ’s prime minister promised a 25 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2020 , laying down a marker for other industrialized nations .
The European Union , too , has pledged to make a 30 percent reduction as part of a global agreement .
Norway has announced its readiness for a 40 percent cut in emissions .
Brazil has unveiled plans to substantially cut emissions from deforestation .
India and China are implanting programs to curb emissions as well .
Looking forward to Copenhagen , I have four benchmarks for success :
Every country must do its utmost to reduce emissions from all major sources , including from deforestation and emissions from shipping and aviation .
Developed countries must strengthen their mid-term mitigation targets , which are currently nowhere close to the cuts that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says are needed .
Developing countries must slow the rise in their emissions and accelerate green growth as part of their strategies to reduce poverty .
The love and hatred of cycling can bring together strange bedfellows , as demonstrated last night at the Spectator magazine 's debate on the subject , chaired by the broadcaster , Andrew Neil .
Arguing against the motion that " Cyclists are a menace " were both Ken Livingstone and one of his least favourite journalists , Andrew Gilligan - a man who has referred to the former London mayor as " dishonest " and " arrogant " .
As Gilligan put it : " Us agreeing with each other seems about as likely as Imelda Marcos sending her shoes to the menders rather than buying a new pair . "
But on the other side too there was a strange alliance , between wild - eyed Daily Mail writer David Thomas and Labour MP Stephen Pound .
From Thomas we had the usual joyless speech about " lycra loonies " and " louts " , " driver baiting " and fevered images of lines of poor motorists stuck on country lanes behind plodding cyclists .
" Motorists are an easy target , " he lathered , because of their licences and insurance - while cyclists get away with whatever they want .
" To a cyclist , a red light is merely a way of bringing a dash of colour to a city street . "
Few here will subscribe to Pound 's arguments either I suspect , but his entertaining rant was good theatre and at least had a dash of originality .
He denounced the headphone - wearing " lycra- clad velociraptors " who speed around the streets .
" Who knows what they are listening to ?
The Killers certainly .
Definitely not the Archers . "
And he implored reasonable cyclists to turn on the antisocial minority .
On the pro-cycling side of the debate , the arguments were less colourful , but ultimately more convincing ( although as a cyclist , I suppose I would say that ) .
Cyclists make up around 2 % of the traffic in the London rush hour but they cause just 1 % of injuries to pedestrians - almost all of them minor .
And of the 204 people killed on London roads last year none was killed by a cyclist .
In fact a cyclist has not been responsible for a road death in London for the previous eight years either .
That alone demonstrates cyclists are not the road menace they are sometimes painted as , said Gilligan .
" To be a real menace you need more hardware . "
And he implored the non-cyclists in the crowd : " Instead of hating us , you should join us .
You would have nothing to lose but your trains . "
Livingstone confided that his special branch officer had advised against cycling .
" [ He said ] I really do n't think you should ride a bike because so many people hate you .
Someone is bound to run you off the road . "
But he predicted that once cycling reached a critical mass , a step change would occur in terms of attitudes to cyclists by other road users - as has happened in cities such as Cambridge and Copenhagen .
The proposing side 's secret weapon though was Baroness Sharples , who famously accosted a cyclist with her bag because he 'd illegally sped through a pedestrian crossing outside Parliament .
" I did n't hurt him .
It was a very small shopping bag and it was very light , " she said .
Her point was that cyclists who do n't follow the rules of the road are frightening to older people and those with limited mobility .
She wanted to see more courtesy from everyone .
On the night , the audience trounced her side of the debate , voting by 96 to 45 against the motion that " cyclists are a menace " .
But I suspect few people would argue with what she had to say - particularly if she was carrying a handbag .
The 3 Most Neglected Aspects of Preparing for Retirement
I recently interviewed Craig Israelsen , a Personal and Family professor at Brigham Young University , and one of the authors of Your Nest Egg Game Plan : How to Get Your Finances Back on Track and Create a Lifetime Income Stream [ Buy at Amazon ] .
One of the questions I asked him was this :
In your experience , what is the most neglected aspect of preparing for retirement ?
“ I ’m going to cheat and give you three things , ” Israelsen replied .
His insights provide some helpful information about getting ready for retirement , and how you can increase the chances that you will be able to retire comfortably and do a little more of what you want .
Here are the three things that Israelsen believes are most neglected when people start thinking about retirement .
# 1 : Not Doing Enough
“ This is really obvious , ” Israelsen told me .
“ But one of the worst things you can do is to not do enough .
Most people either start too late , or do n’t put away enough . ”
He went on to explain that , many people do n’t realize the benefits of putting money into a retirement plan as soon as possible .
Additionally , he cautions against not putting in enough .
“ If you want to buy an annuity , ” he explained , “ you need to have at least $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 so that you can carve that investment out . ”
Israelsen recommends thinking about retirement now , no matter your age .
Think about Social Security , and recognize that while it will help , it will not be able to come close to replacing your income .
Estimate how much income you will need each month , and work out a plan to save up enough .
He also says that you need to think about how your nest egg will behave when it comes to taking distributions .
Finally , Israelsen told me that it is vital that those with company matches take full advantage of them .
“ Part of not putting enough money in your retirement accounts is not taking advantage of employer match programs .
You ’re leaving free money on the table .
Max out your employer match , and use that to grow your retirement funds . ”
# 2 : Getting Out of Debt
“ You do n’t need as much if you have no debt , ” Israelsen pointed out .
And he ’s right .
If you do n’t have monthly debt obligations ( and this includes your mortgage ) , then you can get by on surprisingly little , and still have enough left over to travel or do some other things .
“ Debt reduction is a huge part of preparing for retirement , and many people neglect this .
If you have a small nest egg , and no debt , it is usually possible to work something out .
A medium sized nest egg , and a lot of debt , is n’t doable . ”
In order to limit the amount of debt that you have , Israelsen recommends living within your means .
“ Think about what it ’s important in your life .
Having lots of things really does n’t matter in the grand scheme .
Instead , put yourself in a position to live modestly now , and then live modestly in retirement . ”
Living within your means , and paying down your debt , can be one of the most important things you do to get ready for a prosperous retirement .
# 3 Figuring Out Want You Want To Do
“ I hear from people all the time who just talk about generalities when it comes to retirement , ” Israelsen commented .
“ I ’m going to retire .
Yes , but what are you going to do ? ”
He recommends that you start when you are younger to think about what you would like to do .
Whether it ’s volunteer work , spending time visiting your grandchildren , traveling the world , or developing a hobby or skill , you should have an idea of what you want to do , and how much money you will need to do it .
“ We were n’t put on Earth to watch TV , ” Israelsen pointed out , “ but if you do n’t have some sort of idea of what you want to do , and how you are going to do it , that ’s what you ’ll end up doing . ”
With proper planning — and the earlier you start the better — you are more likely to retire with enough of a nest egg to create the income stream you need to do what you want .
And that ’s something worth thinking about .
( Disclosure : I received a free copy of Nest Egg Game Plan to review .
I was not compensated in any way to interview Israelsen or share portions of the interview . )
Researchers report that the human body has an entirely unique and separate sensory system aside from the nerves that give most of us the ability to touch and feel .
Surprisingly , this sensory network is located throughout our blood vessels and sweat glands , and is for most people , largely imperceptible .
This discovery may shed light on the causes of unexplained chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia .
The human sensory experience is far more complex and nuanced than previously thought , according to a groundbreaking new study published in the December 15 issue of the journal Pain .
In the article , researchers at Albany Medical College , the University of Liverpool and Cambridge University report that the human body has an entirely unique and separate sensory system aside from the nerves that give most of us the ability to touch and feel .
Surprisingly , this sensory network is located throughout our blood vessels and sweat glands , and is for most people , largely imperceptible .
" It 's almost like hearing the subtle sound of a single instrument in the midst of a symphony , " said senior author Frank Rice , PhD , a Neuroscience Professor at Albany Medical College ( AMC ) , who is a leading authority on the nerve supply to the skin .
" It is only when we shift focus away from the nerve endings associated with normal skin sensation that we can appreciate the sensation hidden in the background . "
The research team discovered this hidden sensory system by studying two unique patients who were diagnosed with a previously unknown abnormality by lead author David Bowsher , M.D. , Honorary Senior Research Fellow at the University of Liverpool 's Pain Research Institute .
These patients had an extremely rare condition called congenital insensitivity to pain , meaning that they were born with very little ability to feel pain .
Other rare individuals with this condition have excessively dry skin , often mutilate themselves accidentally and usually have severe mental handicaps .
" Although they had a few accidents over their lifetimes , what made these two patients unique was that they led normal lives .
Excessive sweating brought them to the clinic , where we discovered their severe lack of pain sensation , " said Dr. Bowsher .
" Curiously , our conventional tests with sensitive instruments revealed that all their skin sensation was severely impaired , including their response to different temperatures and mechanical contact .
But , for all intents and purposes , they had adequate sensation for daily living and could tell what is warm and cold , what is touching them , and what is rough and smooth . "
The mystery deepened when Dr. Bowsher sent skin biopsies across the ocean to Dr. Rice 's laboratory , which focuses on multi-molecular microscopic analyses of nerve endings in the skin , especially in relation to chronic pain conditions such as those caused by nerve injuries , diabetes , and shingles .
These unique analyses were pioneered by Dr. Rice at Albany Medical College ( AMC ) along with collaborators at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm , Sweden .
" Under normal conditions , the skin contains many different types of nerve endings that distinguish between different temperatures , different types of mechanical contact such as vibrations from a cell phone and movement of hairs , and , importantly , painful stimuli , " said Dr. Rice .
" Much to our surprise , the skin we received from England lacked all the nerve endings that we normally associated with skin sensation .
So how were these individuals feeling anything ? "
The answer appeared to be in the presence of sensory nerve endings on the small blood vessels and sweat glands embedded in the skin .
" For many years , my colleagues and I have detected different types of nerve endings on tiny blood vessels and sweat glands , which we assumed were simply regulating blood flow and sweating .
We did n't think they could contribute to conscious sensation .
However , while all the other sensory endings were missing in this unusual skin , the blood vessels and sweat glands still had the normal types of nerve endings .
Apparently , these unique individuals are able to ' feel things ' through these remaining nerve endings , " said Dr. Rice .
" What we learned from these unusual individuals is that there 's another level of sensory feedback that can give us conscious tactile information .
Problems with these nerve endings may contribute to mysterious pain conditions such as migraine headaches and fibromyalgia , the sources of which are still unknown , making them very difficult to treat . "

Plants have systems for keeping their six - legged inhabitants in check
In Africa and in the tropics , armies of tiny creatures make the twisting stems of acacia plants their homes .
Aggressive , stinging ants feed on the sugary nectar the plant provides and live in nests protected by its thick bark .
This is the world of " ant guards " .
The acacias might appear overrun by them , but the plants have the ants wrapped around their little stems .
Acacias ... have very open flowers , but still , the ants do n't seem to go on to them .
We wanted to know why
Nigel Raine , Royal Holloway
These same plants that provide shelter and produce nourishing nectar to feed the insects also make chemicals that send them into a defensive frenzy , forcing them into retreat .
Nigel Raine , a scientist working at Royal Holloway , University of London in the UK has studied this plant - ant relationship .
Dr Raine and his colleagues from the universities of St Andrews , Edinburgh and Reading in the UK and Lund University in Sweden have been trying to work out some of the ways in which the insects and the acacias might have co-evolved .
He explains how the ants provide a useful service for the acacias .
" They guard the plants they live on , " said Dr Raine .
" If other animals try to come and feed on the rich , sugary nectar , they will attack them . "
In Africa , one type of ant - guard , known as Crematogaster , will even attack large herbivores that attempt to eat the plant .
Ants will fiercely guard their acacia homes " If a giraffe starts to eat the leaves of an acacia that is inhabited by ants , the ants will come out and swarm on to its face , biting and stinging , " says Dr Raine .
" Eventually , the giraffe will get fed up and move off . "
In the New World tropics , the Pseudomyrmex genus of ants fulfil a very similar guarding role .
For both species , the acacias provide little , reinforced structures that the ants hollow out and nest within , as well as sugar - rich nectar for them to eat .
" In return , both groups of ants protect their host plants from herbivores - both hungry insects and larger [ animals ] , " explains Dr Raine .
Give and take
That is the plus side for the plants .
But being inhabited by aggressive insects could make one important aspect of a plant 's life difficult - flowering .
Flowers need to be pollinated so the plant can reproduce .
So what stops the ants from attacking the helpful little pollinators or stealing all the tasty nectar that attracts them ?
" Some plants do this structurally , with physical barriers to stop ants getting on to the flower , or sticky or slippery surfaces that the insects can't walk on , " said Dr Raine .
" Acacias do n't have these barriers .
They have very open flowers , but still , the ants do n't seem to go on to them .
We wanted to know why . "
One clever approach by the plant is a food " bribe " .
" Extrafloral nectaries " are small stores of nectar on stems , from which the inhabitants can feed without going on to the flowers .
Acacias also produce structures called beltian bodies on the leaf tips .
Ants protect the leaves from large herbivores
These , Dr Raine explains , are nutritious structures produced by the plant to feed its resident colony of ant - guards .
But when this is n't enough , it is a case of chemical warfare .
Flowers can produce a variety of chemicals .
We can smell some of the volatile organic compounds they release when we sniff our favourite summer bloom .
But there is a more manipulative side to these scents .
Floral volatile compounds can act as signals - drawing in pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds in with their irresistible aromas .
To the ants , however , they are far from irresistible .
" The flowers seem to produce chemicals that are repellent to the ants , " said Dr Raine .
" They release these particularly during the time when they 're producing lots of pollen , so the ants are kept off the flowers . "
In recent studies , described in the journal Functional Ecology , Dr Raine and his colleagues found that the plants with the closest relationships with ants - those that provided homes for their miniature guard army - produced the chemicals that were most effective at keeping the ants at bay .
" And that was associated with the flower being open , " he says .
" So the chemicals are probably in the pollen . "
A bribe : Plants provide " nectaries " on their stems
When the pollen has all been taken away - by being brushed on to the bodies of hungry pollinators and helpfully delivered to other plants - the flowers become less repellent .
" So at this point , the ants can come on to the flowers and can protect them from other insects that might eat them , so that the developing seeds are n't lost , " he explains .
Dr Raines ' team was able to test this using young flowers that had just opened and that contained lots of pollen .
The scientists wiped them on older flowers and on the acacia 's stems .
This showed them that the effect was " transferrable " - the stems and older flowers that had been wiped became more repellent .
" It gives this really neat feedback system - the plant is protected when it needs to be protected , but not when it does n't . "
Selective deterrents
The repellent chemicals are specific to the ants .
In fact , they attract and repel different groups of insects .
" [ The chemicals ] do n't repel bees , even though they are quite closely related to ants .
And in some cases , the chemicals actually seem to attract the bees , " says Dr Raine .
The researchers think that some of the repellents that acacias produce are chemical " mimics " of signalling pheromones that the ants use to communicate .
" We put flowers into syringes and puffed the scent over the ant to see how they would respond , and they became quite agitated and aggressive " he explained .
" The ants use a pheromone to signal danger ; if they 're being attacked by a bird they will release that chemical that will quickly tell the other ants to retreat . "
Dr Raine says this clever evolutionary system shows how the ants and their plants have evolved to protect , control and manipulate each other .
The ants may be quick to swarm , bite and sting , but the harmless - looking acacias have remained one step ahead .

The National Physical Laboratory has deployed a range of techniques to create the world 's smallest snowman - a diminutive fellow just 10 µm across , or " 1/5th the width of a human hair " .
The NPL explains : " The snowman was made from two tin beads used to calibrate electron microscope astigmatism .
The eyes and smile were milled using a focused ion beam , and the nose , which is under 1 µm wide ( or 0.001 mm ) , is ion beam deposited platinum .
" A nanomanipulation system was used to assemble the parts ' by hand ' and platinum deposition was used to weld all elements together .
The snowman is mounted on a silicon cantilever from an atomic force microscope whose sharp tip ' feels ' surfaces creating topographic surveys at almost atomic scales . "
Sadly , the NPL appears to currently lack the technology to create a nanocarrot or miniature Santa hat , but we have no doubt it 's working on a deposited platinum system capable of tackling these decorative shortcomings . ®
The rules state information must be relevant , up to date and not excessive Five police forces which challenged a ruling that they should delete records on criminal convictions from their database have won their appeal .
The court of appeal said convictions , however old and however minor , can be of value in the fight against crime .
The court said that as a result the retention of that information should not be denied to the police .
The forces said if they had lost , they may have been forced to delete details of as many as one million people .
The police added if the original ruling had been upheld , the result would have been a " liars ' charter " - where people would be able to deny criminal convictions on job applications if they knew the deletion deadline had passed .
' However old or minor '
Three judges ruled that retaining information was far easier to justify than actually disclosing the information to others .
" If the police say rationally and reasonably that convictions , however old or minor , have a value in the work that they do , that should , in effect , be the end of the matter , " said Lord Justice Waller , sitting with Lord Justices Carnwath and Hughes .
The appeal was made by the chief constables of the Humberside , Staffordshire , Northumbria , West Midlands and Greater Manchester forces .
This data assists police officers in their work in preventing crime and protecting the public
Acpo
Send us your comments
The five convicted people who had contested the case were refused permission to appeal to the Supreme Court .
The Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) welcomed the ruling , adding that " the ramifications of losing the appeal were potentially huge " .
Ian Readhead , Acpo director of information , told the BBC : " This data assists police officers in their work in preventing crime and protecting the public and the loss of such valuable information would have been detrimental to that .
" Although principally used for police purposes , these records are also critical to the courts , the Criminal Records Bureau , the Independent Safeguarding Agency , the Crown Prosecution Service and the Home Office , who all supported this appeal . "
But Anna Fairclough , a lawyer for the civil rights group Liberty , said the judgement " forgets the privacy rights of millions of people " .
She said : " Exceptions to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act and the net of employment vetting are being cast so wide that people will be forever haunted by the minor indiscretions of their youth .
" We need a tighter rein on the circumstances when spent convictions can be disclosed . "
Held for 100 years
The original ruling came about after five people complained to the information commissioner because their criminal records showed up when they applied for jobs .
One of the cases was a record held by Humberside Police about the theft of a 99 p packet of meat in 1984 .
The person involved , who was under 18 at the time , was fined £ 15 .
Another , held by West Midlands Police , referred to a theft which took place more than 25 years ago , for which the individual was fined £ 25 .
And a third , held by Staffordshire Police , related to someone under 14 who was cautioned for a minor assault .
Under current policy , criminal records remain on the police national computer for up to 100 years .

Black Friday sales figures wo n't come in for several more days , but we 've already got some very good news to report .
No one died at Wal - Mart .
During Black Friday 2008 , shoppers trampled a worker to death on their way into the store .
Thanks to beefed - up security that did n't happen this year .
( See the cattle - herding fences , bullhorns , and guys in ominious black hoodies in the post - apocalpytic pic on the right . )
See the NYT 's slide show , featuring more photos by Robert Stolarik >
It appears a contract between righthander John Lackey and the Red Sox is inevitable , if it ’s not already complete .
Depending on who you want to believe , the veteran Angels pitcher has agreed to a five - year deal with Boston for $ 85 million ( so says Jon Heyman of Sports Illustrated ) or worth slightly more than $ 82.5 ( so says Jayson Stark of ESPN ) .
Either way , finalizing the deal appears to be a formality .
Lackey took a physical with the Red Sox this morning , and players do n’t fly to a city in the dead of winter unless they ’re planning to sign .
If the deal is indeed complete , signing the 31 - year - old righthander would be in line with Theo Epstein saying he would look to improve the team in ways beyond adding offense .

A rotation of Jon Lester , Josh Beckett , Lackey , Daisuke Matsuzaka , and Clay Buchholz or Tim Wakefield would be better than what the Yankees have right now in CC Sabathia , A.J. Burnett , Andy Pettitte , TBA , TBA .
The deal , if there is one , also could be precursor to Buchholz being made available via trade .
The Adrian Gonzalez drums will beat louder now .
Lackey was said to be seeking a Burnett - type deal , and it appears he got one .
The Yankees gave him five years and $ 82.5 million last winter .
Lackey is 102-71 in his career with a 3.81 ERA .
He is a low - maintenance “ I want the ball ” type of starter who missed about five starts last season with assorted health issues , including a sore elbow that shelved him at the start of the season .
But he was sharp in the playoffs , allowing five earned runs on 19 hits over 19 2/3 innings while striking out 14 .
He was the winning pitcher in Game 7 of the 2002 World Series during his rookie season , and according to baseball - reference.com , the pitcher he is most similar to in baseball history is none other than Beckett .
He has struggled in his career at Fenway , for what it ’s worth , going 2 - 5 with a 5.75 ERA in nine starts .
But that was against the Red Sox .

The news that the Red Sox were closing in on a deal with Lackey was broken by FoxSports ’ Ken Rosenthal , who confirmed an earlier Twitter report by Ed Price of AOL Fanhouse .
UPDATE , 1:46 p.m. :
The most interesting aspect of this deal could be the impact it has on teams interesting in trading for Roy Halladay .
Signing Lackey also helps protect the Red Sox in the event Beckett leaves as a free agent following the 2010 season .
I saw a lot of Lackey last season , covering three Angels - Yankees series during the regular season and both playoffs series the Angels were in .
He ’s not the most elegant starter you ’ll ever see , but he keeps his teams in games and the Angels loved playing behind him .
This move would hurt the Angels badly .
UPDATE , 2:09 p.m. : George King of the Post suggests that Lackey going to Boston will decrease the desire for the Yankees to chase Roy Halladay .
King believes the Yankees were motivated to keep Halladay away from the Red Sox , much as was the case with Johan Santana .
But look for the Angels to make a deal for Halladay now .
If Lackey is out , they need him .
( Note :
There are multiple reports this afternoon that Halladay is headed to Philadelphia in a three - way deal that will send Cliff Lee to the Mariners . )

Multi-process plugins come to Firefox
The ability to run tabs , plugins and even extensions in separate process is one of the strongest points of Chrome .
Nearly everyone might have experienced an unfortunate browser crash in the middle of a browsing session , and cursed some unstable website or plugin .
While Google Chrome surely does mitigate these disasters by limiting the crash to the offending page or pugin , the browser itself is prone to crashes too , which in the case of Chrome are made worse by the lack of a good session management system .
Just as Chrome took on support for extensions and themes to gain further parity with Firefox 's features , now Firefox is fighting back by incorporating one of the most popular of Chrome 's features .
In the latest nightly version of Firefox released just yesterday , is a feature which allows for running plugins in separate processes .
A simple change in the " about : config " page on the latest Firefox Nightly ( Minefield ) will now launch plugin process separate from the browser , and it would appear there will soon be support fro running tabs that way too .
From what it appears , Firefox will be using a lot of the same code Chrome uses to achieve this so as not to reinvent the wheel .
Do n't you just love open source !
This is all part of the Electrolysis project which aims to bring out of process plugins and tabs to Firefox , and developers have been busy from quite some time testing the functionality , this seem to be the first time it has appeared on the Firefox nightlies .
If you want to test out this exciting functionality download a nightly build of Firefox from here , and set the dom.ipc.plugins.enabled property in your about : config to true .
After a restart you will notice that your plugins load in a separate " mozilla-runtime.exe " process .
This functionality is fresh out of development and is still very very buggy !
Some of the bugs might make Firefox unusable , such as the lack of support for plugins which are loaded from a path with spaces , i.e. all plugins but Flash ( this will probably be fixed by tomorrow ) .
Right now there is no indication that a plugin has crashed , and all the browser shows is a black box in place .
There is also no way to restart the plugin after a crash , and you will have to restart the whole browser instead .
If you are indeed brave enough to test it though , do report bugs and crashes to help make this feature better faster .
HINT : Try forcefully " crashing " your plugins by killing the " mozilla-runtime.exe " if the damn things just wont crash when you need it !

Educators suspended over freezing death of student By Wang Yan ( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-12-25 08:03
Two school principals were suspended from duty after being held responsible for a student 's death , suspected to have been caused by severe punishment .
Yang Guangsheng , principal of Wujing Junior Middle School in Linqu county of Shandong province , and vice - principal Wang Dongping , were relieved of their posts on Tuesday night for poor school management , local media reported yesterday .
The suspension was based on the findings of a government investigation team probing the controversial student death last Friday .
Student Zhang Jixin , 14 , was found dead in the gutter near his dormitory building on the morning of Dec 18 .
Local media quoted insiders as saying that Zhang was made to stand out in the cold all night as a punishment and froze to death .
Zhang was caught by one of the teachers on the evening of Dec 17 , trying to climb the dormitory wall , the Wuhan Evening News reported .
The teacher who punished him allegedly went drinking and forgot about Zhang .
The next morning Zhang was found dead .
The temperature was - 10 C the previous night , the report said .
Another teacher from the school reportedly said the student had " died comfortably " .
" He looked comfortable , without any pain on the face , " the teacher was quoted as saying .
The remark soon triggered enormous criticism from members of the Chinese online community .
The teacher is reported to have temporarily left his job because of the mounting pressure on him .
However , Linqu police said Zhang 's death was accidental .
" We tend to believe Zhang 's death was caused primarily by unknown health problems .
But there 's still a possibility that the freezing contributed to his death , " police said in a statement .
Police said Zhang was found lying in the gutter , wearing dark jackets and sports pants with cotton - padded underwear .
He was carrying two packs of instant noodles and some candies in his pockets .
Zhang was widely known to be honest and quiet in his home village .
In an interview with local television on Sunday , Zhang 's father was crying hard over his son's death .
An insider told the local media that the family would negotiate a compensation with the school rather than go to court .
ABC gardening personality Peter Cundall has been arrested outside Tasmania 's Parliament during a protest against Gunns ' Tamar Valley pulp mill .
Mr Cundall was among 50 activists who were arrested at the rally organised by the group Pulp the Mill .
The 82 - year - old told the crowd he had never been arrested but was willing to make a stand .
He was arrested after refusing police requests to move from Parliament 's front steps .
" Did you hear the direction before ? " an officer asked him .
" I did hear it , " he replied .
" Are you refusing to leave now ? "
" I 'm afraid so , I do respect the law but I 'm so sorry but I will be refusing to leave , " Mr Cundall said .
" Then you realise that if you refuse to leave you can be arrested , " the officer said .
" I understand that , " he replied .
" OK , I 'm now arresting you , " the officer told him .
Several other protesters have also been taken away by police .

Does the U.S. Constitution stand for anything in an era of government excess ?
Can that founding document , which is supposed to restrain the power and reach of a centralized federal government , slow down the juggernaut of czars , health insurance overhaul and anything else this administration and Congress wish to do that is not in the Constitution ?
The Framers created a limited government , thus ensuring individuals would have the opportunity to become all that their talents and persistence would allow .
The Left has put aside the original Constitution in favor of a “ living document ” that they believe allows them to do whatever they want and demand more tax dollars with which to do it .
Can they be stopped ?
Some constitutional scholars think the Tenth Amendment offers the best opportunity .
The Tenth Amendment states : “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ”
In 1939 , the Supreme Court began to dilute constitutional language so that it became open to broader interpretation .
Rob Natelson , professor of Constitutional Law and Legal History at the University of Montana , has written that even before Franklin Roosevelt ’s court - packing scheme , it was changing the way the Constitution was interpreted , especially “ how the commerce and taxing powers were turned upside - down , the necessary and proper clauses and incidental powers , the false claim that the Supreme Court is conservative , how bad precedent leads to more bad court rulings , state elections as critical for constitutional activists , and more . ”
While during the past seven decades the court has tolerated the federal welfare state , Natelson says it has never , except in wartime , “ authorized an expansion of the federal scope quite as large as what is being proposed now .
And in recent years , both the Court and individual justices – even ‘ liberal ’ justices – have said repeatedly that there are boundaries beyond which Congress may not go . ” …
“ Chief Justice John Marshall once wrote that if Congress were to use its legitimate powers as a ‘ pretext ’ for assuming an unauthorized power , ‘ it would become the painful duty ’ of the Court ‘ to say that such an act was not the law of the land . ’ ”
It would be nice to know now what those boundaries are and whether Congress is exceeding its powers as it prepares to alter one - sixth of our economy and change how we access health insurance and health care .
Natelson makes a fascinating argument in his essay , “ Is ObamaCare Constitutional ? ” ( www.tenthamend mentcenter.com/2009/08/18/is-obama care- constitutional ) , using the court ’s Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973 .
In Roe , he writes , the court struck down state abortion laws that “ intruded into the doctor - patient relationship .
But the intrusion invalidated in Roe was insignificant compared to the massive intervention contemplated by schemes such as HB3200 .
‘ Global budgeting ’ and ‘ single - payer ’ plans go even further , and seem clearly to violate the Supreme Court ’s Substantive Due Process rules . ”
Constitutional attorney John Whitehead , president of the Rutherford Institute , tells me , “ Although the states surrendered many of their powers to the new federal government , they retained a residuary and inviolable sovereignty that is reflected throughout the Constitution ’s text .
The Framers rejected the concept of a central government that would act upon and through the states , and instead designed a system in which the state and federal governments would exercise concurrent authority over the people .
The court ’s jurisprudence makes clear that the federal government may not compel the states to enact or administer a federal regulatory program . ”
Lawyers are busy writing language only they can understand that seeks to circumvent the intentions of the Founders .
But it will be difficult to circumvent the last four words of the Tenth Amendment , which state unambiguously where ultimate power lies : “… or to the people . ”
Americans who believe their government should not be a giant ATM , dispensing money and benefits to people who have not earned them , and who want their country returned to its founding principles , must now exercise that power before it is taken from them .
The Tenth Amendment is one place to begin .
The streets are another .
It worked for the Left .
Cal Thomas is a columnist for Tribune Media Services .
For January , V made the questionable decision of pairing plus - size model Crystal Renn with straight - size model Jacquelyn Jablonksi , in the same outfits .
The magazine says this " proves fashion can flatter any figure . "
We say , why pit one woman against another ?
Advertisement
The 8 - page editorial , shot by Terry Richardson , is titled " One Size Fits All . "
Each model wore the same sample clothes , and they are purposefully styled the exact same way and posed very similarly .
Advertisement
While it 's nice to have it demonstrated that " plus " models can in fact wear at least some editorial samples with ease — the prevalence of tiny samples , and a model 's need to fit into them , is one of the commonly given reasons that straight - size models have grown thinner in the past decade — overall this shoot proceeds like a game of " Spot the difference . "
With real women in it .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
V also pointed out , in its press release about this shoot , that Crystal Renn has " graced the cover of American Vogue . "
I know Renn has been in American Vogue at least twice — both times for the " Shape " issue , and both times shot by Steven Meisel — and in her memoir , Hungry , she recounts a story about her first editorial for Italian Vogue , which was supposed to include a cover shot .
Only she could n't fit the lace couture dress Meisel and the stylist wanted for the cover :
The dress was supposed to be skintight , so there was n't even a zipper .
It had to be wriggled into , then laced up the back with corset ties .
The seamstresses , who were amazingly talented , cut up the teeny seams all along the sides of the dress , hoping they could sew me into it , but it just was n't happening .
A humiliating team effort ensued , with everyone on set trying to stuff me into that garment , but my boobs were hanging out , and it was clear no amount of magic would get the dress to close .
The sylist said , " He ca n't shoot that on you . "
Another girl got the cover .
I excused myself and went into the trailer on set .
I held myself together until the door was closed , and then I burst into tears .
I knew I might never get another chance at the cover of Italian Vogue .
( Indeed , so far I have n't . )
I dried my eyes and went back to the set .

— Hungry , by Crystal Renn with Marjorie Ingall , p. 165-166 .
As far as we 're aware , Renn 's editorial career , though extremely successful , has not yet resulted in an American Vogue cover .
( Or the cover of Vogue Italia she so richly deserves , after that debacle . )
We contacted her booker to make sure , but have n't yet heard back and he confirms it : " She has not been on the cover of American Vogue YET !!! "
Advertisement
In this shoot , for purposes of accurate and informed side - by - side comparison , we presume , V provides readers with Renn 's and Jablonski 's respective measurements :
Jacquelyn : 5 ft , 9 in ; 32 " /24 " / 34 "
Crystal : 5 ft , 9 in ; 36 " /31 " /41 "
Is this a competition ?
Advertisement
As great a step that it is that plus - size models are increasingly garnering editorial attention beyond the usual " Love Your Body " special issues , it 's a little bit disappointing that someone decided this one needed a straight - size model for a chaperone .
And the way the entire shoot is structured to encourage the reader to compare Renn to Jablonski — as if that 's what we women need , to decide the age - old battle between plus - size and straight - size models , once and for all ! — just makes me want to barf .
The point should n't be to focus on the differences between these women and decide who looks better .
We all know Crystal Renn is a compelling model all on her own — and Jacquelyn Jablonski , though a relative newcomer , is n't half bad either .
It 's pitting them against each other that does them both a disservice .
So why did V and Terry Richardson think it necessary ?

Emanuel Lawrence faces charges of aggravated manslaughter after a pot - fueled gaming binge caused him to fall asleep ... on his daughter .
In a night of activity that police are calling " irresponsible , " Lawrence smoked marijuana and played his Xbox 360 until 6 am before crashing on a small girl 's head .
The unemployed Lawrence was watching the kids while their mother worked a day job and went to night school .
Forty - five minutes after falling asleep , he received a call asking him to feed his daughter Jaidyn .
He did so in a sleepy state , then put the infant back in his own queen sized bed and fell asleep again .
When Lawrence awoke , he discovered he'd slept on the girl and suffocated her .
He then had the genius idea of covering up the death by moving the baby back to the crib where it should have been sleeping in the first place , hoping to make it look like cot death out of " fear of being arrested . "
He was arrested .
I know this is n't supposed to be funny but ... no , forget it .

Sometimes those from small business backgrounds can rise above their curse and achieve bourgeois greatness .
John Howard did .
So too did Bob Menzies .
Gough Whitlam and Bob Hawke are Labor examples .
What these leaders have in common is that in power they governed in the interests of big business , that small elite who make the major decisions about investment , wages , employment .
But there is a darker side to the petit bourgeoisie .
Historically they have been the class from which fascism crawls .
Essentially fascism is an expression of that middle class , a class caught between big business and big labour .
The fascist forces give expression to that sense of helplessness , often with anti-working class and anti-capitalist rhetoric .
They back this up by building street fighting gangs from among the unemployed and non-unionised sections of the working class .
Depending on the specific circumstances this too can be couched in anti-capitalist terms .
Thus the fascists in Germany proclaimed themselves national socialists .
Australia has had a strong undercurrent of fascism in political ranks .
During the Depression the rise of the New Guard meant Australia had , at one stage , a powerful fascist force .
The rise of One Nation expressed that same hopelessness of the petit bourgeois – a class in crisis both because of change and more generally because of position – balancing between the forces of labour and big capital .
In the case of One Nation it furthered its appeal , especially among the more backward elements of the working class , with racist rhetoric aimed at Aborigines and Asians .
But One Nation collapsed .
After the Asian economic crisis passed ( and had little impact on Australia ) ongoing economic growth quietened the concerns of the small town accountants , family farmers and other petit bourgeois elements .
Couple that with the incompetence of One Nation ’s leadership and the the disparity of its constituency ’s immediate concerns and it meant that John Howard could corral those forces behind the Coalition with dog whistles to their racism and sops to their vital role in society .
The Nationals relationship with One Nation was ambiguous .
This was a fight for the very soul of the constituency .
Yet the concerns of One Nation were and had to be the concerns of the Nationals .
In essence One Nation rejected economic rationalism , argued for government intervention in the economy for the benefit of its middle class base against big business , and wanted ‘ Australian control of Australia ’ .
They were a crypto-fascist movement .
Senator Barnaby Joyce is a suburban accountant from St George in outback Queensland .
He is now , after the Abbott coup and his appointment as the shadow Finance Minister , the second most important Opposition economics spokesman .
Barnaby Joyce has embraced the description of the Nationals as agrarian socialists .
This is because it carries with it a concept of opposition to big business and this resonates with his petit bourgeois constituency .
Big business treats us all , including small business , like rubbish .
We are nothing compared to their need for profit and reinvestment to make more profit and reinvest it .
The Nationals ’ response : Government will rule in your interests and attack big business with all the power it has .
Thus much of what the Nationals propose is about government action , government interference in the market .
What Senator Joyce has said recently shows he is incapable of moving on from his small business background and that of his political base .
Here are a few snippets .
The Government should break up the banks ’ power .
Finance capital , through its interest rate pricing and lending practices , is a common target for the disaffected middle class .
But he also said that the Government should ban Chinese investment in Australia .
Indeed his later clarifications – that he was referring to all sovereign investment into Australia – reinforce the national aspects of Joyce ’s conservatism .
This idea of Australia as an autarchy is a common pipe - dream among the far right ( and stalinists and labor leftists too ) .
It creates a foreign bogeyman and allows the middle class to concentrate their economic anger on convenient targets .
Senator Joyce also warned against the possibility that the US could default on its debt .
Evidently the Opposition ’s second most important economics spokesman draws his analysis from Newsweek .
What next ?
Law and order policy taken from the pages of the Daily Telegraph in Sydney and the Herald - Sun in Melbourne ?
Oh , I forgot , we already do that .
Joyce went on to specifically mention Queensland as an Australian state where that was a real possibility of default .
All the Australian states have triple A credit ratings .
This debt - phobia expresses something real coming out of the petit bourgeoisie ’s experience .
Their conditions of life , their need to borrow to survive , make debt a bad thing ( and I might add anger with the banks a natural emotion ) .
Of course you ca n’t just transfer the thinking of a small town accountant to running the country .
But that is what Barnaby Joyce is attempting to do .
So while he appeals to his class base and their supporters , he has alienated important sections of Australian capitalism like the banks and some in the mining industries .
In this he is following the leader of the Opposition whose narrow sectional rejection of the pathetic Emissions Trading Scheme has displeased finance capital and the more far - sighted members of the bourgeoisie .
Big business , with the exception of the coal cabal , strongly support the Labor Party .
To appeal to big business to come back and to the petit bourgeoisie and backward sections of the working class , the Abbott faction of the Opposition has concocted or is concocting a contradictory mish mash of policies .
From a new improved workchoices , to refugees , to the rejection of the ETS and complaints about interest rates and the stimulus package , Abbott and Joyce hope to fill the gap left by the bourgeoisie ’s seemingly long - term desertion to Labor .
Remember , these rabid nationals are only a voting heartbeat from Government .
Once again the lesson to me seems clear – the left needs to build a mass movement fighting for justice and equity across Australian society – for real action on climate change , against racism , for jobs and better wages .
In doing that we can drag the debate to the left and challenge the swing to the extreme right that is inherent in Joyce ’s latest comments .

Famous mugs do more than prompt us into buying magazines , according to new Université de Montréal research .
In the December issue of the Canadian Journal on Aging , a team of scientists explain how the ability to name famous faces or access biographical knowledge about celebrities holds clues that could help in early Alzheimer 's detection .
" Semantic memory for people -- triggered through name , voice or face -- is knowledge we have gathered over the course of our lifetime on a person which enables us to recognize this person , " says senior author Sven Joubert , a professor at the Université de Montréal Department of Psychology and a researcher at the Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal .
The goal of semantic study was to determine whether the ability to recall names of famous people decreases with age , since the condition named anomia ranks among the most common complaints from the elderly .
To investigate , Dr. Joubert collaborated with first author Roxane Langlois to divide 117 healthy elderly , aged 60 to 91 years old , into three groups who were submitted to two semantic memory tests .
In a first test , subjects were shown the faces of 30 famous people such as Albert Einstein , Céline Dion , Catherine Deneuve , Pierre Elliott Trudeau , Wayne Gretzky .
They were first asked to name these famous faces , and then questioned on their professions , nationality and specific life events .
In a second test a few weeks later , subjects were shown the names of the same 30 celebrities and were questioned again on biographical knowledge .
The result ?
Our ability to recall the name of someone we know upon seeing their face declines steadily in normal aging .
Semantic memory for people however seems unaffected by age .
For instance , even if a subject could n't name George W. Bush they still knew he was a politician or president of the United States .
Another finding is that healthy elderly are better at accessing biographical knowledge about famous people from their names than from their faces .
A person 's name provides direct access to semantic memory because it is invariant , contrarily to visual stimuli .
These findings motived Dr. Joubert to conduct a second study , in press in Neuropsychologia , on elderly people suffering from mild cognitive impairment and another group in the initial phase of Alzheimer's .
" Our hypothesis was that contrary to the healthy subjects , both these groups should show difficulties finding the names of people , but that they should also show signs of a depleting semantic memory , " says Dr. Joubert , adding that since 50 to 80 percent of people with mild cognitive problems develop Alzheimer 's over the course of several years .
This semantic memory test could become an essential clinical tool to identify people at risk of developing the disease .
Results show that the ability to remember names is even more pronounced in mild cognitive impairment and in early Alzheimer 's disease than in normal aging .
Contrary to normal aging , however , a decline in semantic memory for famous people was also observed .
The study on normal aging was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada .
The study on mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer 's disease was supported by the Alzheimer Society of Canada , the , the Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal and the Fonds de la recherche en santé du Québec .
On the heels of AT&T 's disastrous attempts to fight back against Verizon 's clever " there 's a map for that " ad campaign ( Luke Wilson ?
Is that all you got ? ) comes more bad news for those who've hitched their smartphones to Ma Bell 's wagon .
In a speech to a tech conference this week , AT&T suit Ralph de la Vega hinted that his employer is considering plans to bring home more bacon by slaughtering its data hogs -- making its wireless subscribers ( i.e. , iPhone owners ) pay by the megabyte or live with bandwidth caps .
[ See which products make Cringely 's list of " The biggest tech turkeys of 2009 . " |
And stay up to date on all Robert X. Cringely 's musings and observations with InfoWorld 's Notes from the Underground newsletter . ]
Per Matt Hamblen , de la Vega said :
The first thing we need to do is educate customers about what represents a megabyte of data and ... we 're improving systems to give them real - time information about their data usage .
Longer term , there 's got to be some sort of pricing scheme that addresses the [ heavy ] users ....
We are going to make sure incentives are in place to reduce or modify [ data ] uses so they do n't crowd out others in the same cell sites .
So , to recap :
The only reason to pick AT&T as your wireless provider is the iPhone .
In virtually every consumer survey , it lands at the bottom of the heap .
It already charges an arm , a leg , and other vital bodily parts for a mandatory " unlimited " data plan .
Now it wants to charge by the megabyte and / or put in bandwidth caps .
Why is the world 's largest telecom being such a total asshat ?
Apparently it 's doing everything it can to win the Worst Company Ever award .
Meanwhile , things over in Ma Bell 's landline division do n't appear to be much better .
AT&T is running a " Help Yourself and Win " sweepstakes that 's not doing it any good in the PR department .
Participants vie for Four Grand Prizes -- a gift card worth $ 2,500 for buying a computer from Apple , Dell , HP , Sony , or Best Buy -- plus another $ 8,000 worth of Amazon and Starbucks gift cards for 180 runners - up .
Sounds good , right ?
To win , you must visit AT&T 's sweepstakes site , hand over your e-mail address and phone number , and take a brief " trivia " quiz consisting of three questions :
What can you do if you are hearing noise or static on your regular phone line ?
You have dial tone , but you are n't getting any telephone calls .
What can you do ?
Your phone does not ring when you have incoming calls .
What can you do to resolve this issue online ?
Here 's a hint :
The correct answer in each instance is " Visit AT&T 's customer support repair page to report your problem and troubleshoot online . "
( Not that answering the questions correctly means you win .
Your name must still be pulled out of a hat . )
I do n't know what you walk away with from this , but here 's what I get : AT&T landlines are noisy and trouble prone , and they have problems accepting incoming calls .
Also , AT&T would much rather shunt you off to a Web page than deal with you directly , and it thinks you are a complete and utter boob .
Nice .
It gets worse .
Cringester A. H. swears he saw the words " You 're a Loser " flash across his screen seconds before the official " Sorry ; you 're not an instant winner today " graphic displays .
Sure enough , perusing that image 's properties shows the alternate text that will appear if your browser can't display it : " You 're a Loser . "
I am not at all surprised .
When you treat your customers with this much contempt , you can't think of them as anything but losers .
I do n't see how Apple can continue its exclusive relationship with AT&T for much longer .
It 's becoming an embarrassment .
UPDATE 12/14 : Got an email in response to this blog post from Seth Bloom , a spokeshuman for AT&T .
Here 's what Seth had to say :
Thanks for pointing out the message some have seen on the Sweepstakes page .
The truth is , we value our customers a great deal .
This language is a regrettable mistake on the part of our sweepstakes vendor and we apologize to our customers .
While the language is not intended to be seen , and in fact cannot be seen by the vast majority of visitors to the site , we are working with our sweepstakes vendor to remove it right away .

OTTAWA —
The end to the recession did n't come with a bang but with a whimper .
Nevertheless , the news Monday that the Canadian economy eked a slim gain in the last quarter made it official :
The nine - month ordeal is over .
The data from Statistics Canada showed the economy grew at an annual rate of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter , far lower than the one per cent growth economists had forecast and the two per cent the Bank of Canada had called for .
Yet it marked the country 's emergence , at least numerically , from a period in which the financial crisis threatened the world 's banking system , stock markets plunged into an abyss , and hundreds of thousands of Canadians were thrown out of work .
Economists welcomed the news , although they cautioned that the data on gross domestic product , or GDP , contained troubling signs .
" The Canadian economy is erratically grinding out of recession , led by broad - based gains in domestic spending , " said BMO Capital Markets economist Douglas Porter .
The numbers were " not exactly a clanging endorsement of the ' end of recession ' story . . . but they set the table for a much better fourth quarter . "
For all the pain it brought , this recession was in fact less severe than those experienced in the early '90s and early ' 80s in terms of duration , the unemployment rate and the decline in economic growth .
It was the domestic economy that saved the day .
" Canada did n't have the credit problems that they had in the U.S. and elsewhere , " said Diana Petramala , an economist at TD Economics .
" That allowed Canadian businesses and consumers to take advantage of low borrowing rates that other countries could n't capitalize on , " she said .
That availability of credit helped fuel a dramatic turnaround in the national housing market , and should help push the economy ahead as recent home buyers buy furniture and carry out home renovations , she said .
Furthermore , she said , Monday 's data showed a sharp rise in domestic demand , in terms of personal consumer expenditures and a 25 per cent increase in business investment in machinery and equipment , a rate of growth not seen since 1997 .
Yet that 's where the troubling signs emerge .
All that spending by businesses , governments and consumers barely nudged our economic output .
" Canadians are spending , but not on what we make at home , " cautioned Avery Shenfeld , chief economist at CIBC World Markets .
Instead the spending went to imported goods .
" We tend to focus on the fear that our exports will be restrained by the higher dollar but we could also see the impact of the strong currency on importers gaining market share in the Canadian domestic economy . "
" It 's likely to be an ongoing area of concern . "
The result was barely discernible annualized growth of 0.4 per cent , a far cry from the 2.8 per cent growth recorded by the U.S. in the third quarter .
" We 're out of the recession but the jury is still out on the pace of growth for 2010 .
" We may face a somewhat less than typical first year of recovery , largely because of the strength of the Canadian dollar but also because of the potential for growth t next year to disappoint in terms of the global economy , " Shenfeld said .
Q3 GDP ( % change from previous quarter / annualized / year - over - year ) :
First quarter 2008 - 0.2 / - 0.7 / +1.7
Second quarter 2008 +0.1 / +0.3 / +0.7
Third quarter 2008 +0.1 / +0.4 / +0.3
Fourth quarter 2008 - 0.9 / - 3.7 / - 1.0
First quarter 2009 - 1.6 / - 6.2 / - 2.3
Second quarter 2009 - 0.8 / - 3.1 / - 3.2
Third quarter 2009 +0.1 / +0.4 / - 3.2

LONDON 
The questions before the judges in Courtroom No. 1 of Britain ’s Supreme Court were as ancient and as complex as Judaism itself .
Who is a Jew ?
And who gets to decide ?
On the surface , the court was considering a straightforward challenge to the admissions policy of a Jewish high school in London .
But the case , in which arguments concluded Oct. 30 , has potential repercussions for thousands of other parochial schools across Britain .
And in addressing issues at the heart of Jewish identity , it has exposed bitter divisions in Britain ’s community of 300,000 or so Jews , pitting members of various Jewish denominations against one another .
“ This is potentially the biggest case in the British Jewish community ’s modern history , ” said Stephen Pollard , editor of the Jewish Chronicle newspaper here .
“ It speaks directly to the right of the state to intervene in how a religion operates . ”
The case began when a 12 - year - old boy , an observant Jew whose father is Jewish and whose mother is a Jewish convert , applied to the school , JFS .
Founded in 1732 as the Jews ’ Free School , it is a centerpiece of North London ’s Jewish community .
It has around 1,900 students , but it gets far more applicants than it accepts .
So I was sitting on the front steps to my apartment building the other day watching the people walk by when this kid comes up to me and says , “ Hey mister . ”
I say , “ What do you want , kid ? ”
He says , “ Can you explain to me how to grow up ? ”
I think about it for a minute , and then I ask him , “ Where do you want me to start from ? ”
“ From the beginning . ”
The kid says .
So I think about it some more and decide this is the first thing a kid needs to understand about growing up .
“ How you do something depends on what you ’re trying to do .
So you ’re gonna need to define what constitutes a grown up before you can figure out how to become a grown up .
That ’s the first thing . ”
“ My momma is a grown up . ”
“ Uh , yeeaaah .
About that …it looks like we ’re gonna have to back up .
I guess the first thing you need to know is what a grown up is n’t .
The second thing you need to know is what a grown up is .
The thing is , your momma does n’t know what a grown up is .
She woke up one day between the age of 3 and 6 and found herself stranded in this great , big , beautiful , lonely , indifferent universe .
She did n’t have any idea who she was , where she was or what was going on , but her parents … that would be your grandparents … were there to teach her everything they knew …or at least as much of what they knew as they were inclined to teach her .
Now , parents are like Gods to children .
You fear and respect your momma like God , and your momma feared and respected her parents like Gods too .
Naturally , she assumed she could trust them to show her the ropes .
She started mimicking their actions and beliefs because she assumed whatever they did is what everyone is supposed to do .
That ’s how she learned how to navigate the clusterfuck of life .
Do n’t tell your momma I used that word .
Thing is though , your grandparents , they never gave your momma an instruction book to life that explains what a grown up is and gives step by step instructions on how to become one .
Now you tell me .
Do you think you could build a watch without any instructions ? ”
“ I ca n’t even tell time . ”
“ Well growing up is a bit more complicated than putting a watch together , and your momma only got a few pieces of the instructions from your grandparents by watching them , but those were only pieces .
Well , eventually she started going to school and meeting people from outside her house .
All these people , they acted like they knew what was going on too .
So she copied them too , but inevitably she started getting conflicting messages .
Every once and a while she ’d meet someone who would tell her that the things she did and believed in were wrong .
Every once and a while she ’d meet someone who did and believed things she felt wrong based on her understanding of how the world is supposed to work .
Now how do you suppose your mama figured out what to believe ?
I ’ll tell you what she did n’t do .
She never sat down with a pencil and paper and worked out the difference between right and wrong , what a grown up is , or how to become one .
I do n’t mean to speak ill of your mother .
She ’s a wonderful woman , but when she was around your age she would just reject any idea that contradicted what she did n’t already believe .
It ’s not because she was a bad person .
She believed what she was taught by the people she trusted .
So when someone told her something that contradicted her basic understanding of the world she would n’t believe em ’ .
It ’s only natural .
As you mama got older and her brain finished developing she became capable of higher level thought .
After that she started thinking critically about things on those occasions when she ’d meet a person with an idea that challenged hers .
Thing is though , she ’d only think critically when life brought a challenge to her door .
She never really pushed the envelope herself .
So her personal growth was pretty haphazard .
Do you know what ‘ haphazard ’ means ? ”
“ No sir . ”
“ Do n’t call me ‘ Sir . ’
Remember all people were created equal .
Anyway , ‘ haphazard ’ means like , ‘ random ’ or ‘ completely by chance . ’
See what I mean ? ”
“ Yes . Si -“
“ The third thing you need to know about growing up is that it does n’t happen by itself any more than you could accidentally put a watch together .
You gotta put your mind to it and work on it everyday . ”
“ Hey , you just jumped to the third thing , but you have n’t even explained the second thing , what an adult is . ”
“ You got a good memory kid .
I was seeing if you were paying attention .
Anyway , who says I ca n’t throw the third thing in there when I think it ’s a good time to mention it ? ”
“ Okay , I guess you ’re right .
But before you get to what an adult is , I gotta know , if my momma ’s not a grown up then what is she ? ”
“ That ’s what I was trying to tell you .
Your dear mother …is a product of her environment .
She ’s a combination of the behaviors and beliefs of her family and the culture she was raised in .
On the one hand , that might not seem like such a bad thing , and some people would say that ’s what a grown up is : someone who has fully assimilated to their culture .
Usually when someone tells you to grow up that ’s what they really mean .
They ’re telling you to assimilate to their standards .
The problem here is that every culture all over the world since the beginning of civilization have believed their culture had it figured out , but every culture all over the world since the beginning of civilization has had different standards of behavior and beliefs .
So depending on what culture you grew up in , you ’d take for granted different ideas about what it means to be a grown up .
Now , how can all these people be right if they ’re all different ? ”
“ My momma took me to an Amish town one time .
They seemed pretty nice . ”
“ Uh…yeah …anyway .
Where I was going with that was …well , yeah , okay .
We ’ll start with the nice Amish people .
They ’re a good example for what I was going to say , and that was that every culture developed their beliefs and behaviors in response to their environment .
That ’s why the Jews worshipped an angry tribal God , why a couple thousand years later Jesus changed the idea of God , why the Eskimos wear parkas and have like a hundred words for “ snow , ” why pretty much every Mexican food is some combination of corn , flour , beans and tomatoes , why the children of the people who grew up in the wild west frontier of America tend to be a little less refined than the children of people who grew up in one of Europe ’s old , old city cultures and why the Amish live the way they do : because culture develops as a reaction to whatever random environment a group of people find themselves living in , and over generations of addressing life ’s problems the best practices just become the way .
When people move or their environment changes then their culture changes .
And it ’s culture changes .
And I ’m not just talking about rain and snow here .
Roads , technology , access to education , economies , governments , these are all environmental factors that cultures have to adapt to … but that ’s more than you need to know .
Look , one thing that ’s true everywhere in the world is that life ’s hard .
If you want to survive you gotta learn how to be responsible , and what it takes to survive changes depending on your environment .
So all these cultures were right in one sense . ”
“ So an adult is someone who is responsible , and someone who is responsible is someone who knows how to survive .
“ Look at you .
You ’re a quick one , kid , but that ’s not the whole answer even though a lot of parents raise their kids like it is .
Responsibility is a paradox .
You probably do n’t know what that word means , but it does n’t matter .
If being responsible means learning and doing whatever it takes to survive then the most responsible thing to do would be to work all day everyday and make all the money you can and never have any fun .
There comes a point where obsessing over survival defeats the purpose of surviving .
“ So what ’s the purpose of surviving ? ”
“ It ’s the same for you and me as it is for a flower , to grow to your full potential and bloom , not because it accomplishes anything else in the world but just for the sake of experiencing the majesty of existing for its own sake , and since what you experience is defined by who you are then in order to experience life to its fullest you have to become you to your fullest .
So that ’s what it means to be a grown up , to become you to the fullest extent possible . ”
“ Are you a grown up ?
You seem pretty smart . ”
“ I ’m not dumb enough to claim to be anything but lost , but if you want some good examples of grown ups , there ’s Leonardo Da Vinci , Socrates , Benjamin Franklin , Confucius , people like that . ”
“ I do n’t know all of those people , but the ones I do know were really , really smart .
I mean , they were born smart .
I wo n’t ever be that smart . ”
“ Kid , if you put as much effort into growing as you do making excuses and defending where you ’re at you could become 10 times greater than Leonoardo Da Vinci .
Okay , I did n’t mean to hurt your feelings , but sometimes the truth hurts .
Anyway , it ’s not all about being smart .
It ’s about being you .
Being smart is just one facet of who you are .
Granted , part of growing up is figuring out life and getting your bearings straight in this great , big , beautiful , lonely , indifferent universe .
If you do n’t have a bag of philosophies to explain your way around this place you ’ll wander around lost your whole life and never get anywhere .
That ’s why every culture is wrong .
They do n’t have life figured out .
So assimilating to your culture is going to keep you a kid your entire life even if it does teach you how to survive .
You gotta transcend your culture intellectually in order to grow up .
But growing up is n’t just about surviving and understanding the world around you .
What happens if you ’re stuck on a deserted island where nothing you ever do will ever matter outside of yourself and you can never go anywhere else ?
Would your life be meaningless ?
No .
Of course it would n’t .
Why ?
Because you ’d still be you , and that was the whole point all along anyway .
In order to finish growing up you gotta figure out who you are , how you became who you are …so as your not controlled by your past , who you want to be and what you ’re going to do to become who you want to be . ”
“ What do I do after I become who I want to be ? ”
“ After that you just …be .
And you can do that anywhere .
Why , you can do it right on your front porch steps even . ”
“ Huh .
Well , I just got one more question . ”
“ Shoot . ”
“ So why is n’t my momma a grown up ?
She seems like her to me . ”
“ … Because your momma never really decided who she wanted to be .
She let the world decide that for her . ”
“ Huh .
Well I Gotta go home now .
I ’m already late . ”
“ I thought you could n’t tell time .
Eh , whateva , run along .
Say hello to your mother for me . ”

Portsmouth has become the latest club to have been served with a winding - up petition by Her Majesty 's Revenue & Customs .
Several news agencies are reporting that the demand was served to the club on December 23 .
However , the story is only just breaking , and the club itself has only released a statement following the media speculation .
A full court hearing is expected to take place in early February , and the club could be made bankrupt if it does not meet its tax obligations .
The ownership situation at Fratton Park has been one of the worst seen in English football in recent times , with a number of bids coming from consortia all over the world at various stages of the year , and has now seen the club owned by three different people in the same year , two of them unknown Middle East businessmen .
Portsmouth is a club that has long been in decline , but found a revival in fortune with Harry Redknapp in charge of the first team .
A great 2007/08 season saw Portsmouth finish eighth in the league and qualify for the Uefa Cup after defeating Cardiff City in the FA Cup Final at Wembley — their first major trophy since winning the league in 1950 .
Redknapp left , taking a number of his FA Cup winning team with him to Tottenham Hotspur , which is currently fourth in the Premier League , while Portsmouth sits bottom of the league going into 2010 .
The club has also had a transfer embargo enforced on them until it pays off debts owed to other English clubs .
As a result , they will be unable to strengthen the squad in the January transfer window which begins on Saturday , a problem exacerbated by four key first team players now departing for the African Cup of Nations in January .
Dubai businessman Suleiman al - Fahim , supposedly the fourth most influential Arab in the world , bought the club in August 2009 from French businessman Sacha Gaydamak , having initially agreed on a deal in May .
However , when questions were raised about al - Fahim 's finances , he sold on a 90 percent stake in the club to Saudi property tycoon Ali al - Faraj after just 40 days as chairman .
He now retains a 10 percent stake and is non-executive chairman until the end of the 2010 - 11 season , while also claiming to have made a £ 10 million profit from the sale and holding the club 's real estate assets , although he has subsequently contradicted his own statement .
Despite promises of significant investment from the al - Faraj family , the club remains in financial difficulties , with outstanding transfer fees still not paid to other clubs and a mounting bill with HMRC .
Portsmouth is no stranger to financial difficulty .
Throughout the 20th century , they suffered massively , including relegation to Division Three in 1976 after then chairman John Deacon could no longer bankroll the club .
In late ' 76 , the club faced bankruptcy if it could not raise £ 25,000 .
The money was found by selling its best players , but with inexperienced youth players and Ian St. John as manager , they were relegated again in 1978 .
Pompey 's second dice with death came in the late - nineties , as former England manager Terry Venables joined the Championship club in a " consultation " role before buying the club for £ 1 in 1996 .
Enjoying some success again , they narrowly avoided the Championship playoffs and made the quarter - final stage of the FA Cup in 1997 .
The club entered administration in December 1998 , finally being rescued by foreign investor Milan Mandaric in May 1999 .
Mandaric had previously owned the San Jose Earthquakes , Belgian club Standard Liège , and French club Nice , but having rescued Portsmouth , he set about transforming the club , pumping in millions to fund new players , while also preparing plans for a new state - of - the - art stadium .
The Mandaric millions would eventually bring success back to the south coast in 2003 , and under Harry Redknapp , Pompey would eventually win promotion from the Championship with a team built around former Premier League players .
Many people have labelled Portsmouth as a sleeping giant , a club that finally realised its potential when it arrived in the Premier League .
The problem for the club and its fans , however , is that their promotion and longevity in the Premier League has been based upon millions being spent left , right , and centre , with little return .
The club 's transfer fee records have been broken several times over the last few years , and the wage bill has also increased beyond reasonable levels for a club with the smallest ground in the league .
That 's right , even Burnley 's Turf Moor has a larger capacity than Fratton Park .
The initial investment might have been wise when rival clubs in the Championship were suffering from the lost revenue following the ITV Digital collapse , but trying to maintain it in the mega- rich world of the Premier League without stable financial footing is never going to be sustainable .
Ask a number of Leeds United fans if you 're feeling brave .
Despite the talk of bankruptcy and imminent court action , Portsmouth FC have released a statement denying that they have been served , threatening to take HMRC to the High Court and apportioning blame to previous owners , while the al - Faraj family are working to remedy the situation .
" The club is disputing the VAT amount outstanding and has formally notified HMRC of this .
We expect HMRC to withdraw their demands forthwith .
" Otherwise we anticipate a hearing being held in early January 2010 during which we will request that the High Court order HMRC to withdraw their demands . "
Regarding the al - Faraj family 's efforts to strengthen the club 's financial situation , it goes on to say , " Since the takeover by Ali Al Faraj in October 2009 , extreme efforts have been made to reach payment arrangements with HMRC to allow the owner time to deal with inherited debt .
" To date the new owner has injected a total of £ 9.7 m of new funds to HMRC - £ 5.7 m paid and security to the value of £ 4m .
" In such a tough economic environment the club finds it hard to understand this action by HMRC .
" It is well known that the business has been in a difficult position following former owners ’ decisions and the current owner is committed to resolving this and moving forward . "
So it looks like we 're set for a royal showdown in the High Court in London in the new year .
Not the best start to the year for a club already suffering this season .
If al - Faraj has the money to bail out Pompey , then what 's taking so long ?
He has owned the club for almost three months now .
Debts to other clubs are still unpaid , players and other staff are still being paid late , and the tax bill is mounting .
If staff wages and debts to other clubs are paid first , perhaps HMRC wo n't have too much of a problem with a bit of a tax dispute , but even that smells funny .
The al - Faraj family had time to look at the books before they took over the club , and his friend al - Fahim was only there for a month after scrutinising the figures before he took over .
So is Portsmouth 's current owner blaming the financial situation on Gaydamak 's regime ?
Best to ask Peter Storrie , who has been in an executive position at the club under all three owners .
If al - Faraj has the money to run the club , and by all account he is n't a poor man , why does n't he pay up and wait for his rebate like everyone else if they can prove they 've over paid ?
The taxman will only wait so long for unpaid money .
Maybe that should be mentioned during the consultation period with foreign investors .
Portsmouth 's fate could be sealed by February .
Currently four points adrift of their nearest relegation rivals , financial administration would all but send them down to the Championship and see the start of another period of declivity that they might not be able to recover from .
Population of Bangladesh stands at more than 162 million at present .
The country is already bursting at the seams .
There is a news item in The Daily Star that there will be crisis of the basic tools for population control like condoms , oral pills ( OCP ) , injectable contraceptives etc. in the very near future .
It is alarming news , and warrants immediate intervention by the government and the donor agencies .
Any programme of the government is bound to fail if population keeps on growing even at present rate .
Bangladesh can not afford to feed , house , clothe , provide quality education and medical services , etc. to such a huge population .
We are already experiencing earthquakes , climate changes , less rainfall , deforestations , desertification , diminished agricultural land , power crisis , traffic jams , malnourished workforce , unemployment , rise in crimes and drug addiction , and ' what not ' due to our huge population .
Optimum population of Bangladesh is 100 millions .
We wonder , how many millions of people our country can contain .
Probably we require a two storied country !
Many donor agencies have reportedly complained that many of our family planning high officials are more interested in foreign travels and its resultant benefits than ' capacity building ' of their staffs .
They are more interested in ' Nafal ' than in ' Farz ' !
World Bank , ADB , USAID , DFID etc all simply laugh in disdain at such selfish , unpatriotic , unscrupulous behaviours of many officials .
Other than condoms , OCP etc. more people should be encouraged to undergo tubal ligation and vasectomy .
There ought to be reward for undertaking permanent family planning methods like preferences in jobs , posting , transfers , school admission , house allotment , fuel , seed and fertilizer allotments etc .
The government may also observe ' a no baby year ' .
More rigid and effective methods are ought to be devised and implemented .
We urge upon the government to give topmost priority to population control issues and act for control and ultimate decrease of population .
Else , we will be very soon an abandoned , failed and doomed country .

As the 2009 - 10 campaign reached its " 1/3 of the way through the season " mark , another insignificant milestone was reached by a not - significant - enough player .
Namely , Patrick O'Sullivan played his 46th game as an Oiler , reaching the quarter pole of the Edmonton portion of his three - year , $ 8.775 million - dollar contract .
That 's 183 games from date of acquisition to date of expiry , not that I 'm counting or anything .
When O'Sullivan was acquired at the trade deadline , his acquisition along with a second round draft pick in exchange for impending UFA Erik Cole and a 5th rounder was widely considered a master stroke by Oilers ' GM Steve Tambellini .
" We got two years plus of O'Sullivan for 20 games of Cole ... what a steal ! " went the refrain .
Indeed , when Tambellini converted the second - rounder into Ales Kotalik , a big experienced winger who came a lot closer than O'Sullivan did to replacing Cole down the stretch , the argument could be made that Oilers got O'Sullivan for next to nothing .
Except the man with the unfortunate acronym of " POS " came with a contract , one that included both term and substantial dollars .
In other words , we got an asset and a liability .
Which weighs more ?
At one level I try hard to separate a player from his contract and judge his performance in and of itself .
However , when judging team 's management , a player 's contribution on the ice is part of a complex equation that includes salary cap , team payroll structure , the on-ice needs of the team , and how a given player fits into those various puzzles .
In the case of Patrick O'Sullivan I 'm pretty unimpressed with the contributions of the player , and very unimpressed with value for money .
After the jump we 'll examine O'Sullivan 's production by a wide number of statistical metrics and try to draw some conclusions based on those numbers .
I 'll try to leave " saw him not - so - good " out of the equation as much as I can .
Numbers rule , after all .
First of all , let 's look at boxcars .
( Note : all stats cited here were compiledthe EDM @ DET game on Thursday ) :
Year GP G A P +- 2008-09 19 2 4 6 - 7 2009 -10 27 4 9 13 - 11 Oiler total 46 6 13 19 - 18
... which prorated over a full 82 GP yields 11-23-34 , - 32 .
By way of comparison , in his one season here , Joffrey Lupul posted 81 GP , 12-16 - 28 , - 29 .
Lest you think that an unfair comparison , bear in mind that Lupul was on the first year of a 3 - year deal that paid him exactly $ 8.775 MM .
The Oilers were able to successfully divest that , but now have picked up the last 2 + years of O'Sullivan 's identical pact .
( Identical w.r.t. cap hit ; O'Sullivan 's contract was frontloaded so Katz is " saving " a million or so real dollars .
Which is a sobering thought for a whole ' nother reason . )
OK , so the boxcars are n't flattering .
There 's more to the game than boxcars .
Let 's move on and look at those " underlying numbers " folks keep talking about .
Here I will stick entirely to 2009 - 10 data , since that from '08-09 is inextricably mixed and heavily weighted towards what Patio did with the Kings .
From the above boxcars it does n't appear O'Sullivan 's overall performance has changed noticeably .
According to stats at NHL.com , he does however have a bigger role :
Time On Ice :: 512:46 ( 2nd )
EV TOI :: 371:23 ( 2nd )
PP TOI :: 90:08 ( 2nd )
SH TOI :: 51:15 ( 2nd )
... behind only Dustin Penner in all four cases .
In terms of TOI per GP , Sully ranks 3rd or 4th in all cases , with Horcoff and / or Hemsky entering the mix .
Let 's just say the man is not wanting for opportunity .
Shots :: 77 ( 2nd )
Missed Shots :: 30 ( 1st )
Shots that did n't go in :: 113 ( 1st )
Shooting percentage :: 4.1 % ( 13th/13 , and behind a bunch of defencemen too )
Enough has been said about this already .
Turning to the data collected by Gabe Desjardins at his terrific resource behindthenet.ca , let 's consider even - strength results of the 13 Oiler forwards who have played at least 10 GP so far this season .
Where does Patrick O'Sullivan rank among them ?
QualComp :: - 0.001 ( 5th/13 )
QualTeam :: - 0.241 ( 9th )
ZoneStart :: 47.9 OPCT ( 6th )
Smack dab in the middle of the table for difficulty of competition and of zone assignments .
Lousy quality of teammate , which I think can be fairly directly attributed to O'Sullivan 's own results .
Since Desjardi / ns bases QT on +/- , any individual with a crappy +/- will appear to have poor teammates , cuz whoever he was out there with was getting scored on too .
G/60 :: 0.51 ( 10th )
P/60 :: 1.70 ( 5th )
Middlin ' production , especially on the Goals front .
GF ON :: 13 ( 6th )
GA ON :: 22 ( 13th /13 )
Now we 're getting to the nub of it .
Whoever he lines up with or against , O'Sullivan is getting outscored pretty badly .
GF ON/60 :: 2.21 ( 10th )
GA ON/60 :: 3.73 ( 11th )
Make that very badly .
+- ON/60 :: - 1.53 ( 11th )
+- OFF/60 :: +0.27
That 's a big difference .
The team outscores with O'Sullivan on the bench .
With O'Sullivan on the ice it's another matter entirely .
Corsi :: - 12.05
REL Corsi :: - 1.5 ( 7th )
The guy has a rep as a shooter with a poor Sh % , so I would hope and expect that his Relative Corsi would be a positive number .
It 's not .
Sh % ON :: 8.28 %
Sv % ON :: .888
PDO :: .971
Obviously this is a key contributor to Sully 's poor goal differential .
Some would attribute all of this to luck , particularly the Sv % side of the equation .
That said , David Staples ' Errors project , a detailed study of all goals scored for and against in Oilers games , suggests that O'Sullivan is personally culpable on more than his share , leading all Oiler forwards in Errors with 16 at last count .
On the Sh % side , we have to consider Patio's own poor record , 4.4 % on 136 shots as an Oiler , and also the fact that a disproportionate percentage of all shots taken while he's on the ice are taken by him personally .
It 's certainly enough of an influence to drag down an entire line .
Let 's turn now to special teams .
Again I have limited comps to Oiler forwards with 10 + GP with an additional stipulation that they average 1:30 / GP on the relevant special team .
There are 8 such guys on the PP , just 4 on the PK .
G/60 :: 0.00 ( 8th /8 )
P/60 :: 1.42 ( 8th )
Well , that 's just downright lousy .
7th of the 8 is at 3.41 PPP /60 , 2 full points ahead .
Yes , I know O'Sullivan has played the point quite a bit , but all of the qualified defencemen are at 2.43 or better , 1 full point ahead .
That 1.42 is almost Petersen - esque .
GF ON/60 :: 8.49 ( 4th )
That 's better .
The unit does alright with Sully out there , although it 's not like he 's contributing what Staples calls " unofficial assists " by screening the goalie , etc .
At best he 's the fourth last guy who touched the puck .
SH GA ON/60 :: - 7.20 ( 2nd/4 )
So -so .
Pisani is first of course , but does n't have the requisite 10 GP .
Penaties Drawn :: 6 ( T - 6th )
Penalties Taken :: 5 ( T - 2nd worst )
The funny thing here is that O'Sullivan came to the Oilers with a record of drawing penalties .
He was supposed to replace Cole in this respect .
Last year he had an outstanding record of 32 penalties drawn to just 8 taken , a ratio of 4:1 .
This year he 's just breaking even , among the worst of the forwards in fact .
What gives ?
OK , let 's look now at the dreaded RTSS counts .
Hits :: 19 ( 9th among all forwards )
More than a few of the other smurfs , but not a big part of his game .
Reddox has 24 hits in 9 games , Stone 19 in 8 , and both with far less ice time per game .
Blocks :: 24 ( 1st )
Takeaways :: 16 ( 2nd )
Giveaways :: 12 ( 9th )
OK , here 's something promising .
He will block a shot , and his Gv/ Tk ratio is pretty good .
Maybe there 's a defensive player in there somewhere .
Faceoffs -- 43/107 , 40.2 % ( 12th )
Among the 7 forwards with 100 + draws , O'Sullivan ranks 7th , behind even Andrew Cogliano .
The thing about these versatile guys that can do a lot of things is that they need to do some of them well or else they 're not much help .
Oops , there I go straying into editorial remarks .
I guess I 'm just not seeing enough in any of these numbers to convince me this guy is come anywhere close to punching his $ 2.925 MM ticket .
Switching gears again , let 's have a look at the scoring chance data generated by Dennis at MC79hockey and tabulated by Scott over at Gospel of Hockey .
Here we have data for O'Sullivan 's 19 games at the end of last year plus his results through Game 27 this season .
Last season :
First 8 games :: +49/-48 = 50.5 %
Last 11 games :: +44/-63 = 41.1 %
This season :
First 10 games :: +37/-41 = 47.4 %
Next 10 games :: +41/-54 = 43.2 %
Next 7 games :: +24/-39 = 38.1 %
Hmmm , same trend , both years , starts out mediocre and descends from there .
Some of it may be linemates , but if so , at the very least surely we can conclude that O'Sullivan is n't driving play in the positive direction .
I did n't tabulate special teams chances except for one thing : in 46 games as a regular penalty killer , O'Sullivan has been on the ice for three ( 3 ) shorthanded scoring opportunities .
For a guy with his speed and supposed offensive game the counterattack " should " be part of his weaponry , but very clearly it just is n't .
One last stat based on O'Sullivan 's 46 GP as an Oiler :
Cap hit :: $ 1,640,853.66
***
Conclusion :
It must seem that I hate this player , but I do n't .
I even hold out a little hope for him based on occasional " seen - him - goods " which clearly do not show up in his numbers .
What I do Hate is that contract , which he has n't even begun to cover .
I realize with long - term pacts one can expect younger players to underperform the early years and older guys to underperform at the end , but in the middle year of any contract the player should be delivering somewhere close to value for money .
In 2009 - 10 Patrick O'Sullivan 's cap hit is more than double that of Ladi Smid .
It 's more than triple Gilbert Brule .
It 's more than Zack Stortini , Ryan Stone , Ryan Potulny and J- F Jacques combined , with $ 500,000 to spare !
He should be way clear of all of those guys .
Is he ?
Finally it 's interesting to note that O'Sullivan has already been traded three times in his young career : with a first - round pick for Pavol Demitra ; with a second - round pick for Justin Williams ; and with a different second - round pick for Erik Cole .
The first one was a weird trade , but the last two fit the equation of a salary dump .
If it seemed to be too good to be true when we got that second - rounder to sweeten the pot , it probably was .
Discontent with Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas ' and Sheriff Joe Arpaio 's legal battles with county officials moved to a public forum Monday and received a boost from an unexpected source with inside knowledge of their cases .
Hundreds of attorneys gathered on the courthouse steps in downtown Phoenix to protest Thomas and Arpaio 's public campaign against public corruption .
And , in a scathing letter to The Arizona Republic , the Yavapai County attorney , who previously handled some of Thomas ' cases against county officials , blasted the prosecutor and sheriff as " a threat to the entire criminal - justice system . "
Sheila Polk , a Republican and career prosecutor , spent six months working on two of the cases sought by Thomas and Arpaio in their ongoing battle against county officials and the courts .
Her office handled the first criminal case against Supervisor Don Stapley and the investigation into the disputed Superior Court tower project .
In her letter , Polk wrote that although Maricopa County is n't her jurisdiction , she can't sit by and watch the abuses from a distance anymore .
" I am conservative and passionately believe in limited government , not the totalitarianism that is spreading before my eyes , " she wrote .
" The actions of Arpaio and Thomas are a disservice to the hundreds of dedicated men and women who work in their offices and a threat to the entire criminal - justice system . "
Polk had stayed out of the legal drama in Maricopa County , and her remarks offer the first insight from an outside law - enforcement official who has some knowledge of the cases Arpaio and Thomas have lodged against county officials .
Maricopa County Sheriff 's Chief Deputy David Hendershott said that the Yavapai County Attorney 's Office mishandled the allegations and that Polk was n't as familiar with the cases as she implied .
But Polk 's words appeared to shock Thomas , who learned about the letter the same day a rally was held near his office .
More than 250 people , mostly attorneys , gathered in front of the Superior Court complex in downtown Phoenix on Monday to protest criminal charges filed against a Superior Court judge who is accused of hindering prosecution , obstructing a criminal investigation and bribery .
Thomas laughed off the rally with a quip : " They predicted 1,000 people would turn out , and obviously that did n't materialize .
So , I guess I 'm not as big a draw as the sheriff . "
He said he could not comment on Polk 's letter .
Hendershott spoke on behalf of Arpaio .
Hendershott said that Polk 's office repeatedly failed to issue subpoenas the Sheriff 's Office needed .
" It seemed clear to us that this case was being deliberately stalled , " he said .
" We basically let her know that her work product was ineffective . "
Hendershott implied that Polk was interested in becoming a judge and was trying to curry favor with attorneys and politicians by stalling the investigation .
Polk declined to comment , saying the letter speaks for itself .
Hendershott said that , after learning of Polk 's letter , he also notified the FBI of his concerns about Polk 's handling of the investigations .
Criminal inquiries
In April , Thomas asked Polk to take over Stapley 's prosecution , which involved his financial - disclosure forms , and the grand - jury investigation into the planned court - tower project in downtown Phoenix .
Hendershott said that his office also was trying to get Yavapai County to issue subpoenas in an investigation of Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox .
When the cases were handed over , Polk told The Republic , she had no personal relationship with Thomas .
Polk said she worked with the Sheriff 's Office on the cases for the next six months , then returned the cases to the Maricopa County Attorney 's Office .
In Polk 's letter , she wrote that she was " happy to remove myself from the cases and from contact with Sheriff Arpaio .
My discomfort grew daily and my role in restraining potential abuses of power increasingly more difficult . "
The letter does not specify details about the potential abuses .
In a letter Thomas sent to The Republic to defend his office and complain about the newspaper 's editorial opinions , he said he went to great lengths to show fairness in the investigations and sought help from outside agencies - to no avail .
He said his only option was to pursue the cases himself at a " great personal and professional cost . "
" While we do not ask for accolades , we must defend ourselves from repeated public attacks , " he wrote .
" These attacks , quite unlike our own actions , genuinely threaten the foundation of our government . "
Similar message
The attorneys who rallied Monday also criticized Thomas and Arpaio for what they see as heavy - handed tactics .
" I think all Maricopa County citizens need to be very concerned about this attack on the independent judiciary , " defense attorney John Curry said , " because without an independent judiciary , there is no rule of law . "
Thomas has fought Superior Court judges for several years .
In 2006 , he took Presiding Judge Barbara Mundell to federal court in a successful bid to stop a probation program conducted in Spanish for DUI offenders .
And on Dec. 10 , Thomas charged Presiding Criminal Judge Gary Donahoe with bribery , obstructing a criminal investigation and hindering prosecution over Donahoe 's rulings in the court - tower probe .
Donahoe had ordered that Thomas remove himself from that case , given the infighting with other elected county officials .
Thomas then passed the court - tower investigation and the first Stapley case to Yavapai County .
Earlier this month , Thomas filed a civil suit in federal court accusing several judges , the Board of Supervisors and private attorneys with racketeering over the investigations .
Among the speakers at the rally was Judge Timothy Ryan 's brother Tom Ryan , a civil attorney .
" By your very conduct , Mr. Thomas , you have become a threat to the rule of law and the Constitution you swore to uphold , " Tom Ryan said .
Among the protesters were a few judges , Hispanic community activists and some of Thomas ' and Arpaio 's political rivals .
Not all defense lawyers approved of the rally .
" You 've got lawyers like me who have been fighting excesses by the state for years , and the courts have allowed the accumulation of power that has occurred , " attorney Adrian Fontes said .
" Then , when one of their own gets charged , they expect the entire community to come to their rescue . "
Clutter is n’t just about making you stressed out and irritated , it can actually have an impact on your wallet and your bank account !
1 . When you ca n’t find something , you buy it again
This has happened to me many a time .
Before I started keeping things organized , and keeping a loose inventory of what I owned , I would buy another Phillips head screwdriver when I could n’t find my first one .
Now my tools are organized , in one spot , always put back in its place and never lost .
You also ca n’t really trust your memory to recall what you have purchased or not .
This is also a big problem when you are out shopping and thinking you need another plain , classic black sweater .
2 . You are paying for that space where you live
Where you live costs money .
Whether it ’s your apartment , your own home , your parents ’ home , a dorm room , or a hotel .
If you pay $ 1000 a month for a 1000 square foot apartment , that ’s $ 1 per square foot .
If you clutter up half of the apartment and cannot use the space , you are wasting $ 500 a month , paying for what is essentially storage .
3 . When you ca n’t find something , you lose time
And time costs money ( although I should mention that time is more valuable than money , as you can never earn back those lost years of being a workaholic ) .
If you are running late to meet a new client , and you need to find your laptop bag , if you ca n’t locate it , you are losing out on establishing goodwill with that client .
4 . You could be considering buying a larger home or paying for external storage
Many people think they need to move to a bigger house because there is just NO MORE SPACE .
In reality , they probably just need to get rid of their stuff , and they will see that they have more than enough space .
This can cost you in the hundreds of thousands .
You have to sell your old home by paying a real estate agent , buy a new , bigger home by talking to a banker about a second mortgage and spend money moving your family , settling in , and purchasing more furniture for your now too big house .
Unless you are giving up your life and job temporarily , and taking a backpacking tour around the globe , you should never , ever have to pay for those rent - by - the - month storage facilities .
I cannot imagine why it seems logical to pay for storage to house your things .
It ’s stuff .
Repeat after me : S - T - U - F - F .
Do not squeeze any hard earned dollar out of yourself pay to house things .
5 . You pay for it in stress
Media Statement
Statement by the Special Rapporteur for the Occupied Palestinian Territories , Richard Falk ,
on the first anniversary of the Gaza war , 27 December 2009
UN expert urges pressure on Israel to end blockade of Gaza , and the implementation of the Goldstone Report
GENEVA – “ People of conscience everywhere , as well as governments worldwide and the United Nations , should take note of the dire situation in Gaza , ” says the Special Rapporteur for the Occupied Palestinian Territories , Richard Falk , one year after the start of the Israeli military campaign against the Gaza Strip .
“ The ordeal of the 1.5 million residents of Gaza affected by the Israeli blockade , over half of whom are children , has been allowed to continue without any formal objection by governments and at the UN , ” stresses Falk .
For the independent expert , “ so far , there is no evidence of meaningful international pressure being brought to bear to end the blockade or to ensure that Israeli and Hamas officials are held accountable for alleged war crimes perpetrated during the Gaza attacks . ”
In his view , “ this represents both a tragic failure of responsibility by the powerful governments of the world and of the UN . ”
“ The unlawful blockade imposed by Israel continues , and is in its third year , ” says the UN expert , noting that insufficient food and medicine is reaching Gazans , producing a further deterioration of the mental and physical health of the entire civilian population since Israel launched Operation Cast Lead against the territory on 27 December 2008 , and maintained its military attack for 22 days .
Israel has not allowed building materials to enter the Gaza Strip to repair the billions of dollars of damage resulting from the heavy bombardment and artillery assaults on the civilian infrastructure of the whole area .
The blockade continues to cause major breakdowns of the electricity and sanitation systems due to the Israeli refusal to let spare parts needed for repair get through the crossings .
For the Special Rapporteur Richard Falk , two urgent types of action should be encouraged on this dismal anniversary :
that Israel ’s European and North American allies insist that Israel immediately ends its illegal blockade of the Gaza Strip , backed up by a credible threat of economic sanctions .
It was n’t very long ago that a dinner party guest who wanted to spare the hostess any embarrassing contention simply avoided discussing religion or politics and stuck to the weather .
Not anymore .
In fact , it says something unutterably depressing about the state of the nation that we ’ve finally managed to politicize even the climate .
Take , for example , the controversy that erupted on the eve of the global climate conference in Copenhagen , when hackers skeptical about global warming stole and released e-mails and documents from computers at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in Britain .
The center is an important source of baseline historical data on climate change , and the hackers claim the e-mails show that scientists there manipulated , suppressed and even falsified numbers to make a case for global warming .
Others who ’ve looked at the material say taking e-mails out of context creates misleading impressions , and that the worst you can say about the British climatologists is that they evinced an arrogant desire to keep what they regarded as the skeptics ’ “ junk science ” out of peer review journals .
In either case , the unit ’s chief has stepped down and an investigation is underway .
Far more interesting has been the immediate reaction by the enthusiasts who ’ve labeled the affair -- what else ? -- Climategate .
This week , former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said the evidence of wrongdoing was clear and that President Obama should scrap plans to attend the conference .
In Hollywood , two conservatives , screenwriter Roger L. Simon and filmmaker Lionel Chetwynd -- yes , Virginia , there are conservatives west of La Brea -- urged the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to take back the 2007 Oscar it gave Al Gore for the documentary “ An Inconvenient Truth . ”

The impact of this autonomic red -
blue division often is amplified by the fact that we Americans are , by and large , technologically advanced but scientifically illiterate .
Our national conversation is dominated by a culture of assertion rather than a respect for evidence reasonably assessed .
Thus the endless wrangling over self - evident nonsense like creationism .
It ’s precisely the insistence on treating a scientific theory , evolution , and an allegorical notion , creationism , with a faux evenhandedness that creates a situation in which 75 % of Americans believe most scientists disagree over global warming .
In fact , the scientific consensus on the issue is broad and deep .
Nor does it rely on science done at the Climatic Research Unit at East Anglia .
Even if something untoward occurred there , we have two other scientific organizations providing baseline climate data -- both of which happen to be funded and directed by the U.S. government .
One is NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies , and the other is the Global Historical Climatology Network -- operated not by the EPA or the Interior Department but by the Commerce Department .
Their historical data essentially matches that compiled at East Anglia .
So what are we to believe : that huge numbers of British and American scientists have entered into a conspiracy to dupe the world on climate change ?
Why ?
What would they stand to gain ?

As Alan I. Leshner , who heads the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science , wrote this week : “ It is wrong to suggest that apparently stolen e-mails . . . somehow refute a century of evidence based on thousands of studies .
. . .
Doubters insist that the Earth is not warming .
This is in stark contrast to the consensus of 18 of the world ’s most respected scientific organizations , who strongly stated in an Oct. 21 letter to the U.S. Senate that human - induced climate change is real .
Still , the doubters try to leverage any remaining points of scientific uncertainty about the details of warming trends to cast doubt on the overall conclusions shared by traditionally cautious , decidedly nonradical science organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences and the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science . ”
Long ago , Cicero suggested that a mysterious public act could be best assessed by asking :
Who benefits ?
Is it really any accident that Palin and most of the GOP lawmakers trying to discredit the science on global warming come from states enriched by petroleum production and industries with sizable carbon footprints ?
( The delegate from Saudi Arabia has taken a similar position at Copenhagen . )
If you feel like you ’ve been here before , think back on the long and agonizing debate over tobacco regulation and second - hand smoke .
As additional tens of thousands died ,
Big Tobacco produced one eccentric scientific skeptic after another .
Every one of them got a sympathetic hearing from lawmakers elected from tobacco - growing states .

Eric Shaqfeh studies blood at Stanford University , using computer models that simulate how the fluid and the cells it contains move around .
On November 11 at a meeting of the scientific society AVS , he will present his latest unpublished findings from two studies .
One shows how components in blood line up to prepare for healing ; the other demonstrates the best shape to use for man-made nanoparticles that target cancers -- a surfboard .
The different components that move through our blood stream are not evenly distributed .
For years , scientists have known that platelets -- which help blood to clot -- stay close to the walls of blood vessels as they circulate .
" When somebody cuts himself , the fact that the platelets are sitting seven times more frequently at the edges of the little blood vessels is critical , " says Shaqfeh .
His models suggest that when a new platelet is made , it takes longer than expected to migrate to and line up at the edge -- as much as ten or fifteen minutes to establish " hemostatis , " in which blood cells are properly distributed in the body .
The research , funded by the Army , suggests that current techniques for blood transfusions may not be ideal .
Freezing platelets , which is common practice , may change their shape and disrupt their movements , and there may be better ways to give transfusions that establish the proper blood arrangement faster , says Shaqfeh .
In related work , Shaqfeh added tiny nanoparticles of various sizes and shapes into his blood models .
Such particles are of interest to the cancer researchers , who hope to use nanoparticles to target the walls of blood vessels that feed tumors .
Shaqfeh found that surfboard - shaped particles stayed closest to the walls of blood vessels .
He will soon be working with another group to test fluorescent surfboard - shaped particles in actual blood vessels to see how they behave .
The talk " The Microfluidics of NonSpherical Colloidal Particles and Vesicles with Application to Blood Additives " is on November 11 , 2009 .
Heather in Indianapolis is the kind of gal who helps out a pal who ’s down on his luck .
So when her marginally employed friend needed a place to crash while he got back on his feet , she let Greg live in her house and help himself to her food and other belongings , like her laptop , “ pretty much rent - free , ” for three months .
One day , after several hours spent trying to get rid of all the spyware on her computer — thanks to all the porn sites she found in the browser history — she turned on parental controls .
( A lil ’ passive - aggressive ?
Maybe . )
Then , when she forgot to log off one day , Greg removed them .
When Heather figured this out ( after being bombarded by spyware once again ) she added the parental controls back .
And Greg — instead of saying something like , “ Hey , did you realize those settings block stuff like Google and Careerbuilder ? ” — left her this charming note .
“ According to this note , ” Heather says , “ in addition to all the horrible things I ’ve done such as give him a place to live , let him eat my food , give him breaks on rent for months at a time and put up with his laziness , carelessness and filth , I have also DENIED HIM A SOCIAL LIFE !
OMG ! ”

China , Japan , Vietnam , Indonesia , Afghanistan , Pakistan ...
US president Barack Obama ran through the gamut of nations as he articulated another elegant Asia policy speech in Tokyo this week .
Conspicuous by its absence was India .
Was India not on his radar ?
Or was it such a close ally that he skipped naming it at a public function ?
It left New Delhi wondering .
Just two days later , bam !
He did something even more astonishing by acquiescing in a Chinese demand to let Beijing assume the role of a monitor in South Asia , an area where China is seen by India as part of the problem , not the solution .
As Manmohan Singh heads to Washington this weekend for a state visit with Obama , capping a week of US - Asia engagement , it is becoming increasingly obvious that something is amiss in Indo - US relations .
Somewhere , it would appear , the growing mutual faith , fostered by the much - maligned George Bush Jr and Manmohan Singh , seems to be chipping at the edges .
The meeting in Washington could make the growing edginess apparent .
There will , no doubt , be an accumulation of many small ideas - agriculture , education , technology , climate change , business , counter - terrorism , and so on - which would be cemented by the good personal chemistry between Manmohan Singh and Obama at the summit .
But would it all add to the big picture that was emerging between the two biggest democracies of the world ?
What is this " big picture " ?
The Americans have articulated it thus .
In March 2005 , the Bush administration 's advisor , Philip Zelikow , defined its new policy on South Asia , saying : " ( The US ' ) goal is to help India become a major world power in the 21st century .
We understand fully the implications , including military implications of this statement . "
Former US ambassador to India , Robert Blackwill recently elaborated on it , " Bush based his transformation of US - India relations on the core strategic principle of democratic India as a key factor in balancing the rise of Chinese power .
This was not based on the concept of containing China .
Rather , it centered on the idea that the US and India had enormous equities in promoting responsible international policies on the part of China and that deep US - India bilateral cooperation in that respect was in the vital national interests of both countries . "
In other words , the US was beginning to see India as a key player in Asia , at par with China ; in fact , possibly as a democratic counterweight to an overtly ambitious China .
Indo - US relations started on this new path which culminated with the nuclear deal .
That was expected to have been the beginning of the game - changing experience .
Somewhere it seems the Obama administration does n't have , or have n't yet developed , a taste for the experience .
It 's not yet able to see the next stage of the transformation .
For , the big picture is ultimately about transforming institutions and mindsets of the administration of the two countries .
William Cohen , former US defence secretary , does n't quite agree .
He told Crest : " I think President Obama has a big picture on India , for he decided months ago to host PM Singh for the first official state visit of his presidency .
It is well understood in policy circles in Washington , but perhaps not expressed clearly or often enough , that India continues to play a critical role in the stability of South Asia .
President Obama is trying to develop relationships on a broad base to promote stability and peace in the world . "
Cohen 's optimism is n't shared by Ashley Tellis , senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment .
Says Tellis : " The Obama administration is not thinking in geopolitical terms . "
Adds an Indian official : " This administration is taking a regime - centred approach to international politics .
That is a structural flaw . "
As a matter of fact , New Delhi is still to get a handle on the Obama administration 's strategic priorities where India is concerned .
Says a top Indian official : " We understand America 's tactical compulsions .
What we do n't understand is what is its big strategy . "
Some analysts say that it 's still early to expect a clear strategic direction from the Obama regime .
For one thing , it 's still only Obama 's first year in office ( it took Bush and Bill Clinton four years to start a meaningful engagement with India ) .
For another , Obama was thrown into the deep end with the financial crisis , Iraq and then the war in Afghanistan forcing him to take up the urgent before the important .
So , it would be silly to get impatient , say the analysts , while pointing out that Obama will be in India before another year is out , which too will be a first for a US President .
It was also possible , they say , the structural imbalances between the US and China - caused by the financial crisis - is forcing Obama to be more pliant than he would have been otherwise .
So , as Obama feels his way , could New Delhi stepped into the breach ?
Yes , perhaps , but India 's foreign policy has been traditionally passive , and reaction - oriented .
What has possibly caused greater inertia in South Block is that , at the officials ' level , there is still apprehensions about being seen as a US partner .
This is a far cry from the almost lusty way in which Indian and US civil society rush to engage - through business , education , and every other 21st century attribute .
The contrast only reinforces the need to change the mindset of officialdom .
Unless changed , small things can become big irritants .
This used to be the case in the Clinton years , because there was no big idea behind the relationship .
The pattern is again becoming similar .
When Obama said that a resolution of the Kashmir problem was key to sorting out the mess in Afghanistan , it set Indian hackles up .
Likewise , when Stanley McCrystal stated in his review that Indian activity in Afghanistan was raising concerns in Pakistan , India got deeply upset , without really engaging with the Americans on this front .
In fact , in all these months , only former foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon has made the effort to intensively engage with the Obama administration and give them an understanding of Indian strategic thought .
With the US - China joint statement this week , New Delhi is bristling yet again in the belief that Obama is giving China a free rein at a time when India - China ties are particularly low .
All of this has made Indo - US relations once again a -rhythmic .
The two countries are rarely moving in pace , and often botching up things in areas where they had developed an understanding .
On Afghanistan , for instance , American and Indian policies are running largely parallel to each other .
India is one of the largest stakeholders in Afghanistan after the US , and yet there is no coordination between the two , largely because Washington is still too busy trying to keep the Pakistan generals in humour by giving them all kinds of sops .
India feels , as a result , jihadis are virtually running the show in the Afghanistan - Pakistan border area .
But no one is still taking the initiative to make Washington see reason .
China is more complicated than Pakistan or Afghanistan .
As it happens , this is China 's moment , and both India and the US concede as much .
However , what is worrying folks here is whether Obama 's Asia tour , especially his statement in China , indicates his desire to wind down the American super - power status in the region .
If that were so , China will move to fill in the vacuum not because it 's pushy and aggressive but because US would be ceding far too much ground .
The alarm at this possibility was in evidence this week as Obama travelled through China .
Many felt Obama went to China " as a profligate spender going to see his banker . "
And China never let him forget it .
Not only were his public events censored , he was the first US president in a while not to get a live broadcast in China .
Also the Chinese managed to get a joint statement out of a US president after failing to do so for eight years with George Bush .
The new US thinking on China is to try and persuade China to sit hard on Pakistan regarding its support to terrorists and Al Qaeda .
But this thinking , according to Indian strategists , is flawed because it's not in Chinese interest to make Pakistan " behave " with India .
The strategy could end up as a repeat of the North Korean experience .
Said a senior official , " China believes it has India pinned by Pakistan and its jihadi antics the same way it believes it has Japan pinned with North Korea and its nuclear antics . "
China , therefore has little reason to help clean up Pakistan .
The world around India is not looking good .
And with the US otherwise occupied , there could be a dangerous drift in Indo - US relations .
The instinctive official Indian response is that this is the time to batten down the hatches .
Says a high - level policy maker : " Keep your head down .
Let us consolidate the gains we have made with the US over the past few years . "
These would be incremental gains for India in development and economic areas , security and defence .
It would seem Obama thinks along these lines .
As he had said : " Our rapidly growing and deepening friendship with India offers benefits to all the world 's citizens as our scientists solve environmental challenges together , our doctors discover new medicines , our engineers advance our societies , our entrepreneurs generate prosperity , our educators lay the foundation for our future generations , and our governments work together to advance peace , prosperity , and stability . "
But strategists do n't think that biding the time is a bright idea .
K Subrahmanyan , one of India 's top strategic thinkers , said this is the time for India to take the lead in the relationship .
According to him , Obama changed the rules of the game in China , when he said conflict was no longer possible , but competition was .
India , he believes should step into the breach , and offer to partner US in innovations , technology , and other areas , to redefine the global race once more .
He insists that Obama finds the thought of China being US ' banker disagreeable .
India should now reach out and partner the US to wean it off that dependency .
Tellis says that Obama should take the initiative and support India at the UN Security Council , bring it into the global non-proliferation regime , so by time US convenes its nuclear security summit in 2010 , India is there as leader of the disarmament ideal .
Suggestions are many and they often come easier than it is possible to act on them .
Still , it would seem that unless India takes the lead in Indo - US ties , it will continue to be wary of Obama .
And from there , a return to distrust in bilateral relationship is not such a big step away .
On Wednesday evening I attended a tasting of fifteen wines from Bordeaux 2005 .
The vintage was widely hailed as superb and pre-recession demand drove the prices into the stratosphere .
Aside from the outrageous apparent quality of the wines , the tasting had two other attractions : the ability to taste some of the top wines blind and to do so in the company of Robert Parker .
Over 100 of us packed a room in a midtown hotel for the event , organized by Executive Wine Seminars .
I arrived fifteen minutes early and it was already hard to find a seat at a table .
Five wines were pre-poured into five ISO glasses , and there was some bread and cheese .
At my table were people who had come in from Chicago , Wisconsin , Delaware and Napa .
And they had paid a lot of money too : $ 795 each ( I was fortunate enough to have gotten a ticket from someone who couldnâ€™t attend ) .
The air practically buzzed with anticipation .
Even though the tasting was blind , everyone knew the lineup of wines and it included some of the most heralded wines of the vintage as the Parker scores ( in parentheses ) indicate :
Angelus ( 98 ) â€¢ Cos d’Estournel ( 98 ) â€¢ Ducru Beaucaillou ( 97 ) â€¢ Haut Brion ( 98 ) â€¢ Lafite Rothschild ( 96 + ) â€¢ La Mission Haut Brion ( 97 ) â€¢ Larcis Ducasse ( 98 ) â€¢ Latour ( 96 + ) â€¢ L’Eglise Clinet ( 100 ) â€¢ Margaux ( 98 + ) â€¢ Montrose ( 95 ) â€¢ Pape Clement ( 98 ) â€¢ Pavie ( 98 + ) â€ ¢Le Gay ( 95 ) â€¢ Troplong Mondot ( 99 )
In addition to my excitement about tasting these wines , I was eager to see Parker engage in a blind tasting .
Blind tastings are incredibly challenging , of course , and can humble even the most accomplished tasters .
On the other hand , Parker is known to be a formidable taster , and he has made some impressive claims about his own tasting abilities .
In the famous profile of Parker published in The Atlantic ( that Parker displays on his web site ) back in December 2000 , the author wrote that Parker “ stores the sensation of each [ wine ] into a permanent gustatory memory .
When I asked him about the mechanical aspects of his work , he told me in a matter - of - fact way that he remembers every wine he has tasted over the past thirty - two years and , within a few points , every score he has given as well . ”
2005 is a vintage that is obviously very fresh in his memory ( and he has said it is the greatest Bordeaux vintage he has experienced in his storied career ) , and given his apparent total recall of the wines he tastes , I was obviously very keen to see how he ’d fare in a blind tasting –particularly one involving his favorite wines of the vintage .
Parker himself was in good spirits , chatting and being photographed with many of the attendees .
A burly man , he was wearing a black , open - necked shirt and a gray sport coat with red lÃ©gion dâ€™honneur pin on the lapel .
On his left , Parker had a â€œsurpriseâ€  guest , Dominique Renard , a nÃ©gociant from Bordeaux who Parker had been wanting to meet up with Parker so Parker invited him to join the seminar .
In his opening remarks , Parker placed the 2005 vintage in the pantheon of vintages that includes 45 , 47 , 59 , 61 , and 82 .
He also said that it was tough to taste Bordeaux that was so clearly meant for the long haul at this point in its evolution and praised the organizer , Howard Kaplan of EWS , for â€œtaking time away from his family this morningâ€ to double decant the wines ( from bottle to a decanter , then back into the rinsed bottle ) .
He said he hadnâ€™t tasted these wines since 2007 .
He also touched on the probable quality of the 09 vintage ( â€œlooks superbâ€ ) as well as the 08s ( “ a much underrated vintage ” ) and the difficulties of 07 ( “ will be discounted very seriously ” ) .
Finally , we dove into the first flight .
It was clearly divided between two modern style wines , # 1 and # 3 , that were quite popular ( but that I didnâ€™t really care for ) and the others .
The second wine was quite reticent and closed and some attendees , including Parker , dumped on it for that reason .
I actually had a hard time deciding whether this was delicate or closed and , in the end , I decided on both .
The fourth wine was a wall of tannins , but the tannins were elegant and the wine seemed quite like Cabernet .
Parker opined after the flight that it was very definitely a Medoc and probably a first growth .
The final wine in the flight was drinking the best right now , truly quite delicious .
Parker suggested it was a Pomerol ( on the right bank ) .
In his overview of the first flight , Parker discussed the powerful tannins of the wines and that these wines would likely outlive him .
When he said , â€ œthe worst thing you could do is die with a full cellar , â€ the room burst into laughter and a smattering of applause .
Unfortunately , given that there were only five glasses , we had to dump what remained of the first flight to make way for the second .
Wine number six was bursting with plump and juicy red fruits that I found to be stewy .
The seventh wine had an alluring nose with just a hint of Brett ( think earth and horses ) , and a gorgeous structure with a balance of tannin from both the barrel and the grapes .
The eighth wine had a pretty nose of rose petal but , in my view , had a slightly confected quality on the palate .
Parker suggested after the flight that it might be Cos dâ€™Estournel .
The ninth wine was another beauty and , for me , the wine of the night .
Although there was another big slab of tannins , the tannins were elegant undergirding a delicate layer of dark berry aromas .
Tightly wound and clearly one for the long haul , I would gladly tuck this away in my basement to enjoy decades from now .
Parker called the wine â€œvirtually perfect , â€ and thought it was from the Medoc .
The tenth wine was another beauty , with a lovely herbal note on the aroma .
On the palate , huge but graceful tannic structure proved that the best wines can have both power and elegance .
Parker said it was â€œvery Medoc and very cabernetâ€  but likely not to be a first growth and suggested , specifically , Ducru .
Overall , he called this flight a â€œreally extraordinaryâ€ flight of wines .
The final flight started badly with a horrendously corked wine .
Fortunately , Howard found another bottle and brought it to our table .
I found this pour to have a sort of char brulÃ©e note , a juiciness on the midpalate but also a nice minerally quality at the core .
Parker called it â€ œshut down .â€ 
The twelfth wine was big , rich , luscious but the tannins were not a wall , rather rich , polished , and expensive , the Ferragamo loafer of tannins .
I thought it was a good example of the modern style .
The thirteenth wine was a lovely aromatically but on the palate had somewhat sweet tannins .
Parker commented that he thought it was a first growth .
The fourteenth wine I found to be overblown , a wall of tannins with overripe fruit .
Parker liked it , however , so much so that he hailed it as a first growth .
The final wine was another gorgeous example of cabernet in a bit more modern style , rich , tarry but not to tarry .
Parker didnâ€™t have a comment on this wine .
The organizers of the Executive Wine Seminars like to have the participants vote on the top wines of the tasting .
So we all filled in our top three choices , and with alacrity that would put many polling stations to shame , Howard ran the tallies , awarding three points to a wine for a first place finish , two for a second , and one for a third .
But before the unveiling , one of the organizers asked Parker if he cared to pick two wines out of the tasting .
â€ œUm , no , â€ was his immediate reply to an outburst of laughter from the room .
However , he then decided to elaborate a few picks , as is the tradition at these annual EWS events .
He said that his favorite wines of the evening were 9 , 8 , and 3 followed closely by 13 , 14 and 1 .
As to specific picks , he ventured that wine # 6 was Pape Clement , # 8 was Cos , # 10 Ducru , # 9 Margaux , # 13 Latour , # 14 Lafite , saying that it was hard to confuse those last two but that they could be the other way around .
Here was the order of the wines with their popular vote tallies :
1. Pavie , St. Emilion ( 51 )
2. Haut Brion ( 6 )
3. Pape Clement ( 56 )
4. Montrose ( 2 )
5. Ducru ( 30 )
6. Angelus , St. Emilion ( 57 )
7. La Mission Haut Brion ( 43 )
8. Lâ€ ™Eglise Clinet , Pomerol ( 53 )
9. Le Gay , Pomerol ( 53 )
10 . Latour ( 86 )
11 . Larcis Ducasse , St. Emilion ( 28 )
12 . Margaux ( 40 )
13 . Lafite ( 28 )
14 . Troplong Mondot , St. Emilion ( 54 )
15 . Cos dâ€ ™Estournel ( 39 )
I note the appellations of the six right bank wines since they are mostly Merlot based as opposed to the Cabernet - based wines from the Medoc .
What conclusions can we draw from this ?
Well , for one , you could have ten bottles of Le Gay , Parkerâ€™s favorite wine of the evening , for the price of one bottle of Lafite .
A second conclusion is about the wines themselves .
There are clearly some winemakers that have pushed a style of wine making that makes forceful , extracted wines , enhanced with new oak and the resulting wood tannin .
Sometimes that style can obscure the grape variety or even the place to such an extent that one might confuse a cabernet for a merlot , a Medoc for a Pomerol .
And in a blind tasting , a delicate and / or close wine such as Haut Brion can fare poorly when sandwiched between two opulent wines such as Pavie and Pape Clement .
A final issue is about points and the nature of blind tasting , a capricious undertaking if there ever were one .
Although Parker did not rate the wines yesterday , his top wine of the evening ( Le Gay ) was the lowest rated in the lineup from his most recent published reviews .
It goes to show that on any given night , one wine can show better than its â€œpedigree.â€ 
For all the precision that a point score implies , it is not dynamic , changing with the wines as they change in the bottle nor does it capture performance from one tasting to the next .
Blind tasting removes preconceptions about wines while maintaining the ability to rate wines in a peer group setting .
Wednesday night , Parker upended the order of his published ratings of the wines and , in the process , could not correctly identify any of these wines .
In print , he awarded Lâ€ ™Eglise Clinet , a Pomerol , a score of 100 points .
While he did call it his second favorite wine of the night , it is interesting to note that he could not pick out this wine in the lineup ( he thought the actual Lâ€ ™Eglise to be Cos , a wine that is not only from across the river , but from St. Estephe , an appellation known for the extreme tannic structure of the wines ) .
In that same vein , he mistook Lafite , a Paulliac , for Troplong - Mondot , a new wave St. Emilion .
Blind tasting can be ruthless in its outcomes .
A high - fat , high - sugar diet does more than pump calories into your body .
It also alters the composition of bacteria in your intestines , making it easier to gain weight and harder to lose it , research in mice suggests .
And the changeover can happen in as little as 24 hours , according to a report Wednesday in the new journal Science Translational Medicine .
Many factors play a role in the propensity to gain weight , including genetics , physical activity and the environment , as well as food choices .
But a growing body of evidence , much of it accumulated by Dr. Jeffrey I. Gordon of Washington University in St. Louis , shows that bacteria in the gut also play a key role .
Humans need such bacteria to help convert otherwise indigestible foods into digestible form .
Ninety percent of the bacteria fall into two major divisions , or phyla : the Firmicutes and the Bacteroidetes .
Previous research had shown that obese mice had higher levels of Firmicutes , and lean ones had more Bacteroidetes .
Analyzing the genomes of the bacteria , Gordon and graduate student Peter Turnbaugh concluded that the Firmicutes were more efficient at digesting food that the body can’t .
Animals that have a higher proportion of Firmicutes convert a higher proportion of food into calories that can be absorbed by the body , making it easier to gain weight .
When the researchers transferred bacteria from obese mice into so - called gnotobiotic mice , which were raised in a sterile environment and had no bacteria in their guts , the mice gained more weight than did those receiving a similar amount of bacteria from lean mice , even though they were fed the same diet .
Gordon and Turnbaugh found that they could transfer bacteria from human intestines into gnotobiotic mice , which were fed a low - fat , plant - rich diet in the weeks before the bacteria were transplanted and for a month afterward .
After the bacteria were transplanted from a lean human donor , the colonies in the mice had a high proportion of Bacteroidetes and a low proportion of Firmicutes .
But within 24 hours after the mice were switched to a high - sugar , high - fat diet , the proportions of the two phyla were reversed .
With time , the mice also grew fatter than their littermates who did not receive the human bacteria .

Jesper Parnevik Comments on Tiger Woods Scandal
Swedish golfer Jesper Parnevik has decided to weigh in on the Tiger Woods affair scandal and with good reason .
It turns our he is the one who introduced Elin Nordegren to the PGA phenom back in 2000 , when she and her twin sister Josefin Nordegren were both employed by his family as nannies to the Parnevik children .
The 44 - year - old Swede and his wife Mia Parnevik hired the Nordegren sisters to serve as au pairs for their three offspring .
He has now come forward with an irate response to Woods ' current situation .
He said , " I would be especially sad about it since I 'm kind of -- I feel really sorry for Elin -- since me and my wife were at fault for hooking her up with him .
We probably thought he was a better guy than he is .
I would probably need to apologize to her and hope she uses a driver next time instead of the 3 - iron . "
Ironically , Mia was also a nanny to a family in Florida when she met her future husband Jesper in 1986 .
They currently reside in Jupiter , Florida - photos below .
Reporters caught up with Parnevik on Wednesday at Bear Lakes Country Club where he had just finished up the first - round play at a PGA Tour final - stage qualifier .
He offered up the following advice for Tiger : " Maybe not just do it , like Nike says . "

So what is really behind Tiger Woods apology ?

Searching the seas .
Artifacts found underwater are often better preserved than relics found on land ( Image : Jon Henderson / University of Nottingham )
KITTED out with the latest scuba gear , Garry Momber peers through the murky water to the seabed below .
It ’s dark – Momber is 11 metres below the water ’s surface and the black peat of the seabed absorbs what little light reaches the bottom .
Then the tide turns , and as clearer water flows in from the open seas , the decaying remains of an ancient forest emerge from the gloom .
Working quickly , he records details of the exposed material before the strengthening current forces him away from the site .
This is all in a day ’s work for Momber , who is director of the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology in Southampton , UK .
His job is to search for clues to a prehistoric world lost beneath the waves in the channel that separates the Isle of Wight from the south coast of England – to be precise , at a location 300 metres off the port of Yarmouth .
Momber ’s work is just part of a growing trend for searching the deep for clues to our distant past .
The field of underwater archaeology is perhaps best known for unearthing relics from more recent history , like Henry VIII ’s ship the Mary Rose , yet the seabed is stuffed with clues to prehistory too – especially a murky period 11,500 years ago , at the end of the last ice age , when early Europeans were slowly changing from being nomadic hunter - gatherers into settled farmers .
Back then , sea levels were 50 metres lower than today , and the vast majority of early …
' I 'm in a spot of bother ...':
What lorry driver rang to tell boss after being impaled by 8ft pole in freak accident
A lorry driver was speared by an 8ft pole and calmly called his boss to say : ' I 'm in a spot of bother . '
Jason Ripley was pierced through the chest - just inches from his heart - by the metal shaft after an accident in his delivery truck in Darlington , north east England .
The 39 - year - old drove into a horizontal barrier , which was hidden by a bush , and as it struck the side of his vehicle , it bounced on the bonnet and smashed through the windscreen .
Skewered : Jason Ripley is treated while a parking barrier pierces his chest
But as he lay impaled he realised nobody had seen the freak accident and he risked dying .
So he grabbed his mobile and phoned work to say : ‘ I ’ve had a bit of an accident - I ’m in a spot of bother . ’
Speaking of the moment he was skewered , he said : ‘ It went straight through my chest and out the back .
There were seven or eight feet of pole sticking out .
‘ It was only two or three inches from my heart .
I was just staring at the sky , thinking , “ That 's it , I 'm going to die ” . ’
He was lifted out of the seat by the impact and his vehicle came to a stop after 20 yards with the skewered driver left pinned against the back of the cab .
‘ My boss raced around to see me .
He was gob - smacked .
It was just out of this world , ’ he added .
Mr Ripley said his thoughts then turned to his family – his partner Helen Todd , 38 , and sons Joshua , 19 , and Jay , 11 – as he was being cut out of the vehicle by firefighters .
‘ That was the worst bit , when they clamped the jaws of the cutters on the pole and it started turning inside me , ’ he said .
The incident happened on August , 19 last year , but Great North Air Ambulance has just released the pictures to help raise cash .
‘ It was strange when I saw it turning , but by that stage I just wanted to get it out of there .
‘ Even when they put me in the helicopter there was still about four feet of pole going through me .
Recovered : Mr Ripley , 39 at home with 38 - year - old partner Helen Todd
‘ It was when I heard the Air Ambulance , that ’s when I thought , I ’m nearly there . ’
The minutes left in Jason ’s ‘ critical hour ’ were running low .
Forklift truck drivers at the scene of the accident moved parked cars so the helicopter could get close and airlift him to James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough .
Within minutes he was in the safe hands of the waiting surgeons .
He said : ‘ Someone told me , “ Do n’t worry , your going to be OK and when I woke up the pole was gone . ’
The pole meant he would not fit into a scanner .
He was induced into a 24 - hour coma while skilled surgeons cut into his ribs and slid the barrier out from the side , under his arm .
He has suffered lasting injuries from the trauma , but was back at work within months and counts himself lucky to be alive .
Mr Ripley released the photographs over a year after the crash to try and help raise money for the Great North Air Ambulance .
He said : ‘ It makes you appreciate what you 've got .
‘ It ’s clear to me without the Great North Air Ambulance I would have died .
‘ If they are n’t there people will die .
I will be indebted to them forever .
It took more than an hour to get me out of the truck .
‘ Without the helicopter I do n’t think I would have survived the trip to hospital .
‘ I ca n’t thank the GNAA , the doctors and the rescue team enough .
They are all truly amazing . ’
The accident happened on an industrial estate in Darlington when a loose pole , which was part of a gateway , bounced onto the bonnet of his truck and through the windscreen .
Mr Ripley still has a shoulder injury and had one rib removed following the accident .
He said : ‘ I was driving through a gateway from one part of the industrial estate to another when it happened .
‘ The pole was the gateway and was hanging loose but had been almost covered by overgrown bushes .
‘ As I drove through the gateway the pole caught the truck , bounced onto the cab and went through the windscreen .
‘ My colleagues were only a few hundred yards away so I phoned them first because it was easier to explain where I was than it would have been to the emergency services .
‘ It was strange because I did n’t feel much pain at all .
‘ I had a rib removed and two others tied together and I ’ve also got a shoulder injury which I will probably have for life . ’
WASHINGTON , Jan. 18 ( UPI ) --
The prospect of a mushroom cloud rising from the Dasht - e - Lut , Iran 's Desert of Stones , may not be Tehran 's greatest threat to international stability .
A successful test of an Iranian nuclear weapon at some point in the next few years may prove less destabilizing than a simple free market economic measure that Iran is said to be planning for March of this year .
Tehran is preparing to open a bourse , a mercantile exchange and potentially a futures market , where traders can buy and sell oil and gas , along the lines of the International Petroleum Exchange ( IPE ) in London and the NYTMEX in New York .

The differences are first , that this one would price its energy in euros , not dollars , and second , that it would not use West Texas Intermediate or Brent Crude ( from the North Sea ) as its standard oil for pricing .
It would use a Persian Gulf - produced oil instead .
So what ?
This sounds like a minor change , and possibly even a useful one , broadening the choice among traders and consumers in the kind of way that Adam Smith , the 18th century father of modern capitalism , would have recommended .
Not so .
This could be a far more profoundly punishing blow to American interests than Iran 's ability to manufacture a crude atom bomb that would have little credibility until it became small and stable and reliable enough to be delivered on some putative target .

The relationship between the oil price and dollar is intimate and important , and very useful to the dollar 's highly profitable status as the world 's reserve currency .
The prospect of a rival bourse and futures market opens the intriguing possibility , beyond hedging the future oil price , of profitable arbitrage between the euro and the dollar .
And if oil and gas are to be denominated in more than just one currency , why not open the trade to others ?
Why not denominate the price of a barrel of oil in Japanese Yen , or in Chinese yuan , the currency of the world 's second biggest oil importer ?
Why not , in short , end the monopoly rule of the almighty dollar ?
Such a move would not be welcomed in Washington , which swiftly moved after the fall of Baghdad in 2003 to reverse Saddam Hussein 's impudent decision to start selling Iraqi oil for euros , rather than dollars .
After all , the great benefit of running the world 's reserve currency means that if all else fails , the United States Treasury can just print more and more of the stuff and pay for its oil imports that way .
There are , naturally , limits to the degree to which the United States can debase its currency , as the world found with the first great OPEC price rise of 1973 , when the price per barrel tripled .
This is usually attributed to the political decision by Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil producers to punish the United States for its decisive support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War .
That is partly true , but the crucial OPEC decision was as a direct result of President Richard Nixon 's Aug. 15 decision to end the dollar 's link to the gold standard .

The dollar declined in value , which meant the OPEC producers received less value for their oil .
So at their Beirut meeting on Sept. 22 , OPEC adopted resolution XXV : 140 , which resolved to take " any necessary action ... to offset any adverse effects on the per barrel real income of member countries resulting from the international monetary developments as of Aug. 15 . "
That was also the time when Sheikh Zaki Yamani , the Saudi oil minister , first mentioned the possibility of deploying the ultimate weapon of an oil embargo .
Most of the financial world is currently awaiting another , similar devaluation of the dollar , in response to the monstrous scale of current deficit on the U.S. current account .
Writing in the Financial Times last week , Harvard Professor Marty Feldstein suggested that on the basis of the 1985 - 87 Louvre and Plaza devaluations , the dollar could fall as much as 40 percent or even more .
The markets simply do not know when .
But should it come after an Iranian bourse is up and running , some very tidy sums could be made by those playing a dollar - euro trade on Tehran 's energy futures market .
The Tehran bourse is listed as an objective for this year in Iran 's current five - year plan .
The Tehran Times reported July 26 that the final authorizations had been received for the bourse to go ahead .
Mohammad Javad Asemipour , the technocrat and former deputy petroleum minister who has been charged with launching the bourse , has made a number of discreet scouting trips to London , Frankfurt , Moscow and Paris .
Just after Christmas , he was quoted by the Iran Labor News Agency saying " transparency in oil transactions would be one of the advantages of having such an establishment " ( the bourse ) , and adding that this would " allow dealers access to related information and promote equal trade opportunities .

Asemipour is an elusive type , but one who seems convinced that Iran can play off the European against the Americans , the euro against the dollar .
Just over a year ago , he was quoted in the quasi- official Iran Daily saying that the Europeans have played " a beautiful game " with the United States during the years of sanctions , when they actively participated in economic projects , particularly in the energy sector , across Iran .
" In this game , the Europeans have pretended to be siding with America , whereas they got involved in business here and developed a sort of competition with the Americans , " he said .
" But in practice , they ( the Europeans ) have pursued their own interests . "
There is no shortage of officials in the Bush administration who nurture such suspicions of the French and Germans , despite what seems at the moment to be a common concern about Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
The question now is whether the world 's traders will come to a Tehran Bourse if and when it opens , bearing in mind that a similar idea in Dubai failed to gain much traction .
But that was before oil prices reached $ 65 a barrel , and before the Dubai 's partners in the Gulf Cooperation Council decided it was time to stop glowering at Iran as a potential enemy , and started to invite Tehran to their meetings as an observer .
Before , that is , the Arab world began to judge that whatever the American intentions , Iran had become the real winner of the Iraq War .
The world could be about to change much faster than we think , whether or not Iran tests an atomic device .
There are other , possibly more devastating weapons available that could hit a financially vulnerable American where it hurts most .
