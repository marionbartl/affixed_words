No Deposit Bonuses for Canadians
Online casinos give Canadian players a no deposit bonus when they join specific casino sites .
There currently is more choices of casinos to pick from in Canada then anywhere else .
Of course there is some which will not accept users but the majority do .
These are safe and secure site which have been in operation for years , and they do pay out wins directly to your bank account if that is what you are looking for .
Of course you can use web wallets to fund the casinos and withdraw wins , this is totally up to you .
To make things a bit better you will find special bonus casinos for Canada players where the no deposit offer is exclusive .
The amounts range from a few spins to thousands of dollars .
A couple months ago one player in Canada won over 7 million on a progressive jackpot game , there is a good chance that the next winner will be from Canada as well which the progressive is currently over 8 million .
So with the no deposit bonuses you can claim why not try your luck out .
The special no deposit bonus may end without giving notice , for this reason when you see promotions such as this one , you should join up as soon as you see it .
If not , the casino may end the promotion .
Mid-Air Collision of Glider and Jet near Reno : ASG - 29 vs. Hawker XP800
There 's been a lot of buzz this week about two recent accidents in the western United States , both of which occurred on Monday of this week .
Amazingly , neither accident killed anyone .
This is about one of them .
Akihiro Hirao , a visiting pilot from Japan , towed out from the Minden - Tahoe airport in an ASG - 29 ( one of the hottest new German sailplanes , a similar one is pictured at the right ) .
A few hours later , he collided with a Hawker XP800 ( a fast business jet ) around 15,000 feet ( different reports have published numbers between 13,000 and 16,000 ) that was descending to land at the Reno after a brief flight up from San Diego .
The impact was dramatic .
The Hawker was traveling at roughly 300 knots ( well over 300 miles per hour ) and it completely destroyed one wing of the glider as well as the nose cone of the jet .
I 've not seen any pictures posted of the glider wreckage yet ( they 'd look a lot worse since it eventually hit terrain at high speed ) .
But here are shots of the jet , which managed to make a gear - up landing at the nearby Carson City airport ( I was there not long ago myself ) .
In the close up you can see the glider 's wing spar sticking out of the jet !
As you might imagine , this has sparked a lot of discussion and debate in the soaring community -- especially those of us who fly in the Reno area during the summer .
Causes ?
We wo n't really know everything that we can until the NTSB finishes their investigation .
Based on the information I 've read and heard this week , there 's a good chance that the accident was preventable .
I 'm led to believe that the ASG - 29 had a working transponder on board but that it was n't currently powered up .
If that 's the case , it means the glider was virtually invisible to the jet 's pilot and co-pilot , not to mention Reno Air Traffic Control .
Even if the jet pilots could n't have visually detected the glider ( which is pretty difficult going that fast ) , their TCAS would have picked up the transponder signal and suggested a safe diversion .
If the glider was not equipped with a transponder , that was a serious oversight .
While they 're not required ( yet ? ) , it 's a very good idea to have one if you 're flying in busy airspace .
There 's a lot more I could say about this , but I 'll hold off until the NTSB publishes their report a few months from now .
Parachutes
People are often surprised to find out that glider pilots routinely wear parachutes .
An incident like this makes it clear .
Having a parachute may be the difference between living and dying .
The glider pilot parachuted to safety and was picked up a few hours later .
I was visiting my local parachute rigger ( Silver Parachute Sales and Service in Hayward ) today and we chatted about this .
They heard the news pretty quickly , partly because this sort of news travels fast , and partly because they packed the parachute .
This was , in fact , Darrin Silver 's " first save . "
Closing Thoughts
The pilots of the jet and the glider are to be commended for getting themselves and , in the case of the jet , their passengers safely on the ground .
Looking at the pictures of the damaged jet cockpit , it must have been pretty chaotic in there .

Update : Pictures and more links added on the morning of 8/30/2006 .
Update # 2 : I 've posted NTSB Preliminary Report on the Glider and Hawker Collision as a follow - up to this article .

Debian Lessons
Project management lessons from the Debian project .
5 September 2004
This text lists the important things I think the Debian development community has learned about project management in the course of developing the Debian GNU / Linux system .
These are my personal opinions , not those of the project or other developers .
I hope this list will be useful to Debian , other Linux distributions , and other free software projects .
This is the second version of this text .
The first one was written in the year 2000 .
Thanks to the people on Debian 's IRC channel for feedback since the first private drafts .
Thanks to Mark Brown for pointing out IRC versus mailing list for communication between developers .
Make sure things scale up .
Problems are always simpler when the project is small .
When the number of developers and packages grows a lot , small problems become big problems .
Make things distributed so that things can be worked on in parallel .
Make sure the foundation is good .
Debian has a pretty good package management system ( even though it has lots of minor flaws and warts ) .
This makes it much easier to build the system , when one can concentrate on making packages better , instead of having to fight the base system .
Document important things .
When people need to work together , they need to know how to take each other into consideration .
Rules are needed for how packages are laid out so that they do n't interfere with each other .
If these rules are n't written down , they will have to be remembered by the community memory and word of mouth , both of which are unreliable .
The Debian Policy documents are a fine example of this .
Debian could n't live without it .
( Note that when documenting things it 's important to document the reasons behind the decisions as well .
Debian documents do n't always do this well . )
Automate repetitive tasks when possible .
Repetitive tasks should be automated , especially if they are tricky or critical .
This reduces the number of human errors , and also frees up developers for more important tasks .
Debian examples include dinstall ( moves uploaded packages into the ftp server ) , lintian ( checks for many errors that are easy to make ) , and the automatic compilation for porting efforts .
They 're all absolutely necessary for Debian to maintain high levels of quality .
Avoid single points of failure , especially for volunteers .
Volunteers will always lack time at the critical point .
For critical jobs , have several people share the workload and make sure there are mechanisms for checking that things are going smoothly .
Do not worry about time tables ; keep goals realistic .
In big volunteer projects , time tables will always slip .
That is not a catastrophe , and it must be tolerated , but there should still be some effort in keeping them .
Goals must be kept realistic .
Make it easy to work independently .
The more interdependencies things have , the more communication is needed ( read : less time spent on productive hacking ) and the bigger the chance that a single developer or package will cause big problems .
For example , if many packages must manipulate the configuration of a server ( say , Apache ) , it is better if they can just drop a file in a directory of configuration files , rather than having to attempt to automatically edit a single configuration file .
Some things must be decided or handled centrally .
Security issues are one such example .
These must not be de-centralized or trouble will happen .
Do not overload developers .
Developers are volunteers with too little free time .
Make as few requirements on their time as possible .
For example , do not require that they follow high - volume mailing lists .
Overloaded developers have a tendency to disappear , or at least their packages will be of lower quality or less up - to - date than they might be .
Also do not let developers overload themselves by trying to do too much , and make it easy ( culturally and technically ) to give up packages , when the workload gets too high .
Be open and keep things public .
If you 're popular , your users will want to know what is going on .
Do not decide things behind closed doors .
Allow everyone to read the discussions leading to decisions and , preferably , allow everyone to participate in them , even if they are n't developers .
Developers may need a private forum as well , but it should be used as little as possible .
By doing things in private , you are hiding your motives and other people will be assuming the worst and react accordingly .
This applies within the project and between developers or groups of developers as well .
When things are decided that affect more developers than those involved in a particular discussion , the discussion must be held in a forum that all developers can participate it .
For example , IRC is not good enough , since not everyone will be present at any given time .
It 's OK to start a discussion on IRC , but before any decisions are made , it should be taken to , say , a mailing list .
Make it easy to contribute .
There are never too many developers , so make it natural and easy for people to join in and help with what they can , even if it is just reporting bugs .
Debian has recruited a thousand developers this way , and manages to have well over ten thousand packages .
Many developers only have one package , but it tends to be one they need themselves , so they 're motivated to keep it working .
Some barrier to entry may be necessary for quality and security .
The Debian New Maintainer process screens and trains prospective new Debian developers .
Note that this is a process with two different tasks .
On the one hand , it is necessary to make sure the people who become official developers are well - intentioned and have the right attitude : an official developer effectively has root privileges on a large number of machines and so they must be trustworthy .
On the other hand , many of the skills required of a Debian developer can be learned during the NM process .
The process also helps them become part of the Debian development community .
Have leadership .
There must be some way to solve conflicts and arguments , if a natural consensus does n't occur .
Different projects may need different kinds of leadership , but there has to be some way , formal or informal .
Conflicts are natural , but must n't get out of hand .
Developers are often opinionated , strong - minded , and bullheaded .
You can't avoid that .
They must be allowed to scream at each other every now and then , but fights must not be allowed to escalate .
Everyone in the project will have to be responsible for mediating between disagreeing parties , if they can't come to a consensus by themselves .
Unfinished fights will easily haunt the project .
Developers do not have to like each other , but they do have to get along , at least to the extent that they do n't prevent each other from working on the project .
If two people despise each other , they must learn to ignore each other , and especially to learn to ignore insults the other party may throw .
Use a bug tracking system .
An open bug tracking system makes it harder for bugs to be forgotten when developers are too busy , or leave the project , or lose their disks .
It also lets people see whether they want to use a package before installing it , and to find solutions or workarounds for bugs that are already known but not yet fixed .
Real world politics matter .
As the free software movement has grown , and Debian with it , people outside the programmer communities on the Internet have started to take notice .
Inevitably , this brings in matters of real world politics .
As a result , people within Debian need to mind such political issues as different developers voting for opposite parties or living in countries almost literally at war with each other .
Debian developers occasionally need to step very carefully to avoid upsetting each other .
One cannot assume Debian developers have anything in common except the desire to work together on a free operating system .
The social contract binds us together , pretty much nothing else does .
Controversial issues will result in a flame war and often will never really end .
Almost all discussions within Debian take part on mailing lists .
This is good in many ways , but has some drawbacks .
One such drawback is that the natural limitations on aggressiveness that are present in a face - to - face discussions are missing .
This means that controversial issues easily result in flame wars .
Another drawback is that there is no natural deadline to a mailing list discussion : in a face - to - face meeting , sooner or later the participants will want to go away and that ends the discussion .
On a mailing list , things can easily go on for weeks , and can easily re-surface at the drop of a hat .
These facts also mean that finding a consensus and making a decision as a group is hard .
Compensation helps keep people motivated .
Doing much work without any reward does not work in the long run .
The best form of compensation depends on the person .
For some , the compensation of having a Debian package of something they use themselves is enough .
For others , getting thank you notes is what makes them happiest .
What rarely works for anyone is getting flamed at for doing their best , even if is in reaction to an error they made .
Never , ever , write a program to mail Debian developers automatically .
Always make automatic mails opt-in .
Most Debian developers get and process huge amounts of e-mail each day .
They develop wildly different e-mail reading habits that are best suited for their different temperaments .
They tend to take their e-mail personally , and react strongly to any e-mail they did n't want to get .
Thus , sending them automatically generated e-mail ( say , to inform them that there is a new upstream version ) is a good way of annoying them .
Do n't make assumptions about people 's background .
Do n't assume anything about their ethnic , religious and cultural backgrounds , their political opinions , their linguistic ability , their technical training , their geographical location , their lifestyle , or their knowledge about issues not directly related to their packages .
For example , do n't assume they know what time zone you mean unless you are explicit about it ( and giving times of day in UTC is better than assuming that people know what " EST " is ) .
Do n't assume they know English well .
The fewer assumptions you make , the easier it is to communicate successfully .

A leading scholar sparked a furious row yesterday after she claimed to have ' wistful nostalgia ' for the days when female students were regularly groped and harassed by older male dons .
Mary Beard , professor of classics at Cambridge University and a fellow of Newnham College , said that pupils often had to put up with ' fumblings ' in order to get inspirational teaching .
She said she had an ' ambivalent attitude ' to being ' pawed ' by male academics but said that some of the worst offenders were great scholars .
But fellow female academics and equal opportunity campaigners condemned her comments as ' shocking and unacceptable ' .
They point out that victims of sexual harassment are unlikely to share her views on the emotive subject .
Professor Beard , 51 , made the controversial comments in a vigorous defence of Eduard Fraenkel who was Corpus professor of Latin at Oxford University from 1935 to 1953 , and one of the most renowned classical scholars of the 20th century .
The academic - who teaches at an all - women college - complains that Fraenkel 's reputation as a ' serial groper ' has been omitted from all biographies of him .
In a review of the Dictionary of British Classicists , Professor Beard claims that a female tutor used to warn her students that ' although they would learn a lot , they would probably be ' pawed about a bit ' by Fraenkel .
She describes how Baroness Warnock admitted in her memoirs that she had heady discussions about Latin and Greek with him , combined with ' kisses and increasingly constant fumblings with ... ( my ) underclothes ' .
Professor Beard , classics editor at the Times Literary Supplement , said : " Any academic woman older than her mid-forties is likely to have an ambivalent reaction to this .
" On the one hand , it is impossible not to feel sisterly outrage at what would now be deemed a straightforward case of persistent sexual harassment and the abuse of ( male ) power .
" On the other hand , it is also hard to repress certain wistful nostalgia for that academic era before about 1980 when the erotic dimension of pedagogy ( teaching ) which had flourished , after all , since Plato was stamped out . "
Professor Beard claims that Baroness Warnock shares that ' ambivalence ' as she weighs " the damage done ( to Fraenkel 's wife no less than to some of his ' girls ' ) against the inspirational teaching which came with , and was inextricable from the ' pawing ' . "
The academic also insists " it would be foolish to imagine that love for one 's wife is necessarily incompatible with ' pawing ' one 's female students " .
Professor Beard , who is married to art historian Robin Cormack and has two grown - up children , re-iterated her argument on her Internet website , dated August 1 , the Times Higher Education Supplement reveals today ( thurs ) .
But a spokesman for the Equal Opportunities Commission said he was sure that victims of this kind of behaviour do not feel a ' wistful nostalgia ' for the past .
He said : " It 's this kind of attitude that held women back in higher education for so long .
" Thankfully that 's not the case any more and women are leading the way in HE .
These kinds of attitudes should never be allowed back ( into HE ) . "
Kat Stark , women 's officer for the National Union of Students , said : " I find it incredibly hard to believe that anyone would view sexual harassment with ambivalence -- be it now or twenty years ago .
" All students have a right to learn in an environment free from any form of harassment , and to write about it with ' a certain wistful nostalgia ' is both shocking and unacceptable . "
June Pervis , professor of gender history at the university of Portsmouth , said : " Nostalgia ?
Where has that woman been living ?
" The wandering hands fraternity used their status and power to exploit female students , and some were silly enough to feel ' flattered ' by this attention ...
Very pathetic . "
And Gill Evans , professor of history at Cambridge , added : " I was chased round a table once by an amorous don ( I got away ) .
" I think it is and was an abuse of power and no - one should have to put up with being pawed to get inspirational teaching . "
But Professor
Beard hit back at the NUS attack , insisting she was ' not condoning sexual harassment ' .
She said : " The NUS needs to think a bit harder about history and what university used to be like and what people of my age look back to .
" The best comparison I can make is about smoking .
One looks at Humphrey Bogart movies that were surrounded by rings and rings of cigarette smoke and we have a wistful nostalgia for it .
That does n't mean that I think smoking should now be allowed in public places . "
When asked if she had been the subject of sexual harassment herself , she replied : " No , I 'm not a victim of this .
But the culture of universities in the 1960s and 1970s did n't put it in terms of harassment .
That 's what changed . "
She added : " I am terribly sorry if people got the impression that I 'm in favour of male sexual harassment because I 'm not . "
But she repeated her assertion that she felt a ' certain nostalgia ' for the ' mores ' of the 1960s and 1970s .
She claimed that ' something is lost and something is gained ' by the move to heavier policing of the issue .
She said : " It is certain that some people benefited from the old fashioned mores - there were some relationships of closeness that were extremely productive .
" But some people lost out terribly and were damaged .
I do feel nostalgia but that is different from saying that this is now how I want it to be . "
Cessna C182 and C172 cockpit for Flight Simulator or Prepar3D Based on WidevieW on multiple computers and a real instrument panel sold by Simkits HOME | BACK
CURRENT CESSNA C-182 FLIGHT SIMULATOR COCKPIT
This is the latest version of my personal Cessna C182 - RG Flight Simulator cockpit .
It has been assembled in 2016 and it is still in operation .
It has a total field of view ( FOV ) of 225 degrees , obtained with 3 TVs placed at 90° from each other .
The main advantages of this kind of simulator cockpit configuration , are :
Very little space required .
The full cockpit simulator can be installed in a small corner of your living room , as it needs only a space of 5 feet by 5 feet .
It is actually a small cube .
Due to the very narrow angles between the monitors ( just 90 degrees ) , you may use a scenery zoom factor as low as 0.7 , which reduces scenery blur a lot and improves the performance , since it will not be necessary to use very high scenery level of detail radius .
This Cessna Flight Simulator cockpit works with 4 computers of average power ( since the total workload is distributed over multiple computers , low - end hardware is still enough ) linked togther by WidevieW and Widetraffic .
If still uses FSX , but may work also with Prepar3D via WidevieW 64 .
The instrument panel is still a regular one from Simkits , slightly customized to better match a C - 182 .
The monitors are regular 50 " Full - HD TVs .
The main drawback of this setup , is that the pilot will have the left monitor much closer to the right monitor , but once you get used to this , it will be perfectly fine , considering the pros and the low cost .
OLDER CESSNA C-182 FLIGHT SIMULATOR COCKPIT
This Cessna cockpit project has been started on August 2008 .
First stage completed in October 2008 with the cockpit fully operative .
Second stage completed on April 2009 with the addition of a complete enclosure .
This simulator cockpit has been dismantled in 2016 because the space required was excessive .
It was converted to the more compact version just discussed above .
But now let 's see all the upgrades done year by year .
Added an MPID to facilitate ATC communications , perform check - list and consult maps .
With the purpose of getting a closed , surrounding cockpit , without keyboard and mouse , I 've added an MPID ( Multi Purpose Integrated Display ) fixing it to the control yoke , and a Tablet PC for easy chart browsing .
Thanks to these two simple devices , the monitor connected to server ( main PC ) is used exclusively to run Flight Simulator , then I can switch it OFF and concentrate on flying , without using keyboard and mouse anymore throughout the flight !
The MPID , or Multi Purpose Integrated Display is an unit buit my myself and patent pending .
Please contact me if you need further information on this item .
The unit has an high quality LCD monitor , letting to read comfortably even the smallest text and , in the above picture , it 's used as an interface with the ATC : all the ATC messages are displayed on the monitor and the buttons can used to issue ATC commands .
Of course , I use a secondary audio card in the computer , to re-direct spoken messages into an headset , keeping them separated from engine sound , and giving the ultimate surrounding experience .
Now , to fully interact with the ATC , I no longer need a big monitor , no keyboard , no mouse , as I can operate it efficently from the MPID , while I 'm still totally concentrated on the instrument panel and on flying !
Possible alternative uses for the MPID are to display a moving map , a weather radar , a TCAS , a Google Earth satellite picture , weather information , the use is limited only by own fantasy .
ADDED A FULL COCKPIT ENCLOSURE , ENSURING AN IMMERSIVE ENVIRONMENT WITH BODY WRAPPING VIEWS
The Cessna cockpit is now fully enclosed and isolated from the room .
The environment is fully immersive , as there are no visual references beyond the monitors and the instrument panel .
The computers and the cables are now well hidden by wooden and plastic plates .
The wrapping panoramic view made with 5 TVs 37 " each is really impressive .
The hot air is pulled out by three powerful fans mounted on the roof , while colder air conditioned air penetrates the cockpit from small openings .
Part of the panoramic view , obtained by five 37 " LCD connected to five computers and synchronized via WidevieW .
A tablet PC is used to show landing charts , while an MPID ( Multi Purpose Integrated Display ) is fixed to the control yoke and used to interact with ATC or use the FSX kneeboard without mouse and keyboard .
All the cockpit is indeed mouse - less and keyboard - less , everything is done via real Cessna instrument panel , MPID and touch screen tablet PC .
In the picture above , the Cessna flight simulator cockpit seen from outside .
The cockpit is based on six computers , one used as server to drive the instrument panel ( real gauges , GPS , radio stack , etc ) and five used to drive one TV each , ensuring a stutter free panoramic view , covering 180° around the aircraft .
The computers used as clients for the visuals , are based on the following hardware and software :
Intel DX48BT2 motherboard
Intel E8500 CPU ( Dual Core , 3.16 Ghz not overclocked )
4 GB of DD3 system memory , at 1333 Mhz
n Vidia 8800 GT video card , with 1gig of video memory
Generic SATA2 500GB hard drive
Samsung 37 " LCD full - hd TV running at 1920x1080 ( LE37M86BD )
Windows Vista 64 Home Basic ( really useful to prevent OOM - Out of memory errors on complex photoreal scenery , happening sometimes with FSX )
The computer used as server , has in addition the following hardware :
A secondary nVidia 8800GT ( one video output is used for service monitor , used to make maintenance , run FSX , etc ; another video output is used for the Garmin 500 GPS ; and a third video output is used for the MPID to interact with FSX ATC and Kneeboard .
The fourth video output is still free for future expansions , perhaps for a radar weather )
A secondary audio card , to redirect engine sounds to powerful speakers and ATC communications to an headset
Windows XP
Home Basic ( I 've avoided to use a 64 bit operative system on the server , either because it 's useless when there are no scenery views , and also to prevent incompatibilities with older hardware ) .
The instrument panel is a TRC472 sold by Simkits and assembled by myself .
I have heavily customized it , because it is sold for a C172 , but I 'm simulating a C - 182 .
So , I 've added a fuel / manifold pressure gauge , a CHT indicator , a rudder trip , plus various controls present on the C - 182 and not on the C - 172 .
The tablet PC is a Fujitsu ST5112 and has charts , so I do n't need to use paper in the cockpit .
The small unit fixed on the control yoke , is my home made MPID ( Multi Purpose Integrated Display ) , useful to interact with ATC and to use FSX Kneeboard without keyboard and without mouse .
Again , all the cockpit is strictly based on a NO MOUSE , NO KEYBOARD and NO PAPER policy !!!
The synchronization of the views is done via network by WidevieW and Widetraffic in TCP / IP mode .
Software is Microsoft Flight Simulator X ( FSX ) with SP2 and lot of custom scenery ( in particular , I have satellite scenery covering entire Italy , made by Flight Simulator Center ) .
FIRST TEST FLIGHTS !
Everything is up and running as expected now , with WidevieW synchronizing all the displays .
Future improvements will perhaps include an external structure to hide the monitor 's holders , the computers and to give a general better aspect .
But now its the time to put away hammers , screwdrivers and drill , and just enjoy beautiful flights .
COCKPIT BUILDING IN PROGRESS
The flight deck has received all the instruments , radio stack , GPS unit and is by 95 % completed .
I still have to add the control yoke , rudder trim wheel , cowl flaps and parking brake switch .
Everything is handled through TRC Simkits input and output boards .
At the same time , I 'm working on the basement and holders for TVs .
Everything in home - made , using wood , as it is easier to work .
The simulator takes a lot of space , see the drawing below .
THE SIMULATOR COCKPIT PROJECT
I am now working also on the basement and holders for monitors , chair , flight deck .
etc .
The final assembly will be huge , about 2.6 x 1.8 meters wide and 1.2 meters high .
In order to get the exact sizes and to not make mistakes with holders and basement 's shapes , I 've used PC boxes and other equipment to put the flight deck , chair and front monitor in correct place .
ASSEMBLING THE CESSNA INSTRUMENT PANEL
Just before assembling the altimeter .
It is probably the most difficult gauge to build , but paying lot of attention and working carefully , it will definitely work as expected .
The flight deck is receiving more gauges daily .
THE MONITORS ARE READY
Thesting the monitors used for 180 degrees flight simulator view .
They are 5 in total and are all Samsung LCD TV , 37 " diagonal size , 10000: 1 contrast ratio , 1920 * 1080 resolution connected to PC via DVI=> HDMI cable .
They will be placed along a circle , with the complete flight deck in the front .
I 'm still studying how to mount and hold them all together .
UNPACKING THE COMPONENTS OF THE INSTRUMENT PANEL
There are definitely too many boxes in my living room .
This Cessna C-182 RG cockpit will be based on six networked computers , driving five Samsung 37 " HD monitors ( 1920 * 1080 ) for a full 180 degrees view .
The cockpit will feature a realistic aircraft instrument panel , with working hardware instruments and a replica of the Garmin 500 GPS system .
This is a kit purchased from SimKits , a department of TRC Development b.v
The cockpit will work with FS2004 and FSX .
ASSEMBLING THE CESSNA GAUGES
As said before , the instrument panel and case was purchased from TRC Development b.v as " kit " .
This means that you receive about three boxes full of pieces to assemble .
This picture shows the progress building the cockpit case , that has required just one day working alone .
I 'm now going very fast because I cannot wait to have everyting assembled and working ( but I know ... several weeks will be required , including the structure to hold the monitors ) .
I have tried to assemble my first gauge , in this case the vertical speed indicator , which is probably one of the simplest .
Assembling the gauges was n't too difficult and is very enjoyable if you like to build things by yourself .
A very detailed documentation for each gauge is available on Simkits website , for best results you must follow such documentation strictly as indicated ( you know ... once you make an hole or glue something , you cannot use " Edit => Undo " or reset the flight !!! ) .
In case you prefer to receive everything assembled in factory , built and tested gauges , as well as the entire cockpit , are available at an additional cost .
The boxes of the wonders .
They contain all the gauges to assemble , the radios ( ready for use ) and a replica of Garmin 500 GPS ( ready for use as well ) .
I have received all the items just a few days after the order , everything was ready for immediate delivery .
I have really appreciated a so prompt delivery time , because in the world of flight simulation it is not uncommon to have to wait for weeks ( or months ) when you order special devices .
VINTAGE MD -80 FLIGHT SIMULATOR COCKPIT
My MD - 80 cockpit built from 1998 to 2002 .
February 2002 - I 'm working and improving my cockpit each day .
My final goal is to reproduce a MD - 80 EFIS / FMC as best as possible .
My current setup includes nine monitors , two for the main panel , one for the overhead panel , one for the FMC , and five for 180° full - screen outside view .
The server has an EPIC card inside , several commands are still given clicking with the mouse on the screens , but the flight guidance , the FMC and the TRC are hardware made and they resemble the real aircraft very closely .
As input peripherals , I 'm using high quality controls ( hydraulic Rudder Pedals by Flight Link , full - size Jetliner Yoke by Precision Flight Controls and professional throttle Ministudio Jet Console by SafeLine
Future upgrades include an hardware overhead panel and radio stack .
Furthermore , I would like to totally eliminate both the keyboard and the mouse , using only actual switches and buttons .
For the software , I 'm still using the excellent Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 on the server , Mad Dog by Rodolfo Arata .
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 is used on the clients only , for scenery display .
I 've created a special version of WidevieW and designed compatible scenery on the 98's side in order to make the simulators compatible between them .
Hardware components are complex .
The server is an AMD Athlon at 1000 mhz with 256mb of SDRAM and three video boards : Matrox G450 Dual Head AGP and PCI capable of running a total of 6 monitors .
Two 17 " NEC FE700 monitors ( on the bottom of the picture ) at 1280x1024 are used for the primary instruments , while a 15 " LCD monitor by Likom ( 1024x768 ) is used for the overhead panel ( I 've had to use a LCD to save space and weight , as it is positioned over my head ) .
The FMC has a SVGA 5 inches green - phosphor monitor , like in the real thing .
The sound board is a Creative Sound Blaster LIVE with Four Point Surround .

Developing Firefox Extensions with GNU / Linux
In '89 , an ancient Sumerian deity named Zuul razed downtown New York with her avatar , a flaming , Stay - puft Mallowzilla .
In related news , the aptly named " Mozilla Foundation " has released Firefox 1.5 Beta , a web browser built on an easily extended , cross- platform application framework called XUL ( pronounced " Zuul " ) .
In this article , I will provide insight into how to professionally develop a Firefox Extension with GNU / Linux .
For demonstration , I 'll develop an application called Stantz .
This article is directed to anybody who wants to extend Firefox .
Experience writing HTML , Javascript , and CSS should be all you need to understand XUL .
Some knowledge about the Linux command line and the Python programming language are desirable , but not necessary .
You may want to play with an Apache web server 's configuration , and experience handling a neutron accelerator pack would certainly help .
Thankfully , you wo n't need to build Mozilla and you wo n't have to compile any C or C ++.
What can you do with a Firefox Extension ?
Firefox extensions can modify the Firefox user interface .
This includes adding buttons to tool bars and menus ; changing fonts , colors , and icons ; capturing events in the client interface like page loads and clicks ; and modifying web pages after the browser loads them and before the user sees them .
All of this functionality comes with the aspect - oriented facility of overlays .
Extensions also have as much access to the file system as the user running Firefox .
Extensions can add protocol handlers , hooking actions to URLs like icq :// , aim :// , or stantz :// .
Extensions have UniversalXPConnect privileges , allowing them to harness any XPCOM component .
Firefox comes with a rich library of XPCOM components that permit your extension to drive very low - level functionality like sockets from Javascript .
You can also augment the XPCOM library with Firefox extensions by adding Javascript , linkable libraries , or XPIDL .
What can you do without a Firefox Extension ?
Any web page can be a rich application by using Ajax and even XUL .
Just as DHTML is the hip word for creatively applying HTML , Javascript , DOM , and CSS , Ajax is the hip word for what you could always do with DHTML , plus XMLHttpRequest .
Using XMLHttpRequest s , any web page can query a dynamically created web page and replace all or any part of a web page , for example , populating a selection box or updating a stock quote ticker .
Normal Javascript can dispatch XMLHttpRequest s. Also , XUL does not require any special privileges to render in Firefox .
Web pages can ask permission for UniversalXPConnect privileges and use any XPCOM components they like , but this permission only affects the function and thread that asks , rendering the exercise impractical .
When should you use a Firefox Extension ?
Only when you must .
Installation of a Firefox extension has a substantial " barrier of entry " since extensions require draconian permission from the user to deter the web 's criminal element from using them as a virus delivery platform .
Here follows stantz.xpi
Starting from the top , the vibrant denizens of the web will install Stantz by clicking on a link to stantz.xpi , a cross platform installer , pronounced " zippy . "
XPI files are no more complicated than a way to organize a common zip archive .
Broadly , stantz.xpi has the following structure :
stantz.xpi
install.rdf is an XML file that contains information about the Stantz application .
chrome .
manifest is a flat text file that directs Firefox to use the overlays , stylesheets and locales Stantz provides , as applicable .
chrome / stantz .jar contains all of the files that will appear on the chrome :// URL .
components / contains any XPCOM components that Stantz provides .
defaults / contains a default preferences file .
Creating extensions for growing applications , of course , requires some scaffolding to support agéd versions .
The new , 1.5 release of Firefox , code named Deer Park , supports the plain text chrome .
manifest format for declaring where your extension 's overlays , locales , and skins are .
Firefox 1.0 requires bulky contents.rdf files in content / , locale / , and skin/ , as applicable .
Very early releases of Firefox and the Mozilla Suite require an install.js script instead of an install.rdf , but that is beyond the scope of this article .
Stantz will support all browsers that use install.rdf and chrome .
manifest or **/contents.rdf .
Anybody can publish their Firefox extension at https://addons.mozilla.org/.
This avoids quite a bit of hassle on your part and your users ' .
However , I intend to publish Stantz on my own web server .
If you plan to do the same , you will need to add a MIME type to your apache configuration .
While this may be possible with a .htaccess file , it is this developer 's experience that this does not work , so you will need root access on your distribution server .
My server 's configuration allows me to add mini configuration files in /etc / apache2 / conf.d , so I 've added xpi.conf to enable XPI .
Without this line , the client browsers will not recognize the file as an installer .
/etc/apache2/conf.d/xpi.conf
AddType application / x- xpinstall .xpi
Here Follows chrome/stantz.jar
chrome / stantz .jar is a zip archive , as well .
Per the instructions in chrome .
manifest and contents.rdf files , Firefox will map directories in chrome / stantz .jar to chrome :// URL's .
The chrome :// protocol provides access to all of Firefox 's internal user interface and that of all installed extensions .
For example the XUL file , chrome:// browser / content/browser.xul , defines Firefox 's main interface window .
You can unpack this file from your Firefox installation directory ( perhaps / usr / lib / mozilla - firefox ) .
The archive , chrome / browser .jar , contains the browser interface file , content / browser / browser.xul .
chrome/ stantz.jar
content / will contain your XUL and Javascript .
It may also contain any other " content " your extension will need .
Agile developers , hackers , and academics who have lost their grant money and have a penchant for entrepreneurship will be inclined to , at least at first , write all of the user - readable text in their native language and put all of their images and style sheets in the content section as well .
However , Firefox is a pro-social platform and provides easy means for locales and skins .
The skin / directory will contain images and style sheets that define the appearance of your user interface .
locale / will contain a directory for each language and locale your extension supports .
Supporting these facilities makes it easy for you , or other extension developers , to tailor your extension 's functionality to their favorite language and appearance using overlays .
The project directory , stantz /
Your project should be laid out with all of the directories that will appear in the chrome jar and the installer xpi .
If you are publishing this project on your own , you should also have a www / directory .
stantz /
For this project , I used a Subversion repository .
You can use svn if you choose , or you could go with the very capable Concurrent Version System , CVS .
My own preference is for Subversion , so the tutorial is Subversion - centric ; as always , your mileage may vary .
While managing a Subversion repository is beyond the scope of this article , Stantz 's publish script makes use of svn commands to version stantz.xpi and update.rdf .
Even if you work alone , a version management system provides a very big " Undo " button for your entire project that will remember how your project looked every time you committed changes .
To get you started , here are some Subversion commands you will need .
svnadmin create / svn / stantz # done once to create the repository svn co file :// svn/stantz # done once to obtain a " working copy " cd stantz # a typical session svn up # done before you start working to acquire the most recent changes svn stat # see what files have changed since you last updated svn ci -m " Fixed bug 0 " # to " check in " or commit changes # when you 're done and everything works
Here 's the entire layout for Stantz .
stantz /
Build scripts generate the files denoted in bold .
You should not add these files to your version management system .

Sortez - vous la tête des grilles
Par Molly E. Holzschlag
« Aerials , in the sky , when you lose small mind you free your life »
- System of a Down
Survolant ma ville de résidence Tucson dans l'Arizona un soir de novembre , je fus étonnée de voir à quel point la structure de la ville épousait les formes d'une grille .
Tucson est une de ces villes américaines très planifiées , et vu du ciel , il est très facile de voir que les designers de Tucson ont réussi à créer une ville dans laquelle tout est structuré par rapport à un plan précis ( figure 1 ) .
Je revenais à la maison de Londres , qui est en revanche bien loin d'être structurée en grille .
Londres est faite de spirales , de cercles , de tangeantes , et semble bien souvent avoir été créée de façon spontanée ( figure 2 ) .
Comme je réfléchissais à cet article depuis quelque temps déjà , les vues aériennes de ces villes m'ont semblé être une bonne métaphore pour le design en grille sur le Web .
Avec les technologies et les techniques actuelles , nous sommes libres de créer des designs en grille — ou bien nous pouvons décider de casser complètement cette trame .
Le fait qu'un tel choix puisse donner un plus grand pouvoir au web designer est incontestable : le véritable défi repose sur la façon que nous avons de « nous débarrasser de notre esprit étriqué » et de penser en sortant du rang .
L'empire des sens
Si nous étendons la métaphore urbaine au web design , nous pouvons voir d'intéressants parallèles .
Les designs basés sur des grilles peuvent être extraordinairement utiles pour créer des sites qui sont prévisibles , dans lesquels il est facile de naviguer , et visuellement accrocheurs .
Les grilles sont très utiles pour aider les designers à mettre en place les éléments , rendant le site simple à utiliser par les visiteurs ( figure 3 ) .
Parmi les avantages d'une telle architecture , on peut dire qu'il est facile de se repérer à Tucson ; un sens basique de l'orientation ou un plan sont suffisants .
Les habitants vous donnent le chemin de leur maison en se basant sur la grille : « J'habite au sud-ouest du croisement de la Campbell Avenue et de Prince Road » .
Les routes et les transports publics vont typiquement du nord au sud et de l'est à l'ouest , ce qui rend les déplacements en ville faciles .
D'un autre côté , les architectes de Tucson avaient pensé à ces plans dans une certaine limite de croissance , et cela a causé d'innombrables problèmes pour maintenir la facilité à se déplacer au fur et à mesure que la ville grandissait en dehors des limites initialement définies .
De plus , les contraintes posées par l'architecture en trame de Tucson n'encourage pas l'émergence de nouveaux voisinages et de nouvelles communautés .
De nombreux résidents de Tucson seront d'accord pour dire qu'il manque à la ville un cœur actif — ou plein de petites communautés uniques — et de ce fait , même si ces endroits existent , et même s'ils sont faciles d'accès , les gens ne sont pas suffisamment motivés pour sortir et les trouver .
Londres , au contraire de Tucson , est un vrai labyrinthe .
Je connais des Londoniens qui ont toujours sur eux un guide de poche de Londres pour les aider à se repérer !
Les voies de transport dans la ville sont telles que les futurs taxis doivent réussir un test prouvant qu'ils possèdent « La Connaissance » pour conduire les traditionnels taxis noirs .
La croissance quasi - organique de cette ville en a fait un endroit où il n'est pas facile de se déplacer .
Mais à Londres , d'intéressants et merveilleux endroits ont émergé , et les voisinages aux saveurs très distinctes sont présents partout — il n'existe pas seulement un ou plusieurs pôles d'intérêt culturel publics , mais une multitude .
Le cheminement est peut - être plus délicat , mais il y a plus d'alternatives , et la plupart des gens sont alors plus motivés pour participer aux diverses possibilités offertes par la ville .
Lorsqu'on examine des designs déstructurés et spontanés , la métaphore persiste .
Comment font les gens pour se déplacer facilement dans des ruelles sinueuses et alambiquées ?
D'un autre côté , le travail visuel peut résulter d'une destruction du système rigide qui est devenu , avec l'âge , courant dans le développement et le web design .
Dans la figure 4 , vous pouvez facilement constater à quel point le fait de casser la mise en page structurée en grille met au défi les designers de conserver la facilité d'utilisation , tout en créant des designs qui sont différents de ce que nous avons l'habitude de voir .
Sous les grilles , la plage
Il est fascinant pour moi , qui suis une maniaque du code plus que du design , de voir à quel point nos designs collent au code .
Je suis certaine que cela est dû aux contraintes des mises en pages en tableaux qui nous ont trop longtemps emprisonnés dans une grille visuelle ( figure 5 ) .
Ajoutez à cela une compréhension de la mise en page par CSS toute récente , et il est alors facile de comprendre les raisons ayant entraîné un tel amalgame .
Les mises en pages en tableaux sont excellentes pour les designs en grille .
Le squelette lui-même reproduit une trame sécifique , et nous avons tendance à nous contenter de remplir les trous avec des images et des éléments qui constituent notre design ( figure 6 ) .
Si nous avons le malheur de créer un design déstructuré possédant une quelconque complexité , nous devons utiliser de nombreuses images dans le document pour parvenir au résultat , rendant alors les documents lourds et compliquant le squelette de base .
Les grilles basées sur les tableaux présentent certains avantages , mais , tout comme avec la métaphore urbaine , une force peut aussi devenir une faiblesse .
Les grilles utilisant des tableaux nous permettent de s'assurer que toutes les cases fonctionnent en tandem .
Vous voulez que toutes les colonnes s'adaptent à la même taille ?
On ne se soucie même pas de savoir comment — c'est le comportement naturel des tableaux .
Vous voulez appliquer un espacement entre les cellules ?
Là encore , pas de soucis .
Mais que se passe - t - il si vous ne voulez pas de cette adaptation automatique ?
La réponse est douloureuse : vous n'avez pas le choix .
Les CSS changent complètement la donne , et c'est pourquoi je pense , comme beaucoup d'autres , que nous n'avons pas encore appris à faire des designs spécifiques au Web .
Ce que nous commençons tout juste à comprendre — en particulier pour ceux d'entre nous qui arrivons aux mises en pages basées sur les CSS après des années d'utilisation des tableaux — c'est que le modèle visuel des CSS permet beaucoup plus facilement de casser les trames et de faire des designs pour des éléments discrets et sémantiques .
Parfait ?
non , car malgré tous les gains rendus possibles par les CSS , nous perdons certaines choses .
L'adaptation des colonnes est un problème récurrent en CSS , tout comme l'espacement des cases .
Le modèle visuel des CSS n'est fait que de lignes et de boîtes .
C'est pareil pour les grilles , n'est - ce pas ?
Bien sûr , si nous le décidons ainsi .
C'est là qu'intervient la principale différence .
Les CSS nous permettent de prendre une boîte — n'importe quelle boîte — et d'en faire ce que nous voulons , indépendamment des boîtes qui l'entourent ( figure 7 ) .
Nous pouvons utiliser la propriété position d'une boîte flottante , et nous pouvons ajouter des images de fond aux éléments .
Du coup , bien que nous travaillons toujours avec des boîtes , nous pouvons les présenter dans de nombreuses déclinaisons visuellement plus intéressantes et techniquement plus efficaces .
Cela permet les designs en grilles , mais également une mise en place bien plus aisée des designs déstructurés , comme vous pouvez le voir sur un des designs que Dave Shea a créé pour CSS Zen Garden , Blood Lust ( figure 8 ) .
La figure 9 montre les différentes boîtes créées par le design en grille déstructuré de Blood Lust , démontrant encore une fois la façon avec laquelle les CSS nous permettent de créer des trames déstructurées en utilisant des boîtes qui sont en relation avec d'autres tout en restant indépendantes de ces dernières .
Au fur et à mesure que nous comprenons ce que nous pouvons faire à l'aide de boîtes , notre capacité à casser cette grille qui nous a retenus captifs pendant si longtemps devient beaucoup plus claire .
Observons ce design ( figure 10 ) , qui peut être considéré comme très déstructuré , voire carrément spontané :
Et regardons aussi les boîtes sous - jacentes positionnées en utilisant les CSS :
Non seulement le balisage devient plus aéré , mais les CSS sont très simples à comprendre pour n'importe quel designer familier avec la mise en page en CSS .
Pourtant , la présentation à l'écran est riche et singulière , et montre qu'un design qui n'est pas basé sur des grilles peut être respectueux et tout à fait utilisable .
Vers l'infini et au - delà !
Toute la beauté et le challenge de travailler avec des mises en pages modernes résident dans les options qui s'offrent à nous .
Grâce aux CSS , nous avons des outils permettant la réalisation de designs faciles à gérer , légers et visuellement riches qui peuvent se baser sur une trame si nous le souhaitons .
Mais nous pouvons aussi déstructurer la trame au besoin , voire s'en débarrasser complètement .
Cela ouvre une myriade d'opportunités pour le designer Web contemporain .
Mais il reste un défi , celui de penser à utiliser ces options plutôt que de retomber sur des designs en grille juste parce qu'ils sont familiers .
Pour ceux d'entre nous qui sortent d'années de mises en page à base de tableaux , le défi est particulièrement difficile à relever .
Pour de nombreux vétérans du design web , changer la façon que nous avons de présenter le contenu sans utiliser de tableaux signifie une mutation du système sous - jacent que nous utilisons depuis si longtemps .
Pour certains , cela vient naturellement , mais pour la plupart d'entre nous , il est difficile d'effectuer le grand saut .
Une partie de la réponse repose dans notre propre éducation à propos du fonctionnement des CSS et des navigateurs , mais aussi sur notre volonté à abandonner nos conventions .
Il existe une nouvelle génération nommée « Je n'ai jamais fait de design utilisant les tableaux de toute ma carrière » .
Pour elle , nos anciennes techniques semblent très souvent étranges et limitées , et c'est durant cette génération que nous verrons sans doute disparaître de nombreuses conventions qui ont émergées durant la dernière décennie .
La Toile devient mature , nos approches vis -à - vis de cette dernière changent , nos chances d'innovations et de créativité étant plus proches que jamais .
Nous ne sommes plus limités à une ville planifiée ; nous pouvons créer des designs uniques et tout à fait fonctionnels .
En tant que coalition , les vétérans chevronnés et la jeunesse spontanée actuelle nous montrent , comme une provocation , que le web d'aujourd ' hui ne ressemble à rien de ce à quoi il ressemblera demain .
Et dans l'ensemble , je suis certaine que vous serez d'accord pour dire que c'est une excellente nouvelle .

David Reynolds , a contractor by trade , had broken his arm while remodeling a bathroom in 1998 .
Keeping the cast dry proved to be very difficult , and when he tried looking around for a product to help , he was unable to find anything that was both effective and affordable .
That 's when the light bulb went on .
After doing a patent search for such a product and finding nothing , Reynolds , an inventor since childhood , designed a plastic covering with an adjustable fastening mechanism on one end to keep arm and leg casts dry .
He enlisted the help of his longtime friend and fellow contractor , Marty Ceccarelli , to build Mar - Von LLC and the brand .
But even with their innovative product in hand , it was n't easy to get it on store shelves .
" I just started going to the local drugstores , " says Reynolds .
" I had a real hard time .
Most people do n't want to give you the time of day . "
Determined to succeed , Reynolds and Ceccarelli continued to develop the Cast Cover and sales strategies for two years , and eventually landed their product on the shelves of Albertson 's / Osco Drug and 12 local Walgreens stores .
The reaction from consumers spoke volumes - their product was a fast seller .
Today , the pair sells not only Cast Covers , but also the waterproof Shower Sleeve - open on both ends , they are designed for patients with IVs .
Today , the products are sold via wholesalers and distributors and on their Web site .
Reynolds , who expects $ 2 million in annual sales by the end of the year , has this advice for other aspiring entrepreneurs : " I had a vision of inventing something , [ but ] it did n't happen overnight .
Do n't give up , and do n't take no for an answer . "

Abstract
This short paper discusses various aspects of Lisp 's interaction with the outside world , including file systems , error systems , and window systems .
Observations are made about the current state of Common Lisp and its interactions with the " outside . "
Suggestions are made about possible future directions for Lisp evolution .
Introduction
It should be obvious to any student of Common LISP : The Language ( CLtL ) [ Steele 84 ] that Common Lisp is not so much a language as it is a constraint on a language .
The fact that a myriad of technical details are left unspecified means that every actual implementation of present day Common Lisp must have significant implementation - dependent aspects .
This implies that there can be no implementation will run in any other implementation .
Of the many issues left vague by CLtL , some are related to data representation or algorithms , which may need to vary between implementations .
The site - effect behavior of operators like DELETE and REMPROP is not fully specified , for example .
Also , various issues of sharing between structures created by the QUOTE special form and the backquote facility are left up to the implementation .
Although significant , these issues do not preempt the programmer 's ability to use the associated facilities because the parts that are left vague are not necessary to the useful employment of those facilities .
The lack of specification is an important use of information hiding which for the most part adds strength , rather than weakness , to the Common Lisp language .
In contrast , however , some things left vague in CLtL cannot be justified as desirable information hiding .
These are things which programmers frequently do need to know , but which were not possible for the designers of Common Lisp to agree upon prior to the publication of CLtL .
They include interfaces to the file system , where a standard exists but needs repair ; the error system , where a standard is ready to be proposed ; and the window system , where considerable design work remains to be done before a standard can be considered .
Vendors have tried independently to fill the gaps left by CLtL , and many of their solutions have been quite creative .
But rarely have they been compatible with one another .
In the end , developers of portable application programs are always left to answer the same important question :
" Do I settle for the least common denominator for the sake of portability , or do I use the best of what each system provides at the cost of maintaining implementation - dependent code ? "
The File System
A Standard in Need of Repair
Many users are surprised to find how ill defined the CLtL file system interface really is .
This is probably because most implementations make good faith effort to provide a useful interpretation of the fairly vague terminology which the pathname chapter contains .
As such , the programmer often does n't realize how much he is taking for granted until he tries to port his application to another implementation , particularly one provided by a different vendor on a different operating system .
Common Lisp is not entirely to blame here .
It would have been very desirable to say that all file systems have hierarchical directories ; that all filenames have at least 32 characters ; that all filenames have a name , a type , and a version ; or that all file systems use upper ( or lower ) case as canonical in filenames .
But file systems are separate from Lisp in most implementations ; they come with the operating system and they have fixed , unmodifiable constraints that make the specification of a portable standard very complicated .
In order to present the illusion of added structure , Common Lisp could have simulated types or version numbers for file systems which did n't provide them primitively , but in cases where Lisp needed to cooperate with other programs that did not analogous simulation , many problems would probably have arisen .
The Lisp Machine community had dealt successfully with " generic file systems " for years , but only by providing a much larger set of primitives than the Common Lisp designers were willing to accept .
Although the Common Lisp pathname system was based on the Lisp Machines , in fact that it was only a subset proved to be a problem .
Given the degree of variation in file systems , there were really only two ways in which the Common Lisp file system interface could have been done better :
The designers of Common Lisp could have decided that the problem was too complicated for a serious interface to be provided and could have provided a radically simpler interface .
For example , they might have defined that functions like LOAD and OPEN takes only strings and might have asserted that such strings are inherently implementation - dependent and must be dealt with using sharpsign conditionals .
( Present day reality is n't far from this . )
The designers of Common Lisp could have opted to provide primitives and functionally more like what is provided on Lisp Machines .
However , there were many who believed that Common Lisp was already too large ; it is unlikely that any additional complexity could have gotten past the committee .
Many of the problems with the Common Lisp file system interface were not anticipated by the designers .
This is probably because implementors were initially concerned primarily with their own interfaces .
They read the manual and implemented that they believed was a true interpretation of what it said .
Only when users began to port programs from implementation to implementation did the degree of divergence become apparent .
The Condition System
Ready for Standardization
Traditionally , Lisp and most other languages have treated program errors as things which should simply never happen .
If you got an error , your program halted ; there was nothing more to be done .
It is this hard - line of errors which is to a large extent responsible for the dim view that the public has traditionally taken towards computers .
The traditional stereotype of a computer which , given a large problem that contains only a minor detail in error , simply says , " It does not compute ! " ( rather than being more fault tolerant ) is not far from the truth .
About all that CLtL says about errors is that they are " handled in an implementation - dependent way . "
It suggests that each implementation have an interactive debugger although it offers no further detail .
It also suggests that implementors provide a means for trapping errors , but again it gives no detailed advice .
This leaves writers of large , portable programs in a quandary because most of the functions in CLtL are willing under some circumstances to signal an error .
In a few cases , there is no defined way to test in advance for those circumstances in order to avoid them .
( Various floating - point arithmetic and file system errors are common examples . )
Fortunately , the state of the art in handling Lisp error conditions has improved dramatically in the past five years , and Common Lisp is now in a position to adopt a condition system which will substantially improve the condition handling capabilities of user programs .
The system being developed [ Pitman 87 ] is a modification of a design originated by Weinreb and others at Symbolics in 1983 .
In this system , an error is signaled when a program wants to admit to the " outside world " that it is struck and does not know how to usefully proceed .
No further computation can occur without external intervention .
Programs may at any time establish restart points to which control may be transferred in the event of trouble .
At the point where an error occurs , there is an effective branch in the road with typically several restart points to which control might be transferred .
Other programs can handle the condition by providing advice about which branch to take .
As soon as a selection is made , the process of handling is complete and the original program continues .
The error condition is represented by a structured object which holds information about the situation .
The signaling protocol is standardized in a way that allows other programs to conveniently receive information about a condition being signaled and the restarts available in that context .
Those programs can then provide advice about how to proceed .
If no program offers advice about how to proceed , handling is attempted interactively using the debugger .
Some important features of this condition system are :
The representation of conditions as objects is standardized .
A hierarchy of condition types is provided .
Simple type discrimination is a common way to decide whether and how to proceed from various errors .
Information about how the condition object is displayed is separated from the structure of the object , so handlers need not parse error message strings .
In some older Lisp dialects , certain kinds of errors could not be signaled unless the signaler was prepared to handle a particular style of restarting .
In this system , the process of signaling and the process of establishing restarts are usefully decoupled .
Using the condition system requires no special understanding of Lisp internals .
The program interface is surprisingly portable .
The system has been generalized to allow the notion of non-error ( non-fatal ) conditions , which do not require user intervention even if unhandled .
Graphics and Windows
Standard Needed , But None is Sight
More and more programmers have at their disposal a bit - mapped screen , a state - of - the - art pointing device , and perhaps even a full window system .
In spite of this , the set of display operations available in Common Lisp is extremely limited .
The only operations defined are those which are fully compatible with a screen printing terminal interface .
The programmer cannot even reliably clear the screen using only Common Lisp primitives , much less read a cursor position , draw a box , or accept mouse input .
There are competing theories about how windows and graphics should be introduced into Common Lisp .
Common Lisp could provide a standard Lisp - level interface to a low level console device control protocol such as X .
This is the approach taken by those involved in the CLX effort .
It would assure a strong base on which to build portable programs which use windows and graphics .
It would also simplify the task of the documentation writer because only a single interface style would generally need to be documented .
There are two main disadvantages to this approach .
The first is that the X protocol is too low level .
Even its strong proponents agree that at least one and perhaps several layers of abstraction need to be built upon it before a level is reached which is practical for day - to- day programming .
The second disadvantage is that it causes an application to have the same look on all systems , rather than allowing its interface to adapt to the interface style of the host system .
This tends to thwart the desire of hardware or operating system vendors to provide a " uniform look " for all products that run in their environment .
Alternatively , Common Lisp could provide a very abstract interface to the window system .
This is the approach taken by ; the CommonWindows effort .
This approach is likely to appeal most to users because it provides the Lisp system with the greatest latitude in producing an interface that is culturally compatible with other programs running on that same machine .
The key disadvantages are that there is less opportunity for the application designer to do any fine tuning of the interface , and that documentation for portable applications may be considerably more complicated since the interface could have a very different " feel " in each environment .
Given the tremendous market pressure to find a solution to the window system problem in the near term , and given the Common Lisp tradition for compromise , it seems likely that the ultimate result will be a hybrid one .
Probably layers such as the following will continue to be added from low level to high level as they can be agreed upon :
Low Level Device Control Protocol
Interactive Stream Protocol
Output Graphics Protocol
Window System or User Interface Management System
At the same time , certain high level interfaces will probably be provided directly .
For example , one could easily imagine the Common Lisp designers moving to adopt facilities for high - level interfaces to common idiomatic tasks , such as simple menus , multiple - choice menus , box drawing , and table formatting .
Those who could not make do with these high level interfaces would presumably fall back on whatever layer of the emerging layered display protocol had been standardized upon the time the standard went to press , or sacrifice compatibility with the portable standard by suing a proprietary or " de facto " standard .
Even once the display protocols are worked out , there is a long list of other issues related to windows which have been swept under the rug by the current Common Lisp design but which show up often enough in everyday programming to deserve explicit treatment in some future standard .
Among these are the question of newline confirmation of input , the echoing behavior of interactive READ - CHAR , input editing , character sets , fonts , multi-processing ( including issues of memory sharing ) , locks , and asynchronous interrupts .
Conclusion
Common Lisp has traditionally attempted to stay out of the business of specifying " programming environments . "
Yet the constant pressure from users to provide an environment in which complex applications can be delivered portably is somewhat in conflict with this desire .
The new Common Lisp condition system leaves many decisions still open to the implementation , but moves a step closer to changing Common Lisp from a programming language to a complete programming environment .
The various window systems proposals which are being considered still continue this trend .
Those who think Common Lisp is already too big should brace themselves for things yet to come .

A record label uses DRM to sort of keep its customers from copying the music .
It turns out that the software poses a threat to the user 's PC .
So the label issues a patch ... which opens up another security hole .
If you guessed that the label in question is Sony , you 'd be correct .
If you guessed that I 'm recapping last month 's rootkit debacle , you 'd be wrong .
It 's déjà vu all over again , as Yogi Berra once said .
On Tuesday , Sony informed the world that its other DRM software contained a security vulnerability as well .
SunnComm's Media Max version 5 is the culprit , with its installation of a directory that could provide a means by which malware writers could hijack a PCs running Windows .
The problem was discovered in late November by Information Security Partners , which shared it with the EFF and Sony .
Common sense would tell most people that if your DRM software a ) is a security risk for your customers and b ) does n't really do anything to solve the problem you think you have , then your best course of action is to drop the whole subject .
Unfortunately , common sense and Sony are only passing acquaintances .
Sony and SunnComm released a patch to fix the vulnerability .
If by " fix , " Sony and SunnComm meant " make the problem worse , " then their solution is a rousing success .
According to Princeton computer science professor Ed Felton , the patch is insecure .
It turns out that there is a way an adversary can booby - trap the MediaMax files so that hostile software is run automatically when you install and run the MediaMax patch .
The previously released MediaMax uninstaller is also insecure in the same way , allowing an adversary to booby - trap files so that hostile software is run automatically when you try to use the uninstaller .
This time , Sony turned to security professionals for help and was able to release an updated patch earlier today that supposedly fixes the problems with the previous version .
If you own one of the 27 CDs that came with MediaMax 5.0 and want to get rid of the software all together , SunnComm offers a web - based uninstall tool .
At this point , I do n't know what I can say about the whole sorry mess that has n't already been said , so I 'll close with this : if Sony is trying to alienate its customers , expose itself to massive legal liability , and get the general public up in arms over DRM , it 's doing a fine job .
If the music label has some other goal in mind , it needs to change its tactics quickly .
Near one edge of Mars ' northern polar cap stands Udzha .
Named for a town in Siberia , Udzha , which is 45 km ( 28 mi ) across , is classified as a crater .
Yet it 's almost hidden from view as its sharp - edged , rocky rim peeks from under the polar cap 's layers .
Editor 's Note :
This article was originally presented by the Mars Odyssey 's Thermal Emission Imaging System ( THEMIS ) team at Arizona State University .
It is reproduced here with permission .
At the THEMIS site , you can zoom in on this new image .
The northern polar cap of Mars sprawls across the top of the Red Planet for roughly 1,000 kilometers ( 620 miles ) .
At thickest , the cap piles up about 2.7 km ( 9,000 feet ) high , but becomes thinner toward its serrated edges , where deep canyons and smaller troughs carve a spiraling pattern into the cap .
Near one edge of the northern polar cap stands a curious feature named Udzha .
Named for a town in Siberia , Udzha , which is 45 km ( 28 mi ) across , is classified as a crater .
Yet it 's almost hidden from view as its sharp - edged , rocky rim peeks from under the polar cap 's layers .
A newly released image of Udzha was taken at visible wavelengths during local summer .
It comes from THEMIS , the Thermal Emission Imaging System , a multi- wavelength camera on NASA 's Mars Odyssey orbiter .
We see Udzha surrounded by dark , stratified layers mostly covered with bright deposits of water ice .
The polar caps of Mars , which are large enough to be glimpsed even in backyard telescopes from Earth , form an archive of the planet 's recent climate history .
The record is written in layer after layer of dust and ice .
Each polar winter sees an accumulation of carbon - dioxide frost , which falls as light snow , condensing directly from the atmosphere as temperatures plunge to minus 130 degrees Celsius ( minus 202 Fahrenheit ) .
This produces a thin " polar cap " that reaches down to about latitude 60 degrees north .
This layer resembles the layer of snow cover that collects in Earth 's northern hemisphere every winter .
On Mars , the frost condenses around dust particles brought by the winds from all over the planet .
When the frost disappears the following summer , it leaves the dust behind , along with the residual polar cap , which is made of water ice .
As years pass , the dusty layers slowly accumulate , while major climatic events interrupt the sequence from time to time .
These events - still poorly understood by scientists - prevent the layered deposits from displaying a monotonous regularity .
Polar Pancakes
Besides its annual cycle of frost deposition , the Martian polar caps undergo cycles on longer time scales .
The planet 's spin axis changes its tilt relative its orbit over periods of a few million years .
On scales of 100,000 years or so , the axis experiences lesser tilts .
Finally , the planet 's orbit itself undergoes changes on similar time scales that alter the severity of the seasons .
Each of these longer - than - annual cycles imparts a signature on the polar materials .
It 's as if a stack of buckwheat pancakes has a few buttermilk ones inserted here and there .
In the dark troughs that flank Udzha lies a complex history of the Martian climate - if only scientists could read it clearly !
Recent work has focused on mathematical analysis of the patterns found in the exposed layers .
The goal , only partly accomplished , is to identify the broad patterns of change and match them to the calculated changes in Mars ' orbit and spin axis .
If Udzha is a rocky bowl brimful with deposits of ice and dust , its southern flank appears startlingly smooth and featureless .
This material reaches from the rim down to a broad trough at the slope 's foot , about 600 meters ( 2,000 feet ) below the rim in elevation .
What 's covering the slope ?
Where did its layers go ?
THEMIS images taken late at night show the slope is warmer than the rest of Udzha and the dark layers , with the rocky rim being warmest of all .
This is reasonable , given that the slope faces south and southwest - toward the Sun , in other words .
As the scenic vista shows , most of the landscape is extremely flat - and much of it is highly reflecting white ice .
So wherever local slopes tip to face the Sun more squarely , they grow warmer .
It 's possible the slope lacks the layering seen everywhere because it is made of debris that worked free of the layered sediments and was blown by the wind .
The slope might also include rocky material that weathered out of the rim-rock and trickled down .
Reduced to countless individual pieces , the material has slid , mingled , merged , and collapsed into a relatively homogenous mass .
It might even be dry and loose .
But a more likely bet says it 's relatively firm , held fast by water that has worked its way into the material and froze .
Manipulating the iTunes property list file in Scheme
Jim Ursetto
Ursetto Consulting , Inc .
Introduction Recently , I noticed that iTunes had lost track of some of my music files .
I keep nearly all my music on an NFS server , visible to both iTunes and a SLiMP3 device .
At some point , I had reorganized the music directories a bit without considering that the pathnames in iTunes ' database would be invalidated .
The simplest way to reconnect lost files is to reimport them .
Unfortunately , when doing so you lose your hard - won statistics , such as Play Count and Last Played .
I figured I might retain these statistics by locating the new files and then updating iTunes Music Library.xml with the new pathnames .
And if I could automate the process , I 'd be able to quickly fix this problem in the future whether it occurred deliberately or otherwise .
This article documents my attempt to do just that by building an application in Chicken Scheme , using the bindings to Objective C and Cocoa provided by the objc egg .
It 's targeted at the intermediate Scheme programmer , who may have some experience with Cocoa .
It may also be useful to a beginner looking for examples of an interactive development process , and to a non-Scheme user for the same reason .
In this article , I present code as I write it and design decisions as I make them ; and I offer a lot of commentary .
I 've tried to document the coding process from start to finish , including the false starts , because it is my opinion that the reader can benefit from an author 's mistakes as well as his successes .
Are you ready ?
Then let 's begin .
Beginnings
Here 's our initial strategy .
We 'll look up every track in the database and where it should reside on disk .
If the file does n't actually exist , we flag it as bad , and use some heuristic to determine where it has moved to .
We 'll update the database with this new location and write it out .
For flexibility , we 'd probably like to grab the bad tracks in one phase , and update the database in a second phase , so that we can examine our proposed changes before committing them .
To begin , we need my objc egg ( download with chicken - setup objc ) and my plist library source code ( placed in the project directory ) .
We 'll type the code below directly into a new file .
I 'm using an interactive development environment — Emacs with Neil van Dyke 's Quack — so I can send my definitions to the running Scheme interpreter as they are entered .
We 'll do quite a bit of testing at the REPL , as you 'll see .
( use objc plist )
The iTunes XML file is a property list or " plist " file , which can be read in using the NSDictionary class method dictionaryWithContentsOfFile : .
We actually use an NSMutableDictionary because we 're going to be updating the dictionary in memory ; using a plain NSDictionary seems to work as well here , but let 's be safe .
( define-objc- classes NSMutableDictionary )
A quick primer : the define - objc - classes form looks up the NSMutableDictionary class in the Objective C runtime , and creates a new variable called NSMutableDictionary which we can use to access the class .
( @ obj keyword1 : arg1 keyword2 : arg2 ) is like the Objective C message expression [ obj keyword1 : arg1 keyword2 : arg2 ] — it sends obj the keyword1 : keyword2 : message with arguments arg1 and arg2 .
Finally , if a hyphen occurs in a method name , we remove it and uppercase the next letter ; this allows us to type dictionary - with - contents - of - file : instead of dictionaryWithContentsOfFile : . itunes : open-library opens the music library file name and returns an NSDictionary representing the iTunes library .
( define ( itunes : open - library name ) ( or ( @ NSMutable Dictionary dictionary - with - contents - of - file : ( expand - tilde name ) ) ( error ' itunes : open - library " failed to open library " name ) ) )
You 'll notice the call to expand - tilde .
Cocoa wo n't automatically expand a tilde into a filename , but it 's very likely one will be present in the iTunes library filename .
So we write a little wrapper function around the NSString method stringByExpandingTildeInPath : .
If the argument is a Scheme string , we convert it into an NSString first .
expand - tilde returns an NSString .
( The ns:string ?
and ns : make - string procedures are from the plist library , and will probably be integrated into the objc egg in the future .
) ( define ( expand - tilde name ) ( @ ( if ( ns:string ? name ) name ( ns:make - string name ) ) string - by - expanding - tilde - in - path ) )
We can use the NSDictionary method writeToFile : atomically : to write out the updated iTunes plist as ASCII XML .
I pass #t to atomically : for safety ; this way the plist will be written to a temporary file and moved into place .
( define ( itunes : write - library plist dest - name ) ( @ plist write - to - file : ( expand - tilde dest - name ) atomically : # t ) )
Now we can do a little exploration .
Enter the following definitions : ( define name " ~/Music/iTunes / iTunes Music Library.xml " ) ( define lib ( itunes : open - library name ) )
If we now type " lib " at the REPL , we should theoretically see an ASCII representation of the entire iTunes XML database ( courtesy of lib 's description method ) .
In actuality , Chicken truncates this output to prevent mistakes like , oh , say accidentally dumping 8 megabytes of data into your interpreter session .
If we 'd actually like to see all the output , we should probably write it to a file : #;94 > ( with-output-to- file " /tmp/itunes-ascii.txt " ( lambda ( ) ( display lib ) ) )
This will take a few seconds .
Below , I show a heavily edited version of the output , enough so you can see the structure of the plist .
#; 96 > lib # < objc - instance { " Application Version " = " 6.0.2 " ; " Music Folder " = " file://localhost/Users/jim/Music/iTunes/iTunes%20Music/ " ; Playlists = ( { Name = Library ; " Playlist ID " = 5867 ; " Playlist Items " = ( { " Track ID " = 5353 ; } , ) ; ... } , ... ) ; Tracks = { 100 = { Album = scenemusic ; Artist = radix ; Name = plopalou ; Size = 2946233 ; ... } ; ... } ... }>
We could have simply looked at the XML file itself to see the structure , but this way is more instructive ( and easier to read , to boot ) .
To obtain track data , we look at the " Tracks " key ; its value is a dictionary containing one key and value pair per track .
We can retrieve this value using the NSDictionary method objectForKey : . ( define ( itunes : tracks plist ) ( let ( ( tracks ( @ plist object - for - key : " Tracks " ) ) ) ( unless ( @ tracks is - kind - of - class : NSDictionary ) ( error 'itunes : tracks " tracks key is not a dictionary . " ) ) tracks ) ) ( define tracks ( itunes : tracks lib ) )
We already know what the tracks dictionary looks like from our exploration of the structure of lib , so I wo n't show the output of typing " tracks " at the REPL here .
Instead , let 's take a closer look at the specific track that appeared earlier , track ID 100 . # ; 105 > ( @ tracks object - for - key : " 100 " ) # < objc - instance { Album = scenemusic ; Artist = radix ; " Bit Rate " = 128 ; Comments = " radix@ .... " ; " Date Added " = 2002-11-11 11:33:34 - 0600 ; " Date Modified " = 2005-02-06 13:33:20 - 0600 ; " File Folder Count " = 4 ; Genre = Electronic ; Kind = " MPEG audio file " ; " Library Folder Count " = 1 ; Location = " file://localhost/Users/jim/Music/iTunes/iTunes%20Music/radix/scenemusic/plopalou.mp3 " ;
Name = plopalou ; " Persistent ID " = 993694A5E4D4BA2 F ; " Play Count " = 11 ; " Play Date " = - 1086610989 ; " Play Date UTC " = 2005-08-31 19:05:07 - 0500 ; " Sample Rate " = 44100 ; Size = 2946233 ; " Total Time " = 184111 ; " Track ID " = 100 ; " Track Type " = File ; Year = 2000 ; }>
Examining the track data structure , it appears the Location key will give us the music file 's pathname as a file :// URL . #;109 > ( @ # 105 object - for - key : " Location " ) @ " file://localhost/Users/jim/Music/iTunes/iTunes%20Music/radix/scenemusic/plopalou.mp3 "
The # 105 above refers to interpreter result number 105 — in other words , the result of ( @ tracks object - for - key : " 100 " ) .
# by itself refers to the most recent result .
This is an extremely useful abbreviation when working in the REPL .
The @ " ... " is a shorthand way to describe an NSString .
You can also create NSString s using the @ " ... " syntax ; but you do n't normally need to , since the Objective C bridge changes Scheme strings passed as method arguments into NSString s. plist keys and values plist keys are - always - strings , even when they appear to be integers .
objectForKey : expects an actual Objective C object , and the bridge will throw an error if you pass it a number .
Even converting your key to an NSNumber object does n't work : #;107 > ( @ tracks object - for - key : 100 ) Error : bad argument type - not a structure of the required type : objc:instance #;107 > ( ns:make - number 100 ) # < objc - instance 100 > ; An NSNumber integer object # ;108 > ( @ tracks object - for - key : ( ns:make - number 100 ) ) #f
This restriction is only true for plists , not for NSDictionary types in general , which accept any object as a key .
Although you may - add - a non-string key to a plist structure , writing the plist out to disk later will fail .
plist values are a different matter : they may be instances of NSString , NSNumber , NSDate , NSData , NSArray or NSDictionary .
The plist library provides functions to convert most of these to and from Scheme objects , including the " catch - all " schemify and objcify .
The plist API is n't finalized , so consult the code for the latest .
Here are a couple of examples : #; 117 > ( define bit-rate ( @ # 105 object - for - key : " Bit Rate " ) ) #; 118 > bit-rate # < objc- instance 128 > ; An NSNumber ( integer ) object #; 118 > ( ns:number - value bit-rate ) 128 #;119 > ( schemify bit-rate ) 128 #;120 > ( objcify 128 ) # < objc - instance 128 > ;
An NSNumber object , again plist - path
By the way , the plist library provides a convenience function called plist - path that lets us easily trace a given path through a nested plist structure .
The idea for this came from the article Using Perl to Manage Plist Files , crossed with SXPath .
In our case , we need to iterate over many tracks and we 'll wind up using a different approach .
Nevertheless , here 's a straightforward way to obtain the Location of track ID 100 : #;101 > ( plist - path lib '( Tracks 100 Location ) ) @ " file://localhost/Users/jim/Music/iTunes/iTunes%20Music/radix/scenemusic/plopalou.mp3 " file :// URL parsing
We 've got a file location in the form of a file :// URL , but we need a real filename so we can check if the file exists .
Originally , I wrote the following naive function to strip off the file :// localhost prefix : ( define ( URL -> filename str ) ( let ( ( url- prefix " file://localhost " ) ) ( and ( substring= ? str url - prefix ) ( substring str ( string - length url - prefix ) ) ) ) )
This does n't work , of course , because URLs can contain escaped characters .
But why write a URL parser when Cocoa already has one , in the form of the NSURL class ?
Consulting the documentation , we find the NSURL methods + URL - with - string , - isFileURL , and - path .
Before trying them out , we need to import the NSURL class .
( define-objc- classes NSURL ) #;124 > ( define loc ( @ ( @ tracks object - for - key : " 100 " ) object - for - key : " Location " ) ) ; the file :// URL , an NSString #; 125 > ( @ NSURL URL - with - string : loc ) ; create a new NSURL #< objc- instance file:// localhost / Users/jim/Music/iTunes/iTunes%20Music/radix/scenemusic/plopalou.mp3> #; 126 > ( @ # 125 is - file - URL ) # \x1 ; the objective C bridge true value #; 127 > ( @ # 125 path ) @ " / Users/jim/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/radix/scenemusic/plopalou.mp3 "
For convenience , we define a small wrapper which converts a string to an NSURL .
( define ( ns:string -> URL str ) ( @ NSURL URL - with - string : str ) )
Operating on all tracks
To iterate through the tracks , we will use ns:enumerator - fold , which is defined in the plist library .
Here is the definition : ( define ( ns:enumerator - fold kons knil e ) ( let loop ( ( seed knil ) ) ( let ( ( obj ( objc: send e next - object ) ) ) ( if ( not obj ) seed ( loop ( kons obj seed ) ) ) ) ) )
If you 're not familiar with fold , here 's a little background .
fold is known as the fundamental list iterator .
It starts with a procedure KONS , a " seed " KNIL and a list L .
For each element X of L , fold obtains a new seed by applying KONS to X and the current seed .
For example , if KONS is cons and KNIL is '( ) , fold will return a copy of L , reversed .
With fold and its sister fold - right , you can implement many standard operations on lists , such as for - each , map and filter .
ns:enumerator - fold is similar to fold , but iterates over an Objective C collection ( such as an NSArray or NSDictionary ) using an NSEnumerator .
As we 've seen , plist files such as the iTunes Music Library are nested collections of arrays and dictionaries , so ns:enumerator - fold can be used to operate on entire sections of a plist file — in our case , the list of tracks .
We typically obtain an enumerator via the instance 's objectEnumerator ( for NSArray ) or keyEnumerator ( for NSDictionary ) method .
NSDictionary accepts objectEnumerator messages as well ; this will iterate over its values instead of its keys .
During our exploration of the plist data , we saw that the Tracks key contains a dictionary which maps integer track IDs to track data dictionaries .
We do n't expect to need these track IDs , just the track data .
Therefore , we can use object - enumerator to iterate over the values only .
( define track - enumerator ( @ tracks object - enumerator ) )
The plist library code defines some convenience functions based on ns:enumerator - fold , such as ns : array -> list and alist -> ns: dictionary .
We could , for example , use ( ns:array - > list ( @ tracks all - values ) ) to obtain a Scheme list of all the track data dictionaries , then use regular list operations ( such as fold ) on the list .
However , this list may contain tens of thousands of temporary Scheme objects — one for each track — since each track dictionary is wrapped in a Scheme object .
It 's a lot more efficient to operate on each object as we need it in ns:enumerator - fold ; this way each object is garbage - collected immediately after it has been used .
Here 's some code which leverages what we 've learned so far , to build a data structure containing all the " bad " ( unconnected ) files in the iTunes database .
As described in the section on folding , our lambda is called once for each element ( track ) .
When a good file or a non -file URL ( such as http :// ) is found , it returns the current seed unchanged .
When a bad file is found , we cons the list ( bad - file < name > < location > ) onto the seed and return that .
Creating a plain list , rather than using fancy object or record types , makes it easier to examine and take apart in the REPL .
( define bad - files ( cons ' bad - file - list ( ns:enumerator - fold ( lambda ( x xs ) ( let* ( ( location ( @ x object - for - key : " Location " ) ) ( URL ( ns:string -> URL location ) ) ) ( if URL ( if ( @ URL is - file - URL ) ( let ( ( name ( ns:string - value ( @ URL path ) ) ) ) ( if ( file - exists ?
name ) xs ( cons `( bad - file , name , ( ns:string - value location ) ) xs ) ) ) xs ) ;;
Not a file ; do nothing ( begin ( warning " invalid URL : " location ) xs ) ) ) ) '( ) track - enumerator ) ) )
The structure of bad - files should look like this : ( bad - file - list ( bad - file < name > < URL > ) ( bad - file < name > < URL > ) ...)
The astute reader will notice that fold creates its list in reverse order from the source , but this does n't matter as dictionary values are unordered anyway .
Let 's write the list out so we can examine it in an editor .
Here 's a convenience function ( for use in the REPL ) which pretty - prints a list to a file .
( define ( write - list x file ) ( with - output - to - file file ( lambda ( ) ( pp x ) ) ) ) #; 130 > ( write - list bad - files " /tmp/not-found.scm " )
I used the .scm extension so I get Scheme syntax highlighting when I open the file .
Below we can also see a bit of the resulting output .
( bad - file - list ; contents of file ( bad- file " / mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/ariana/18/Faith No More / Angel Dust /09 Be Aggressive.mp3 " " file://localhost/mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/ariana/18/Faith%20No%20More/Angel%20Dust/09%20Be%20Aggressive.mp3 " ) ( bad - file ... ) ...)
Finding files
We 've successfully built a list of bad files ; now we need to apply the " heuristic " I briefly mentioned in order to guess where each file has moved .
The strategy I 've chosen for this part is pretty simple : find all music files under a destination directory and index them based on the last few components of their pathnames .
We can't generally match the filename alone , since unless your filenames are extraordinarily descriptive , we 're likely to encounter duplicates .
Most people create a directory per artist or album or both , e.g. Artist / Album / Filename.mp3 .
In all probability , files wo n't be moved individually ; instead an artist or album will be moved as a chunk .
This means we can usually make a unique file fingerprint by including a few path components from the end — 3 should be adequate , but we 'll make it configurable .
We 'll move on now to finding all files under a given base directory , keyed by a portion of the pathname .
Chicken provides a nice utility function , find - files , in the posix unit .
Chicken also provides pathname operations , but none suit our purpose of grabbing the last N components of a pathname .
We need to find the N th occurrence from the right of the system directory separator ( / ) in the pathname , and grab everything to the right of it .
To this end , we can repeatedly use SRFI - 13's string - index - right to find the rightmost occurrence of a character , on successively smaller substrings .
( use srfi -13 ) ; ; for string - index - right ; Find index of Nth occurrence of character C in STR , starting from the right .
( define ( string - ind ex - right - n str c n ) ( let ( ( start 0 ) ) ( let loop ( ( end ( string - length str ) ) ( n n ) ) ( if ( zero ? n ) end ( and end ( loop ( string - index - right str c start end ) ( fx - n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ;
Obtain the rightmost N pathname components from PATH .
Returns PATH ; if N is greater than the number of components .
; ( pathname - components - right " /tmp/foo/bar/baz/qux " 2 ) => " / baz/qux " ( define ( pathname - components - right path n ) ( let ( ( index ( string - index - right - n path pathname - directory - separator n ) ) ) ( if index ( substring path index ) path ) ) ) find - music - files will find all files under base - dir , returning a hash table which maps the last sig pathname components of each file to the full filename .
As the second argument of find - files , we pass a regular expression which should match any music filenames in our collection .
( use posix ) ; ; for find - files ( define itunes : music - regexp " .*\. ( [ Mm ] [ Pp ]
3 | [ Aa ] [ Aa ] [ Cc ] ) " ) ; find - files anchors this with ^ and $ ( define ( find - music - files base - dir sig ) ( alist - > hash - table ( map ( lambda ( fn ) ( cons ( pathname - components - right fn sig ) fn ) ) ( find - files base - dir itunes : music - regexp ) ) ) ) ;; using Chicken 's , d option to show contents of the hash table #;135 > , d ( find- music - files " / mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/ariana "
3 ) ...

This implementation looks nice , but harbors a flaw : when a key collision occurs , only the latest value is preserved .
Key collisions are still a possibility , and we'd like to save the duplicate filenames so the user can see what happened .
Therefore , we 'll create the hash table by hand , and store each value as a list ( even single values , for simplicity ) .
Also , some experimentation revealed that find - files recurses into symbolic links to directories , which was resulting in duplicate files .
We can prevent this by using the limit procedure argument , which is called for every directory .
Recursion is done only when this procedure returns true .
( define ( find - music - files base - dir sig ) ( let ( ( table ( make - hash - table string= ? ) ) ) ( for - each ( lambda ( fn ) ( let ( ( short - name ( pathname - components - right fn sig ) ) ) ( hash - table - set ! table short - name ( let ( ( old - key ( hash - table - ref / default table short - name # f ) ) ) ( if old - key ( cons fn old - key ) ; duplicate key ; cons value onto value list ( list fn ) ) ) ) ) ) ; new key , single element value list ( find - files base - dir itunes : music - regexp cons '( ) ( lambda ( fn ) ( not ( symbolic - link ? fn ) ) ) ) ) ; do n't recurse into symlinks table ) )
To test the new code , I created 4 test files and several similar directories in / tmp .
Two files are not distinguishable from the other two when the pathname component value is too low .
#; 137 > , d ( find - music - files " / tmp / mp3 " 3 ) hash - table with 2 elements and comparison procedure < unknown > : " /b/c/1.mp3 " -> ( " /tmp/mp3/a/b/c/1.mp3 "
" /tmp/mp3/z/b/c/1.mp3 " )
" /b/c/2.mp3 " -> ( " /tmp/mp3/a/b/c/2.mp3 "
" /tmp/mp3/z/b/c/2.mp3 " ) #; 138 > , d ( find - music - files " / tmp / mp3 " 4 ) hash - table with 4 elements and comparison procedure < unknown > : " /a/b/c/1.mp3 " -> ( " /tmp/mp3/a/b/c/1.mp3 " )
" /z/b/c/1.mp3 " -> ( " /tmp/mp3/z/b/c/1.mp3 " )
" /a/b/c/2.mp3 " -> ( " /tmp/mp3/a/b/c/2.mp3 " )
" /z/b/c/2.mp3 " -> ( " /tmp/mp3/z/b/c/2.mp3 " )
Correlating bad files with good ones
Now we expand bad - files to look up each bad file in the music table by its key ( using significant - path - components path components ) .
Our lookup function , music - table - ref , will return a string if there is only one file match , a list ( duplicate file1 file 2 ... ) if there are multiple matches , or #f if no matches were found at all .
We always want to start the enumerator from the beginning of the track list , so we 'll do that directly in the fold code rather than manually reevaluating the track - enumerator global variable here .
( define ( music - table - ref table key ) ( let ( ( path ( hash - table - ref / default table key # f ) ) ) ( cond ( ( not ( pair ? path ) ) path ) ( ( null ? ( cdr path ) ) ( car path ) ) ( else ( make - duplicate path ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( make - duplicate filenames ) ( cons ' duplicate path ) ) ( define ( duplicate ? file ) ( and ( pair ? file ) ( eq ? ' duplicate ( car file ) ) ) )
And here 's the new code to grab the bad files along with their " good " counterparts .
This code is almost a straight cut - and - paste , except for the new call to music - table - ref , and a slightly different list structure .
Instead of containing bad - file records , the new result list will contain moved records , each of which contains a source ( a bad - file record ) and a destination ( the output of music - table - ref for that particular file ) .
( define significant - path - components 3 ) ( define music - table ( find- music - files " / mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3 " significant - path - components ) ) ( define bad - files ( cons ' bad - file - list ( ns:enumerator - fold ( lambda ( x xs ) ( let* ( ( location ( @ x object - for - key : " Location " ) ) ( URL ( ns:string -> URL location ) ) ) ( if URL ( if ( @ URL is - file - URL ) ( let ( ( name ( ns:string - value ( @ URL path ) ) ) ) ( if ( file - exists ? name ) xs ( cons `( moved ( bad - file , name , ( ns:string - value location ) ) , ( music - table - ref music - table ( pathname - components - right name significant - path - components ) ) ) xs ) ) ) xs ) ;;
Not a file ; do nothing ( begin ( warning " invalid URL : " location ) xs ) ) ) ) '( ) ( @ tracks object - enumerator ) ) ) )
Our list structure should now look like this : ( bad - file - list ( moved ( bad - file < name > < URL > ) < destination > ) ...)
Running this on my NFS drive / mnt / mp3 / scratch/cd/mp3 yields 352 moved files , of which 0 are duplicates and 21 not found ( completely deleted tracks ) .
Once again , I wrote out the result to a file using ( write - list bad - files " /tmp/moved.scm " ) .
Here is an excerpt : ( bad - file - list ( moved ( bad- file " / mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/ariana/18/Faith No More / Angel Dust /09 Be Aggressive.mp3 " " file://localhost/mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/ariana/18/Faith%20No%20More/Angel%20Dust/09%20Be%20Aggressive.mp3 " )
" / mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/burned/22/Faith No More / Angel Dust /09 Be Aggressive.mp3 " ) ...)
Data structure access
We need to define some accessors and creators for our data structures , rather than just using car and cons .
This will insulate us from future changes to the structure layout ; we need only update the accessor functions .
( define ( bad - file ? x ) ( eq ? ( car x ) ' bad - file ) ) ( define ( bad - file - name x ) ( cadr x ) ) ( define ( bad - file - URL x ) ( caddr x ) ) ; I 'll refer to records tagged with ' moved as " moved - item " records from now on .
( define ( make - moved - item bad - file dest ) ( list ' moved bad - file dest ) ) ( define ( moved- item ? x ) ( eq ? ( car x ) ' moved ) ) ( define ( moved - item - source x ) ( cadr x ) ) ;; will be a bad - file record ( define ( moved - item - destination x ) ( caddr x ) ) ( define ( make - bad - file - list x ) ( cons ' bad - file - list x ) ) ( define ( bad - file - list ? x ) ( eq ? ( car x ) ' bad- file - list ) ) ( define ( bad - file - list - items x ) ( cdr x ) ) ;; list of moved - item records
Now we can , for example , use a filter to return bad files which were also not found in the moved music - table .
( filter ( lambda ( m ) ( not ( moved- item - destination m ) ) ) ( bad - file - list - items bad - files ) )
This is a bit clunky , not to mention the fact that it returns a list of moved - item records .
It should instead return a bad - file - list so that we can filter the results again with the same code .
So we 'll define a filter function that handles unpackaging and repackaging the results .
;
Filter a bad file list and return a second bad file list with the results .
( use srfi - 1 ) ;; filter ( define ( bad - file - list - filter pred x ) ( make - bad - file - list ( filter pred ( bad- file - list - items x ) ) ) ) ;
Add a couple predicates useful for the bad - file - list - filter .
( define ( moved- item - duplicate ? x ) ( duplicate ? ( moved- item - destination x ) ) ) ( define ( moved- item - notfound ? x ) ( not ( moved- item - destination x ) ) ) ( define ( moved- item - unique ? x ) ( string ? ( moved-item- destination x ) ) )
Now it 's much easier to get a list of all the files we failed to find : #;149 > ( bad- file - list - filter moved - item - notfound ? bad - files ) ( bad - file - list ( moved ( bad- file " / mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/burned/Veronica/3/Mase/Harlem
World /13 What You Want.mp3 " " file://localhost/mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/burned/Veronica/3/Mase/Harlem%20World/13%20What%20You%20Want.mp3 " ) # f ) ...)
It turns out that I deleted this album off the disk , but not from iTunes .
If you like , you can now store the bad file list to disk and read it back at any time , showing only duplicates or notfound or unique items .
significant - path - components example
It 's important that we specify the significant - path - components value appropriately .
For example , I 'll use a value of 1 ( filename only ) rerun the query on my library .
At the REPL , we redefine significant - path - components and then resend the definition of bad - files to the interpreter .
Afterward , make sure to reset these to their old values .
#; 150 > ( define significant - path - components 1 ) #; 151 > <... re-evaluate bad - file - list > #; 152 > ( write - list ( bad - file - list - filter moved - item - duplicate ? bad-files ) " /tmp/dups.scm " )
There were 7 total duplicates .
5 were actual duplicate files ; for example , ( moved ( bad- file " / mnt/mp3/ scratch/cd/mp3/ariana/mp3dump1/misc/David Lee Roth - Just A Gigolo.mp3 " " file://localhost/mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/ariana/mp3dump1/misc/David%20Lee%20Roth%20-%20Just%20A%20Gigolo.mp3 " ) ( duplicate " / mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/burned/Veronica/4/miscellany/David Lee Roth - Just A Gigolo.mp3 " " / mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/burned/mp3dump1/misc/David Lee Roth - Just A Gigolo.mp3 " ) ) 2 were valid name collisions — different songs with the same base filename .
( moved ( bad- file " / mnt/mp3/ scratch/cd/mp3/ariana/18/Aretha
Franklin / Amazing Grace ( Disc 2)/05 Wholly Holy.mp3 " " file://localhost/mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/ariana/18/Aretha%20Franklin/Amazing%20
Grace%20( Disc%202)/05%20Wholly%20Holy.mp3 " ) ( duplicate " / mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/burned/22/Aretha
Franklin / Amazing Grace ( Disc 1)/05 Wholly Holy.mp3 " " / mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/burned/22/Aretha
Franklin / Amazing Grace ( Disc 2)/05 Wholly Holy.mp3 " ) )
I became curious to see how many total duplicates there were in the searched directory — above , only duplicates that match bad files are shown .
We can get this data from music - table by looking for table values containing more than one element .
It might pay off to encapsulate this stuff within a function , but we wo n't right now .
#; 153 > ( filter ( lambda ( x ) ( pair ? ( cdr x ) ) ) ( hash - table - values music - table ) )
The length of this list is 23 ( i.e. , 23 duplicates ) .
Interestingly , only 4 are different files with the same filename , even though the filenames contain only the track number and title .
The remaining 19 are real duplicate songs — 16 of which are from the same album !
( It turns out I ripped one of my CDs twice . )
This is clearly useful functionality and should probably be made available to the user in a nicer way .
Fixing bad file locations in the database Now we'd like to make another pass through the iTunes track database , fixing any bad file locations that we can .
For each URL in the database , we need to find the matching moved - item record , if it exists .
This is why we saved the full bad - file location URL in the bad - file record .
For quickest lookup , we 'll create another hash table mapping the bad file URL back to its corresponding moved - item record .
Looking back on it , we could have stored the track ID number in the bad - file record , and used it to index this hash table instead .
The only real drawback is that iTunes can change these IDs , which would invalidate any old bad - file data you had saved .
However , I 'll leave the design as it is .
( define ( make - URL - > moved - item - table bad - file - list ) ( let ( (h ( make - hash - table string= ? ) ) ) ( for - each ( lambda ( m ) ( hash - table - set ! h ( bad - file - URL ( moved - item - source m ) ) m ) ) ( bad - file - list - items bad - file - list ) ) h ) ) ;
This is not very well named .
( define URL-to-moved-item- table ( make-URL->moved - item - table bad-files ) )
Here is an excerpt from the resulting hash table : #; 155 > , d URL - to - moved -item- table " file://localhost/mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/ariana/16/DJ%20Krush/The%20
Message%20at%20the%20Depth/05%20The%20Blackhole.mp3 " -> ( moved ( bad- file " / mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/ariana/16/DJ
Krush / The Message at the Depth /05 The Blackhole.mp3 " " file://localhost/mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/ariana/16/DJ%20Krush/The%20Message%20at%20the%20Depth/05%20The%20Blackhole.mp3 " )
" / mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/burned/4/DJ Krush / The Message at the Depth/05 The Blackhole.mp3 " )
We really need item accessors for the URL table ; I address this issue at the end of the article .
Now we can pass back through the tracklist , updating any bad URLs with our new location .
The location must be a string , not an NSURL .
If you try to write a plist containing an NSURL , it will fail : #; 160 > ( define d ( @ NSMutableDictionary dictionary ) ) #; 161 > ( @ d set - object : ( @ NSURL file - URL - with - path : " / tmp /abc " ) for - key : " Location " ) #< objc- instance { Location = file://localhost/tmp/abc ; }> #; 162 > ( @ d write - to - file : " /tmp/a.plist " atomically : # f ) #f Instead , we need to use - absoluteString to obtain the URL as an NSString .
( define ( path - > URL x ) ( @ ( @ NSURL file - URL - with - path : x ) absolute - string ) )
The code to obtain move - results is , once again , very similar to the code for bad - file - list .
Instead of music - table - ref , we use hash - table - ref to look up the current track 's moved - item record .
As a quick check , we verify the track 's pathname matches that of the looked - up record .
Finally , if the destination is valid — meaning it's a unique file , not a duplicate or not - found file — we update the dictionary using setObject : forKey : .
The move - results list structure looks exactly like the bad - file - list structure , except that only successful moves will be included .
This means that any duplicate and not - found items will be stripped out without ceremony or warning .
That 's fine , because we can filter bad - file - list itself if we need this data .
( define move - results ( cons ' move - results ( ns:enumerator - fold ( lambda ( x xs ) ( let* ( ( location ( @ x object - for - key : " Location " ) ) ( URL ( ns:string -> URL location ) ) ) ( if URL ( if ( @ URL is - file - URL ) ( let ( ( name ( ns:string - value ( @ URL path ) ) ) ) ( let ( ( moved - item ( hash - table - ref / default URL - to - moved - item - table ( ns:string - value location ) # f ) ) ) ( if moved - item ;; Verify pathname gibes with bad - file record .
( if ( string= ? name ( bad - file - name ( moved - item - source moved - item ) ) ) ( if ( moved- item- unique ? moved - item ) ( begin ( @ x set - object : ( path - > URL ( moved - item - destination moved - item ) ) for - key : " Location " ) ( cons moved - item xs ) ) xs ) ;; this xs nest is here in case we want xs ) ; ; to warn or cons different messages xs ) ) ) ;; ... xs ) ;;
Not a file ; do nothing ( begin ( warning " invalid URL : " location ) xs ) ) ) ) '( ) ( @ tracks object - enumerator ) ) ) )
After evaluating move - results and possibly examining the output , we can run the bad files search again on the newly updated dictionary , by reevaluating the bad - files expression .
Examining this output , I see that the only output consists of the 21 files that were not found in the new location ( which had been deleted on purpose ) .
#; 165 > ( length ( bad - file - list - items bad - files ) ) => 21
Now we can write our library to a new XML file , shut down iTunes , and copy the file into place .
#; 166 > ( itunes : write- library lib " ~/scheme/xcode/plist/iTunes Music Library.xml.new " )
Tragedy Unfortunately , as many people ( now including myself ) have belatedly discovered after hacking up the iTunes XML file , iTunes will blithely ignore any changes you 've made .
The real data is kept in the binary iTunes Library file ; the XML file is " read - only " and is generated from this data , overwriting your changes .
Fortunately , a solution of sorts is detailed at Schmolleworld .
In short , you first make a backup of your iTunes Library and iTunes Music Library.xml files , then truncate the iTunes Library file ( i.e. " ~/ Music / iTunes Library " ) > and overwrite the old .xml file with your new copy .
iTunes will think the iTunes Library file is corrupted , and rebuild it from the XML file .
Although this is n't exactly what you might call " safe " , it worked for me and my 5,628 song library .
However , any file in the XML database that iTunes cannot actually find will be eradicated from the iTunes database .
Files that you 've deliberately deleted , such as the album I described above , will disappear , which is pretty useful .
Files that have been moved and not updated in your XML file , or which are on a removed volume , will also disappear , which is bad .
That means all files you want to keep must be resolved before recreating the library .
You should check the output of ( bad - file - list - filter moved - item - notfound ? bad - files ) to find all moved files that can't be resolved .
You can update the XML file as many times as you want , but should not recreate the library until you are confident all files you want to keep are resolved .
iTunes will also " reorganize " your iTunes Music folder ( usually " ~/ Music /iTunes / iTunes Music " ) when importing the XML file , I assume only if you have " Keep iTunes Music folder organized " selected .
In my case , a few question marks in filenames were translated into underscores , and that 's it .
iTunes wo n't lose track of these files even if you back out your XML file and restore the old names .
A better solution than the above might be to generate an AppleScript , or to make AppleScript calls directly from Objective C , which sends commands to iTunes to update its database .
For best results and safety , we would have to be able to look up songs via the Location URL .
Although I can look up by alias name , I can't convert this to a URL .
Furthermore , even if we indexed by track ID instead , AppleScript does n't let you set Location anyway !
Double tragedy
And yet after all that , a fatal error has occurred : all non-smart playlists , including Podcasts , are destroyed when importing a new XML file .
Most playlists can be restored using ListSaver , a $ 6 shareware product from Dead End Software .
However , the Podcast playlist is restored as a regular playlist , with all your podcast data intact but your subscription info gone .
You can resubscribe , but your files on disk will not show up in the subscription .
I do n't know of any workaround .
Groovy Movin ' reconnects files by sending the Command - I keystroke to bring up the " Can't find file " dialog box , then navigates ( again via keystrokes ! ) the file selector and finds the correct file .
This process is very dodgy ; it 's subject to timing issues and has a huge amount of error correction to compensate .
Another option would be for you to delete and reimport bad files manually , then output an AppleScript which would restore ratings and playcounts scraped from a backup copy of the XML file .
The Applescript would need to reference files by Artist , Album , and Size .
For best results , you 'd want to specify the restored files manually , to avoid updating every song .
One can imagine an Applescript which retrieves the current iTunes selection and spits it to a program which grabs the old data , generating a new script to update the selection .
Probably such a thing has already been written .
All this heartache just because Apple did n't provide a way to modify a music file 's location via Applescript !
We just can't reasonably change the hardcoded paths in the music library .
It looks like our only real option to is to fall back on that tried - and - true tool of system administrators everywhere — the symbolic link .
( Update June 2007 : originally , the symbolic links we create had to be permanently available .
I have now devised a way to remove the symlinks after you have reconnected your lost files ; see Moving unmanaged iTunes files . )
Symlinks
We 'll perform the same track dictionary traversal we did in obtaining move - results , but instead of updating the dictionary we 'll create symbolic links from each correct file to the corresponding bad file .
First , since the bad file path may not even exist , we 'll need a convenient way to create a string of directories before making the symlink , a la mkdir - p .
In fact , we could simply shell out to mkdir - p , but we might like more control than it provides — for example , we might not want to follow symbolic links .
Also , it 's a nice exercise !
Directory creation
Our strategy : first , split the pathname into its components .
All slashes are stripped out of the component list , so we can't tell if a given list represents an absolute pathname .
Therefore , we use absolute - pathname ?
on the pathname string to select a pathname - building function for later .
At the start , no components are completed ( a null list ) and all are remaining .
At each step of the loop , we append the first remaining component to the completed list , and use the pathname - building function from above to make it into a new pathname .
Existing directories can simply be recursed into .
Existing symlinks , if they point to directories , are optionally recursed into .
If the path does n't exist , we create a new directory .
Any failure condition will throw an error .
This process repeats until no components remain .
While developing the directory creation code , I encountered some interesting behaviour testing for file type and existence .
I recorded my findings in the following table , to ensure I handled all cases correctly .
Note : if / tmp / 1 is a symlink to a directory , ( symbolic - link ? " / tmp/1 " ) => #t ( directory ? " / tmp/1 " ) => #f ( symbolic - link ? " / tmp/1/ " ) => #f ( directory ? " /tmp/1/ " ) =>
#t However , if / tmp / 1 is a dead symlink , ( symbolic - link ? " / tmp/1 " ) => #t ( symbolic - link ? " / tmp/1/ " ) => error : no such file ( file - exists ? " / tmp/1 " ) => #f ; follows the symlink !
( file - exists ? " /tmp/1/ " ) => #f Unlike symbolic - link ? , directory ?
does an implicit file - exists ?. ( directory ? " / no/such / file " ) => #f
As you can see , appending a trailing slash " resolves " a symbolic link , which prevents us from testing if it is really a link .
But we also need to resolve symlinks to recurse into them .
We note that the pathname builder , make - pathname , takes two arguments , directory and file , and just appends a slash to the pathname if file is #f .
Therefore , we call make - pathname twice in the code below , once for no slash and once when we need the trailing slash .
Appending a slash to resolve a symlink is , in fact , simpler than using read - symbolic - link to do so .
; Creates all directories in pathname in the manner of mkdir - p . ; Throws an error upon failure ; returns the pathname on success .
If traverse - symlinks ; is #f [ default is #t ] , it is an error to recurse into symlinks to directories .
( define ( create - directories pathname . traverse - symlinks ? ) ( let ( ( make - pathname ( if ( absolute - pathname ? pathname ) make - absolute - pathname make - pathname ) ) ) ( let loop ( ( path - done '( ) ) ( path - left ( string - split pathname ( string pathname - directory - separator ) ) ) ) ( if ( null ? path - left ) pathname ( let ( ( next - path ( append path - done ( list ( car path - left ) ) ) ) ( pathname - so - far ( make - pathname path - done ( car path - left ) ) ) ) ( if ( directory ? pathname - so - far ) ( loop next - path ( cdr path - left ) ) ( if ( file - exists ?
pathname - so - far ) ( if ( and ( symbolic - link ? pathname - so - far ) ( : optional traverse - symlinks ?
# t ) ; Resolve symlink by ( directory ? ( make - pathname pathname - so - far # f ) ) ) ; appending a slash .
( loop next - path ( cdr path - left ) ) ( error ' create - directories " file exists " pathname - so - far ) ) ( begin ( create - directory pathname - so - far ) ; may throw an error ( loop next - path ( cdr path - left ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
Interlude : Accessing our result structures
Our result structures all look similar — they contain a type tag followed by a list of results — and the bad - file - list filter is pretty useful .
So we 'll generify the result processing by defining accessors and operations on " result " structure types .
( define ( result - type x ) ( car x ) ) ( define ( result - items x ) ( cdr x ) ) ( define ( make - result type items ) ( cons type items ) ) ( define ( result ? x ) ( symbol ? ( result - type x ) ) ) ;;
Should check for a valid result tag , but oh well .
( define ( filter - result pred x ) ( if ( result ? x ) ( make - result ( result - type x ) ( filter pred ( result - items x ) ) ) ( error ' filter - result " not a result list " ) ) )
Additionally , symbolic link creation can fail for one reason or another , and we might like to report this within the returned result structure .
We 'll create an error record which we expect to be placed in the destination slot of a moved - item record .
( define ( moved- item - error ? x ) ( error ? ( moved- item - destination x ) ) ) ( define ( error ? x ) ( and ( pair ? x ) ( eq ? ( car x ) ' error ) ) ) ( define ( make - link - error msg dest ) ( list ' error msg dest ) )
Interlude : Exceptions
The procedure create - symbolic - link throws an error rather than returning a boolean value .
But we 'd prefer that errors be caught and signaled in the results list ; we do n't want a single error to stop our processing .
So , we 'll make a helper procedure which invokes a thunk ( zero- argument procedure ) and returns #t upon success and #f upon error , and define a new procedure create - symbolic - link * on top of this .
We can catch errors using the methods described in SRFI - 12 : Exception Handling .
( define ( error - > boolean thunk ) ( handle - exceptions _ #f ( begin ( thunk ) # t ) ) ) ;;
See SRFI - 12 for details .
( define ( create - symbolic - link * old new ) ( error - > boolean ( lambda ( ) ( create - symbolic - link old new ) ) ) )
Then again , we'd like to get the actual exception message so we can inform the user exactly how linking failed , since there are myriad ways to actually fail .
The meat of our linking procedure will consist of calls to create - directories and create - symbolic - link , which may each throw errors .
Rather than cluttering up our link result code with the somewhat unsightly exception handling constructs , let 's define a simple macro that looks like an if block , with a fourth slot for error handling .
Our first attempt : an if statement with 4 blocks .
The fourth is a catch procedure called if an error is thrown .
The catch procedure receives 3 arguments , corresponding to the three usual pieces of information given with each exception : message , location , and argument list .
You might reasonably expect the fourth slot to be a code block like the others .
Using a lambda , though , lets the user choose his argument names , rather than having bindings magically appear in his environment .
( define - macro ( try - if pred conseq alt catch - proc ) ( let ( ( exn ( gensym ) ) ) `( handle - exceptions , exn ( , catch - proc ( ( condition - property - accessor 'exn ' message # f ) , exn ) ( ( condition - property - accessor 'exn ' location # f ) , exn ) ( ( condition - property - accessor 'exn ' arguments # f ) , exn ) ) ( if , pred , conseq , alt ) ) ) )
This function takes an error message and argument list ( as obtained from an exception ) and flattens them into a single string .
( conc is the do - what - I - want string appender . ) ( define ( error - > string msg args ) ( cond ( ( null ? args ) msg ) ( ( and ( pair ? args ) ( null ? ( cdr args ) ) ) ( conc msg " : " ( car args ) ) ) ( else ( conc msg " : " args ) ) ) )
I used try - if for a little while , but found it unwieldy .
Feel free to skip this excerpt from my first version of the link results code : ( try - if ( and ( create - directories ( pathname - directory src ) ) ( create - symbolic - link dst src ) ) ( cons moved - item xs ) ( error ' link - results " bad #f value " ) ;; this should never happen ( lambda ( msg loc args ) ( cons ( make - moved - item ( moved - item - source moved - item ) ( make - link - error ( error - > string msg args ) dst ) ) xs ) ) ) )
First I noted that we could pass the exception to the catch procedure instead of its components , then unpack the exception data in error -> string .
( define - macro ( try - if pred conseq alt catch - proc ) ( let ( ( exn ( gensym ) ) ) `( handle - exceptions , exn ( , catch - proc , exn ) ( if , pred , conseq , alt ) ) ) ) ( define ( error - > string exn ) ( let ( ( msg ( ( condition - property - accessor 'exn ' message # f ) exn ) ) ( loc ( ( condition - property - accessor 'exn ' location # f ) exn ) ) ;; ignored ( args ( ( condition - property - accessor 'exn ' arguments # f ) exn ) ) ) ( cond ( ( null ? args ) msg ) ( ( and ( pair ? args ) ( null ? ( cdr args ) ) ) ( conc msg " : " ( car args ) ) ) ( else ( conc msg " : " args ) ) ) ) )
In fact , we do n't even need the pred / conseq / alt arguments to try - if — we could change it into a generic try macro which executes a single try block .
On the other hand , perhaps only the predicate of the if should be evaluated within the exception handler .
Since handle - exceptions always returns , though , we could not distinguish between a return value from the catch proc and a return value from the predicate .
( In other words , how do we get the value of the predicate to the remainder of the if , while skipping the if when an error occurs ? )
Undoubtedly there is a way to do this , but our macro does n't need to be a catch - all solution , as long as it helps us do our work .
Therefore , our try macro will accept a single try block , returning its value .
However , if an error occurs during the try block , the catch procedure will be called with the exception and its return value will become the return value of try .
try consequently becomes just a very thin wrapper around handle - exceptions , and serves only to provide a different syntax .
( define - macro ( try try - block catch - proc ) ( let ( ( exn ( gensym ) ) ) `( handle - exceptions , exn ( , catch - proc , exn ) , try - block ) ) )
Creating the symlinks
We can now cut - and - paste ( yet again ) the move - results code and tweak it to perform symlinks instead of updating the plist dictionary .
We really should have abstracted out the common code earlier , but we were trying to get a proof - of - concept going and nice coding took a back seat .
Never fear : we will address this problem in a bit .
This code passes through the tracks list , looking up the corresponding moved - item record for each track .
If a unique destination file is found , then a symlink pointing to it is created in place of the missing source file .
Directories are created as needed for the symlink .
Any symlink that fails will have its moved - item - destination field set to ( error exception - message " / path/to/dest " ) .
Duplicate and not - found files will be skipped and are omitted from the results , just like in move - results .
At this point I went back and re-opened the iTunes database file , then re-evaluated bad - files to get a clean copy of the bad - file - list , because the plist dictionary had been modified when I was playing around with move - results .
( define link - results ( make - result ' link - results ( ns:enumerator - fold ( lambda ( x xs ) ( let* ( ( location ( @ x object - for - key : " Location " ) ) ( URL ( ns:string -> URL location ) ) ) ( if URL ( if ( @ URL is - file - URL ) ( let ( ( name ( ns:string - value ( @ URL path ) ) ) ) ;; REMOVE ( let ( ( moved - item ( hash - table - ref / default URL - to - moved - item - table ( ns:string - value location ) # f ) ) ) ( if moved - item ;; Verify pathname gibes with bad - file record .
( if ( string= ? name ( bad - file - name ( moved- item - source moved - item ) ) ) ( if ( moved-item- unique ? moved - item ) ;;
The meat : symlink the destination to the bad file .
( let ( ( src ( bad - file - name ( moved- item - source moved - item ) ) ) ( dst ( moved- item - destination moved - item ) ) ) ( try ( begin ( create - directories ( pathname - directory src ) ) ( create - symbolic - link dst src ) ( cons moved - item xs ) ) ( lambda ( exn ) ( cons ( make - moved - item ( moved - item - source moved - item ) ( make - link - error ( error - > string exn ) dst ) ) xs ) ) ) ) xs ) ;; this xs nest is here in case we want xs ) ; ; to warn or cons different messages xs ) ) ) ;; ... xs ) ;;
Not a file ; do nothing ( begin ( warning " invalid URL : " location ) xs ) ) ) ) '( ) ( @ tracks object - enumerator ) ) ) )
Finally , the payoff .
Having evaluated link - results , it turns out to be a good thing I saved all the error output .
Every single link returned an error : ( filter - result moved - item - unique ? link - results ) => ' ( link - results ) ( eqv? ( length link - results ) ( length ( filter - result moved - item - error ? link - results ) ) ) => #t ( write - list link - results " /tmp/link-errors.scm " )
Here 's an example failing record : ( moved ( bad- file " / mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/ariana/22/Depeche
Mode / Violator /02 Sweetest Perfection.mp3 " " file://localhost/mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/ariana/22/Depeche%20Mode/Violator/02%20Sweetest%20Perfection.mp3 " ) ( error " can not create directory - Permission denied : / mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/ariana/22/Depeche
Mode " " / mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3/burned/15/Depeche Mode / Violator/02 Sweetest Perfection.mp3 " ) )
I forgot I did n't have proper permissions to write to my NFS drive !
So I created a new UNIX group , chgrp ed the music directories , and added my user to the new group .
The interpreter , unfortunately , had to be restarted to see this change .
Up to this point , I had been using one continuous interpreter session , a common paradigm in the Lisp world .
I was saddened at its passing , but resolved the next session would be even better .
With permissions fixed , I ran the query again and wound up with zero errors : ( filter - result moved - item - error ? link - results ) => ( link - results ) ( eqv ? ( length ( result - items ( filter - result moved - item - unique ? link - results ) ) ) ( length ( result - items link - results ) ) ) =>
#t I subsequently confirmed that all the links were created correctly , and that iTunes now had access to all my " lost " files !
I then reran the bad files query , and it came up only with the 21 files that were intentionally deleted .
( Actually , it came up with one extra album , due to my ill - fated attempts to import an updated XML file .
One of my albums was " reorganized " — i.e. renamed — by iTunes .
As soon as I accessed these songs ( via Get Info ) , iTunes magically found them again and updated the XML file . )
My article Moving unmanaged iTunes files explains how to make iTunes reference the real , underlying files in its database , so you can then dispose of the symlinks .
Cleanup !
As the late Harry Caray would say : " Holy cow ! "
Our code may work , but it sure is ugly .
We 've accumulated a bunch of global variables , many of which are used to share state between procedures .
We 've also done a lot of cutting - and - pasting , which has left us with similar but separate code for three different passes through the track list .
It probably was n't the best idea to put this cleanup off , because we 've got a lot of work to do .
On the other hand , now that we 've solved the problem , it is much clearer where exactly code can be refactored .
Let 's tackle global variables first .
Not all globals are bad — for example , constants that must be visible everywhere are fine .
We do n't have any of these , though .
( Chicken provides a define - constant form for true constants . )
Other globals such as name ( iTunes XML filename ) and lib ( the plist representing the iTunes library ) are just artifacts of our programming in the REPL .
These are simply passed as arguments to toplevel procedures ; they 're not referenced by name from within any procedures .
These are nice to have for REPL interaction , so we can safely remove them into a separate driver file , treating the main code as a library .
itunes: music -regexp
Our itunes : music - regexp might be a good candidate for a SRFI - 39 parameter .
It 's " mostly " constant and has a good default value , but we might want to override it .
Parameters , a form of dynamically scoped variable , are a safer substitute for global variables , as they are thread - local and you can also temporarily override them with the parameterize form .
The only place this variable is used is from within find - music - files ; we could certainly pass it as an ( optional ) argument instead .
But let 's make it a parameter and see how it turns out .
( define itunes : music - regexp ( make - parameter " .*\. ( [ Mm ] [ Pp ]
3 | [ Aa ] [ Aa ] [ Cc ] ) " ) )
Only the tiniest tweak to find - music - files is required .
( define ( find - music - files base - dir sig ) ( let ( ( table ( make - hash - table string= ? ) ) ) ( for - each ( lambda ( fn ) ( let ( ( short - name ( pathname - components - right fn sig ) ) ) ( hash - table - set ! table short - name ( let ( ( old - key ( hash - table - ref / default table short - name # f ) ) ) ( if old - key ( cons fn old - key ) ( list fn ) ) ) ) ) ) ( find - files base - dir ( itunes : music - regexp ) ; the only change cons '() ( lambda ( fn ) ( not ( symbolic - link ? fn ) ) ) ) ) table ) ) music - table - ref significant - path - components is used in both find - music - files and music - table - ref .
We could parameterize it so it 's accessible from both , or pass it as an argument .
However , once a music table is created , it should always be called with the same value of significant - path - components .
The approach in an " object - oriented " language might be to create an object containing significant - path - components and a hash table as instance variables , with a pathname lookup operation defined on the class .
In Scheme , we can use a closure to achieve the same effect .
We 'll change our fold function to take a music - lookup procedure , rather than a music table .
This procedure will accept one argument ( a path ) , returning the matching pathname (s ) in its database .
We can then implement music - lookup internally in any manner consistent with our goal .
In other words : ( music - table - ref music - table ( pathname - components - right name significant - path - components ) ) ; becomes ( music - lookup name )
Our implementation is a function - creating - function which will call find - music - files and return a music - lookup function .
music - lookup will be closed over both the table created by find - music - files and the significant - path - components passed to it .
This piggybacks off the toplevel music - table - ref , which can still be tested separately .
The drawback is the table is now read - only .
To avoid this , we could implement the music - table as a dispatch function ( an " object " ) instead , capable of doing both a lookup and returning the raw table , depending on which message you send the object .
Or we could implement it as the list ( music - table < sig - path - components > < hash - table > ) and have music - table - ref pull out the appropriate data .
The key realization here is that we can implement the music table any way we want , as long as we can create a 1 - argument music - lookup procedure that returns the correct data .
Whether music - lookup looks at global variables or is closed over the music - table data does n't matter .
Whether it sends a message to an object , or uses define - record accessors or list operations does n't matter .
We 've now achieved better encapsulation and separation of interface from implementation .
We could of course define find - music - files and music - table - ref within the closure created by make - music - lookup .
Neither needs to be visible in the global environment , and we would no longer have to pass significant - path - components as an argument to either .
However , functions defined within closures are often a pain to debug at the REPL ; I feel it 's often easier to test them when defined at toplevel .
I 'll keep the music table wrapped opaquely in the lookup function , but I may revisit this in the future if we need access to the hash table .
( If you 'll recall , earlier we did pull out all values in the music table , to obtain a list of every duplicate file .
So more transparency may indeed be warranted . ) ( define ( make - music - lookup base - dir . significant - path - components ) ( let * ( ( sig- components ( : optional significant - path - components 3 ) ) ( table ( find - music - files base - dir sig- components ) ) ) ( lambda ( path ) ( music - table - ref table ( pathname - components - right path sig- components ) ) ) ) )
The URL table I like the approach of creating a dedicated lookup function enough to do the same thing for the URL - to - moved - item - table .
This will be passed to the moved - and link - results generators .
( define ( make - moved - lookup bad - files ) ( let ( ( table ( make - URL->moved - item - table bad- files ) ) ) ( lambda ( location ) ( hash - table - ref / default table location # f ) ) ) ) location - fold and functified bad - files , move - files , and link - files Now that we 've addressed the global variable issue , we can turn our attention to the unconscionable reliance on cut - and - paste which festers yet and lurks malignly in the dark dank recesses of that grotesque silken - masked blasphemy ... our code .
We need to wrap the calls to ns:enumerator - fold inside functions , which we should have done in the first place .
Each of the result generators has only two free variables : tracks ( the track dictionary ) and a lookup function .
We can pass these as parameters to the new functions .
Additionally , much code is shared between all three ; we can abstract this out into a new function location - fold , which will accept a procedure argument meat that performs the unique code of the fold .
In all three cases the unique code refers to x , xs , location and name , so we 'll pass these as arguments to meat .
I will present the newly - abstracted code here without much comment .
Here 's an example of its use : ( define tracks ( itunes : tracks ( itunes:open-library " ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music Library.xml " ) ) ) ( define music - lookup ( make-music - lookup " / mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3 " ) ) ( define bad - files ( get - bad - files tracks music - lookup ) ) ( define moved - lookup ( make - moved - lookup bad - files ) ) ( link - files tracks moved - lookup )
Or , without intermediate variables other than tracks : ( define tracks ... ) ( link - files tracks ( make - moved - lookup ( get- bad - files tracks ( make-music - lookup " / mnt/mp3/scratch/cd/mp3 " ) ) ) )
And without further ado , the code : ( define ( location - fold tracks meat ) ( ns:enumerator - fold ( lambda ( x xs ) ( let* ( ( location ( @ x object - for - key : " Location " ) ) ( URL ( ns:string -> URL location ) ) ) ( if URL ( if ( @ URL is - file - URL ) ( meat x xs location ( ns:string - value ( @ URL path ) ) ) xs ) ;;
Not a file ; do nothing ( begin ( warning " invalid URL : " location ) xs ) ) ) ) '( ) ( @ tracks object - enumerator ) ) ) ( define ( get - bad - files tracks music - lookup ) ( make - result ' bad - file - list ( location - fold tracks ( lambda ( x xs location name ) ( if ( file - exists ? name ) xs ( cons `( moved ( bad - file , name , ( ns:string - value location ) ) , ( music - lookup name ) ) xs ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( link - files tracks moved - lookup ) ( make - result ' link - results ( location - fold tracks ( lambda ( x xs location name ) ( let ( ( moved - item ( moved - lookup ( ns:string - value location ) ) ) ) ( if moved - item ;; Verify pathname gibes with bad - file record .
( if ( string= ? name ( bad - file - name ( moved- item - source moved - item ) ) ) ( if ( moved-item- unique ? moved - item ) ;;
The meat : symlink the destination to the bad file .
( let ( ( src ( bad - file - name ( moved- item - source moved - item ) ) ) ( dst ( moved- item - destination moved - item ) ) ) ( try ( begin ( create - directories ( pathname - directory src ) ) ( create - symbolic - link dst src ) ( cons moved - item xs ) ) ( lambda ( exn ) ( cons ( make - moved - item ( moved - item - source moved - item ) ( make - link - error ( error - > string exn ) dst ) ) xs ) ) ) ) xs ) ;; this xs nest is here in case we want xs ) ; ; to warn or cons different messages xs ) ) ) ) ) ) move - files does share some code with link - files , but we 've abstracted enough for now .
( define ( move - files tracks moved - lookup ) ( make - result ' move - results ( location - fold tracks ( lambda ( x xs location name ) ( let ( ( moved - item ( moved - lookup ( ns:string - value location ) ) ) ) ( if moved - item ;; Verify pathname gibes with bad - file record .
( if ( string= ? name ( bad - file - name ( moved - item - source moved - item ) ) ) ( if ( moved- item- unique ? moved - item ) ( begin ( @ x set - object : ( path - > URL ( moved - item - destination moved - item ) ) for - key : " Location " ) ( cons moved - item xs ) ) xs ) ;; this xs nest is here in case we want xs ) ; ; to warn or cons different messages xs ) ) ) ) ) )

Crime Posted by Ogged
on 09.30.05 Jesus H. The Ex is living in NY at the moment , and last night she woke up in her fourth - floor apartment to find a stranger standing five feet from her bed .
She yelled a loud - as - she - could " Hey ! " and the guy ran out the fire escape ( making off with the roomie 's laptop ) .
She and her roommate ( whom she 's known for a while ) both seem remarkably composed .
They 've extra - double secured the window that the guy must have come through , and apparently the cops were shocked that the guy had been able to get in in the first place .
In the grand scheme of city crime , this is n't even a blip , but it 's not hard to imagine that , for a lot of people , it would be enough to drive them from the city , or even cities generally .
Maybe not even initially , but after realizing that they had n't been able to sleep for a month , or that they were carrying around a gnawing unease .

A Democrat Posted by Ogged
on 09.30.05 Via the apostropher , a so very very good response by Barack Obama to groups on the left who are angry that any Democrats voted to confirm John Roberts , and a response , more generally , to calls that Democrats should n't compromise .
Read the whole thing to see a politician who " gets it , " both in terms of the issues , the language that will resonate with his audience , and broad political strategy .
These two paragraphs in particular seem downright wise .
According to the storyline that drives many advocacy groups and Democratic activists - a storyline often reflected in comments on this blog - we are up against a sharply partisan , radically conservative , take - no - prisoners Republican party .
They have beaten us twice by energizing their base with red meat rhetoric and single - minded devotion and discipline to their agenda .
In order to beat them , it is necessary for Democrats to get some backbone , give as good as they get , brook no compromise , drive out Democrats who are interested in " appeasing " the right wing , and enforce a more clearly progressive agenda .
The country , finally knowing what we stand for and seeing a sharp contrast , will rally to our side and thereby usher in a new progressive era .
I think this perspective misreads the American people .
From traveling throughout Illinois and more recently around the country , I can tell you that Americans are suspicious of labels and suspicious of jargon .
They do n't think George Bush is mean - spirited or prejudiced , but have become aware that his administration is irresponsible and often incompetent .
They do n't think that corporations are inherently evil ( a lot of them work in corporations ) , but they recognize that big business , unchecked , can fix the game to the detriment of working people and small entrepreneurs .
They do n't think America is an imperialist brute , but are angry that the case to invade Iraq was exaggerated , are worried that we have unnecessarily alienated existing and potential allies around the world , and are ashamed by events like those at Abu Ghraib which violate our ideals as a country .
Go on .

The Magic Words Posted by Ogged
on 09.28.05 Some of our winger friends -- first rate legal minds , every one -- are on about the fact that the indictment of DeLay does n't say what he did .
As I understand the charge of conspiracy , all Earle needs to show is that at some point , DeLay was informed of the funneling of funds and said something like " Ok . "
The end .
In fact , I 'd guess that DeLay 's involvement will be easy to prove .
The bulk of the case will go to showing that the transfer of funds from one organization to the other was intended to circumvent the law .
Without someone ( credible ) willing to testify , that 's a pretty tough case to make .
And like I said below , I sure hope Earle can make it , because if he can't , it 's going to become very difficult to use the law to check corrupt politicians .

Hey [ blogger self - congratulation ahead ] , maybe I should get back into the political blogging business :
What 's the one - sentence knock on George Bush ? ...
Here 's my nomination : George Bush does n't play by the rules .
From the Iraq war , to the South Carolina primary against McCain , to the outing of Valerie Plame , to putting political hacks into career civil service positions , to not holding enough press conferences , to refusing to release records , to his National Guard service all of these are examples of not playing by the rules ... because Bush is running on " boldness , " he 'll keep doing and bringing up things that can be called reckless , or indifferent to the rules .
And we should also keep in mind all the ongoing investigations of Republicans .
Every trickle of news about any of them will feed the " not playing by the rules " beast .
Having a counter to the " bold " / " strong leader " / " decisive " persona lets us shift the debate to facts and outcomes , which are overwhelmingly in our favor .

on 09.27.05 [ I 'm going to be upset if academic blogs do n't link to Fontana 's supergood grad - school advice post just because it contains the word " fellatio . " ]
On a different topic entirely , what do the people of blogdom know about soy products ?
I have this notion in the back of my mind that some people are convinced that soy is a tool of the devil , and will kill me .
But then there are the Japanese .
Is there an informed consensus on this ?

on 09.27.05 As Young Ben heads off to his first days of graduate school , I thought it might be a good time to offer words of advice to others at the very start of their graduate careers .
Ben 's talent and charm will carry him through with no problems , I 'm sure , but for any interested parties I offer these opening salvos .
Add your own in comments !
1 . The most important thing : recognize that graduate school is not at all college + 1 .
It 's a job - training program designed to qualify you for a very specialized line of work .
You 're a professional now .
Act accordingly .
2 . As a corollary of ( 1 ) , keep in mind that your relationship with your faculty is completely different from an undergraduate's .
In some ways this is good : you 're halfway a colleague .
In some ways this is bad : you 're completely dependent on them .
Getting abused , harassed , or mistreated ?
Any of the official lines of complaint might well result in a lukewarm letter of recommendation , which pretty much kills your chance at a job .
Never make the mistake of thinking that you 're one of them .
3 . In case you 're unclear about what ( 2 ) means : it entails that you should not [ behave badly ] .
I know you 're really drunk , but respect the boundaries .
4 . Partly because your work is all - consuming , and partly because of the strange relationship mentioned in ( 2 ) , you need to have some kind of outlet outside of your academic life .
This will cushion you when , inevitably , the professional life hits the skids .
If you can , make nonacademic friends .
Keep up at least one hobby from the old days .
You need to blow off some steam once in a while .
5 . Keep fit .
I 'm completely serious about this .
6 . Listen to your peers .
At the start of my program , I got invaluable advice from older , wiser heads .
Keep your ears open to learn the ins and outs , the standards , the expectations , and so on .
No need to reinvent the wheel .
7 . In any department there are stand - up , heart - of - gold people who are on your side .
There are also [ bad people ] .
Find out who 's who , and do n't take their word for it .
[ Appearances can be misleading ] .
Bite your tongue and bide your time , honky .
8 . Do your fair share .
From time to time , there will be annoying obligations .
Go to the parties .
Attend the receptions .
Take the visiting speaker to lunch .
You 're building a little goodwill , and it can really help to be seen as a team player if things get rough .
Being a good citizen is a good thing .
9 . Network like mad .
Meet people and impress them with your cleverness .
10 .
Do n't waste time whining about the market -- you could be working with that energy .
My advice : every six to twelve months , surface for air .
Go meta about your career choice .
If you 're not enjoying graduate school , if the work is n't moving you , if it 's not paying off as you 'd hoped , consider dropping out .
If you decide to continue , do n't think about it until six months later .
11 . There 's no shame in dropping out , either .
Smarter people than you are flourishing in nonacademic careers , and I invite you to bite their asses if you think your " Dr " means anything .
12 . Enjoy it .
You 'll probably never be around such smart , interesting , and completely fucked up people ever again .
It 's good times .
I 'm sure I 've contradicted myself , come across like a jerk , whatever .
I 'll amend as appropriate .

It 's really depressing to be leafing through real - estate listings , and catch myself learning to skip over anything that looks nice , because while I can't afford anything , I really can't afford any place I 'd want to live in .
Cheapest listing so far : a 2 - bedroom condo in a not - so - great town , in a drab sanitorium - chic building , for $ 450,000 .
On the other hand , I had a great tan in February .
Dough Power Posted by Ogged
on 09.26.05 I 've been intrigued by swimmer Ian Crocker since he thrashed Michael Phelps and broke his own world record in the 100 M butterfly ; especially after reading this great quote from his teammate .
" It 's amazing someone so sedate can create so much power at the drop of a hat . "
( This is Crocker 's dough - boy face after setting that world record .
Dude could play baseball . )
So I paddled over to his website , where I learned that not only is he a big Dylan fan , but his nickname is ... Teh Crockah .
Teh Crockah is hereby named the official swimmer of Unfogged .

My daughter Maude was 5 when she realized that Barney had only one expression .
She could n't stop laughing when she noticed this .
She ran around the living room with this psychotic Barney smile which never changed , and then started saying , " I 'm happy .
I 'm sad . "
She laughed some more and then screamed , " Help me !
I do n't know how to feel . "
Brilliant , and disturbing .

This cracked me up .
Why does China have to spend millions on new repressive opinion - blocking technologies and new complicated anti-speech rules when it could just adopt TimesSelect across the board and accomplish the same thing more efficiently and with less controversy ?...
The NYT might even lease its proprietary TimesSelect technology to threatened dictatorships around the globe as a turnkey solution to their Internet dissent problems .
Worried about subversive pro-democracy agitators ?
Just make them part of TimesSelect 's premium content and they 'll never be heard from again !

Tillman , Again Posted by Ogged
on 09.25.05
It 's hard to read about Pat Tillman and not get very depressed that he 's dead ( and was killed by friendly - fire , at that ) .
Interviews also show a side of Pat Tillman not widely known  a fiercely independent thinker who enlisted , fought and died in service to his country yet was critical of President Bush and opposed the war in Iraq , where he served a tour of duty .
He was an avid reader whose interests ranged from history books on World War II and Winston Churchill to works of leftist Noam Chomsky , a favorite author .
...
Baer , who served with Tillman for more than a year in Iraq and Afghanistan , told one anecdote that took place during the March 2003 invasion as the Rangers moved up through southern Iraq .
" I can see it like a movie screen , " Baer said .
" We were outside of ( a city in southern Iraq ) watching as bombs were dropping on the town .
We were at an old air base , me , Kevin and Pat , we were n't in the fight right then .
We were talking .
And Pat said ,  You know , this war is so f illegal . '
I do n't just mean that he was a liberal , though that 's nice .
What I admire is the unusual mix of principled , brave , patriotism , with the political sophistication to make the distinction between fighting Al Qaeda and attacking Iraq .
What a waste .

I Love You All Posted by Ogged
on 09.25.05 Just saw Grizzly Man , which I 'd forgotten about for a while , but which you really ought not miss if it 's still playing where you live .
If you have n't heard of it , my dear biscuits , it 's the story of Timothy Treadwell , who lived among Alaskan grizzlies for 13 summers , before he and his girlfriend were finally killed by a bear .
I expected a nature documentary , intertwined with the story of an eccentric naturalist .
It 's more accurate to say that it 's the strangely riveting story of a complete nutcase , who managed to shoot unbelievable video .
Finally , a lot of reviews call this " heart - breaking , " and I do feel bad for his girlfriend , but Treadwell himself is crazy in a very funny way , and really , he could n't have gone out any other way .

on 09.25.05 I had some loco moco for lunch yesterday .
That 's a mound of rice , hamburger patty , fried eggs , onions , and gravy .
Mmmmmm .
Actually , I can imagine it being divine , but what I had was only ok ; the patty was n't the greatest , and there should have been more gravy .
But I 'm very pleased about this new Hawaiian place .
Finding itself in Republican sights and with no Democratic power center to offer protection , National Public Radio is turning into an upscale version of Fox " News . "
Nevertheless , information still gets out if the listener is sufficiently attentive .
On July 5 , NPR ’s All Things Considered interviewed two warmongers for their views on the North Korean missile test .
One was Ashton Carter , a Clinton administration assistant secretary of defense , now at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard .
The other was Ambassador Christopher Hill , an assistant secretary of state in the Bush regime .
The Clinton DoD assistant secretary is coauthor of a recent article advocating a unilateral U.S. military attack on North Korea .
His first pitch on NPR was that the whole region , not just the U.S. , is threatened by North Korea and that everyone should gang up on North Korea to make them behave .
The NPR interviewer asked Carter to reconcile his multilateralism with his own recommendation for the U.S. to unilaterally attack North Korea .
Carter replied that North Korea ’s missile was developed to attack us , so we had to protect ourselves .
When the NPR interviewer asked Carter why deterrence would fail with North Korea when deterrence succeeded in the case of the more powerful Soviet Union , Carter agreed that North Korea was not sufficiently insane to launch an attack on the U.S.
So , if the U.S. is not in danger of being attacked by North Korea , why does Carter want to attack North Korea ?
The answer is , well , you see , if we permit North Korea to develop any weapon with which they might be able to stand up to us on some issue critical to North Korea , well , they might not do as we want them to do .
Carter could not conceive of a world in which any country existed that might be able to behave differently than the U.S. dictates .
Ambassador
Hill agreed , but he came at it in a different way .
Hill ’s view is that it is China ’s , Japan’s , and South Korea ’s responsibility to make North Korea behave as the U.S. wants it to behave .
Both Hill and Carter agreed that no country , with the exception of Israel , has a right to any interests of its own unless it is an interest that coincides with U.S. interests .
No other interest is legitimate .
Listening to the pair of hegemonic maniacs , I realized that the U.S. is the new Rome  there is no legitimate power but us .
Any other power is a potential threat to our interests and must be eliminated before it gets any independent ideas .
The U.S. , however , is far more dangerous than Rome .
Rome saw its world as the Mediterranean and , for a while , Northern Europe , but the U.S. thinks the whole world is its oyster .
The Bush regime is busy trying to marginalize Russia , and neocons are preparing war plans to attack China before that country can achieve military parity with the U.S .
Gentle reader , consider what it means when our government believes other countries have no right to their own interests unless they coincide with U.S. interests .
It means that we are the tyrant country .
We cannot be the tyrant country without being perceived as the tyrant country .
Consequently , the rest of the world unites against us .
How is the U.S. , which has spent three years proving that it cannot successfully occupy Iraq , a small country of only 25 million people , going to control India , China , Russia , Europe , Africa , and South America ?
It ’s not going to happen .
What it does mean is that the U.S. government in its hubris and delusion is going to continue starting wars and attacking other countries until a coalition of greater forces smashes us .
Even among our European allies we are already perceived as the greatest threat to world peace and stability .
Our power is not what it once was .
We are weak in manufacturing and dependent on China for advanced technology products .
We are dependent on China to finance our wars and our budget and trade deficits .
How long will China accommodate us when China reads about Bush ’s plans to prevent China from achieving military parity ?
The Bush regime thinks that it can have every country under its thumb .
Neocons are fond of proclaiming that it is a unipolar world in which the U.S. is supreme .
This is a fantasy , and it is rapidly becoming a nightmare .
The Eye of God
I ’m taking the bus to the Port Authority .
The driver navigating the rattling aluminum box we ’re sitting in slaloms through the scrum of New Jersey traffic and dives us under the Hudson River .
I ’m always a bit nervous going through the Lincoln Tunnel .
When I was a kid I was always afraid it would spring a leak .
It did n’t help when my grandmother teased me about not bringing an umbrella .
I ’m a man now .
I ’ve put childish fears behind me .
I look at my fellow passengers .
Almost everyone ’s Hispanic .
Espanol is the lingua franca of el autobus .
Some people are sleeping .
Others are chattering into their cell phones .
No one seems excited about going into The City .
I wonder if suburbanites riding the bus to jobs in Paris feel the same way .
I guess if you ’ve seen one naked city you ’ve seen them all .
The heavy man sitting next to me smells like garlic and onions .
Fast asleep , cheek pressed flat against the window , a dribble of saliva works out of his mouth and jitters down the glass in synchronous rhythm with the tires bouncing on the pavement .
Across from me a young man with a peach fuzz mustache clutches a backpack tightly .
He ca n’t be more than nineteen .
Maybe he ’s thinking about some girl .
Maybe he ’s thinking about the ten pounds of plastic explosives he ’s got in the bag .
I check and see if he ’s got wires or a detonator peeking out of his sleeve .
I sniff the air for rosewater .
I read somewhere that terrorists bathe in rosewater before setting out on their one way trips .
Then again I used wait on a regular customer who reeked of the stuff .
She never blew the restaurant up .
The drivers radio squawks reassuringly .
The calm measured voice of officialdom seeps through the speakers and floats past my ears .
I read the sign saying undercover police officers might be riding on the bus .
I wonder what I ’d do if young man with the peach fuzz mustache got up and started praying to Allah .
Would I tackle him ?
Jump over the fat guy and dive out the window ?
Pray there really was a cop on board ?
I ’d hate the words “ blown up in the Lincoln Tunnel ” to be in my obituary .
Suddenly I realize I prefer the fears of my childhood .
Peach Fuzz is not a terrorist .
I ’ve read too many spy novels .
I have an overactive imagination .
But I ca n’t get the vision of the London bombings out of my head – the twisted charred metal , people ’s shoes lying everywhere .
That ’s the problem with having a well developed imagination .
If you can think of beautiful things you can think of terrible things .
Ninety - seven feet under the river we cross the line separating New Jersey and New York .
I look out the opposite window and stare at the thin metal catwalk hugging the left side of the tunnel .
When I was a kid I used to look for the maintenance workers zipping alongside in their little electric cars .
If the tunnel sprang a leak they would rescue me .
I ’m still looking for them thirty years later .
We approach the end of the tunnel .
I suddenly remember Hitchcock ’s sly cinematic move in the last scene of North by Northwest , where he used the imagery of a train powering into a dark tunnel to represent what Cary Grant was doing to Eva Marie Saint .
If going into a tunnel represents sex what does coming out of one mean ?
Birth ?
If it does I ’m coming into the world smelling like garlic and onions .
The bus breaches into the dull light of a late December afternoon .
I look down into the cars racing below us .
One guy ’s arguing on his cell phone while another driver applies her lipstick .
I ’d rather chance terrorists and public transportation than drive with those people .
The bus angles upwards as we hit the ramp heading into the Port Authority Terminal .
As we start climbing above the streets I look at the windows of the apartment buildings close by .
Each window is somebody ’s home .
Each window is people talking and hating , crying and laughing .
Each window is awe and possibility .
Each window is sex and loneliness .
Each window is gentleness and light .
Each window is the Power and the Glory .
As the bus corkscrews towards the sky there ’s a gap in between the roadways , revealing the streets below .
As if peering through the asphalt and steel iris of a concrete god , I see a modest coffee shop squatting on a busy corner .
On the other side of its plate glass window a waitress drops a check at a booth .
She has dark hair and might be pretty .
I wonder how long she ’s been working there .
I wonder if she ’s scared of growing old and lonely .
I wonder what she dreams about at night .
Before I can wonder anymore the god ’s eye closes and the waitress is gone .
The bus pulls into the terminal .
The kid with the peach fuzz mustache jumps out of his seat before the bus comes to a stop .
He wants to get off first .
I guess he ’s not blowing anybody up .
The fat man next to me wakes up and peels his cheek off the window .
I disembark , go down escalators and stairs , and head towards the 42nd Street exit .
Three young women are walking in front of me , pulling suitcases on rollers .
They look like college students from Minnesota .
Unlike the passengers on my bus theyre excited about being in New York .
“ Oh my God ! ” one of the girls squeals .
“ I ’ve never been so excited and scared in my entire life ! ”
I smile to myself .
It must be wonderful to see New York for the first time .
I watch as the girls step onto the street and do what every tourist does when they first gaze upon Gotham , look up .
Standing together on the sidewalk , the immensity of New York City breaks over us like a neon tsunami .
Even though I ’ve lived around the bright lights of the big city since I was a boy , I find myself looking up too .
For a moment I forget who I am .
A bum interrupts my reverie and asks me for a dollar .
I give it to him .
The girls from Minnesota ask a young cop for directions .
I smell pretzels baking .
I buy one with mustard .
I eat my pretzel and enjoy the sights and sounds of the city .
I glory in being all grown up .
A million faces walk by .
Happy faces , excited faces , cunning faces , drunk faces .
They ’re like those apartment windows .
Like that waitress they all have a story .
Suddenly I ’m filled with joy .
For a moment I ’ve become the Eye of God .
The western sky simmers violet as the sun finishes its dive towards the horizon .
I look at my watch .
I ’m running late .
I finish my pretzel and throw the wrapper in the trash .
I stick my hands into my pockets , walk down 42nd Street , and disappear into the babble of a million stories .
I ’ve never been so excited and scared in my entire life .
Men 's troubles begin during the earliest days in the womb .
Even though there are more male than female embryos , there are more miscarriages of male fetuses .
Industrial countries are also witnessing a decline in male to female birth ratios , and we do n't know why .
Some scientists have argued that the probability of a male child declines as parents ( especially fathers ) age .
Still others have cited the prevalence of pesticides , which produce more birth defects in male children .
Even when a boy manages to be born , he 's still behind the survival eight ball : he is three to four times more likely than girls to have developmental disorders like autism and dyslexia ; girls learn language earlier , develop richer vocabularies and even hear better than boys .
Girls demonstrate insight and judgment earlier in adolescence than boys , who are more impulsive and take more risks than their sisters .
Teenage boys are more likely to commit suicide than girls and are more likely to die violent deaths before adulthood .
As adults , too , men die earlier than women .
Twice as many men as women die of coronary artery disease , which manifests itself a decade earlier in men than women ; when it comes to cancer , the news for men is almost as bad .
Women also have more vigorous immune systems than men : of the 10 most common infections , men are more likely to have serious encounters with seven of them .
While depression is said to be twice as frequent in women as in men , I 'm convinced that the diagnosis is just made more frequently in women , who show a greater willingness to discuss their symptoms and to ask for help when in distress .
Once , at a dinner party , I asked a group of men whether they believed men were depressed as often as women , but were simply conditioned to be silent in the face of discomfort , sadness or fear .
" Of course ! " replied one man .
" Why do you think we die sooner ? "

SQLiteを使った小さなOODB
SQLiteの調査のために、PRbをSQLiteで再実装した習作です。
PRbのリポジトリにつっこんであります。
< URL : http://cvs.sourceforge.jp/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/prb/koya/>
関連ネタ KoyaなTropy
今のとこ ろSQLite3系では動きません。2.x系が必要です。rubyのバインディングもね。 ( sqlite3のせいなのか、sqlite3のrubyのバインディングのせいなのか‥)
で、インストールはいつものように。
% sudo ruby install.rb
Koyaってなんですか ?
SQLite2.xをストレージとして使用する、機能が簡単なOODBです。
本当 にOODBですか ?
たぶんちがいます。振る舞いは保存されませんし、継承も型もありません。
型もないの ?
型の名前はありますが、型の情報は保存されません。
Rubyっぽいの ?
PRbと違い、Rubyの写像を目指していません。一部のオブジェクトだけが
オブジェクトとして扱われます。
んあ ?
Rubyスクリプト上でKoyaObjectを継承したオブジェクトは、Koyaの中で オブジェクトとして扱われます。
ほかのオブジェクトは ?
Fixnum とStringはそのままSQLite風に、それ以外のオブジェクトはMarshalされて 保存されます。
どう違うの ?
KoyaObjectは参照できますが、それ以外は参照できません。アクセスすると
新しいオブジェクトが生成されてしまいます。 dRubyでいうところの参照渡しと値渡しのように違います。
並列性はどうなの ?
トランザクションをサポートします。SQLiteはあんまり並列性がよくないので
気持ちよくあきらめています。
えー ?
しかも、トランザクション待ちをブロックして待てないので、ポーリングします。
とほほですね 。
まあね。
安定してますか ?
実装は不安定です。それ以上にAPIも不安定です。SQLite3ではうまく動きません。
SQLite2.xでもまれに拡張ライブラリの何かを踏んでしまいます。
なにか自慢してください。
ある型名を持つオブジェクトの一覧( extent ) や、逆リンクの一 覧 ( referer ) 、 GC、世代 別GC ( 実効性なし版 ) が用意されています。また、時刻を指定して その時の状態になること( revert_to ) もできます。extent , referer , revert_toは おそらくアプリケーションのバージョンアップや不具合修正のために使うんだと 思います 。
やってなくて、やるつもりなのはなんですか?
複数データベースの扱い 、Path、キャッシュ、アプリケーションとかとか。
とりあえ ずrequire ' koya 'が必要です。 それから、データベースの接続とな るKoya:: Storeを生成します。 パラメータはデータベースファイルの名前です。
% irb -- simple - prompt >> require ' koya ' >> s = Koya:: Store.new ('test.db ' )
Koya:: Storeにはただ一つのrootオブジェクトがあります。
>> root = s.root => #< Koya:: KoyaRef:0x ..... >
rootオブジェクトはキー がStringに限定されたHashのような感じです。
>> root.keys => [ ]
なにか入れてみます 。
>> root [ ' one ' ] = 1 => 1 >> root.keys => [ " one " ] >> root.delete('one ' ) >> root.keys => [ ]
つまんないですね。 transaction を作ってabortしてみましょう。
>> root. transaction do ?> root [ ' one ' ] = 1 >> root [ ' two ' ] = 2 >> raise ' abort ' >> end RuntimeError : abort ..... >> root.keys => [ ]
なにもなかったことになりました。
abortはいまいち作り込みが甘いというか、積極的に使うというよりも 不整合な状態 でcommitできないようにする安全ネットみたいな緊急用に つかうものかもしれません 。
正常なときはこうかな。
>> root. transaction do ?> root [ ' one ' ] = 1 >> root [ ' two ' ] = 2 >> end >> root.keys => [ " one " , " two " ]
transaction中はほかのプロセスはtransactionに入れません。 新しい端末( Terminal2 ) を用意して実験します。
[ Terminal2 ] % irb -r koya -- simple - prompt >> s = Koya:: Store.new ('test.db ' ) >> root = s.root
いままでの端 末( Terminal1 ) で時間のかかるtransactionを実行してみます。
[ Terminal1 ] >> root. transaction do ?> root [ ' three ' ] = 3 >> sleep 10 >>
end
10 秒の間に[ Terminal2 ] で問い合わせてみましょう。
[ Terminal2 ] >> root.keys
いそいで入力できた人は、ブロックしている様子が見られると思います。
しばらくして、次のように表示されたかしらん。
[ Terminal2 ] => [ " one " , " three " , " two " ]
普通 のRubyのオブジェクトはMarshalされたりして保存されます。 それは取り出すたびに新しいオブジェクトが生成されることを意味します。
>> str = " String " >> root [ ' str ' ] = str >> str.object_id 3067308 >> root [ ' str '].object_id >> 1623454 >> root [ ' str '] .object_id >>
1600914
がっかりですね 。
Koyaがオブジェクトとして扱えるのは、Koya::KoyaObjectを継承したクラス だけです。
class Foo < Koya:: KoyaObject def initialize ( name ) self .
name = name end koya_attr : name , : friend def greeting friend .
greeting if friend puts " Hello , This is #{name} ? n " end end
irbに上のクラス定義をペーストしてFooを定義してください。
FooはKoya::KoyaObjectを継承します。
koya_attrはattr_accessorみたいなもので、KoyaObjectの属性を定義します。
@nameじゃなくてnameなのでself.をつけて明示的なメソッド呼び出しにしてる ところがあります。
生成してみましょう 。
>> Foo.new ( ' one ' )
Koya :: TransactionNotFound : Koya :: TransactionNotFound .....
失敗しましたか ? KoyaObjectはtransactionの中でしか生成できません。 これは生成してどこからも参照されていないときにGCされてしまわないようにする
ためです。(さらにどのデータベースに生成するかを決定させるため)
root [ ' foo ' ] に生成し たFooを入れてみます。
>> root. transaction do ?> root [ ' foo ' ] = Foo.new ( ' one ' ) >> end => #< Foo:0 x ... >
作れたみたい 。
>> root [ ' foo ' ] . greeting Hello ,
This is one .
もう一つ作ります。root [ ' foo ' ].friendから参照します。
>> root. transaction do ?> root [ ' foo ' ] . friend = Foo.new ( ' two ' ) >> end >> root [ ' foo ' ] . greeting Hello ,
This is two Hello , This is one
メンテナンス用に使おうと思っている機能を一つ紹介します。 指定の時刻の状態に戻るrevert_toです。
まず時刻を覚えておきます。
>> tag = Time.now
次にroot [ ' foo ' ] を忘れてみましょう 。
>> root. delete ( ' foo ' ) >> root [ ' foo ' ] . greeting NoMethodError : undefined method `greeting ' for nil : NilClass
覚えておいた時刻に戻ります。
>> s.revert_to( tag ) >> root [ ' foo ' ] . greeting Hello ,
This is two Hello , This is one
今日はおしまい 。
みそは二つのテーブルです。 一つはオブジェクトのクラス名等を管理するmemory 、 もう一つはオブジェクトの属性を管理するpropです。
PRbはやりすぎた気がするのでその反動でシンプルになってます。

Angelo Mike noted a strange aspect of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 : before being broken , the students had made an exceptionally organized life for themselves — a cell of ordered liberty on so - called public property in a totalitarian society .
For a brief time , they lived and experienced the possibility of self - organized social order but failed to see the implications .
So it is whenever people are confronted with the need to make sense of government - owned space ( public property ) .
Without formal law or title , they assume a kind of ownership of the space through a form of homesteading .
Think of annual parades , gatherings before sports or music events , or any other place where the property is common in name only .
The same groups somehow manage to meet year after year in the same spot and hold it for themselves .
In practice , the space — limited by the uses to which its temporary owners put it — is treated as if it were owned by the individuals who use it .
Why is this ?
What does this imply for economics and politics ?
In the Lockeo - libertarian tradition , homesteading is a means to establish an initial claim to a scarce resource .
It consists of the exercise of purposeful action over nature .
The resource is usually land , but it can extend to bodies of water and also animals .
One of the rules of homesteading is that you have to mix your labor with the resource if you are going to claim to own it .
This is perfectly reasonable and intuitively correct .
Christopher Columbus can't show up to North America and declare that he owns it all anymore than the first settler in space can claim to own the galaxy .
The resource must be put to specific use by the claimant .
Today , we rarely see real homesteading in action because much of the land we see already has a legitimate owner .
But we do observe many types of informal homesteading , the practice of which underscores the universality of the idea of ownership .
Let us consider a common example : a day at the beach .
When people head to the beach , they bring chairs , set up umbrellas and roll out towels .
Once their things are in order they have effectively homesteaded that area of the beach for as long as they stay .
The area under their tutelage extends beyond the perimeter of their initial space .
Given cultural and density constraints , groups do not usually set up their belongings right next to one another .
Rather , some breathing space is left for personal comfort and to allow others to walk between groups .
So how much space is legitimate ?
Imagine you are standing at the check out lane at the grocery store and the person in front of you turns around and says , " By the way , I am holding 10 spaces behind me . "
The response would be :
The heck you do !
How about if you are searching for a seat at a theater and are told by one person that he is holding an entire row for some friends who are late ?
Or what if some guy wants to prevent people from parking in a lot because he says he is using every space when there are no cars there ?
In each case , we instinctively recognize the absurdity of those claims .
Homesteading stands on solid ground yet its practical application can often be a gray area .
The Case of Mardi Gras
The last weekend of Mardi Gras is well known for the influx of tourists .
Some might travel there to drink heavily , others to observe or participate in the debauchery , and others to enjoy the parades and admire the floats .
Whatever their reason for traveling to the Big Easy one thing is certain : it is crowded .
And since the parades roll down major avenues , the median ( called " neutral ground " by the locals ) gets packed with revelers and the problem of land scarcity is exacerbated .
There are tens of thousands of people competing for a relatively small amount of space .
To make things worse , many Mardi Gras enthusiasts , particularly the residents , often camp early and set aside space to watch the parades later , homesteading their spot .
Mardi Gras tradition has established that anyone who wants to reserve a space on a parade route must do so by setting down a useful and accepted carnival good .
Generally , people use tarps , chairs , ladders , grills , or coolers .
Let 's return to the hypothetical avaricious homesteader who wishes to claim large spaces for himself .
Suppose that he rolls out a piece of tarp that is 100 feet long and 20 feet wide .
Further , assume that he is alone .
Just as the farmer cannot simply claim he owns land that he himself has not used , our greedy parade watcher does not have a proper claim to the entire area under the large tarp .
What happens with bogus claims ?
Other groups of people would ( and do indeed ) see through the farce and call him on it .
They could very well order him to release most of the space he has falsely claimed as his own .
Other enforcement techniques could go further .
Competing groups could disregard the egregious exaggeration and simply use the wasted space .
It could very well come to the use of force .
But this would be rare , unnecessary , and counterproductive : a rogue homesteader would have to continually battle with everyone else .
These norms did not occur due to legislation or special mandate .
Over the years , people recognized the legitimacy of the first user , the homesteader .
Today , the preoccupation is no longer about whether one can homestead a piece of land to watch parades .
The worry is about getting there early to be the first one and enjoy the show .
The Case of Tailgating
Tailgating is the practice of gathering together with friends before a sports event to eat , drink , and talk until the game begins , and sometimes to watch the game on television if people find themselves too inebriated to walk to the sports ' event .
They sometimes arrive a day in advance , driving their travel trailers and preparing for the long haul .
Far from being a mere picnic , this is a huge institution with a tradition that dates far back .
Vast sums are spent on food , special clothing , decorations , electronic contraptions , transportation , special grills and refrigeration equipment — all in the interest of tailgating .
The tailgaters gather at spots public and private .
The private interests sell space to them for profit .
The public authorities permit them to homestead the space because they are pressured to do so by public opinion .
But it is far from being a free for all .
Tailgating groups constitute private clubs and they congregate in the same space week after week in the football season , and year after year , even for decades .
The groups manage themselves as clubs , with rules letting people in or out of the group .
Some are run like dictatorships and other like democracy , but , in each case , the members consent to the management structure .
The space they occupy is as large as necessary for the group , which usually consists of between five and thirty people .
Each group claims a space by putting up a tent , parking a trailer , or setting up a large screen television with chairs in front .
A claimant who insisted on possessing more than is necessary is quickly set straight by other would - be claimants of this scarce space .
There are enforcement mechanisms to keep people out .
Interlopers are scolded , shunned , and sometimes blasted with exhaust fumes and horn blasts .
In the culture of tailgating , people have a surprisingly certain sense of ownership , and even others are willing to assist in the enforcement of order lest their own homesteading assumptions come to be challenged .
Year after year , it comes to be known that certain allocations belong to certain tailgating groups .
Here is the Jones group .
There is the Smith group .
There is the Jefferson group .
Surprisingly , these homesteading rights are even transferable .
If one group falls apart or fails to come together one year , another would - be claimant is notified and given permission to use the space .
This pattern of ownership repeats itself over many acres and even miles of property , with lots of various sizes and shapes honeycombing all available space .
To watch a town be transformed in a matter of hours , from unoccupied to completely occupied , and do so in an orderly fashion , without any titles to property being issued , and conflict kept to a minimum , is a thing of enormous beauty , a testament to the capacity of people to organize themselves in the absence of central planner , formalized rules , formal title , or even the opportunity to trade their property at a profit .
So the Lockean rule about mixing one 's labor should conjure up no great controversy .
It is a principle that is practiced on a regular basis .
When public property is truly in demand , it is effectively privatized by the actions of individuals who understand that ownership precedes order .
And their claims , however temporary or intertemporally elaborate , are reasonable and enforced by widely accepted norms : what Rothbard called the Relevant Technological Unit , the size of which depends on the type of good or resource in question .
The reality of informal homesteading also illustrates that the concept of ownership is not something that must be imposed by the state or even law .
It is built into the very fabric of human action in a world of scarce resources , and it requires massive force to undo .
Conjure up visions of equality and collective sharing if you must but in the real world , property and ownership are part of the way we think , act , and get along in the world .
を読んでいろいろ考えた。
最近はてなブックマークとか見てて、優秀な人は自分がすごいことをやってるとか、努力してることに気づかないみたいな話がありましたね。例えば僕なんかはゲームがすごい好きで、ある程度つまらないゲームでも結構ずーっとやってられるみたいな感じがありますが。んなゲームするのが好きでどうすんだよ!
ってそういう話じゃなくて。この感覚をときどき、プログラミングをしてたりコンピュータを触ってるとき、新しい技術について調べてるときに感じることがあるよという話。
その一方で、読みづらくて分かりづらい本を読んだり、ひたすらバグを叩いてるときとか、同じプログラミングに関することでも気分が滅入るときはたくさんある。プログラマという職業を続けられるのは、プログラミングが好きだからと思う一方で、好きだからといっても意識して努力しないといけないときもあるし、それが辛いと思うときもある。好きなことだけやってればうまくいくっていうほど甘くはないというのがよくわかる瞬間です。
過去に、自分が頭の中で思い描いたものを思うように作れないことに気づいて、とにかくがむしゃらに勉強していた時期がありました。そのときは作りたい物が作れるようになりたいという気もちがかなり強かったんだけども、やっぱり勉強し続けるのはかなり苦しいこともあって。毎日会社が終わると近くの本屋に行って本を買って、喫茶店が閉店するまでこもって読書して、帰ってから仮眠をとって、夜中に起きて朝までプログラミングする。そんなことをずっと続けてた時期がありました。
上司との面談で 「プログラマはいらないんだよ、人を使って物を作れるやつが求められてる」みたいなことを言われたことがありました。でも自分は絶対それは違うと思っていて、自分の手で物を作れる人間じゃないと作れない物がたくさんあると思ってたのだけど、それを証明するだけの力量が自分にはなかった。だから必死で勉強した。いつかこいつらを見返してやるって思って勉強してたら、苦しいと思う気持ちもなんとか乗り越えられたように思います。
自分は、世の中を先回りできるかどうかとか、そのとき必要と思われる技術を勢い付けて身につけられるかどうかとかいうのは、こういう自分を突き動かすモチベーションみたいなのを強く持てないと難しいと経験的に思っている節があります。そしてそういうモチベーションの創出能力みたいなのは、先天的な適正とかにかなり依存してる感がある。だから、もしそういうアンテナの高さとかで自分の価値を出していきたいなら、それが好きかどうかを自問してみること。自問してみて、自分はそこまで好きじゃないと思ったら、無理にそれは追求しない方がいい。どうやってもあの人やあの人、あなたの頭の中にある理想像には追いつけない。
そして、重要なのは、そういう人だけが技術の世界の頂点ではないということをちゃんと認識できるかどうかです。
はてなのプログラマ。周りから見ると、みんながみんな新しい物好きで日々いろんなことを試しては嬉々としてそれをやってる風に見えるかもしれない。新しい物好きなのはそうだけれども、じゃあみんな新しいことばかりやってるかというと全くそんなことはない。そればっかりやってる人間みたいなのは僕を含め数人しかいない。他の人は他の人で全然タイプが違う。この辺は小野さんが前に風林火山で分類していたけどまったくその通りです。はてなのエンジニアがみんな火のエンジニアだったら、全然回らないんです。
プログラマは新しい技術に長けていることだけが価値じゃない。
大量に積もった細かいタスクを淡々とこなしていける並行処理能力をもったプログラマ。あるいは人が作ったものを丁寧に磨いていける能力を持ったプログラマ。そういう複数のカテゴリの人たちが一緒になって組織を作っていくのです。組織はお互いがお互いの仕事を尊敬しあってやっていないと、いずれ崩壊する。だから、僕はこの異なるタイプのエンジニアの能力というのをお互いがお互いに認識しあえるかどうかは非常に重要だと思っています。
また、そういう意味において、自分の得意な能力を使って仕事をしている、自分にはできないこと別の人がやっている、それをお互いが認識している場所を選べる/探せるかどうかがキャリアを磨く上で一番重要なのではないかと思うようになりました。
だから Ajax だ Web 2.0 だ、そういうのができる人材がいないとか言ってみんなが「そうだそうだ」なんていってる所はやっぱりろくなもんじゃない。浮かれた技術を取り入れたいと思う前に、ちゃんとそういう浮かれた事じゃないことをやってる人を評価するべし。そして、あなた方が欲しいと思っている技術者は、おそらくあなたの隣にいる。しかしあなたがそうじゃない技術者を正しく評価できない限り、あなたが欲しいと思っている技術者は、いつまでのあなたの目にはそういう技術者として写ることはないのです。
When David Kean got home from his shopping spree Sunday , he immediately went online .
“ Well , I spent 40 K today , ” wrote Kean , a real estate agent , in a post on the website LoftLA.com .
“ Expensive weekend . ”
Pricey jewelry ?
Luxury car ?
No , parking spaces .
Advertisement
Kean is a future resident of 1100 Wilshire , a swanky high - rise condo development downtown .
And for his $ 40,000 , he bought the right to park his Mercedes CLK coupe and Lincoln Aviator in two spaces on the sixth floor of his building .
Not long ago in car - friendly Los Angeles , free parking seemed like a birthright .
But the real estate boom has hit even the parking lot .
1100 Wilshire is selling parking spots for $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 a pop , offering new residents , who are paying $ 400,000 to $ 1 million for their units , the chance to wrap the cost of their spaces into their mortgages .

Such prices may have been standard in tony sections of New York , Boston and San Francisco , long known for their walk - able downtowns and elaborate public transportation systems .
But in Los Angeles -- home to some of the world ’s first parking garages as well as those sprawling postwar shopping mall parking lots -- the price tags are raising some eyebrows .
Real estate professionals said the setup seems unusual -- even along the canyon of high - rise condos in West Los Angeles .
Shel Kirschner , an agent with Coldwell Banker in West Los Angeles , said that he had n’t heard of selling parking spaces separately from condo units .
“ If you buy a unit in any of condos on the Westside , 90 % of the time , you do have assigned parking ” included with the purchase price , he said .
Donald Shoup , a professor of urban planning at UCLA , said the arrangement “ is bringing us more into line with what other big cities are doing . ”

By charging separately for parking , said Shoup , author of “ The High Cost of Free Parking , ” 1100 Wilshire in effect encourages use of public transportation by residents of the building , which is just a few blocks from a Metro subway stop .
“ Unbundling the parking gives people a new choice , ” said Shoup .
“ Maybe it will deter people who want to own three cars , and encourage people who own only one .
This is exactly the direction L.A. ought to be moving : People who use less parking pay less for housing . ”
In other cities , “ it would be unthinkable to have the parking thrown in for free .
It would turn it into L.A. ”
Residents of the 1100 building get two unassigned spaces with their purchase price , said Kevin Ratner , a senior vice president of Forest City Enterprises , which is developing the project .
Advertisement
But the building ’s design requires drivers to climb a four - story “ speed ramp ” before parking on the fifth through 16th floors .
The unassigned spaces are on the higher floors -- and just getting to them could be enough to induce acrophobia .
Hence the premium parking .
“ You can buy your way down in the building , ” said Ratner .
“ I would do it if I were buying there .
When you roll it into the mortgage , the monthly impact is comparable to what you would pay for parking .
And for resale , it ’s great . ”
While urban planners might hope the high prices will drive some residents to mass transit , early evidence suggests otherwise .
Advertisement
Developer Forest City rolled out the parking program just a few weeks ago , and the response has been positive , Ratner said .
“ You can buy more than two spaces ... you could have more than two cars .
It is a car - centric town , ” he said .
“ Maybe your husband has a couple of hot rods . ”
In downtown Los Angeles , where parking has long been at a premium , some say the 1100 Wilshire prices are just another necessary evil .
Many lots downtown charge $ 100 or more per month for parking .
Residents of the Higgins Building at 2nd and Main streets recently voted to charge themselves a condo fee of $ 65 a month to pay for a valet for themselves and their guests .
Kean , the 1100 Wilshire condo owner who purchased two spaces , said he is guaranteeing himself an easy ride home .
“ Otherwise , you come home late , and you have to circle up to the 11th floor ....
It ’s a mile up . ”
It is not news that the ethnic makeup of New York City is changing and has been for decades .
But the effects this has on the names of the city 's newborns can be dramatic , and surprising .
" When you look at the incredible diversity of the top of the New York naming list , " said Laura Wattenberg , author of " The Baby Name Wizard " ( Broadway Books , 2005 ) , " there are two different phenomena working together .
There is the rising diversity of the population and the willingness to use names from your ethnic background rather than adopting an Anglo name , which is a change from past generations .
At the same time , there is a fall of the usage of the Anglo - Christian classics . "
Names speak to parents ' aspirations for their children .
Everyone has one , and , of course , they are free , said Stanley Lieberson , a Harvard sociology professor who wrote " A Matter of Taste : How Names , Fashions and Culture Change " ( Yale , 2000 ) .
And because few special interest groups have anything to gain in baby name selection , " It 's clean from commercial influences and not simply a reflection of affluence , " Professor Lieberson said .
According to the names released yesterday , Michael and Emily still hang on to their top positions , with Daniel and Ashley close behind .
However , there were differences across groups , with Emily the most popular name among Asian - Americans , Ashley the top name for Hispanics , Kayla among blacks and Sarah for whites .
And , just for the record , there were 27 Katrinas born last year , placing the name out of the top 300 .
But look more deeply into the list , beyond the Top 10 , and the ebb and flow of changes over the years becomes more apparent .
Religion is far and away the biggest influence on names around the world .
Some of that is reflected in New York City , which attracts a wide cross section of Catholics , Jews , Muslims and Hindus , all of whom have strong religious naming traditions .
I neglected to mention that the Summer Solstice began the season of Discardia which will end with the new moon on the 29th .
Chris and I had been talking about doing a yard sale or a trip to the flea market , but we live on a very steep hill without enough foot traffic to make a yard sale successful and it seems that you ’re supposed to show up at the flea market at 5 a .m. so that ’s right out .
We ’d have to make a lot of money to make all that hassle worthwhile , so we ’ll try a less painful approach : the virtual yard sale .

BAGHDAD --
On a recent Sunday , I was buying groceries in my beloved Amariya neighborhood in western Baghdad when I heard the sound of an AK - 47 for about three seconds .
It was close but not very close , so I continued shopping .
As I took a right turn on Munadhama Street , I saw a man lying on the ground in a small pool of blood .
He was n’t dead .
Advertisement
The idea of stopping to help or to take him to a hospital crossed my mind , but I did n’t dare .
Cars passed without stopping .
Pedestrians and shop owners kept doing what they were doing , pretending nothing had happened .
I was still looking at the wounded man and blaming myself for not stopping to help .
Other shoppers peered at him from a distance , sorrowful and compassionate , but did nothing .
I went on to another grocery store , staying for about five minutes while shopping for tomatoes , onions and other vegetables .
During that time , the man managed to sit up and wave to passing cars .
No one stopped .
Then , a white Volkswagen pulled up .
A passenger stepped out with a gun , walked steadily to the wounded man and shot him three times .
The car took off down a side road and vanished .
No one did anything .
No one lifted a finger .
The only reaction came from a woman in the grocery store .
In a low voice , she said , “ My God , bless his soul . ”

I went home and did n’t dare tell my wife .
I did not want to frighten her .

I ’ve lived in my neighborhood for 25 years .
My daughters went to kindergarten and elementary school here .
I ’m a Christian .
My neighbors are mostly Sunni Arabs .
We had always lived in harmony .
Before the U.S. - led invasion , we would visit for tea and a chat .
On summer afternoons , we would meet on the corner to joke and talk politics .
It used to be a nice upper - middle - class neighborhood , bustling with commerce and traffic .
On the main street , ice cream parlors , hamburger stands and take - away restaurants competed for space .
We would rent videos and buy household appliances .
Advertisement
Until 2005 , we were mostly unaffected by violence .
We would hear shootings and explosions now and again , but compared with other places in Baghdad , it was relatively peaceful .
Then , late in 2005 , someone blew up three supermarkets in the area .
Shops started closing .
Most of the small number of Shiite Muslim families moved out .
The commercial street became a ghost road .
On Christmas Day last year , we visited -- as always -- our local church , St. Thomas , in Mansour .
It was half - empty .
Some members of the congregation had left the country ; others feared coming to church after a series of attacks against Christians .
American troops , who patrol the neighborhood in Humvees , have also become edgy .
Get too close , and they ’ll shoot .
A colleague -- an interpreter and physician -- was shot and killed by soldiers last year on his way home from a shopping trip .
He had n’t noticed the Humvees parked on the street .

By early this year , living in my neighborhood had become a nightmare .
In addition to anti-American graffiti , there were fliers telling women to wear conservative clothes and to cover their hair .
Men were told not to wear shorts or jeans .
For me , as a Christian , it was unacceptable that someone would tell my wife and daughters what to wear .
What ’s the use of freedom if someone is telling you what to wear , how to behave or what to do in your life ?
But coming home one day , I saw my wife on the street .
I did n’t recognize her .
She had covered up .

After the attack on the Shiite shrine of the Golden Dome in Samarra in February , Shiite gunmen tried to raid Sunni mosques in my neighborhood .
One night , against the backdrop of heavy shooting , we heard the cleric calling for help through the mosque ’s loudspeakers .
We stayed up all night , listening as they battled for the mosque .
It made me feel unsafe .
If a Muslim would shoot another Muslim , what would they do to a Christian ?
Fear dictates everything we do .
I see my neighbors less and less .
When I go out , I say hello and that ’s it .
I fear someone will ask questions about my job working for Americans , which could put me in danger .
Even if he had no ill will toward me , he might talk and reveal an identifying detail .
We ’re afraid of an enemy among us .
Someone we do n’t know .
It ’s a cancer .
In March , assassinations started in our neighborhood .
Early one evening , I was sitting in my garden with my wife when we heard several gunshots .
I rushed to the gate to see what was going on , despite my wife ’s pleas to stay inside .
My neighbors told me that gunmen had dropped three men from a car and shot them in the street before driving off .
No one dared approach the victims to find out who they were .
Advertisement
The bodies remained there until the next morning .
The police or the American military probably picked them up , but I do n’t know .
They simply disappeared .
The sounds of shootings and explosions are now commonplace .
We do n’t know who is shooting whom , or who has been targeted .
We do n’t know why , and we ’re afraid to ask or help .
We too could get shot .
Bringing someone to the hospital or to the police is out of the question .
Nobody trusts the police , and nobody wants to answer questions .
I feel sad , bitter and frustrated -- sad because a human life is now worth nothing in this country ; bitter because people no longer help each other ; and frustrated because I can’t help either .
If I ’m targeted one day , I ’m sure no one will help me .

I was very happy when my eldest daughter married an American .
First , because there was love between them , but also because she would be able to leave Iraq , and I would n’t have to worry about her safety day after day .
She left last year .
If you had asked me a year ago whether I would consider leaving Iraq , I would have said maybe , but without enthusiasm .
Now it ’s a definite yes .
Things are going from bad to worse , and I ca n’t see any light at the end of the tunnel .
Four weeks ago , I came home from work .
As I reached my street , I saw a man lying in a pool of blood .
Someone had covered him with bits of cardboard .
This was the best they could do .
No one dared move him .
I drove on .

Bill O'Reilly slanders 82nd Airborne
So why did Bill O'Reilly slander these men ?
Fox and O'Reilly : 82nd like Nazis
by miholo [ Subscribe ] From Crooks and Liars .
There was an exchange on Fox News last night between Bill O'Reilly and Wes Clark .
The issue was the release of further Abu Ghraib pictures and video .
O'Reilly was incensed that it " puts our troops at risk " .
Clark responded that what 's putting the troops at risk is the chain of command letting , or even making , this happen in the first place .
O'Lielly was saying that it happens just like this in every war , with Clark rebutting that those were isolated incidents which were court - martialed .
And then , this :
Clark :
And let me explain something .
You go all the way up the chain of command ...
And let me explain something .
You go all the way up the chain of command ...
O'Reilly : General !
You need to look at the Malmedy massacre in World War Two , and the 82nd Airborne who did it !
Video of the exchange here .
The Malmedy massacre ?
Well , about that on the flip ...
From the Wikipedia :
On December 17 , 1944 , near the hamlet of Baugnez on the height half - way between the town of Malmédy and Ligneuville in Belgium , elements of Waffen - SS Kampfgruppe Peiper encountered the American 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion .
After a brief battle , the Americans surrendered .
About 150 of the prisoners of war were disarmed and sent to stand in a field near the crossroads .
Peiper and his leading armoured units then continued their advance .

About 150 of the prisoners of war were disarmed and sent to stand in a field near the crossroads .
Peiper and his leading armoured units then continued their advance .
A tank pulled up , and a truck shortly thereafter .
A single SS officer pulled out a pistol and shot a medical officer standing in the front row , and then shot the man standing next to the medical officer .
Other soldiers joined in with machine guns .
It is not known why this happened ; there is no record of an order by an SS officer .
While the shooting of POWs was common on the Eastern front , such incidents were rare on the Western front .
Another good account : History Net ( w/ thanks to AaronBa ) .
Why do Bill O'Reilly and Fox News believe that American troops used to behave , and ought to behave now , like Nazis ?
Well , it 's nice to see him pick up where Joe McCarthy left off up .
But somehow she neglects to mention McCarthy 's first moment in the national spotlight .
That was his infamous 1949 campaign on behalf of Nazi S.S. officers who were convicted of war crimes for the massacre of American troops in the town of Malmedy during the Battle of the Bulge .
On their orders , 83 American prisoners of war had been murdered by Waffen S.S. machine - gunners .
The S.S. officers were sentenced to death , but McCarthy insisted that the entire case was a frame - up , with confessions obtained by horrific torture .
He intervened in Senate hearings on the case and lied repeatedly during his defense of the Nazi murderers .
His most spectacular claim was that the American investigators had crushed the testicles of German prisoners as an interrogation technique .
McCarthy was later shown to have served as the pawn of neo -Nazi and communist provocateurs who were using the Malmedy case to whip up anti-American sentiment in postwar Germany .
The main source for his false charges concerning Malmedy was a Germany lawyer named Rudolf Aschenauer , whose closest ties were to the postwar Nazi underground and to American right - wing isolationists , but who has also been identified as a communist agent .
Aschenauer testified at U.S. Senate hearings in Germany that he had passed information about Malmedy to McCarthy .
The S.S. officers were guilty , as the Senate report confirmed -- although most of them later got their death sentences commuted in a gesture to former Nazi officials who aided the West in the Cold War .
But McCarthy had succeeded in his larger purpose , winning publicity for himself and casting a negative light on the war - crimes trials .
By Coulter 's loose definition , his involvement in the Malmedy incident proves that McCarthy was a " traitor . "
He lied publicly to advance totalitarian forces in Europe against American interests .
He sided with enemy forces against American soldiers .
He falsely accused American officials of crimes .
Moreover , he took up this tainted cause at least in part because of heavy financial support from an ultra- right - wing German - American businessman in Wisconsin .
He managed to help both Nazis and communists at once , a feat rarely seen since the end of the Hitler - Stalin pact
Yeah , I wrote about this on Kos two years ago .
Oddly enough , Mr. O'Reilly , in his current attack on blogs and our " secret agenda " , slandered 6,993 wounded and 1,509 dead .
You know , in all my reading of WWII and the Battle of the Bulge , I never read about how the 82nd ABN killed Americans in combat .
I mean , O'Reilly went to graduate school .
He could have searched the internet for the relevant facts .
But no , why not slander American soldiers instead .
I think if this was in the same room , Clark would have strangled him with his bare hands .
Just amazing .

In Quality Software Management : Systems Thinking , Gerald Weinberg proposed a rule of thumb to calculate the waste caused by project switching :
Even adding a single project to your workload is profoundly debilitating by Weinberg 's calculation .
You lose 20 % of your time .
By the time you add a third project to the mix , nearly half your time is wasted in task switching .
This can be a problem even if you 're only working on a single project at any time .
The impact of simply letting your email , phone , and instant messaging interrupt what you 're doing can be profound , as documented in this BBC study :
The study , carried out at the Institute of Psychiatry , found excessive use of technology reduced workers ' intelligence .
Those distracted by incoming email and phone calls saw a 10 - point fall in their IQ - more than twice that found in studies of the impact of smoking marijuana , said researchers .
Kathy Sierra wrote a great post comparing multi-tasking and serial tasks and followed it up a year later with a typically insightful post proposing that multi-tasking makes us stupid :
Perhaps the biggest problem of all , though , is that the majority of people doing the most media multitasking have a big-ass blind spot on just how much they suck at it .
We believe we can e-mail and talk on the phone at the same time , with little or no degradation of either communication .
We believe we can do homework while watching a movie .
We believe we can surf the web while talking to our kids / spouse / lover / co-worker .
But we can 't !
Not without a hit on every level – time , quality , and the ability to think deeply .
Joel Spolsky compares the task switching penalty for computers and computer programmers :
The trick here is that when you manage programmers , specifically , task switches take a really , really , really long time .
That 's because programming is the kind of task where you have to keep a lot of things in your head at once .
The more things you remember at once , the more productive you are at programming .
A programmer coding at full throttle is keeping zillions of things in their head at once : everything from names of variables , data structures , important APIs , the names of utility functions that they wrote and call a lot , even the name of the subdirectory where they store their source code .
If you send that programmer to Crete for a three week vacation , they will forget it all .
The human brain seems to move it out of short - term RAM and swaps it out onto a backup tape where it takes forever to retrieve .
I 've often pushed back on demands to work on multiple projects at the same time .
It can be difficult to say no , because software developers are notoriously prone to the occupational hazard of optimism .
We typically overestimate how much we 'll actually get done , and multi-tasking exaggerates our own internal biases even more .
Whenever possible , avoid interruptions and avoid working on more than one project at the same time .
If it 's unavoidable , be brutally honest with yourself – and your stakeholders – about how much you can actually get done under multi-tasking conditions .
It 's probably less than you think .
All Things Pythonic
Language Design Is Not Just Solving Puzzles
by Guido van van Rossum
February 10 , 2006
Summary
An incident on python - dev today made me appreciate ( again ) that there 's more to language design than puzzle - solving .
A ramble on the nature of Pythonicity , culminating in a comparison of language design to user interface design .
Advertisement
Some people seem to think that language design is just like solving a puzzle .
Given a set of requirements they systematically search the solution space for a match , and when they find one , they claim to have the perfect language feature , as if they 've solved a Sudoku puzzle .
For example , today someone claimed to have solved the problem of the multi-statement lambda .
But such solutions often lack " Pythonicity " -- that elusive trait of a good Python feature .
It 's impossible to express Pythonicity as a hard constraint .
Even the Zen of Python does n't translate into a simple test of Pythonicity .
In the example above , it 's easy to find the Achilles heel of the proposed solution : the double colon , while indeed syntactically unambiguous ( one of the " puzzle constraints " ) , is completely arbitrary and does n't resemble anything else in Python .
A double colon occurs in one other place , but there it's part of the slice syntax , where a [ : :] is simply a degenerate case of the extended slice notation a[ start : stop: step ] with start , stop and step all omitted .
But that 's not analogous at all to the proposal 's lambda < args > ::< suite > .
There 's also no analogy to the use of :: in other languages -- in C++ ( and Perl ) it 's a scoping operator .
And still that 's not why I rejected this proposal .
If the double colon is unpythonic , perhaps a solution could be found that uses a single colon and is still backwards compatible ( the other big constraint looming big for Pythonic Puzzle solvers ) .
I actually have one in mind : if there 's text after the colon , it 's a backwards - compatible expression lambda ; if there 's a newline , it 's a multi- line lambda ; the rest of the proposal can remain unchanged .
Presto , QED , voila , etcetera .
But I 'm rejecting that too , because in the end ( and this is where I admit to unintentionally misleading the submitter ) I find any solution unacceptable that embeds an indentation - based block in the middle of an expression .
Since I find alternative syntax for statement grouping ( e.g. braces or begin / end keywords ) equally unacceptable , this pretty much makes a multi-line lambda an unsolvable puzzle .
And I like it that way !
In a sense , the reason I went to considerable length describing the problems of embedding an indented block in an expression ( thereby accidentally laying the bait ) was that I wanted to convey the sense that the problem was unsolvable .
I should have known my geek audience better and expected someone to solve it . :-)
The unspoken , right brain constraint here is that the complexity introduced by a solution to a design problem must be somehow proportional to the problem 's importance .
In my mind , the inability of lambda to contain a print statement or a while - loop etc. is only a minor flaw ; after all instead of a lambda you can just use a named function nested in the current scope .
But the complexity of any proposed solution for this puzzle is immense , to me : it requires the parser ( or more precisely , the lexer ) to be able to switch back and forth between indent - sensitive and indent - insensitive modes , keeping a stack of previous modes and indentation level .
Technically that can all be solved ( there 's already a stack of indentation levels that could be generalized ) .
But none of that takes away my gut feeling that it is all an elaborate Rube Goldberg contraption .
Mathematicians do n't mind these -- a proof is a proof is a proof , no matter whether it contains 2 or 2000 steps , or requires an infinite - dimensional space to prove something about integers .
Sometimes , the software equivalent is acceptable as well , based on the theory that the end justifies the means .
Some of Google 's amazing accomplishments have this nature inside , even though we do our very best to make it appear simple .
And there 's the rub : there 's no way to make a Rube Goldberg language feature appear simple .
Features of a programming language , whether syntactic or semantic , are all part of the language 's user interface .
And a user interface can handle only so much complexity or it becomes unusable .
This is also the reason why Python will never have continuations , and even why I 'm uninterested in optimizing tail recursion .
But that 's for another installment .

Now is a good time to mention “ word wars ” .
Word wars are useful tools during the frantic month of November , when 1600 + words a day are required and time , family demands , and everything else collide .
Set a timer for 5 , 15 , or 30 minutes , challenge someone else , and see how many words you can get written .
Leave everything behind – grammar , punctuation , spelling , perhaps coherent sentence structure – but get that wordcount .
The section below is from one of many word wars .
Because of that , even though I ’ve done some basic editing , it is a little confusing .
Hopefully you can still enjoy :
As tension was rising within the group , they nearly encountered [ BC1 ] another Deeper traveling school .
They scrambled to change direction , but the Deeper community seemed almost to follow them .
They swam rapidly , trying to stay ahead of the quick - moving Deepers and the accompanying Shallower school above .
As they moved off towards one side , they found another , larger shallower school , with no real place to squeeze between .
Frustrated the four swam forward as quickly as they could , gaining a little ground ahead of the shallower farm .
But as they raced ahead , looking for a way to get off to the side before the ridge which was rapidly approaching , a ship and group of enforcers appeared on the horizon .
Alex frantically looked for options as they stopped .
Behind them the shallower school continued approaching , to the north [ BC2 ] a larger school .
Underneath both , a farily [ BC3 ] large Deeper community .
In front of them to the south , the Ridge , which would force the Deepers up and leave them very little room for even possible hiding [ BC4 ] .
And passing directly in front and headed towards them from the east , the group of enforcers .
There was little time ofr [ BC5 ] arguing , though each of them suggested a different tack .
We ’ll split up [ BC6 ]
Alex decided .
“ Gooshan and Xero , to the south , try as hard as you can to get past the school .
If you have to go over the ridge , try to make it through or find a group to blend in with if possible .
Good luck , we ’ll meet you on the shelf .
Muuld , come with me , we ’re going to try and go under the enforcers but stay out from under eth [ BC7 ] ship if possible .
We ’ll be pusing [ BC8 ] our depth but hsould [ BC9 ] be able to make it .
Everyone stay calm as you can , if you get found sing the slave song as we ’ve discussed before and mimic the controlled fear of those belonging to a Deeper group already – afraid only of your owner deepers and not those approaching .
I pray for the best and hope to see you in a few days . ”
No one noticed Daire was gone , nor had thoughts for him now [ BC10 ] .
He was n’t going to save them , not that they trusted him enough for that anyway .
Xero and Gooshan did as Alex suggested , and took off on a south - east tangent , swimming as fast as the possibly could , trying to escape detection and make it around – or under – the shallower school while escaping Deeper notice [ BC11 ] .
They kept being forced to change course east to avoid getting too close .
Just as they seemed to make it south enough of the school , the ground underneath rose forming the ridge , and the Deepers began coming to ttheir [ BC12 ] depth .
There was no room to get further out of the way – they were trapped .

Ah , and here it gets very intense .
The rest of this chapter , and on into the following chapter , is packed to the gills ( haha ) with ….
Well , I wo n’t spoil it for you .
It has been fun to write , though sad in parts .
I will say shortly after this word war I realized that I ’m going to completely change how the groups split up , and in fact mid-way through the chapter I just changed who was where , magically , with no explanation .
My poor proofreaders !
Anyway , this section has a lot of room for improvement on the re-write .
I hope you ’ve enjoyed .
If you would like more excerpts , please let me know .
I ’m drawing near the end of the first draft now , and anxious to be done .
（ Unicode仕様 書 V4.0 Fig.11 - 3 p.299 より引用）
ここに、X軸はセマンティック（意味または機能）、Y軸は抽象的形状、Z軸はタイプフェース（書体）とされています。
この概念モデルに基づいて、日本、中国、韓国などの漢字をひとつにまとめたと説明しています。しかし、Unicodeの仕様書を読んでも、どうも統合にあたってのセマンティック軸の扱いが明確になっていません。そこで、この部分を私なりに検討してみました。
■仕様 書V2.0では次のように書かれています。
Only characters that have the same abstract shape ( that is , occupy a single point on the X and Y axes ) are potential candidates for unification .
Z axis typeface and semantic differences are generally ignored .
（ Unicode V2.0 仕様書 p. 6-108、下から10行目～8行目）
※アンダーラインは私が付けました。以下、同じです。
3次元概念モデルでは、Y軸上で同じ位置の漢字が同じ抽象的な形状となります。抽象的形状が同じものをまとめるということは、Z軸とX軸を無視することになります。ですので上の文章は正しくありません。私の考えでは、正しくは次の文章になるはずです。
Only characters that have the same abstract shape ( that is , occupy a single point on the Y axis ) are potential candidates for unification .
Z axis typeface and X axis semantic differences are generally ignored .
上の図の例で、セマンティックを無視すれば、 と は統合され、ひとつのコードポイントが与えられます。
※ちなみに、この二つは字形が同じで意味が違う例として、
は ” 機械 ” を意味し、 は、 ” 机 ” を意味すると説明されています 。
■ところが、V3.0仕様書から以降、この部分が次のように訂正されています。
Only characters that have the same abstract shape ( that is , occupy a single point on the X and Y axes ) are potential candidates for unification .
Z axis typeface and stylistic differences are generally ignored .
( 直訳）
同じ抽象的形状をもつ文字（すなわち、XとY軸の上でひとつの点を占める）のみが統合化の潜在的候補となる。Z軸のタイプフェースとスタイルの違いは一般に無視する。
この新しい説明では、セマンティック（semantic）がスタイル（stylistic）に代わってしまいました。そして、無視されるのはZ軸（タイプフェースとスタイル）のみとされています。
セマンティックの扱いは明確に書かれていません。しかし、X及びY軸で同じ位置にあるものが抽象的形状が同じ、と言っているわけですから、セマンティックが抽象的形状の一要因になったということに等しいわけです。言い換えると
セマンティックが違えば抽象的形状が違うとみなす
、と暗黙に示したことになります。
このあたり、3次元(立体）で考えるのは難しいので、わかり易くするため、2つの軸、X軸×Y軸を1次元に展開して、図を書き直すと次のようになります。
※この2次元の図は私が作りましたが、上の3次元の図と同等なはずです。
V3.0以降の仕様書では、この図でZ軸のみが無視されると言っています。ですので、 と は別のコードポイントが与えられることになります。
言い換えると、V3.0以降では同じ抽象的形状でもセマンティックが異なれば統合の候補にならない。抽象的形状とセマンティックが共に同じ漢字のみが統合の候補になると変更したことになります。
※しかし、仕様書には、統合ルールは、原規格分離規則以外は、変更してないとも書いてあります。従って、仕様書の説明に矛盾を含んでいます。
X軸、すなわちセマンティックについて考えて見ます。同じ字形の漢字でも言語によって意味が変わったり、新しい意味が付加されたりすることが多く、言語の違いがセマンティックに重要な影響を及ぼすのは明らかです。従って、字形が同じでもセマンティックが違えば別のコードポイントを与えるとなると、中国語、日本語、韓国語、ベトナム語という異なる言語の中で出現する漢字を字形で統合するのは至難になります。乱暴に言えば、セマンティックを無視しなければ、CJKVの漢字統合はできないのではないでしょうか。
結局、概念モデルではセマンティックを無視しないと言い、実際の作業はセマンティックを無視して漢字統合したということで、示した理論と実際にやったことが矛盾してしまったように思います。
V1.0でCJK漢字を統合すると言いながら、原規格分離規則によって、これを徹底できずにV3.0では原規格分離規則を廃止したというように、漢字統合ルールも振れています。
昨日 、Unicodeの漢字統合は破綻してしまったと言いましたが、その原因を辿っていけば、ルールの基になる概念＝3次元概念モデルが曖昧だったためではないでしょうか？
20世紀最大の偉業のはずなんですが。残念。漢字統合は、21世紀にもう一度やり直しが必要なんでしょうね。

BIG NAMES SLAMMING ISRAELI LOBBY LEADING U.S. ACADEMICS SAY ISRAEL A LIABILITY  FOR U.S. By Michael Collins Piper
It s received little attention among Americans who dont follow public affairs and its not been widely mentioned in the media across the country , at least thus far but among informed folks who closely follow the intrigues of the Israeli lobby , the release of a new report critical of Israel and its lobby has been the most talked - about subject of recent days .
Two of the most distinguished foreign policy specialists in the American academic world John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago and Stephen Walt of Harvard have released a paper , entitled  The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy  that has some less than favorable things to say about Israel and the U.S. relationship with that tiny , yet powerful , foreign nation .
The 83 - page paper , which includes some 40 pages of detailed footnotes , was first published on the Internet , but a pared - down rendition of the paper was published on March 23 in The London Review of Books .
The article can be found on the internet at www.ssrn.com or at Harvards official web site , www.ksg.Harvard.edu/research/working_papers/index.htm.*
Ironically , as the New York - based newspaper , Forward , put it on March 24 , theres little that s new in the report .
Anyone who has been a reader of American Free Press or who , going back to the 1960s and 1970s , read other populist publications like Liberty Letter or The Spotlight knows whats now being reported by the two academics .
Although Americas mainstream media always portrayed Israel in the fondest light , free thinkers raised uncomfortable questions that suggested the truth might be different .
Such critics of the U.S. - Israel axis were called anti-Semites ,  and neo - Nazis and haters . 
Worldwide , in contrast , Israel and its American lobby have not been held in such esteem .
In 2002 , for example , South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu , whountil then was an icon of the American press , shocked many when he asserted that in the United States  the Israeli government is placed
on a pedestal ,  because , Tutu said ,  the Jewish lobby is powerfulvery powerful . 
Now Meirsheimer and Walt have stepped up to echo what critics of Israel have been saying for years .
However , what is disturbing to pro-Israel forces is that the academics , as Forward put it , cant be dismissed as cranks outside the mainstream . 
As the Jewish weekly put it :  They are the mainstream . 
Walt has not only been a Harvard professor , but hes also the outgoing academic dean of the universitys John F. Kennedy
In the wake of the firestorm directed at Harvard , the professors removed the Kennedy School logo from the paper on the Internet .
Despite this , as the papers critics have noted , the genie is out of the bottle and copies of the paper have been flying across the globe via email .
As a result , a lot of people who previously were told that criticism of Israel was the work of haters  and extremists  are learning that two of the most respected American foreign affairs specialists are saying some tough things about Israel , its Washington lobby and the dangers of the lobbys influence on U.S. foreign policy making .
On March 25 , the fiercely pro-Israel  Editorial Board column of The Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) took the professors to task but accurately noted that :
[ The premise of Mearsheimer and Walt ] is that Israel is a huge strategic liability for the U.S. which wrecks our reputation in the Arab world , complicates our diplomacy at the UN , inspires Islamic fanaticism and terror , goads us into misbegotten wars and makes us complicit in Israeli human rights abuses , all the while costing some $ 3 billion a year .
Although the WSJ asserted Mearsheimer and Walt are not necessarily anti-Semitic ,  their paper is anti-Semitic in effect . 
Meanwhile , pro-Israel elements are touting the claim by another Harvard professor , pro-Israel agitator Alan Dershowitz , that the two largely relied on material on neo - Nazi and anti-Semitic web sites as their sources .
Dershowitz is not telling the truth .
The most cursory examination of the citations used by the duo demonstrates they used thoroughly mainstream sources as documentation .
The Washington Post , The New York Times , Israels Haaretz , the New York - based Jewish Week , and the aforementioned Forward were prominent among the sources .
In the meantime , on March 26 , The New York Daily News , owned by Mort Zuckerman , former chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations a major force in the Israeli lobby featured a commentarymaking the claim that there is no Israel lobby . 
Zuckermans tabloid repeated the old saw that Congress and American presidents have been friends of Israel out of humanitarian concerns and that the policies have nothing to do with any powerful lobby . 
However , that claim is refuted in the very first footnote in the Mearsheimer - Walt report , which says :  The mere existence of the lobby suggests that unconditional support for Israel is not in the American national interests .
If it was , one would not need an organized special interest group to bring it about .
But because Israel is a strategic and moral liability , it takes relentless political pressure to keep U.S. support intact . 
And so it is .

Yoo publicly debated last month the radical notion of the " unitary executive " - that the president , as commander - in - chief , is sole judge of the law , unbound by hindrances such as the Geneva conventions , and has inherent authority to subordinate independent government agencies to his fiat .
This is the cornerstone of the Bush legal doctrine .
Yoo 's interlocutor , Douglass Cassel , a professor at the Notre Dame law school , pointed out that the theory of the unitary executive posits the president above other branches of government : " Also no law by Congress .
That is what you wrote in the August 2002 memo . "
" I think it depends on why the president thinks he needs to do that , " said Yoo .
The " unitary executive " is nothing less than " gospel " , declared the federal judge Samuel Alito in 2000 - it is a theory that " best captures the meaning of the constitution 's text and structure " .
Alito 's belief was perhaps the paramount credential for his nomination by Bush to the supreme court .
Alito 's manner before the Senate judiciary committee 's hearings has been prosaic and dutiful .
He seems like an understudy for the part of Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman .
But behind the facade of the supplicant who wants to be liked seethes a man out to settle a score .
Few public figures since Nixon have worn their resentment so obviously as Alito .
The son of a civil servant , he attended Princeton and Yale law school .
" Both opened up new worlds of ideas , " he testified .
" But this was in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
It was a time of turmoil at colleges and universities .
And I saw some very smart and privileged people behaving irresponsibly . "
In his application to the Reagan justice department , Alito wrote that his interest in constitutional law was " motivated in large part by disagreement with Warren court decisions ... particularly in the area ... of reapportionment " - which established the principle of one person , one vote .
Alito 's law career has been a long effort to reverse the liberalism of the Warren supreme court .
In the Reagan justice department , he argued that the federal government had no responsibility for the " health , safety and welfare " of Americans ( a view rejected by Reagan ) ; that " the constitution does not protect the right to an abortion " ; that the executive should be immune from liability for illegal domestic wiretapping ; that illegal immigrants have no " fundamental rights " ; that police had a right to kill an unarmed 15 - year - old accused of stealing $ 10 ( a view rejected by the supreme court and every police group that filed in the case ) ; and that it should be legal to fire , and exclude from funded federal programmes , people with Aids , because of " fear of contagion ... reasonable or not " .
Against the majority of his court and six other federal courts , he argued that federal regulation of machine guns was unconstitutional .
He approved the strip search of a mother and her daughter although they were not named in a warrant , a decision denounced by fellow judge Michael Chertoff , now secretary of homeland security .
And Alito backed a law requiring women to tell husbands if they want an abortion , which was overturned by the supreme court on the vote of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor ,
On the supreme court , as O'Connor 's replacement , he will codify the authoritarianism of the Bush presidency , even after it is gone .

CDDB : Feel the Pain
© 2003 Jamie Zawinski < jwz@jwz.org >
In case you did n't know , the file format that CDDB ( and FreeDB ) use is complete garbage .
In addition to random idiotic crap like it being impossible to unambiguously represent a song title that has a slash in it , it 's rocket science to figure out how long a song is supposed to be .
I need this info not only to display it in Gronk ( my MP3 jukebox software ) , but also for some error - checking that my CD - ripping scripts do , so that I do n't end up with truncated files if there was a crash or a full disk or something .
So get this .
CDDB files contain junk like this :
# Track frame offsets : # 150 # 18265 # 32945 # 49812 ... # Disc length : 3603 seconds # DISCID =... DTITLE =... ( You 'd think that the fact that it's in a comment would mean something , but no : you have to parse both comments and non-comments , begging the question of what they thought " comment " means . )
Those numbers are the starting sectors of each track on the disc .
There are 75 sectors per second .
So you convert those to seconds by dividing , and then find the length of each track by subtracting each from the previous .
Oh , but wait , they do n't give you the sector address of the end of the last track : for that one , it 's expressed in seconds instead of sectors , for no sensible reason .
Still , the info is there , right ?
Uh , almost .
It turns out that if the last track on a CD is a data track ( an ISO9660 file system ) then there is a gap between the last track ( the data track ) and the second - to - last track ( the last audio track . )
This gap is exactly 11400 sectors ( 152 seconds , 2:32 . )
On some discs , you can actually see this track , it 's a differently - shiny ring .
Why 's it there ?
I do n't know .
Why 's it that size ?
I do n't know .
What if the data track is not the last track on the CD ?
( Does that even work ? ) I do n't know .
So what this means is , when computing the length that a track should be , you have to subtract 152 seconds from the length of the second - to - last track , only if the last track is a data track .
How do you tell whether the last track is a data track , without having the CD in question physically in your computer ?
By hoping that the CDDB file contains the words " data track " in the title of that track , I guess .
Yeah , that 's reliable .
And , just to keep things interesting , it turns out that older versions of grip and cdparanoia did n't skip over this gap when ripping : instead , they would append 152 seconds of silence onto the end of the second - to - last track .
So now my script that sanity - checks the lengths of the files has to consider two different lengths to be " right " , since I now have CDs that were ripped both ways .
Whee .
I love love love supporting standards invented by 12 - year - olds .
Of course the reason that I use CDDB files at all in Gronk is because of the mind - blowing worthlessness of ID3 tags ( 32 character limits on titles , etc. )
Yay more standards invented by 12 - year - olds .
( Please do n't even mention ID3 v2 or Ogg .
I laugh at you , you silly person .
Those are universally - unsupported fantasies that simply trade one set of problems for a whole new set of problems . )
And as if CDDB was n't bad enough , FreeDB has taken the CDDB braindeadness and layered even more braindeadness on top of it : it is truly a thing of wonder .
For example , go ahead and try to ever have the " genre " field be something approaching reality -- oops !
The first person who ripped this CD said it was " folk " because that 's genre number zero !
So fix it and resubmit it to the database ?
Sorry !
You can't ever change the genre of an entry in the database after creation , since the genre dictates what directory the file goes in on their server .
And so on .
It 's a wonder anything works at all .

Environment Correspondent , BBC News website , Darwin
The data is described as " very worrying "
In a decade the average size recorded by observers has shrunk from 7 m to 5m .
Whale sharks , the world 's largest fish , are caught for food in some east Asian countries and Australian researchers suspect this is causing a decline .
The fish is listed as " vulnerable " , and one of the authors of the new study has described the new finding as " a very worrying sign " .
The data comes from ecotourism companies which run expeditions to watch whale sharks and swim with them in Ningaloo Marine Park off the north - west coast .
" The eco -tourism industry logs the position and size and sex of every shark it swims with , " said Mark Meekan , of the Australian Institute of Marine Science ( Aims ) .
" We have obtained those datasets and analysed them over time , " he told the BBC News website , " and essentially what we have seen in the last decade is a decline in average size of shark from 7 m to 5 m .
" Now , if you consider that the sharks probably are n't sexually reproductive or mature until they 're 6 or 7 m long - that 's a very worrying sign . "
Looking for options
Whale sharks ( Rhincodon typus ) are filter feeders , eating small marine organisms such as krill .
They can live for up to 150 years , attaining lengths of more than 15 m , and are believed to reach sexual maturity around the age of 30 .
The fish are placid filter - feeders
" Whale sharks , like many other shark species , are highly vulnerable to over - exploitation due to their long lifespan and low reproductive rate , " commented Callum Roberts , of York University in the UK , who has researched whale sharks extensively in the Caribbean .
" They have been added to CITES ' list of species threatened by international trade , " he told the BBC News website , " but this will not protect them if they are caught by , for example , Taiwanese vessels and then consumed in Taiwan .
" So whale sharks are at risk , and the decline in size might be due to capture of large sharks . "
There are also indications that the number of sharks visiting Australian waters may be decreasing , which would be additional evidence for a decline prompted by over - fishing .
Playing tag
Aims researchers are running a tagging programme in an attempt to plot whale shark migration routes between Australia , Asia and the eastern coast of Africa .
Specimens tagged in Australia have swum to Asian waters ; last month a tag transmitted for days from the same location in Indonesia , apparently on land , leading researchers to suspect that the shark had been caught and the tag removed .
Either the meat is eaten , or the giant fins used as advertising boards for restaurants serving shark fin soup ; livers are used for oil , and cartilage in traditional Chinese medicine .
Finding migration routes could help pinpoint areas where they are being caught .
" Many of the people doing the fishing are just local villagers with no other option , " said Mark Meekan .
" If we know who they are , we can give them another option , and that option is very lucrative ; the ecotourism industry in Ningaloo generates AU$ 70 m ( £ 28 m ; US$ 50 m ) a year , enough to support an entire town . "
Longer term objectives of the Aims programme include finding out more about the life cycle of the whale shark .
The biggest mystery concerns breeding and reproduction ; males and females live in largely segregated communities , but must come together somewhere to breed .
They are believed to bear live young , but sightings of pups are extremely rare .

Wibble - wobble
He brought us the pocket calculator and the ZX Spectrum , the digital wristwatch and the ill - fated C5 road buggy .
Now Sir Clive Sinclair has turned his attentions to the humble bicycle .
But put it to the test , is it just a bit , well , wobbly ?
After the 7 July Tube bombings , congestion charges in UK cities , and with normal - size bikes forbidden from commuter trains , fold - up bikes are increasingly taking to urban streets .
And it is a busy market .
UK leader Brompton shifts 15,000 a year , around the globe , of its proper bikes designed to fold .
But designer Alex Kalogroulis and Sir Clive say the A - bike is different , and smaller still .
That it stands out from the competitors as an " ultra - compact " bike for " short hop " journeys - two miles from home to the Tube or from the train to the office .
Pedals and handlebars mean it is a bike ; tiny wheels means it does n't do distance .
Named after the shape of its telescopic black - and - silver frame , it claims to come in at half the weight , ( 12.5lbs ) and half the price ( £ 199 ) of those already on the market .
It has two chains , one gear and a weight limit for riders of 13st 5lbs ( 85kgs ) .
Sir Clive Sinclair with his latest invention , the A - bike
Enlarge Image
The bike was unveiled on London 's South Bank , with the hoped - for customers in the City in view across the river .
But the sight of its tiny wheels - the size of a late - 90s micro-scooter - and its novel design raised the question , " Is this a bicycle , or a £ 200 toy starting an early run up to the Christmas market ? "
The only way to answer that is to put the A - bike to the test in the hands of the experts - the cyclists .
Down with the kids
Cycling in the UK 's towns and cities brings two main dangers .
One is getting a bit sweaty .
The other is more serious : death .
See the A - bike in action
In pictures
Truths often come from the mouths of babes and in this case from a Year 7 class of 11 to 13 - year - olds on an art trip to draw Tower Bridge .
They tussled to ride the bike .
Declared it " lightweight and cool " , " better than my BMX " and made plans to scale down the A - bike to sell it for children look like a canny marketing strategy .
But they also spotted what each of the test - riders found : " The handling is a bit hard to control , " shouts Alex Roberts , 12 , over his shoulder , as he veers wildly across the south embankment .
What about in the hands of a seasoned professional ?
Lance - not Armstrong , but Foster - at On Your Bike cycle shop takes the A - bike for a carefully - executed spin down the pavement .
That seat is definitely the most uncomfortable seat I have ever sat on
Lance Foster
Bike shop worker
His verdict on the bike is fast , strong and insightful .
There is much that he would change : " First of all that seat is definitely the most uncomfortable seat I have ever sat on .
" Plus , the way those handle - bars fold in - I would have made them a bit longer .
With the geometry of the bike you need them for good , aggressive speed .
" And , when you turn , it is very unstable . "
Commuter cyclist
As for the regular cyclists , student Felix Tanzer , 21 , finds there is more than a weight restriction for riders .
" I think it 's designed for the small - of - leg , " he laughs , as his knees knock the handle - bars .
A - BIKE Weighs 12.5lbs Folds ' in 10 seconds ' Riders below 13st 5lbs
One design in red , black and silver Two chains , one gear
Would he stretch his student budget to buy one ?
" No . " He is too near the Tube to need one in London .
He fears the bike would be laughed at back at university in Bristol .
And he doubts it could cope with the hills , the wind on the Downs , the blasts of winter weather .
If the bike is meant to fit in to a commute , how does it fare on the Tube itself ?
It packs neatly into a shoulder bag or can be carried by the handle bars .
It is out of the way on the escalator step or the carriage floor , much like any folding bike .
Achy - arm sets in on the streets , but there is a bag to ease the load
But achy - arm from carrying it is quick to surface , and how everything else would be balanced is less clear .
Especially with the amount of gear cyclists tend to trail .
The A - bike 's distributors hope to shift 15 to 25,000 in the first year .
That is quite a projection in the current market .
Kids may want one , but everyday commuters could well demand more of a bike for their buck .
Whether it becomes a success , or a " collector 's item " along the lines of the C5 in the 1980s , looks likely to depend on how many A - bikes Santa can fold down and pack into his sleigh .

Hannah Rothstein , 7 months old , has double thighs and a dimpled bottom , but very svelte German underwear .
She can still fit into her birth - to - 3 - month - old clothes because she lacks her peers ' familiar bulge in the rear .
She can sleep all night without a diaper .
And during the day , every so often , after her mother , Melinda , of Newton , Mass. , places her on a plastic potty and makes a little " pss-wss -wss " sound like the one used to call a cat , Hannah uses the toilet .
For many parents in the United States , the idea of potty training before a baby is able to walk , or even before age 2 , is not just horrifying but reprehensible -- a sure nightmare for parents and baby , not to mention a direct route from the crib to the psychiatrist 's couch .
But a growing number of parents are experimenting with infant potty training , seeing it as more sanitary , ecologically correct and likely to strengthen bonds between parent and child .
About 2,000 people across the country have joined Internet groups and e-mail lists to learn more about the techniques of encouraging a baby -- too young to walk or talk -- to go in a toilet , a sink or a pot .
Through a nonprofit group , Diaper Free Baby ( www.diaperfreebaby.org), 77 local groups have formed in 35 states to encourage the practice .
One author 's how - to books on the subject have sold about 50,000 copies .
" It 's just so simple , " said Lamelle Ryman , who recently attended a support meeting at an apartment on the Upper West Side .
Ms. Ryman , the mother of 7 - month - old Neshama , added , " I feel like it 's been such a gift in our relationship . "
Super ethanol is on its way
The next generation of this biomass fuel could be cheaper , more plentiful and arriving sooner than you think .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) � Cellulosic ethanol , the biofuel that differs from corn - based ethanol in that it can be made from pretty much any organic matter , has made an impression among people who matter .
Alan Greenspan , the revered former chairman of the Federal Reserve with a big distaste for irrational exuberance , recently sang its praises before a Congressional hearing on energy security .
Greenspan said cellulosic ethanol is the only alternative energy source that could be produced in enough volume to make a dent in gas usage .
" You 'll get an awful lot of investments [ into this technology ] coming in , especially if the numbers make sense , which I think they do , " he said .
And last month Goldman Sachs ( Charts ) , the world 's largest investment bank , poured $ 27 million into Iogen , a Canadian - based biotech specializing in ethanol made from cellulose .
It used to be thought that this fuel , which some argue has the potential to replace more than two thirds of all gasoline used in the U.S. , was decades away from commercial viability .
But high gas prices , a touch of technical innovation , and a healthy dose of capital may move that date up .
" There are a lot of people who think the technology is there , " and could be competitive even if oil prices return to $ 30 a barrel , said Greg Bohannon , a managing partner at Greenrock Capital , a California - based private equity fund that focuses on renewable energy .
" Why would Goldman Sachs invest in a company that 's not going to be commercially viable for 10 years ? "
Chances are , they did n't .
Beyond corn
Most ethanol currently produced in the U.S. is made from corn kernels .
Its benefits have been well documented in the press , especially since gasoline prices reached a record average of $ 3.06 a gallon last September , and have n't fallen much since .
Ethanol is clean burning .
It 's renewable .
And it costs about a dollar a gallon to produce .
Existing cars can run on 10 percent ethanol with no modifications , and they 'd need only about $ 100 worth of tinkering to be 85 percent ethanol powered .
And , perhaps most importantly , it 's domestically produced .
But there are a few major problems with corn - based ethanol .
First , it takes a lot of energy to make it .
According to the Department of Energy , most studies put the ratio as low as 1:1.4 - meaning that for every one unit of energy spent , only 1.4 units of ethanol energy are created .
Indeed , there are some camps who believe producing corn - based ethanol actually results in a net loss of energy .
Second , an expensive infrastructure would need to be built if people started using mostly ethanol in their vehicles , since ethanol is water soluble and the existing pipelines and filling station equipment for gasoline are not completely water tight .
Third , there 's not enough corn available .
John Ashworth , a biomass expert at the Department of Energy 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory , said corn could only supply about 12 to 18 billion gallons of ethanol a year , or about 10 percent of the nation 's 140 billion gallon - a - year gasoline habit .
After that , ethanol would start to run up the price of corn , raising the cost of everything from eggs to Coca Cola .
Of course the same problem would emerge with ethanol made with sugarcane or soy or any other food crop .
Wood chips to the rescue
Cellulosic ethanol has all the advantages of corn - based ethanol - there is no difference in the ethanol , only in the way it 's produced .
But unlike corn - based ethanol , cellulosic ethanol can be made from a variety of things that might otherwise be considered waste � sewage sludge , switchgrass , plant stalks , trees � virtually anything that contains carbon .
Ashworth said there are an estimated one billion tons of such material available in the U.S. every year , enough for 100 billion gallons of ethanol .
While it 's not feasible to actually go out and collect every ounce of that one billion tons , he said it 's not unreasonable to expect ethanol to replace 40 billion gallons of gasoline in the near future .
" There 's a lot of venture capitol out there that 's willing to invest in cellulosic ethanol , " he said .
" You 're likely to see some plants built in the next 12 to 18 months . "
Entrepreneurs are in fact pressing ahead with ambitious plans .
" We know the technology is proven , " said Jim Stewart , a spokesman for Bioengineering Resources Inc. , or BRI , an Arkansas - based biofuel outfit .
" It 's at the point of commercialization . "
Stewart said BRI uses a patented bacterial culture to transform organic matter into ethanol , and can produce a gallon of it at a fourth the retail cost of a gallon of gas .
He said the company plans to have 4 plants operating commercially within the next 16 to 18 months , but some industry - watchers believe it will be at least several years before cellulosic ethanol production will become commercially viable .
Vancouver - based Syntec Biofuel uses a different process to make ethanol .
It turns the organic matter into gas and then moves the gas over a metal catalyst , which then turns it into liquid fuel .
But the end result is the same .
Syntec hopes to have a full - scale plant up and running in three years , then plans to make most of its money by selling the plant 's design to outside producers .
Company spokesman Jeff Eltom touted the efficiency of Syntec 's process , saying it plans to get 10 units of energy out of every one unit they put in .
" We 're not going to totally replace gasoline , " said Eltom .
" But we can take a big chunk out of what we import and become more energy efficient . "
Temperance
Eltom 's comment reflects the conventional wisdom in the alternative energy field :
As the shift is made from fossil fuels to other options , it wo n't be any one single thing that meets the world 's energy needs , but rather a mix of sources that will do so .
Still , not everyone believes cellulose ethanol will be part of that mix in the near term .
When the U.S. Energy Information Administration released its long term world energy outlook earlier this week , it projected a surge in U.S. oil consumption over the next 25 years , mostly due to transportation needs .
The agency said it does take new technologies into account when making its predictions , but that it believes cellulose ethanol is still too expensive to compete in the market place with corn ethanol and gasoline .
" It would take a breakthrough in the costs , " said Andy Kydes , a forecaster at EIA .
" It could happen , and we have hopes for it , but right now it 's not on our radar . "
Kydes did , however , ask for the names and phone numbers of the companies mentioned in this story , saying the agency would " look into it . "

The phenomenon is n't entirely new .
John Doerr , a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers , notes that when he and his partners invested in Intuit , the business software maker , in the mid-1980s , " none of the money went into the company .
It was all to buy founders ' stock shares . "
" We always prefer that the money be used to build the company , " Mr. Doerr said .
But the desire to own a piece of a hot company , he said , sometimes trumps that sentiment .
Indeed , he said Kleiner Perkins was currently considering just such an investment in one enterprise .
Typically , the founders are the sole beneficiaries of these deals .
Webroot , for instance , raised $ 108 million in venture capital last February .
A large share of that money is being used to open offices around the globe , said Mike Irwin , Webroot 's chief financial officer , and to expand the company 's product offering .
But some of that $ 108 million -- Mr. Irwin would not say how much -- went directly to the company 's two creators , Steve Thomas and Kristen Talley , who founded the company in 1997 .
They still own a share of Webroot but neither works for the company .
In eHarmony 's case , 116 people benefited financially when the company , which was started in 1999 , announced last December that it had raised $ 110 million .
The word within the venture capital community is that less than $ 30 million of that sum went into the company coffers .
Mr. Forgatch said that was inaccurate , but he would provide no specifics .
" It 's not my place to talk about personal finances of 115 other people , " he said .
Mr. Forgatch argues that the venture deal he helped to craft is good for the company , based in Pasadena , Calif . , as well as for the people who benefited .
And he may be right .
The transaction served as a kind of release valve that helped quiet the collective impulse among eHarmony insiders to see the company go public .
An incremental payoff for their hard work , Mr. Forgatch said , " allows everyone to focus on the mission . "
The incursion comes hours after Israeli aircraft struck at bridges and a power plant in the Gaza Strip .
Cpl Gilad Shalit was abducted by Palestinian militants during a raid on an Israeli post near Gaza on Sunday .
Israel had warned of a massive military assault if he was not freed and its tanks have been massing along the border with Gaza for several days .
It is unclear how many troops are being used in the operation , launched from the Kerem Shalom crossing near southern Gaza .
This major incursion comes less than a year after Israel pulled soldiers and thousands of settlers from Gaza , which it had first occupied in 1967 .
Since completing the withdrawal in September 2005 , the Israeli army has regularly shelled targets in Gaza in an attempt to halt the firing of rockets into Israel by Palestinian militants .
Many Palestinian militants and civilians have been killed in the shelling .
' Limited operation '
The Israeli forces have taken up position near the town of Rafah , shortly after passing Gaza 's disused international airport .
According to the BBC's Gaza correspondent , Alan Johnston , the troops ' objective appears to be fairly limited - they have not entered Rafah and are camping on farmland outside the city .
An Israeli military spokeswoman said the soldiers were planning to set up observation posts .
The Associated Press news agency quotes Palestinian witnesses as saying the troops had entered the area under the cover of tank shells .
Palestinian militants anticipating an Israeli assault have been erecting barricades and preparing hideouts and ambush positions .
A spokeswoman for the Israeli armed forces said they had not encountered any resistance from the Palestinians .
Israeli military officials have been quoted as saying Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had backed a " limited operation " targeting the " terrorist infrastructure " .
Gaza 's militants have been readying defences
Hours before the ground assault , Israeli jets attacked three bridges and a power plant in the Gaza Strip .
The Israeli military confirmed the first strike on the bridge was aimed at stopping militants from moving Cpl Shalit .
The strike on the plant plunged much of Gaza into darkness .
It is not yet clear if there were any casualties .
Cpl Gilad Shalit was captured when Palestinian militants burrowed under the Gaza border and attacked an Israeli army position , killing two soldiers .
Israel has rejected the militants ' demands for Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails to be freed in exchange for information about the soldier .
' United front '
Earlier on Tuesday , rival Palestinian factions , Hamas and Fatah , agreed a document outlining a common political platform .
As part of the agreement , Hamas said it would accept a Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza - while maintaining its refusal to recognise the legitimacy of Israel .
The Hamas government also authorised the Fatah leader and President of the Palestinian Authority , Mahmoud Abbas , to conduct negotiations with Israel .
A Fatah official said the aim of the deal was to present a united front in talks .
The BBC's Middle East editor , Jeremy Bowen , says there is little in the document to hint at a longer - term peace deal with Israel .
There is no peace process on the ground , he says , and the dynamic of violence in the area has outpaced efforts at peace .
The cross marks the location of the black hole Cygnus X - 1 in this radio image .
The bright region to the left ( east ) of the black hole is a dense cloud of gas existing in the space between the stars , the interstellar medium .
A huge invisible bubble surrounds a well - studied black hole , scientists have just learned .
The cavity is carved from space by the activity of the black hole itself and was detected with a radio telescope .
Other space bubbles have been spotted , excavated by exploded stars and by supermassive black holes that anchor entire galaxies .
The most recent discovery is unique because it involves a stellar black hole , one that resulted from the collapse of a dead star here in our Milky Way .
The bubble is formed by a jet of material streaming from the black hole at very high speeds .
Since this type of black hole is common , the finding suggests scientists have been " severely underestimating how much power black holes pump back into the universe , " said the astronomers who announced the finding last week in the journal Nature .
" We already knew that supermassive black holes at the centers of other galaxies produce enormous amounts of energy , " said study leader Elena Gallo of the University of Amsterdam .
" But this finding proves that something similar is happening in our backyard . "
Vast impact
The jet of energetic particles moves at a significant fraction of light - speed .
" This jet travels up to more than 15 light - years from the black hole , at which point its pressure is balanced by the pressure of the surrounding interstellar gas , " Gallo told SPACE.com .
" There the jet starts to inflate a bubble with energy and particles .
As the bubble expands sideways it creates a shock - compressed " hollow sphere " which gives rise to the observed emission . "
Those observations involve a ring of radio emissions around a two - object system known as Cygnus X - 1 , in which a black hole 10 times the mass of our Sun is orbited by another star .
The setup is about 6,000 light - years away .
A light - year is the distance light travels in a year , about 6 trillion miles ( 10 trillion kilometers ) .
Black holes can't be seen because they swallow light and everything else that gets too close .
But matter and energy in the black hole 's vicinity can escape in dramatic fashion .
Material orbits the black hole and is lured inward by gravity .
But as with all black holes , mealtime is messy .
Some of the matter is kicked outward instead by intense magnetic fields .
And some is converted to energy , emitted as X - rays and other wavelengths .
Scientists are still trying to understand the exact mechanisms behind all this output .
Powerful finding
The newfound bubble is about 10 light - years across and is expanding at about 225,000 mph ( 100 kilometers per second ) .
Its creation has been ongoing for a million years or so .
Astronomers are excited about the disovery because it is impossible to measure directly the power of jets like this one .
By noting the interaction at the bubble , however , the researchers were able to calculate the jet 's power .
The jet packs about 100,000 times more energy than our Sun .
" Remarkably , it also means that , after a massive star dies and turns into a black hole , it is still capable of energizing its surroundings , by means of completely different mechanisms , " Gallo said .
Astronomers suspect there are millions of black holes similar to Cygnus X - 1 .
" We knew about jets from black holes and expected to discover some interaction of the jet 's energy with the gas in our Milky Way , but the size and energy content of this bubble came as a surprise , " said study co-author Christian Kaiser of the University of Southampton in the UK .
The observations were made with the Dutch Westerbork radio telescope .
Back in 2002 , Gator was one of the most reviled companies on the Net .
Maker of a free app called eWallet , the firm was under fire for distributing what critics called spyware , code that covertly monitors a user 's Web - surfing habits and uploads the data to a remote server .
People who downloaded Gator eWallet soon found their screens inundated with pop-up ads ostensibly of interest to them because of Web sites they had visited .
Removing eWallet did n't stop the torrent of pop-ups .
Mounting complaints attracted the attention of the Federal Trade Commission .
Online publishers sued the company for obscuring their Web sites with pop-ups .
In a June 2002 legal brief filed with the lawsuit , attorneys for The Washington Post referred to Gator as a " parasite . "
ZDNet called it a " scourge . "
Today Gator , now called Claria , is a rising star .
The lawsuits have been settled - with negligible impact on the company 's business - and Claria serves ads for names like JPMorgan Chase , Sony , and Yahoo !
The Wall Street Journal praises the company for " making strides in revamping itself . "
Earlier this year , The New York Times reported that Microsoft came close to acquiring Claria .
Google acknowledges Claria 's technology in recent patent applications .
Best of all , government agencies and watchdog groups have given their blessing to the company 's latest product : software that watches everything users do online and transmits their surfing histories to Claria , which uses the data to determine which ads to show them .
Apart from plush new offices at the northern edge of Silicon Valley , it 's remarkable how little the latter - day Claria differs from the old Gator .
It 's true that the company has toned down its most aggressive tactics .
Journalists , watchdogs , and regulators seem mollified .
For the most part , though , the company is in the same business as before , courting the same customers and selling a product that does the same thing in the same ways .
Claria wears in a sharp suit and has a scrubbed face and coiffed hair - but it still looks a lot like Gator .
CEO Scott VanDeVelde does n't deny this .
" I do n't feel like there 's a need to wipe the slate clean , " he says .
" Our technologies are dead center of where the market is going . "
The spyware wars are over - and spyware has won .
Like many dotcoms born in the late 1990s , Gator began with an idea for a product - but no clear way to make money from it .
" Our idea was a program that would store your passwords and automatically log you into password - protected sites , " says Wally Buch .
Buch brainstormed the software with a friend , Symantec founder Denis Coleman , who would remain involved in the company until early 2004 .
They called it eWallet .
Buch came up with the missing revenue model a few weeks later as he waited in the checkout line at a grocery store .
The woman in front of him bought diapers , and he noticed that her receipt included coupons for baby products .
Buch realized that the Web could do the same thing for advertising :
If he kept track of sites people visited , he could deliver ads that reflected their interests and thus increase the chance of triggering a sale .
Along with then - CEO Jeff McFadden and VP of marketing Scott Eagle , Buch and Coleman decided to give away eWallet and use it as a sort of Trojan horse for pop - up ads .
As users surfed the Web , ads would appear based on the site they were visiting .
The gambit worked .
Millions of people downloaded eWallet , and Gator 's bank balance began to grow .
A host of similar companies followed , including WhenU , 180Solutions , and DirectRevenue .
In 1999 , Gator parlayed its early success into $ 12.5 million in financing .
That 's when McFadden and Eagle decided the company 's main product was not password - storing freeware but a covert ad - delivery platform .
" Things really changed after that , " Buch recalls .
" It 's not that I thought pop-ups could n't be valuable , but the way they did it was over the top .
It was an invitation to trouble . "
Uncomfortable with the company 's direction , he left before the year was out .
The business took off without him .
In 2000 , The Industry Standard called Gator one of the " 10 companies to watch . "
The firm pulled in $ 14.5 million in 2001 ; revenue totaled $ 40.5 in 2002 , when Gator delivered pop-ups to 12 million desktops .
" We had 300 retailers , and the click rates were amazing , " Eagle says .
" All we were thinking about was how to continue growing . "
While Gator was raking in profits and plaudits , computer users were growing frustrated .
One minute they were downloading seemingly benign freeware , the next their systems were spewing pop-ups and uploading private data .
Programs they had n't deliberately installed and did n't want anyway were interfering with other apps and dragging down system performance .
All this spawned a backlash , leading to a new market for antispyware utilities , like Lavasoft 's Ad- Aware , designed to remove the offending software , including Gator 's , from users ' computers .
Meanwhile , executives at Web operations noticed that pop-ups interfered with their own ability to do business .
For one thing , the ads enticed visitors to click links that whisked them off to other sites .
For another , the ads papered over their own sites ' ads .
Advertisers who did n't get an adequate response on publishers ' sites would n't renew , and that was bound to compromise potential revenue .
As the leading distributor of pop-up software , Gator became a lightning rod for criticism .
By summer 2001 , the Interactive Advertising Bureau was telling the press about Gator 's " deceptive " practice of " illegally " interfering with Web businesses .
Gator wasted no time in striking back .
In August , the company had sued IAB for " malicious disparagement " that interfered with its right to deliver pop-ups .
The parties settled in November , agreeing to cooperate in the development of future Gator products .
In June 2002 , The Washington Post , The New York Times , Dow Jones , and seven other online publishers filed a lawsuit , charging Gator with nine counts , including interfering with business and violating trademark .
Gator 's software , they claimed , infringed on their trademarks because it used their brand names to trigger ads for competitors - éthat is , when it detected a user logging into The New York Times ' site , it would pop up an ad promoting The Wall Street Journal .
The publishers hoped to convince the court that Gator was specifically targeting their businesses and delivering competing pop-ups .
They hired Ben Edelman , a Harvard economics graduate student with a law degree and a techie bent , to trace the trail of secret signals , both within users ' computers and over the Net .
Thanks to his forensic work and eventual testimony , the publishers won a preliminary injunction forcing Gator to stop targeting their sites .
Ben Edelman is the world 's premiere spyware epidemiologist .
In his Cambridge , Massachusetts , lab near Harvard Yard , he deliberately infects a sacrificial PC with programs like eWallet .
Then he tracks the way the applications sink their tendrils into host desktops , collect sensitive information , and transmit it to the mothership .
This research has earned him few friends in the industry .
Eagle , ever on the defense against competitors , believes Edelman is a spy for his rival WhenU .
After I tell the Claria VP I 'm planning to visit Edelman , he turns grim .
" Why do n't you ask him who he works for ? " he asks testily .
The fact is , Edelman works for the same kind of customers Eagle does : large organizations with a substantial Web presence .
His consulting clients include AOL , the National Football League , and Wells Fargo .
In Edelman 's testimony on behalf of the publishers in their 2002 suit , he gave a step - by - step overview of how Gator 's user tracking and ad delivery software wound up on the machines of unwitting users .
When someone downloaded eWallet , Edelman found , another program called OfferCompanion came along for the ride .
Whenever the browser loaded a new site , OfferCompanion sent the new URL to Gator , which served a related pop-up for the software to display .
Moreover , Edelman discovered , the stealth program could n't be removed using the Windows uninstall command .
Once it was on a PC , it took some effort to erase .
He also found that thousands of smaller companies were also distributing OfferCompanion ( along with similar programs ) bundled with Kazaa and AudioGalaxy .
These distributors made deals with yet another tier of companies that gave away the bundle along with still more freeware .
Whenever a user clicked on an ad , everyone along the chain took a cut .
So if Gator got $ 10 for each click on a Home Shopping Network pop-up , the second - tier distributors might get 10 cents each and the third - tier distributors 5 cents each .
Sometimes , though , the middlemen did n't wait for a user to click ; they simply made it look that way .
When someone clicks on a pop-up ad , the advertiser puts a cookie - a small text file - on the user 's browser to track his movements .
The more active the user is on the advertiser 's site , the more the distributors get paid - especially if the result is a sale .
These companies realized they could add code that stashed a cookie in the browser whenever a pop-up appeared .
Thus , each pop -up served made them another dime , whether or not it ever got clicked .
The scam , known as cookie stuffing , became endemic to the industry .
" Quite simply , affiliates use spyware to rip off marketing departments , " Edelman says .
The publishers ' suit set off a cascade of bad news for Gator .
L.L. Bean , Hertz.com , and Overstock.com piled on during 2003 and 2004 , launching separate suits for unfair business practices and trademark infringement .
In April 2004 , the FTC held a summit to address the spyware problem and followed up with lawsuits against companies like Seismic Entertainment .
Seismic 's code embedded itself so deeply in the operating system that trying to delete it occasionally ruined the host PC .
The agency did n't go after eWallet or OfferCompanion , but it was clear that the Feds were paying attention .
Then Yahoo ! announced that its toolbar would block pop-ups from Gator , among others .
Amid the string of setbacks , Gator canceled plans for an IPO .
Eagle declines to talk about it .
" Suffice it to say that market conditions were n't right , " he says .
The lawsuits and bad publicity left the company wounded , but the numbers were exploding anyway : Profit grew from $ 91,000 ( on revenue of $ 40.5 million ) in 2002 to nearly $ 35 million ( on revenue of $ 90 million ) in 2003 .
The user base was roughly 35 million and growing 50 percent annually .
Apparently , Gator did n't need to change its software ; it needed to change its image .
So , as Eagle puts it , " we shifted the momentum and grabbed the mike . "
The first move was to give the company a new name .
Thus , in October 2003 , Gator , the fearsome snapping reptile , became Claria , the paragon of transparency and light .
Next Claria went to work replacing the pejorative word spyware with the more business - friendly adware .
The adware model was already an accepted way for software companies to support otherwise free products - the free version of the Eudora email program , for instance , displays ads in a small window that can't be closed while the program is in use .
Claria execs argued that eWallet was no different .
Moreover , they policed the distinction with diligence :
Anyone who called the company 's products spyware risked a lawsuit .
In late 2003 , Claria filed a libel suit against PCPitstop.com , a mom-and - pop site that distributed spyware - removal tools .
The suit claimed that PCPitstop was infringing on Claria 's business by including the company on a list of firms that distributed spyware .
As part of a settlement , PCPitstop took down several pages on its site describing how the company 's pop-up generator ruins PC performance and tracks every move consumers make online .
Meanwhile , Claria quietly settled the suits filed by L.L. Bean , Hertz.com , and Overstock .com .
All parties signed nondisclosure agreements , so the terms are secret and nobody will discuss them .
The next step was to cozy up to regulators .
Claria offered to help government agencies and industry watchdogs establish guidelines for spyware , and perhaps show how its own practices were more benign .
To that end , the executive suite made room for a new position : chief privacy officer .
Reed Freeman , a former staff attorney at the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection , took the job .
Freeman spoke at industry events about the importance of privacy and consumer rights , and Claria became a supporter of the Antispyware Coalition , a public interest group headed by the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington , DC .
Claria seemed to embrace the Coalition 's business - friendly list of rules for pop -up advertising companies that sought to rise above the spyware label .
The rules are simple :
There must be " conspicuous notification " when adware is downloaded , and that notice must include a clear explanation of what the software will do and how it can be uninstalled .
But for all Claria 's rhetoric , critics pointed out , its actions suggested a less than hearty embrace of the coalition 's intent .
For example , it complied with the notification provision by adding to the installation procedure a pop-up window full of small type explaining how Claria 's products work .
Edelman scoffs at this solution , arguing that the notification text is " longer than the US Constitution and nobody reads it . "
If Edelman was n't convinced , several makers of antispyware software were .
In April 2005 , Claria issued a press release saying it had convinced McAfee to " acknowledge " that Claria 's software apps were n't " malicious threats " ; McAfee had " inadvertently labeled " Claria a " top threat of 2004 . "
Claria also persuaded Microsoft and Aluria to remove its products from the list of programs targeted by their antispyware apps .
Eagle wo n't discuss how he made his case to these companies , but Aluria CEO Rick Carlson says he 's satisfied with Claria 's disclosure policy .
" At some point theéconsumer has to take responsibility and read , " he says .
As for whether it 's easy enough to remove Claria 's software , " users are never more than two clicks away from uninstalling , " he says .
Claria 's cleanup strategy very nearly paid off in a big way .
According to a June 30 , 2005 , New York Times piece , Microsoft considered acquiring Claria .
The two went as far as holding meetings to discuss terms .
However , Redmond employees who were aware of Claria 's reputation demurred , setting off what the Times called an " internal battle " among Microsoft execs .
Neither company will comment on the article .
The reported deal did n't go through , but Eagle says he 's not worried .
His company 's revenue for 2004 topped $ 100 million .
Claria is back .
As Claria sheds the last of Gator 's skin , Eagle is keen to talk about the final element in the company 's corporate makeover .
" We 're moving into the personalized content business , " he says .
Translation :
The company plans to stop delivering pop-ups altogether .
At first blush , the news sounds like solid evidence that Claria has emerged from the spyware wars with a new focus .
Having taken pop-ups as far as it could , the company has decided to leave the format behind .
But this is n't to say it 's finished tracking customers and using the information to sell advertising .
PersonalWeb , a Claria product scheduled to launch in January , is a close cousin of the OfferCompanion program that hitched a ride on eWallet .
It tracks everything users do on the Internet and sends the information to remote servers for analysis .
Then it places ads on partnering publishers '
Web sites , changing them depending on the profile of the visitor .
The crucial difference is that PersonalWeb does n't display irritating pop-ups that might make users wonder what else has been installed on their PCs .
Better yet , publishers will get a cut of the clickthrough commissions for ads Claria places on their sites .
There will no more fights over territory .
" It 's great for everybody , " Eagle says .
" Merchants make money , publishers make money , and so do we . "
The new product does n't alter Claria 's course .
Rather , it cuts a more viable pathway through the wilderness McFadden and Eagle first opened in 1999 .
PersonalWeb reflects the key lesson the company has learned since then :
While everyone hates pop-ups , nobody much minds behind - the - scenes spying .
In fact , surreptitious tracking is all the rage .
Google - with its interconnected search , email , chat , blogs , and social networks - is also in the business of targeting ads based on user behavior .
So are MSN and Yahoo !
All three maintain profiles of everyone who signs up for their services .
They use cookies to track what visitors do on their sites while they 're logged in ; the downloadable Google and MSN toolbars track which sites users visit when they 're logged out .
Like Claria , Google has amassed a vast database of user profiles that it plans to use for even better targeting in the future .
Few people in the online business community question the idea that marketing software should track user behavior .
Lydia Parnes , director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection , says it 's possible to track people online without being underhanded .
The FTC is in favor of online advertising , she explains , " and sometimes tracking makes advertising work better for consumers . "
Esther Dyson , who has been harshly critical of spyware companies in her influential newsletter , Release 1.0 , agrees .
" As long as there 's disclosure and people are given a choice , I think monitoring users ' behavior is n't a problem , " she says .
That 's the kind of green light Gator could never get .
But in the evolving world of behavioral marketing , Claria is the hottest , um , adware company around .

Tank crews have provided a significant number of casualties
One of the major military surprises of the fighting in Lebanon has been the apparent vulnerability of Israeli armour to Hezbollah anti-tank rockets .
No detailed figures are available and it is clear that many more tanks may have been hit than actually destroyed .
But a significant proportion of Israeli casualties have been among tank crews .
Hezbollah has also used its anti-armour weapons to bring down buildings around sheltering Israeli troops , again causing multiple casualties .
Hezbollah has fielded some of the most modern Russian - made anti-tank weapons , which the Israelis insist have come via the Syrians .
Wire - guided
The potency of infantry anti-armour weapons is nothing new for the Israelis .
One journalist reported seeing the sophisticated Kornet
In 1973 , after Egyptian forces crossed the Suez Canal , Israel tank units learned the hard way about what Russian - made missiles could do .
The Egyptians put across the canal large numbers of soldiers armed with wire - guided Sagger missiles .
As long as the operator kept the target tank in his sights , signals sent along the unreeling wire would guide the missile to its target .
As counter - attacking Israeli tanks raced towards the canal , they were met by barrages of these missiles .
You can be sure Israeli Defence Forces planners ... will be studying these engagements in detail
Commanders spoke of vehicles emerging from the fighting festooned with wires from the missiles , and many tanks were destroyed .
Since then a complex design battle has been underway between the tank and the infantry anti-armour weapon .
For the foot - soldier the key is penetration but also weight :
What can easily be carried into battle ?
Tandem charge
For the tank , too , there are weight considerations as more and more armour places heavier strains on engines and running gear and also potentially limits the areas in which a tank can operate .
In Lebanon Israel has come up against some of Russia 's most modern anti-tank weapons .
Crew protection was a key element in the Merkava tank 's design
The AT - 13 Metis or Saxhorn is a modern tube - launched successor to the Sagger .
Its tandem - shaped warhead can punch through armour of up to 46 cm ( 18 inches ) thick .
The tandem warhead is designed to counter reactive armour as used on many Israeli vehicles .
Reactive armour is essentially made up of explosive pads or bricks on the outside of the tank which explode outwards when hit by an incoming missile .
This disrupts the effect of the missile warhead , which needs to impact upon the surface of the tank to achieve its penetrative effect .
A twin or tandem charge is designed to get around this .
The first warhead triggers the reactive armour and the second penetrates the tank .
Hezbollah is also reported to have used the RPG - 29 ; a shoulder - fired weapon , again with a tandem charge .
Infantry carriers
And a journalist from the London - based Daily Telegraph newspaper reports also seeing abandoned Kornet missiles in Lebanon .
The Kornet was first shown by the Russians in 1994 and represents state - of - the - art technology .
It has either an optical or a thermal sight - effectively " riding " a laser beam to its target .
It again has a tandem warhead .
It has a range of up to 5 km ( three miles ) and is said to be able to penetrate armour up to 1,200 mm thick .
Hezbollah has fielded some of the most modern weaponry
The Kornet has been exported by the Russians to only a few countries , including Syria .
And all the evidence suggests that the Syrians have passed them on to Hezbollah .
Israel is so concerned that it has despatched a team of officials to Moscow to show the Russians the evidence of what they say can only be Syrian weapons transfers .
In the longer term , the experiences of 1973 played an important part in shaping the philosophy behind Israel 's Merkava battle tank .
The Merkava or Chariot is among the most modern in the world , but its unique feature is the extent to which crew protection figured in its design .
Quite apart from carrying highly sophisticated armour , it is almost unique in having the engine in the front , affording additional protection to its crew .
The need for well - armoured infantry carriers that can keep pace with the tanks has led Israel to convert a large number of older tanks to carry troops .
The Achzarit is a good example .
It is based on the Russian T54 /T55 tank which Israel captured in large numbers during the 1973 war .
Its turret and main gun have been removed and various other changes made to allow it to accommodate a crew of three along with seven infantrymen .
New armour
But all of these enhancements have not proved sufficiently effective against the most modern anti-tank systems operated by determined fighters on the ground .
You can be sure Israeli Defence Forces planners and indeed military observers from around the world will be studying these engagements in detail .
Part of the answer may be to adopt new kinds of armour .
But , as ever , part of the answer will be tactical - changes to the way tanks are employed and the way they operate in concert with other elements of ground - power , like infantry and artillery .

A simple homemade Van de Graaff generator
In the previous two projects , we stole high voltage from a television set to power our high voltage motors .
In this project we will build a device that can generate 12,000 volts from an empty soda can and a rubber band .
The device is called a Van de Graaff generator .
Science museums and research facilities have large versions that generate potentials in the hundreds of thousands of volts .
Ours is more modest , but is still capable of drawing 1 / 2 inch sparks from the soda can to my finger .
The spark is harmless , and similar to the jolt you get from a doorknob after scuffing your feet on the carpet .
An empty soda can
A small nail
A rubber band , 1 / 4 inch by 3 or 4 inches
A 5x20 millimeter GMA - Type electrical fuse ( such as Radio Shack # 270- 1062 or # 270-1061 )
A small DC motor ( such as Radio Shack # 273-223 )
A battery clip ( Radio Shack # 270-324 )
A battery holder ( Radio Shack # 270-382 )
A styrofoam cup ( a paper cup will also work )
A hot glue gun ( or regular glue if you do n't mind waiting )
Two 6 inch long stranded electrical wires ( such as from an extension cord )
Two pieces of 3/4 inch PVC plumbing pipe , each about 2 or 3 inches long
One 3/4 inch PVC coupler
One 3/4 inch PVC T connector
Some electrical tape
A block of wood
To build the toy , you need :
That sounds like a lot of stuff , but take a look at the step - by - step photos below , and you will find that the whole project can easily be put together in an evening , once all the parts have been collected .
We 'll start at the bottom , and work our way up .
The first thing to do is to cut a 2 to 3 inch long piece of 3/4 inch PVC pipe , and glue that to the wooden base .
This piece will hold the generator up , and allow us to remove it to more easily replace the rubber band , or make adjustments .
The PVC " T " connector will hold the small motor .
The motor fits too loosely by itself , so we wrap paper or tape around it to make a snug fit .
The shaft of the motor can be left bare , but the generator will work a little better if it is made fatter by wrapping tape around it , or ( better ) putting a plastic rod with a hole in the center onto the shaft to act as a pulley for the rubber band .
Next , we drill a small hole in the side of the PVC " T " connector , just under the makeshift pulley on the motor .
This hole will be used to hold the lower " brush " , which is simply a bit of stranded wire frayed at the end , that istouching the rubber band on the pulley .
As the photo shows , the stranded wire is held in place with some electrical tape , or some other tape or glue .
The rubber band is now placed on the pulley , and allowed to hang out the top of the " T " connector .
Next , cut another 3 or 4 inch piece of 3/4 inch PVC plumbing pipe .
This will go into the top of the " T " connector , with the rubber band going up through it .
Use the small nail to hold the rubber band in place , as in the photo below .
The length of the PVC pipe should be just enough to fit the rubber band .
The rubber band should not be stretched too tightly , since the resulting friction would prevent the motor from turning properly , and increase wear on the parts .
Cut the styrofoam cup about an inch from the bottom , and carefully cut a 3 / 4 inch diameter hole in the center of the bottom of the cup .
This hole should fit snugly onto the 3/4 inch PVC pipe .
Now drill three holes near the top of the PVC union coupling .
Two of these holes need to be diametrically opposite one another , since they will hold the small nail which will act as an axle for the rubber band .
The third hole is between the other two , and it will hold the top " brush " , which , like the bottom brush , will almost touch the rubber band .
The top brush is taped to the PVC union coupler , and the coupler is placed on the 3/4 inch pipe , above the styrofoam cup collar .
The rubber band is threaded through the coupler , and held in place with the small nail , as before .
Bare the top brush ( so it has no insulation ) and twist it to keep the individual wires from coming apart .
You can solder the free end if you like , but it is not necessary .
The free end of the top brush will be curled up inside the empty soda can when we are done , and thus electrically connect the soda can to the top brush .
We need a small glass tube to act as both a low - friction top pulley , and as a " triboelectric " complement to the rubber band , to generate static electricity by rubbing .
Glass is one of the best materials to rub against rubber to create electricity .
We get the tube by taking apart a small electrical fuse .
The metal ends of the fuse come off easily if heated with a soldering iron or a match .
The solder inside them drips out when they come off , so be careful .
The glass , the metal cap , and the molten solder are all quite hot , and will blister the skin if you touch them before they cool .
The resulting glass tube has nice straight , even edges , which are " fire polished " for you , so there is no sharp glass , and no uneven edges to catch on the PVC and break the glass .
The next step is a little tricky .
The small nail is placed through one of the two holes in the PVC union coupler , and the small glass tube is placed on the nail .
Then the rubber band is placed on the glass tube , and the nail is then placed in the second hole .
The rubber band is on the glass tube , which is free to rotate around the nail .
Now we glue the styrofoam collar in place on the PVC pipe .
I like to use a hot glue gun for this , since the glue can be laid on thickly to stabilize the collar , and it sets quickly and does not dissolve the styrofoam .
At this point we are ready for the empty soda can .
Aluminum pop - top cans are good for high voltage because they have nice rounded edges , which minimizes " corona discharge " .
With a sharp knife , carefully cut out the top of the soda can .
Leave the nice crimped edge , and cut close to the side of the can so as to leave very little in the way of sharp edges .
You can smooth the cut edge by " stirring " the can with a metal tool like a screwdriver , pressing outward as you stir , to flatten the sharp edge .
Tuck the free end of the top brush wire into the can , and invert the can over the top of the device , until it rests snugly on the styrofoam collar .
The last step is to attach the batteries .
I like to solder a battery clip to the motor terminals , and then clip this onto either a nine - volt battery , or a battery holder for two AA size batteries .
The nine - volt battery works , but it runs the motor too fast , making a lot of noise , and risking breakage of the glass tube .
It does , however , make a slightly higher voltage , until the device breaks .
To use the Van de Graaff generator , simply clip the battery to the battery clip .
If the brushes are very close to the ends of the rubber band , but not touching , you should be able to feel a spark from the soda can if you bring your finger close enough .
It helps to hold onto the free end of the bottom brush with the other hand while doing this .
To use our generator to power the Franklin 's Bells we built in the previous section of the book , clip the bottom brush wire to one " bell " , and attach a wire to the top of the generator , connecting it to the other " bell " .
The pop -top clapper of the Franklin 's Bells should start jumping between the soda cans .
It may need a little push to get started .
How does it do that ?
You may have at one time rubbed a balloon on your hair , and then made the balloon stick to the wall .
If you have never done this , try it !
The Van de Graaff generator uses this trick and two others to generate the high voltage needed to make a spark .
The first trick
When the balloon made contact with your hair , the molecules of the rubber touched the molecules of the hair .
When they touched , the molecules of the rubber attract electrons from the molecules of the hair .
The you take the balloon away from your hair , some of those electrons stay with the balloon , giving it a negative charge .
The extra electrons on the balloon repel the electrons in the wall , pushing them back from the surface .
The surface of the wall is left with a positive charge , since there are fewer electrons than when it was neutral .
The positive wall attracts the negative balloon with enough force to keep it stuck to the wall .
If you collected a bunch of different materials and touched them to one another , you could find out which ones were left negatively charged , and which were left positively charged .
You could then take these pairs of objects , and put them in order in a list , from the most positive to the most negative .
Such a list is called a .
The prefixmeans " to rub " .
The Triboelectric series
asbestos
rabbit fur
glass
hair
nylon
wool
silk
paper
cotton
hard rubber
synthetic rubber
polyester
styrofoam
orlon
saran
polyurethane
polyethylene
polypropylene
polyvinyl chloride ( PVC pipe )
teflon
silicone rubber
Our Van de Graaff generator uses a glass tube and a rubber band .
The rubber band steals electrons from the glass tube , leaving the glass positively charged , and the rubber band negatively charged .
The second trick
The triboelectric charging is the first trick .
The second trick involves the wire brushes .
When a metal object is brought near a charged object , something quite interesting happens .
The charged object causes the electrons in the metal to move .
If the object is charged negatively , it pushes the electrons away .
If it is charged positively , it pulls the electrons towards it .
Electrons are all negatively charged .
Because like charges repel , and electrons are all the same charge , electrons will always try to get as far away from other electrons as possible .
If the metal object has a sharp point on it , the electrons on the point are pushed by all of the other electrons in the rest of the object .
So on a point , there are a lot of electrons pushing from the metal , but no electrons pushing from the air .
If there are enough extra electrons on the metal , they can push some electrons off the point and into the air .
The electrons land on the air molecules , making them negatively charged .
The negatively charged air is repelled from the negatively charged metal , and a small wind of charged air blows away from the metal .
This is called " corona discharge " , because the dim light it gives off looks like a crown .
The same thing happens in reverse if the metal has too few electrons ( if it is positively charged ) .
At the point , all of the positive charges in the metal pull all the electrons from the point , leaving it very highly charged .
The air molecules that hit the metal point lose their electrons to the strong pull from the positive tip of the sharp point .
The air molecules are now positive , and are repelled from the positive metal .
The third trick
There is one more trick the Van de Graaff generator uses .
After we understand the third trick , we will put all of the tricks together to see how the generator works .
We said earlier that all electrons have the same charge , and so they all try to get as far from one another as possible .
The third trick uses the soda can to take advantage of this feature of the electrons in an interesting way .
If we give the soda can a charge of electrons , they will all try to get as far away from one another as possible .
This has the effect of making all the electrons crowd to the outside of the can .
Any electron on the inside of the can will feel the push from all the other electrons , and will move .
But the electrons on the outside feel the push from the can , but they do not feel any push from the air around the can , which is not charged .
This means that we can put electrons on the inside of the can , and they will be pulled away to the outside .
We can keep adding as many electrons as we like to the inside of the can , and they will always be pulled to the outside .
Putting all three tricks together
So now let 's look at the Van de Graaff generator with our three tricks in mind .
The motor moves the rubber band around and around .
The rubber band loops over the glass tube and steals the electrons from the glass .
The rubber band is much bigger than the glass tube .
The electrons stolen from the glass are distributed across the whole rubber band .
The glass , on the other hand , is small .
The negative charges that are spead out over the rubber band are weak , compared to the positive charges that are all concentrated on the little glass tube .
The strong positive charge on the glass attracts the electrons in the wire on the top brush .
These electrons spray from the sharp points in the brush , and charge the air .
The air is repelled from the wire , and attracted to the glass .
But the charged air can't get to the glass , because the rubber band is in the way .
The charged air molecules hit the rubber , and transfer the electrons to it .
The rubber band travels down to the bottom brush .
The electrons in the rubber push on the electrons in the wire of the bottom brush .
The electrons are pushed out of the wire , and into whatever large object we have attached to the end of the wire , such as the earth , or a person .
The sharp points of the bottom brush are now positive , and they pull the electrons off of any air molecules that touch them .
These positively charged air molecules are repelled by the positively charged wire , and attracted to the electrons on the rubber band .
When they hit the rubber , they get their electrons back , and the rubber and the air both lose their charge .
The rubber band is now ready to go back up and steal more electrons from the glass tube .
The top brush is connected to the inside of the soda can .
It is positively charged , and so attracts electrons from the can .
The positive charges in the can move away from one another ( they are the same charge , so they repel , just like electrons ) .
The positive charges collect on the outside of the can , leaving the neutral atoms of the can on the inside , where they are always ready to donate more electrons .
The effect is to transfer electrons from the soda can into the ground , using the rubber band like a conveyor belt .
It does n't take very long for the soda can to lose so many electrons that it becomes 12,000 volts more positive than the ground .
When the can gets very positive , it eventually has enough charge to steal electrons from the air molecules that hit the can .
This happens most at any sharp points on the can .
If the can were a perfect sphere , it would be able to reach a higher voltage , since there would be no places where the charge was more concentrated than anywhere else .
If the sphere were larger , an even higher voltage could be reached before it started stealing electrons from the air , because a larger sphere is not as " sharp " as a smaller one .
The places on our soda can where the curves are the sharpest are where the charge accumulates the most , and where the electrons are stolen from the air .
Airin an electric field of about 25,000 volts per inch .
Ionized air conducts electricity like a wire does .
You can see the ionized air conducting electricity , because it gets so hot it emits light .
It is what we call a spark .
Since our generator can draw sparks that are about a half inch long , we know we are generating about 12,500 volts .
Troubleshooting
If you are n't detecting any high voltage ( no sparks , does n't attract hair or paper ) then you might try some of these suggestions .
Try a different type of rubber band .
Some are slightly conductive , which at 12,000 volts means conductive enough to leak all the current you have so carefully built up .
Have a supply of many different types of rubber band to try .
Make sure everything is very clean .
Dirt and grease can be slightly conductive , and that will be enough to make the device fail .
Make sure the top brush is touching the metal of the can .
Some cans have a plastic coating inside .
Scrape it off ( or burn it off ) to make a better connection .
Make sure there are no sharp points extending outside the can .
It is OK to have sharp points pointing inside the can , from the cut part of the top .
Sharp points cause corona losses .
Make sure the brushes are not touching the rubber band .
This will put a coating of copper on the rubber , and make it conductive .
Make sure you have a good ground connection .
Make sure the motor is spinning fast .
Check our Message Board for more ideas , and be sure to search for " VDG " and " rubber band " to get all of the messages .
Since people can't spell Van de Graaff , you may want to try various spellings .
Some fun with the Van de Graaf generator
One of the fun things to do with a Van de Graaff generator is to show how like charges repel .
We take a paper napkin , and cut thin strips of the lightweight paper .
We then tape the ends of the paper together at one end , and tape that end onto the Van de Graaf generator .
The effect will look somewhat like long hair cascading down the soda can .
Now turn the Van de Graaff generator on .
The thin strips of paper all get the same charge , and start to repel from one another .
The effect is " hair raising " .
The strips start to stand out straight from the can , like the hair on the back of a scared cat .
A high voltage ion motor
This motor is very simple to build , and goes together in a few minutes .
All you need is two pieces of wire , the small metal cap from the fuse we took apart in the previous project , and some cellophane tape .
The motor creates an ion wind that spins it around like a helicopter .
First , take one piece of wire ( a straightened paper clip will do ) , and cut the end at an angle so it is sharp .
Bend the other end into a rough loop or triangle , so the wire will stand up with the sharp point facing straight up .
A little tape will help hold it onto the table , or a block of wood .
The armature ( the part that spins ) is made from the other piece of wire and the metal cap we saved when we took apart the fuse .
Sharpen both ends of the wire by cutting the ends at a diagonal , like we did with the base wire .
Bend the wire into an S shape .
The pointed ends of the wire should point at 90 degrees from the center straight part of the wire .
Attach the metal cap to the center of the wire with tape .
Place the cap onto the pointed end of the base wire , and bend the S shaped ends of the armature wire down , so it will balance easily on the sharp end of the base wire .
The armature should now spin freely if you tap it gently .
Connect a source of high voltage to the base wire using an alligator clip or a wire .
The high voltage source can be the Van de Graaff generator , or just a couple square feet of aluminum foil pressed against the front of your television set , as we did in earlier projects .
As the high voltage is turned on , the armature will start to spin in the direction away from the sharp points .
The Van de Graaff generator may need a good ground , or a person holding onto the ground wire .
The television will give the motor a good kick every time it is turned on or off , and turning it on and off every second will get it spinning quite rapidly .
How does it do that ?
The motor works by ionizing the air , and then pushing against the ionized air .
As we explained in the previous project , electric charges are concentrated by sharp points .
The sharp points on the ends of the armature concentrate the charges so much that the air around the points becomes charged as well .
Since the air has the same charge as the wire , the two repel one another .
You can actually feel a small wind coming from the sharp point .
As the wire pushes on the charged air , they both move away from one another .
The air blows away , and the wire spins .

Astronomers have identified a massive comet - like structure - spanning a whopping three million light years - that is tearing through a distant galaxy cluster at more than 750 kilometres a second .
Yes , you read that right .
A great ball of fiery gas* , some five thousand million times the size of the solar system .
Fortunately , it is n't anywhere near Earth .
The flaming gas - ball is in the Abell 3266 galaxy cluster , even more millions of light years away from us than it is across .
The fireball , which is the largest object of this kind ever identified , was spotted by stargazers using the European Space Agency 's XMM - Newton X - Ray telescope .
The researchers have produced an entropy map of the gas - ball , which allows them to pick out the relatively cold dense gas of the comet from the hotter gas of the galaxy cluster .
Analysis of the data has revealed remarkable detail of the stripping of gas from the comet 's core , ESA says , at a rate of about a Sun 's mass , every hour .
The scientists who discovered the object describe it as " truly fantastic " .
" In Abell 3266 we are seeing structure formation in action , " said Professor Mark Henriksen , co-author of the results .
" Dark matter is the gravitational glue holding the gas ball together .
But as it races through the galaxy cluster , a tug - of - war ensues where the galaxy cluster eventually wins , stripping off and dispersing gas that perhaps one day will seed star and galaxy growth within the cluster . "
Zurich - based researcher Dr. Francesco Miniati commented : " What interests astronomers is not just the size of the gas ball but the role it plays in the formation and evolution of structure in the universe . " ®
* Please take note that considerable restraint has been exercised , and no references to ' great balls of fire ' have been made in this article .
Two hurricanes in a month , petrol prices at $ 3 a gallon , a current account deficit of enormous proportions , a housing market that defies gravity : little wonder that the mood in the United States is a little edgy .
The International Monetary Fund made it clear last week that it saw the world 's largest economy as an accident waiting to happen .
The US could not continue to live beyond its means indefinitely , and there were only two ways to deal with the unsustainable imbalances in the global economy : the nice way or the nasty way .
The nice way , according to simulations by IMF staff , would involve a gradual slowdown in the pace of consumption in the US , accompanied by slightly higher real interest rates and a modest 15 % devaluation in the dollar over a few years .
The US current account would decline from 6 % of GDP to 3.5 % of GDP by 2010 and to 3 % over the long run .
The other main component of the soft - landing scenario would see a 15 % appreciation of currencies in the developing countries of Asia - China , for the most part - which would result in their current account surpluses shrinking to 2 % of GDP .
The nasty way involves a much sharper contraction in US activity .
Under this scenario , the overseas investors who have been funding the American trade deficit by buying US assets decide they have had enough .
The result is a large and sudden devaluation of the dollar , which adds to inflationary pressure and forces the Federal Reserve to raise short - term interest rates aggressively .
Protectionist pressures mount and this , together with the big appreciation of China 's currency , leads to much slower growth .
With both the world 's two big growth engines - the US and China - faltering , Europe and Japan also suffer .
Financial markets suffer hefty losses , adding to the gloom .
The IMF does not know how this will pan out - nor , to be honest , does anybody else .
On the plus side , it points to the fact that the past year has seen some progress on the agenda it has proposed for each key part of the global economy : the US budget deficit has been reduced , the Chinese have taken the first steps towards a more flexible exchange rate regime , the Japanese and the Europeans have committed themselves to structural reforms of their economies .
On the negative side , however , there has been no evidence thus far that the moves have been accompanied by an improvement in the global imbalances .
On the contrary , they appear to have got worse .
The communique issued by the G7 at the weekend aptly summed up the mood of uncertainty .
Although the global economy has continued to expand and the outlook was " positive for further growth " , it stressed that higher energy prices , growing global imbalances and rising protectionist pressures " have increased the risks to the outlook " .
Inflation
Oil prices are a real concern , despite relief that Hurricane Rita caused less damage than feared .
Prices have now remained higher for longer than policymakers expected , and the futures markets suggest they are going to stay high .
Demand is expected to remain strong and it will take years for investment in new fields and refineries to increase supply .
The inflationary impact of dearer energy is already becoming evident , with consumer confidence dented by falling disposable incomes and policymakers fretting about the effects on inflation .
Central banks will only take a relaxed view of higher oil prices when they can be really confident that activity will not be impaired .
Some analysts believe that it will not be long before the economy is affected .
Janet Henry of HSBC said that if petrol prices stayed at pre-hurricane levels , American consumers would spend an extra 1 % of disposable income just on fuel in the final quarter of 2005 , compared with the fourth quarter of 2004 .
She said : " The current bout of high oil could finally spell the end of the US consumer - leveraged expansion and a near - term end to the Fed tightening . "
It has certainly been the consumer that has kept the US afloat over the past few years .
As the IMF put it : " Fiscal and monetary policies in the United States became sharply expansionary - both absolutely and relative to other countries - thus sustaining domestic demand . "
America 's spending habit has been fed by exports from the rest of the world , with China playing an increasingly important role .
The forces of globalisation have given both sides of the transaction what they want : the US has been able to suck in low - cost goods while the developing countries of Asia have been able to enjoy export - led growth .
In the process , they have built up a huge stock of US assets , while the US has increased its stock of liabilities .
" Looking forward , the global imbalances are clearly unsustainable in the long term .
If the US external current account balance excluding investment income remained at its current level of more than 5 % of GDP , there would be an unbounded accumulation of external liabilities , " the IMF said .
It noted that so far the US had experienced little difficulty in financing imbalances but that there was no guarantee that this benign state of affairs would persist .
It is right to be wary .
On any reasonable assessment , a central part of any unwinding of the global imbalances will be a considerable devaluation of the dollar , which would leave those holding US assets nursing substantial losses .
Vacuum
To trigger a crisis , holders of US assets do n't necessarily need to sell them ; all they need to do is to stop buying more .
To be sure , the US can be allowed to continue along its current path , with the cooperation of the central banks of China , Japan and other Asian countries , but this would mean an even bigger adjustment in exchange rates when the day of reckoning finally arrived , and an even bigger haircut for those awash with US assets .
Apart from the dire consequences for the global economy that would result from a disorderly unwinding of the imbalances , there are two additional causes for concern .
One is that while the IMF has analysed the dilemma with aplomb , neither it nor any other body involved in global economic governance seems to have the clout to do anything about preventing a meltdown .
There is a vacuum that needs to be filled and urgently .
The second concern is this : underlying the policy recommendations of just about every global analyst is the belief that the rest of the world needs to emulate the economic model of the US .
The calls for structural reform in Japan and Europe stem from the belief that the Americans and the other " Anglo - Saxon " economies have the sort of flexibility that breeds success .
Yet that hardly squares with the IMF 's notion that the US economy could be going down the pan at any moment .
As Mark Weisbrot of the Centre for Economic and Policy Research , a Washington - based thinktank , points out , nor does it square with the long - term needs of sustainability .
Europe 's energy consumption per head is half that of the US : Weisbrot says the idea that the Europeans should work longer so that they can buy more things is dangerous and he 's right .
Perhaps the Germans were a lot smarter than they 've been given credit for in their scepticism about the need for neo-liberal structural reform .
Russia left out in the cold
All sorts of rumours were swirling around in Washington at the weekend when it was announced that Gordon Brown was to chair yet another meeting of the G7 in London in December .
One theory was that it was to give political impetus to the world trade talks in Hong Kong , which start two days later .
Another was that it was a special send - off to Alan Greenspan , who retires from the US Federal Reserve in January .
The neatest explanation , however , was that the G7 wanted to shaft Russia .
At the moment , Russia 's political clout means it is a member of the G8 , which last met at Gleneagles in July , but it is not deemed an important enough economy to join the finance ministers and central bank governors of the US , Britain , Germany , France , Italy , Canada and Japan at G7 meetings .
For the first time next year Russia will hold the presidency of the G8 .
Since meetings of the G7 are by tradition held in the country that is hosting the G8 , the Russians thought this was a chance to get into the rich man 's club by the back door .
But instead of holding the next meeting in February , the G7 has cunningly brought it forward to December in the UK , making it possible to leave the Russians out in the cold .
In reality that 's a sensible decision .
There is a strong case for membership of the G7 to be expanded , but China and India have a stronger case than Russia .
I just visited Yahoo Research which has several fundamental learning problems near to ( or beyond ) the set of problems we know how to solve well .
Here are 3 of them .
Ranking
This is the canonical problem of all search engines .
It is made extra difficult for several reasons .
There is relatively little “ good ” supervised learning data and a great deal of data with some signal ( such as click through rates ) .
The learning must occur in a partially adversarial environment .
Many people very actively attempt to place themselves at the top of
rankings .
It is not even quite clear whether the problem should be posed as ‘ ranking ’ or as ‘ regression ’ which is then used to produce a
ranking .
Collaborative filtering Yahoo has a large number of recommendation systems for music , movies , etc …
In these sorts of systems , users specify how they liked a set of things , and then the system can ( hopefully ) find some more examples of things they might like
by reasoning across multiple such sets .
Exploration with Generalization
The cash cow of
search engines is displaying advertisements which are relevant to search along with search results .
Better targeting these advertisements makes money ( a small improvement might be worth $ millions ) and improves the value of the search engine for the user .
It is natural to predict the set of advertisements which maximize the advertising payoff .
This natural idea is stymied by both the extreme
multiplicity of advertisements under contract ( think millions ) and a lack of ability to measure hypotheticals like “ What would have
happened if we had displayed a different set of advertisements for this ( query , user ) pair instead ? ”
This is a combined exploration and
generalization problem .
Good solutions to any of these problems would be extremely useful ( and not just at Yahoo ) .
Even further small improvements on the existing solutions may be very useful .
For those interested , Yahoo ( as an organization ) knows these are learning problems and is very actively interested in solving them .
Yahoo Research is committed to a relatively open method of solving these problems .

Interpal : Planned to sue for libel
In an out - of - court settlement , the Board of Deputies of British Jews said it should not have described Interpal in these terms .
London - based Interpal , which raises millions for Palestinian causes , had launched a libel action against the Board , due in the High Court next year .
The board has now published a retraction and apology on its website .
In the statement , the Board said it had reached a settlement with Interpal in relation to a September 2003 article on its website which referred to " terrorist organisations such as Hamas and Interpal " .
" We would like to make it clear that we should not have described Interpal in this way and we regret the upset and distress our item caused , " said the statement .
Interpal is one of the largest Muslim - led charities in Europe and says its funds humanitarian , educational and medical projects in the Palestinian territories .
The charity , which spends approximately £ 5 m a year , insists it keeps exhaustive records and audit trails of how its Palestinian partners spend money .
Claims from Washington
The row with the Board of Deputies began after the US Treasury Department accused Interpal of being part of the European " funding network " for Hamas , the largest militant Islamist organisation in the Palestinian territories involved in suicide bombings .
We are extremely pleased to have won such an important and long - running battle - all that we ever wanted was an apology to clear the charity 's name
Ibrahim Hewitt , Interpal
Officials claimed Interpal was a conduit through which other organisations could fund Hamas ' activities .
Washington said it would freeze any assets of the charity in the US and banned US nationals from having any dealings with the organisation .
The Charity Commission , the UK watchdog , froze the charity 's accounts and launched an investigation .
It later cleared Interpal , saying Washington had not been able to substantiate the claim .
The US Treasury has however kept Interpal on its list of suspected organisations , a situation that continues to infuriate many British Muslims .
Ibrahim Hewitt , chairman of Interpal , told the BBC that he welcomed the Board of Deputies ' apology .
The precise terms of the settlement would remain confidential , he said .
" We are extremely pleased to have won such an important and long - running battle , " said Mr Hewitt .
" All that we ever wanted was an apology to clear the charity 's name .
" We are glad that we can now put the Board of Deputies ' attack upon the charity behind us and can focus our energies entirely upon Interpal 's essential relief work . "
Mr Hewitt said Interpal was still trying to meet with US Treasury officials in an effort to have the charity 's name taken off the list of suspected organisations .
" We have been trying to negotiate with them - we 've always said they are welcome to come and check our systems . "
A spokesman for the Board of Deputies told the BBC there would be no further comment on the issue .

To my Arab brothers : The War with Israel Is Over  and they won .
Now let 's finally move forward By Youssef M. Ibrahim
http://www.JewishWorldReview.com
|
With Israel entering its fourth week of an incursion into the same Gaza Strip it voluntarily evacuated a few months ago , a sense of reality among Arabs is spreading through commentary by Arab pundits , letters to the editor , and political talk shows on Arabic - language TV networks .
The new views are stunning both in their maturity and in their realism .
The best way I can think of to convey them is in the form of a letter to the Palestinian Arabs from their Arab friends :
Dear Palestinian Arab brethren :
The war with Israel is over .
You have lost .
Surrender and negotiate to secure a future for your children .
We , your Arab brothers , may say until we are blue in the face that we stand by you , but the wise among you and most of us know that we are moving on , away from the tired old idea of the Palestinian Arab cause and the " eternal struggle " with Israel .
Dear friends , you and your leaders have wasted three generations trying to fight for Palestine , but the truth is the Palestine you could have had in 1948 is much bigger than the one you could have had in 1967 , which in turn is much bigger than what you may have to settle for now or in another 10 years .
Struggle means less land and more misery and utter loneliness .
At the moment , brothers , you would be lucky to secure a semblance of a state in that Gaza Strip into which you have all crowded , and a small part of the West Bank of the Jordan .
It is n't going to get better .
Time is running out even for this much land , so here are some facts , figures , and sound advice , friends .
You hold keys , which you drag out for television interviews , to houses that do not exist or are inhabited by Israelis who have no intention of leaving Jaffa , Haifa , Tel Aviv , or West Jerusalem .
You shoot old guns at modern Israeli tanks and American - made fighter jets , doing virtually no harm to Israel while bringing the wrath of its mighty army down upon you .
You fire ridiculously inept Kassam rockets that cause little destruction and delude yourselves into thinking this is a war of liberation .
Your government , your social institutions , your schools , and your economy are all in ruins .

Your young people are growing up illiterate , ill , and bent on rites of death and suicide , while you , in effect , are living on the kindness of foreigners , including America and the United Nations .
Every day your officials must beg for your daily bread , dependent on relief trucks that carry food and medicine into the Gaza Strip and the West Bank , while your criminal Muslim fundamentalist Hamas government continues to fan the flames of a war it can neither fight nor hope to win .
In other words , brothers , you are down , out , and alone in a burnt - out landscape that is shrinking by the day .
What kind of struggle is this ?
Is it worth waging at all ?
More important , what kind of miserable future does it portend for your children , the fourth or fifth generation of the Arab world 's have - nots ?
We , your Arab brothers , have moved on .
Those of us who have oil money are busy accumulating wealth and building housing , luxury developments , state - of - the - art universities and schools , and new highways and byways .
Those of us who share borders with Israel , such as Egypt and Jordan , have signed a peace treaty with it and are not going to war for you any time soon .
Those of us who are far away , in places like North Africa and Iraq , frankly could not care less about what happens to you .
Only Syria continues to feed your fantasies that someday it will join you in liberating Palestine , even though a huge chunk of its territory , the entire Golan Heights , was taken by Israel in 1967 and annexed .
The Syrians , my friends , will gladly fight down to the last Palestinian Arab .
Before you got stuck with this Hamas crowd , another cheating , conniving , leader of yours , Yasser Arafat , sold you a rotten bill of goods  more pain , greater corruption , and millions stolen by his relatives  while your children played in the sewers of Gaza .
The war is over .
Why not let a new future begin ?

EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
Watch an extended version of the interview , lasting 16 minutes
He says he spent two years looking for photographic evidence of alien spacecraft and advanced power technology .
America now wants to put him on trial , and if tried there he could face 60 years behind bars .
Banned from using the internet , Gary spoke to Click presenter Spencer Kelly to tell his side of the story , ahead of his extradition hearing on Wednesday , 10 May .
You can read what he had to say here .
Spencer Kelly :
Here 's your list of charges : you hacked into the Army , the Navy , the Air Force , the Department of Defense , and Nasa , amongst other things .
Why ?
Gary McKinnon : I was in search of suppressed technology , laughingly referred to as UFO technology .
I think it 's the biggest kept secret in the world because of its comic value , but it 's a very important thing .
Old - age pensioners can't pay their fuel bills , countries are invaded to award oil contracts to the West , and meanwhile secretive parts of the secret government are sitting on suppressed technology for free energy .
SK : How did you go about trying to find the stuff you were looking for in Nasa , in the Department of Defense ?
GM : Unlike the press would have you believe , it was n't very clever .
I searched for blank passwords , I wrote a tiny Perl script that tied together other people 's programs that search for blank passwords , so you could scan 65,000 machines in just over eight minutes .
SK : So you 're saying that you found computers which had a high - ranking status , administrator status , which had n't had their passwords set - they were still set to default ?
GM : Yes , precisely .
SK : Were you the only hacker to make it past the slightly lower - than - expected lines of defence ?
GM : Yes , exactly , there were no lines of defence .
There was a permanent tenancy of foreign hackers .
You could run a command when you were on the machine that showed connections from all over the world , check the IP address to see if it was another military base or whatever , and it was n't .
The General Accounting Office in America has again published another damning report saying that federal security is very , very poor .
SK : Over what kind of period were you hacking into these computers ?
Was it a one - time only , or for the course of a week ?
A bird or a plane ?...
Gary was not able to get a picture of what he saw
SK : And you went unnoticed for a couple of years ?
GM : Oh yes .
I used to be careful about the hours .
SK : So you would log on in the middle of the night , say ?
GM : Yes , I 'd always be juggling different time zones .
Doing it at night time there 's hopefully not many people around .
But there was one occasion when a network engineer saw me and actually questioned me and we actually talked to each other via WordPad , which was very , very strange .
SK : So what did he say ?
And what did you say ?
GM : He said " What are you doing ? " which was a bit shocking .
I told him I was from Military Computer Security , which he fully believed .
SK : Did you find what you were looking for ?
GM : Yes .
SK : Tell us about it .
GM : There was a group called the Disclosure Project .
They published a book which had 400 expert witnesses ranging from civilian air traffic controllers , through military radar operators , right up to the chaps who were responsible for whether or not to launch nuclear missiles .
They are some very credible , relied upon people , all saying yes , there is UFO technology , there 's anti-gravity , there 's free energy , and it 's extra-terrestrial in origin , and we 've captured spacecraft and reverse - engineered it .
SK : What did you find inside Nasa ?
GM : One of these people was a Nasa photographic expert , and she said that in building eight of Johnson Space Centre they regularly airbrushed out images of UFOs from the high - resolution satellite imaging .
What she said was there was there : there were folders called " filtered " and " unfiltered " , " processed " and " raw " , something like that .
I got one picture out of the folder , and bearing in mind this is a 56 k dial - up , so a very slow internet connection , in dial - up days , using the remote control programme I turned the colour down to 4bit colour and the screen resolution really , really low , and even then the picture was still juddering as it came onto the screen .
But what came on to the screen was amazing .
It was a culmination of all my efforts .
It was a picture of something that definitely was n't man-made .
It was above the Earth 's hemisphere .
It kind of looked like a satellite .
It was cigar - shaped and had geodesic domes above , below , to the left , the right and both ends of it , and although it was a low - resolution picture it was very close up .
This thing was hanging in space , the earth 's hemisphere visible below it , and no rivets , no seams , none of the stuff associated with normal man-made manufacturing .
SK : Is it possible this is an artist 's impression ?
GM : I do n't know ...
For me , it was more than a coincidence .
This woman has said : " This is what happens , in this building , in this space centre " .
I went into that building , that space centre , and saw exactly that .
SK : Do you have a copy of this ?
It came down to your machine .
GM : No , the graphical remote viewer works frame by frame .
It 's a Java application , so there 's nothing to save on your hard drive , or at least if it is , only one frame at a time .
SK : So did you get the one frame ?
GM : No .
SK : What happened ?
GM : Once I was cut off , my picture just disappeared .
SK : You were actually cut off the time you were downloading the picture ?
GM : Yes , I saw the guy 's hand move across .
SK : You acknowledge that what you did was against the law , it was wrong , do n't you ?
GM : Unauthorised access is against the law and it is wrong .
SK : What do you think is a suitable punishment for someone who did what you did ?
GM : Firstly , because of what I was looking for , I think I was morally correct .
Even though I regret it now , I think the free energy technology should be publicly available .
I want to be tried in my own country , under the Computer Misuse Act , and I want evidence brought forward , or at least want the Americans to have to provide evidence in order to extradite me , because I know there is no evidence of damage .
Nasa told Click that it does not discuss computer security issues or legal matters .
It denied it would ever manipulate images in order to deceive and said it had a policy of open and full disclosure , adding it had no direct evidence of extra-terrestrial life .
For me , the school year is back in full swing -- inasmuch as one can be when Labor Day still has n't rolled around yet .
For those of you who have forgotten , or who now look back upon your high school years through the rosy mists of fondness for that halcyon era when your head , not your back , was covered with hair and your tricep did n't flop around like a Tibetan prayer flag in a good stiff breeze , high school is organized into concentric circles of despair and Sisyphean drudgery which align quite nicely with the Nine Circles of Hell our friend and eternal optimist Dante Alighieri described so fully .
The freshmen have already had most of the pranks pulled on them -- like looking for a swimming pool on the roof , or looking for the smoking area , or being told that we have open campus for lunch , and so on .
They 've lost a bit of that dazed look -- unless it 's a permanent condition .
The " veteran " freshmen on the two - or three - year - plans are already falling back into their habits of trying to evade class as much as possible and still somehow be able to finagle enough credits to achieve sophomorehood .
They lust for a way to get over .
Those who lust for each other have tried to discover just where the security cameras do n't work .
Last year 's freshmen who made the cut to sophomores are hoping to have grown some -- the girls hoping to be able to fill out those teeny tanks they wear and the boys hoping to get closer to making that dunk on the basketball court .
The boys can eat the weight of a newborn elephant in one sitting .
Sophomores bear the grim visage of those who realize that they still must slog through an eternity of high school , and that as long ago as they were seventh graders ?
That 's how long it will be before they graduate .
The mathematically inclined have computed this sentence in Hell as the equivalent of 19.7 % of their lives thus far .
Most of the juniors are engulfed in a tsunami in post - high school planning , as the first deadline to register for the ACT was on the Friday after we started school , and they are frantically collecting honors to list on their aplications and recommendations from harried staff .
Those who swear that they 'll NEVER want to go to college or trade school or sit in a classroom again are sneering at their classmates who are wigging out .
They can't wait to get out of school so they 'll never have to do what anyone tells them , EVER AGAIN .
The seniors have slogged their way through all these levels only to discover that they are merely on the verge of true Hell .
They 've figured out to take AP and honors classes their first semester , and as soon as the transcripts are mailed off to their fifteen dream colleges to " drop them like it 's hot " and coast through the rest of the year .
The ones who SWORE that they would never want to go to college or trade school have lost a bit of that sneer as they are slowly coming to the realization that after antagonizing Mom and Dad for the last six years , what with the brushes with the law and the suspensions and the phone calls from school and the poor grades , their parents are COUNTING the days until they can tell their offspring that their bedroom has become an exercise room , and seven bucks an hour at TWO part time jobs at fast food joints minus something called FICA and social security will get them a run-down one bedroom apartment with three roommates , rides to work on a bus , peanut butter sandwiches , no vacations EVER -- much less three months in a row off , no health care , and tennis shoes from K - Mart , not Foot Locker .
No bling , no phat threads , and no pimpin ' any rides .
Suddenly four years of sitting in a classroom listening to someone drone on and on about 18th century British literature or the principles of accounting does n't sound nearly as stupefying as fifty years of soul - destroying repetitive labor where you come home at the end of the day with the smell of fried food permeating even your HAIR , which you now have to get cut at Great Clips four times a year .
They 've asked their uncle about that job at the Ford plant , but it 's shutting its doors in 2007 and outsourcing to Mexico under NAFTA , and soon their uncle may be delivering pizzas and competing with them for jobs -- and he , at least , has a history of showing up to work on time and following directions , which gives him a big leg up on them .
Gosh , is it too late to take the ACT ?
The teachers have once again realized that no matter how thick the student behavior guide is , that the assistant principals have pretty much no interest in enforcing the policies on tardiness , dress code , attendance , cell phones , smoking in the john , or insubordination unless it 's directed at them .
These teachers will " dis " these administrators with considerable bitterness .
They are already huddling in circles in the hallway , disputing the diagnoses buried in IEPs and 504s , and mocking memos from administration .
They have their own vision of what the school should look like , but theirs is not a theology bearing the imprimatur of the powers that be , so they just appear out of touch with reality .
Those who work hard and strive to inculcate their students with a love of learning are nonetheless vilified by the public and even some of their peers .
Those who think that students should be accountable for their shortcomings are considered to be child - hating misanthropes .
Many of the parents have already had all the phone calls from school they are going to tolerate .
They have blocked calls from any building in the district .
Others have been lurking malevolently in the counseling office since the end of July demanding that their kids ' schedules be changed about five times , or that an entire class be created to fully meet the needs of their son or daughter .
Already two hundred of them have tried to enroll their children in our district by claiming the address of the UPS store down the street , and if they do n't get what they want , they will try to intimidate anyone within hearing , including our sweet little white - haired registrar .
The counsellors and principals fall into various categories listed by Dante .
They either spent two years in a classroom and are 24 years old , or they spent two years in the classroom twenty years ago .
But no matter what , they are experts in good teaching methods and writing curriculum , or so they assure the staff .
Among them are : Panderers , who just want to be the students ' " friend ; " Flatterers , who will tell you that they think you 're a great teacher only to dump more work on you ; Simoniacs , who shower dispensations for referrals upon kids , in a bid to supposedly " save " them from the " Heretics ; " Hypocrites , who will merely counsel a kid who calls a teacher that word for " a person who would engage in carnal activity with his maternal relative " but who suspends a kid for six days for calling the AP a sexual deviate ; Sowers of Discord , Scandal , and Schism , who hang out all day with their favorite staff members in their office , trading gossip and innuendo regarding the rest of the staff -- they think that teachers are all incompetent , hyperbolic , child - hating misanthropes .
The central office administrators and school board .
They will bizarrely give permission for five hundred kids who supposedly live at the UPS store down the street to attend schools in our district , and they will refuse to investigate reports that students are being dropped off at bus stops in cars with license plates from a neighboring state .
They will overturn suspensions upon a whim .
They will go to the National School Board Association meeting in Miami with their entire families while they tell teachers there is no money for raises and their deductible for health insurance will need to triple .
They think that teachers are all incompetent , hyperbolic , child - hating misanthropes who are overpaid .
And how would our friend Dante describe this abode ?
“ And when , with gladness in his face , he placed his hand upon my own , to comfort me , he drew me in among the hidden things .
Here sighs and lamentations and loud cries were echoing across the starless air , so that , as soon as I set out , I wept .
Strange utterances , horrible pronouncements , accents of anger , words of suffering , and voices shrill and faint , and beating hands — all went to make tumult that will whirl forever through that turbid , timeless air , like sand that eddies when a whirlwind swirls . ”
[ Dante , as he enters the Gates of Hell .
Canto III , Inferno ]

On May 15 my site SpamOrHam.org was mentioned in a story on the front page of Slashdot .
Up until the moment when a link to the site appeared on Slashdot people had been visiting the site and classifying about 100 messages per hour ( that 's period A in the chart below ) .
All that changed at 1530 GMT on May 15 .
In the first half an hour ( until 1600 ) around 3,300 classifications were made ( an increase of 33 x ) .
Point B on the chart is the peak of 9,803 classifications in an hour that occurred during the hour starting 2000 GMT .
By this time the story was no longer number one on the Slashdot ( it was demoted from the number one spot at 1628 GMT ) .
At point C the site dropped from its peak classification rate , this occurred nine hours after the story first hit Slashdot .
Those nine hours correspond to 0700 to 1600 in California and 1000 to 1900 in New York ; peak working hours in the US .
The second significant peak occurs at point D occurred 22 hours after the story hit Slashdot ; that corresponds to 1100 GMT on May 16 .
During this period the US is sleeping , but Europe is awake and working .
There 's a smaller peak that I 've labeled E which occurs 16 hours after the story hit the front page .
That 's 0500 GMT which just happens to be 1500 in eastern Australia and similarly the middle of the afternoon in Asia .
Happily although the site is no longer on Slashdot , classifications remain 5 x higher than before it was mentioned .

" Wenn man im Paradies lebt , will man ja nicht so schnell weg " Mathias Bröckers
Ein Gespräch mit Dr. Albert Hofmann , dem Entdecker des LSD , der heute 100 Jahre alt wird
" Ici Rittimatte , 629 m. " steht auf dem Schild neben einem Grenzstein aus der napoleonischen Zeit .
Die Grenze zu Frankreich verläuft direkt über diese Bergwiese in den Ausläufern des Schweizer Juras .
Hier steht das " Bänkli " mit weiter Aussicht über das Baseler Land und den Konturen der Vogesen und Schwarzwalds am Horizont , der Lieblingsplatz eines Mannes , der - sowohl was die Ausblicke , als auch was die Grenzen des Bewusstseins betrifft - Geschichte gemacht hat : Dr. Dr hc. mult .
Albert Hofmann , der Entdecker des LSD .
Heute wird Albert Hofmann 100 Jahre alt .
Doch auch wenn er seit einer Hüftoperation vor drei Jahren mit Stöcken gehen muss , lässt er es sich an diesem strahlenden Augusttag nicht nehmen , mit uns die 500 Meter von seinem
Haus hinauf zum " Bänkli " zu spazieren .
Albert Hofmann und Timothy Leary in Hamburg , 1993
Mit seinem Verleger und Freund Roger Liggenstorfer und zwei Dokumentarfilmern war ich am Morgen gekommen , um ein Gespräch zu führen - und auch jetzt , am Nachmittag und nach einigen Stunden Interview , zeigt unser Gastgeber keine Spur von Erschöpfung .
" Jetzt versteht ihr , warum ich diesen Platz hier als mein Paradies bezeichne " , sagt er , als wir auf der Bank sitzen und von der Weite des Himmels und der traumhaften Sommerlandschaft gebannt sind .
" Eigentlich ist die Rittmatte hier meine allergrößte Entdeckung . "
Nach seiner Pensionierung als Leiter der Naturstoffabteilung der " Sandoz AG " 1971 entdeckte er diesen Platz und baute sich mit seiner Frau Anita dort das Haus , in dem sie jetzt seit 35 Jahren leben .
Doch die Entdeckung , die ihn weltberühmt machte , fand am 18 .
April 1943 statt , als Albert Hofmann eigentlich auf der Suche nach einem Kreislaufmittel war .
In einer Frühstückspause bei einem Honigbrot und einem Glas Milch fiel ihm die Lysergsäure wieder ein , die er 1938 als Wirkstoff des Pilzes " Claviceps purpurea " identifiziert und in verschiedenen Verbindungen hergestellt hatte .
Der vor allem auf Getreide schmarotzende Pilz wird " Mutterkorn " genannt und wurde schon seit dem Altertum als blutstillendes , die Gebärmutter kontrahierendes Naturmittel in der Geburtshilfe eingesetzt .
Albert Hofmann und seine Kollegen hatten aus seinen Wirkstoffen das bis heute in allen Kreißsälen verwendete Standardpräparat " Methergin " gewonnen .
Sieben Jahre später , fasste Hofmann in einer " merkwürdigen Vorahnung " den Entschluss , eine dieser Verbindungen , das Lsyergsäure - Diäthylamid , noch einmal herzustellen .
Während der Arbeit spürte er mit einem
Mal ein merkwürdiges Unwohlsein und notierte in einem Protokoll :
... Ich musste mitten am Nachmittag meine Arbeit im Laboratorium unterbrechen und mich nach Hause begeben , da ich von einer merkwürdigen Unruhe , verbunden mit einem leichten Schwindelgefühl , befallen wurde .
Zu
Hause legte ich mich nieder und versank in einen nicht unangenehmen rauschartigen Zustand , der sich durch eine äußert rege Phantasie kennzeichnete .
Im Dämmerzustand bei geschlossenen Augen - das Tageslicht empfand ich als unangenehm grell - wirkten dagegen ununterbrochen phantastische Bilder von außerordentlicher Plastizität und mit intensivem , kaleidoskopartigem Farbenspiel auf mich ein .
Nach zwei Stunden verflüchtigte sich der Zustand .
Albert Hofmann
Als erfahrener Chemiker , der unter Laborbedingungen und stets kontrolliert arbeitete , konnte sich Hofmann anfangs kaum vorstellen , dass sein Zustand etwas mit den Substanzen zu tun haben könnte , mit denen er an diesem Tag gearbeitet hatte .
Er ging alle seine Arbeitsschritte dieses Morgens noch einmal durch und hatte zunächst ein chloroform - ähnliches Lösungsmittel in Verdacht .
An das LSD dachte er als Allerletztes , weil es ja schon fünf Jahre zuvor pharmakologisch untersucht worden war und er es an diesem Morgen nur kristallisiert hatte .
Heute sagt Albert Hofmann , dass er das LSD nicht entdeckt hat , sondern dass es zu ihm gekommen sei :
Das Lysergsäure - Diäthylamid hatte ich ja nur umkristallisiert und nichts davon eingenommen und du arbeitest doch absolut sauber , dachte ich mir .
Wenn es das gewesen sein sollte , müsste es ja geradezu saumäßig wirksam sein .
Als ich am Montag wieder im Labor war , nahm ich dann die kleinste Menge davon ein , die man sich überhaupt denken kann - und das war , wie sich später herausstellte , noch fünfmal zu viel und brachte mich dann auf einen Horrortrip .
Aber dieses erste Mal , mit diesen Träumen , dazu kann ich nur sagen : das LSD hat mich gerufen , ich habe es nicht gesucht .
Es ist zu mir gekommen , es hat sich gemeldet ...
Wenn sich das LSD nicht von sich aus gemeldet hätte , wäre die Substanz wieder in die Pharmakologie gekommen und die hätte wieder nichts gefunden , und damit fertig , Schluss ...
Aber es hat mich erwischt , irgendwie , es hat sich mir offenbart ...
Was Hofmann an diesem Apriltag des Jahres 1943 widerfuhr - die tiefenpsychologische Kraft pflanzlicher Alkaloide , die Pharmakologie der Bewusstseinsveränderung - , war erst wenige Jahre zuvor überhaupt in das Blickfeld der Wissenschaft geraten .
Der Berliner Pharmakologe Louis Lewin hatte mit seiner Untersuchung über " Phantastica " die ersten Forschungsberichte über die Wirkung halluzinogener Pflanzen vorgelegt .
In Heidelberg hatte Kurt Beringer Ende der 20er Jahre das Meskalin untersucht , den Wirkstoff des Peyote - Kaktus , der von den Indianern Südamerikas sakrale Droge verehrt wird .
Vor seinem Haus auf der Rittimatte , 1989
Mit der Entdeckung des LSD trat die Erforschung dieser Substanzen in eine neue Dimension .
Nicht nur , weil schon die Menge eines Staubkorns - 50 Mikrogram - eine wirksame Dosierung darstellte , sondern vor allem , weil diese Wirkung nicht nur medizinisch - therapeutisch , sondern auch für die wissenschaftliche Erforschung des Bewusstseins äußerst vielversprechend schien .
Von der Wunderdroge zum Sorgenkind
Die " Sandoz AG " begann mit der Erprobungsphase des neuen Medikaments .
Wie jedes Arzneimittel wurde auch " Delysid " , so der Markenname , zahlreichen Prüfungen und Tests unterzogen , man stellte es Wissenschaftlern und Ärzten zur Verfügung , die damit neue Behandlungsansätze in der Psychotherapie und Psychiatrie erprobten .
Es entstanden zahlreiche Studien , die äußerst vielversprechende Resultate zeigten - etwa bei Alkoholikern , die von ihrer Sucht loskamen , bei unheilbar Schwerkranken , deren psychischer Gesamtzustand sich stabilisierte , bei autistischen Patienten , die durch die LSD ansprechbar und therapierbar wurden .
Der tschechische Psychiater Stanislav
Grof bezeichnete LSD in diesem Zusammenhang als " Mikroskop und Teleskop der Psychiatrie " , da es verdrängte , sonst kaum zugängliche Seelenanteile , ans Licht brächte .
In den ersten zwei Jahrzehnten nach seiner Entdeckung erschienen über 1.000 Fachartikel , die solche ermutigenden Ergebnisse bei insgesamt über 40.000 Patienten beschrieben ( sehr viele Studien wurden von Erowid eingescannt und sind online abrufbar ) .
Mit dem DJ Goa Gill bei einer Techno - Party im Baseler Land , 2002
Da die Versuche stets in einem kontrollierten Setting stattfanden und die Klienten vorab in Kenntnis gesetzt worden waren , dass LSD außergewöhnliche Bewusstseinszustände auslöst , kam es bei diesen Anwendungen kaum zu negativen Auswirkungen .
LSD galt so für viele Wissenschaftler und Therapeuten bis Anfang der 60er Jahre als eine Art Wundermittel .
Namentlich Timothy Leary , Psychologie - Dozent der renommierten Harvard University , gab dann aber die Distanz zu seinem Forschungsobjekt auf und wurde völlig euphorisiert zu einer Art Missionar des LSD - Gebrauchs .
Wegen der Propagierung von LSD bei Jugendlichen sind Leary später von Albert Hofmann schwere Vorwürfe gemacht worden .
Das Verbot des LSD folgte bald .
Seit Mitte der 60er
Jahre zählt es zu den illegalen Betäubungsmitteln ; Herstellung , Besitz und Gebrauch sind seitdem weltweit verboten .
Diesen
Weg von der Wunderdroge zum verbotenen Betäubungsmittel hat Hofmann in seinem Buch " LSD - Mein Sorgenkind " ausführlich beschrieben - und wie kaum ein anderer vor dem unsachgemäßen Gebrauch der Substanz gewarnt .
" Wenn man im Paradies lebt , will man ja nicht so schnell weg ! "
Als wir uns für das Interview in seinem Wohnzimmer zusammensetzen , weist er darauf hin , dass er über all das , was er in seinen Büchern schon beschrieben hat , eigentlich nicht mehr reden will : " Das hab ich dort alles besser und ausführlicher gesagt , das müssen wir nicht mehr wiederholen . "
Okay , uns interessiert ja auch am Meisten , wie man es schafft , als 100 - Jähriger noch so erstaunlich vital und geistig rege zu bleiben .
Welche Methoden hat Albert Hofmann dafür angewendet ?
Albert Hofmann : Das hat sich so ergeben .
Das kann man nicht planen .
Ich hatte irgendwie immer wieder das Glück , Positives zu erleben .
Wenn etwas Negatives kam - dann kam , sozusagen wie vom Himmel ... wieder etwas Positives .
So hat sich das immer wieder ausgeglichen .
Ich glaube , dass ich die Gnade hatte , offene Sinne zu behalten - und unser Bewusstsein wird ja von den Sinnen genährt .
Ich habe bis heute keine Brille und keine Hörgeräte ... und ich habe wirklich das Gefühl , dass ich auf die Natur höre , auf das , was uns gegeben ist .
Deshalb bin ich auch so skeptisch gegenüber dieser technischen Kultur - weil : wir verpassen ja das Paradies !
Wir vermauern und verbrettern unsere Sinne mit dieser Technisierung .
Und ich bin noch zu Hause in der Natur , nicht in der technischen Welt .
Ich glaube , das ist einer der entscheidenden Fehler unserer heutigen
Welt :
Wir kommen immer mehr ab von dem , was da ist , von diesem großen Geschenk , wir nehmen es nicht einmal mehr wahr - und rackern uns ab mit technischen Problemen .
Wenn ich in der Stadt hätte leben müssen , wäre ich mit Sicherheit schon lange gestorben , schon lange tot .
Ich habe das Glück , dass ich hier auf der Rittimatte im Paradies lebe - und wenn man im Paradies lebt , will man ja nicht so schnell weg .
Hat auch das LSD dabei eine Rolle gespielt , dass Sie so lange geistig wach und jung geblieben sind ?
Albert Hofmann : Ich müsste zwei Leben haben , um das zu beantworten : eines mit und eines ohne LSD .
Dann könnte man das wissenschaftlich beurteilen .
So kann ich das ja nicht .
In meinem LSD - Buch ( " LSD - Mein Sorgenkind " ) steht ja am Anfang dieses mystische Naturerlebnis als Kind , das ja absolut einem LSD - Erlebnis glich , dieses Einssein mit der Natur .
Irgendwie , glaube ich , war mir das angeboren .
Sie waren 1943 Offizier in der Schweizer Armee und mussten neben der Arbeit im Labor monatlich zum Dienst bei der Grenzsicherung ...
Albert Hofmann : Ja , immer für drei Monate war ich weg , im Tessin , die Südgrenze bewachen , gegen Mussolini ....
...um zwischendurch auf dem Höhepunkt des Weltkriegs die Substanz zu entdecken , die als " geistige Atombombe " bezeichnet worden ist .
Würden
Sie die alte Hippie - Parole unterschreiben , dass dann , wenn alle Generäle einen erfolgreichen LSD - Trip unternehmen würden , mehr oder weniger automatisch der Weltfrieden eintritt ?
Albert Hofmann : Das kann ich auch nicht beantworten .
Man müsste es wissenschaftlich untersuchen .
Aber ich denke , es wäre einen Versuch wert .
In diesem Zusammenhang fällt mir eine Geschichte ein : Irgendwann kam einmal eine junge Frau in mein Laboratorium .
Ich fragte sie , wie sie hier in die Fabrik überhaupt hineingekommen sei , und sie antwortete in Englisch : " I can pass everywhere , I am an angel . "
Und sie sagte : " Sie müssen mir helfen , dass der amerikanische Präsident LSD bekommt . "
Sie hieß Johanna , wie die Heilige Johanna der Franzosen .
Ich wunderte mich immer noch , wie sie überhaupt in das Sandoz - Gebäude hineingekommen war .
Aber ich konnte ihr natürlich nichts geben . "
Die Tore der Wahrnehmung werden geöffnet und wir sehen plötzlich mehr von der Wahrheit
Sie haben das Bewusstsein in einem Sender - Empfänger - Modell beschrieben : der ganze Planet als Sender und jedes einzelne Bewusstsein als Empfänger ...
Albert Hofmann : Unsere Sinne sind die Antennen , darüber kommt alles herein , das Bewusstsein ist der Empfänger .
Alles was wir im Bewusstsein haben , ist irgendwann einmal durch die Sinne hineingekommen - bei Geburt ist es gleichsam ein leeres Bewusstsein und wird dann durch all das gefüllt .
Und ein paar Millionstel Gramm LSD verändern die Wahrnehmung dramatisch - es ist nicht nur einfach das bekannte Bild , ein bisschen verzerrter oder bunter , es ist ein völlig anderes Programm ...
Albert Hofmann :
Und das deshalb , weil LSD unsere Sinne verändert , man sieht besser , man hört besser , alles wird intensiviert .
Insofern hatte auch Timothy Leary recht , wenn er behauptet , es sei auch das größte Aphrodisiakum .
Der Mechanismus des LSD ist ganz einfach : Die Tore der Wahrnehmung werden geöffnet und wir sehen plötzlich mehr - von der Wahrheit ...
Und das ist manchmal sehr verwirrend ...
Albert Hofmann : Ja , man erschrickt .
Man hat ein völlig anderes Bild und das kann einen furchtbar erschrecken .
Deshalb sagen die Indianer ja : bevor ich den heiligen
Pilz nehme , muss ich fasten , muss ich beten , muss ich rein sein - dann bringt mich der Pilz dem Göttlichen näher .
Und wenn ich das nicht mache , tötet er mich oder macht mich wahnsinnig .
Das haben die Indianer , lange bevor LSD und Psylocibin entdeckt wurden , gesagt - und die amerikanische Jugendbewegung , die es ja gut meinte , hat sich daran nicht gehalten , sie haben es zu oberflächlich genommen , sie haben sich nicht vorbereitet ...
Albert Hofmann mit dem LSD - Molekül , ca. 1950
Dieses alte Wissen wurde anfangs nicht vermittelt , die meisten , die LSD nahmen , wussten nicht , was es ist , und kamen erst mit der Zeit dazu , damit richtig umzugehen ...
Albert Hofmann : Das ging alles zu schnell .
Es hätte sich entwickeln müssen , die Erkenntnis , dass es etwas Sakrales ist , das heißt , die Wiederentdeckung , denn eigentlich ist es schon seit mindestens 3.000 Jahren bekannt , dass es etwas Besonders ist .
So wie der " heilige Trank " im antiken Eleusis , den Sie und Gordon Wasson in dem Buch " Der Weg nach Eleusis " als LSD - ähnliche Substanz identifiziert haben .
Auch Tim Leary und seine Kollegen in Harvard , Ralph Metzner und Richard Alpert , haben ja immer auf die Wichtigkeit von " Set & Setting " hingewiesen und das alte Ritualwissen gewissermaßen in die Neuzeit transportiert - aber Leary hat LSD gleichzeitig auch , typisch amerikanisch , angepriesen wie ein Wanderprediger oder Handelsvertreter ...
Albert Hofmann :
Er hat es ja jedem geradezu aufgedrängt .
Das habe ich nie getan .
Dennoch bin ich überzeugt , dass die Menschheit lernen wird , damit umzugehen in Zukunft .
Und wenn man überlegt , wie so ein modernes Eleusis aussehen könnte , dann wäre das zuerst ein Ort , eine schöne natürliche Umgebung , in der man Meditationsferien macht , wo man fastet , ruht und betet ... sich vorbereitet .
Und wo dann solche Substanzen ihrem Sinn entsprechend angewendet werden .
Der Priester von Eleusis wusste , weil jeder einen Vorbereitungskurs machen musste , die richtige Dosierung für jeden einzelnen - und wir wissen ja heute eigentlich auch alles , um dafür zu sorgen , dass es nie einen schlechten Trip gibt ...
Naturwissenschaft und Mystik
Als wissenschaftlicher Pionier im " Weltraum der Seele " kam Albert Hofmann mit vielen Künstlern und Kreativen in Kontakt .
Mit dem Schriftsteller Ernst Jünger verband ihn eine über 50 - jährige Freundschaft , Jünger hat ihre gemeisamen LSD - Experimente in seinem Buch " Annäherungen - Drogen und Rausch " beschrieben .
Auch Aldous Huxley korrespondierte mit Hofmann und besuchte ihn in der Schweiz ; er ließ sich vor seinem Tod , zum Übergang in einen anderen Bewusstseinszustand , von seiner Frau LSD geben .
Huxley benutzte es .
Wie steht Albert Hofmann zu dieser
Art von LSD - Verwendung als Sterbebegleitung ?
Albert Hofmann : LSD wurde schon vor Jahrzehnten in dieser Richtung verwendet , bei sterbenden Krebskranken , wo selbst Morphine nicht mehr gegen die Schmerzen wirkten ...
Ich bin überzeugt , dass das künftig auch ein Thema werden wird , dass man mit LSD diesen Übergang erleichtern kann .
Irgendwann hat jemand Ernst Jünger gefragt : " Glauben Sie , dass das Leben nach dem Tod weitergeht ? " und er antwortete : " Nein , ich weiß es ! "
Und das kann man auch als Naturwissenschaftler verstehen : Nichts kann aus Nichts entstehen , und aus etwas was ist , kann nicht Nichts werden - es gibt nur Umwandlungen .
Wir können nicht sagen , woher wir kommen - dass irgendeine Supermaterie am Anfang stand und dann knallte und den Raum erzeugte ... das ist doch alles dummer Mist .
Darüber wissen wir nichts , das ist das große Wunder .
Aus unseren Erfahrungen können wir nur sagen :
Es gibt Nichts , das aus Nichts entsteht , und Nichts , das zu Nichts zerfällt .
Es gibt immer nur den Wandel .
Und wenn man die Naturwissenschaft und alle ihre Entdeckungen weiter denkt , stößt man immer wieder auf ein Geheimnis .
Ich habe unlängst eine CD mit den Vorträgen Einsteins gehört .
Dort spricht er auch darüber , und er sagt wörtlich , ich habe mir den Satz gut gemerkt : " Das Schönste und Tiefste , was ein Mensch erfahren kann , ist das Gefühl des Geheimnisvollen . "
Wenn man in das Tiefste der materiellen Wirklichkeit vorstößt , wie Einstein es getan hat , stößt man unweigerlich auf das Wunder , auf das Geheimnisvolle .
Weiter kommen wir nicht .
Hier stoßen wir auf dasselbe Mysterium , das auch schon die Menschen in Eleusis erfahren haben .
Ein Interview , das Sie der " Basler Zeitung " letztes Jahr gegeben haben , war mit dem Zitat überschrieben " Unsere Zeit braucht LSD " ...
Albert Hofmann : Das war ein Nebensatz , den haben sie zum Titel gemacht .
Vor zehn Jahren noch wäre das völlig unmöglich gewesen .
Also wenn das kein Fortschritt ist , wenn selbst eine brave , brave bürgerliche Zeitung so titelt .
In den ersten zehn Jahren nach seiner Entdeckung galt LSD als wahres Wundermittel , dann kam das Verbot , die Dämonisierung - und jetzt scheint das Pendel wieder zurück zu gehen , zu größerer Akzeptanz .
Selbst an der Harvard - Universität finden wieder LSD - Studien statt .
Albert Hofmann : Ja , das habe ich verfolgt .
Es ist sicher ein Wandel .
Vor allem weil man entdeckt hat , dass diese Pflanzen , in denen man schon vor 3.000 Jahren Stoffe wie LSD oder Psilocybin gekannt und benutzt hat , mit den Substanzen in unserem Gehirn , wie Serotonin , sehr eng verwandt sind .
Die Pflanzen geben uns Nahrung , sie geben uns Heilmittel und sie geben uns auch Medikamente für das Bewusstsein .
Die Pflanze produziert aus dem Sonnenlicht unsere Nahrung und unsere Atemluft .
Und unser Bewusstsein ist letztlich nichts anderes als die höchste Umwandlung dieser Sonnenenergie .
Wir sind Sonnenkinder !
Unser menschliche Energie ist Sonnenenergie - entstanden aus dem Atomreaktor , den der Herrgott genügend weit weg gesetzt hat , dass er uns nicht gefährlich werden kann .
Nur das Gute kommt von der Sonne , der Ballast , der Atommüll bleibt oben - nur der Mensch , dieser Idiot , glaubt , er müsste die Sonne auf die Erde holen und hier Atomkraftwerke bauen .
Es ist Prometheus , der den Menschen sagt , dass sie die Sonne nicht brauchen und er ihnen das Feuer vom Himmel holt - und für diesen Übermut wird er von Zeus bestraft und muss unendliche Schmerzen erleiden , weil er den Schöpfer beleidigt hat .
In diesem Mythos ist schon alles erzählt - die Griechen waren ein geniales Volk .
Albert Hofmann , 2003
Jetzt ist die Menschheit dabei , sich mit diesem Geschenk des Prometheus selbst zu eliminieren , mit dem Feuer aus Öl und Kohle das Klima und die globalen Kreisläufe zu ruinieren und mit Atomkraft Leben auf Jahrtausende zu vernichten ...
Albert Hofmann :
Als ich in einem Buch einmal über den " Atomreaktor Sonne " geschrieben habe und die naheliegenden Dinge , die wir hier besprochen haben , erhielt ich eine Einladung von Atomphysikern , darüber einen Vortrag zu halten .
Die wussten das ja alles schon , aber sie hatten dieses ganz Einfache aus dem Blick verloren , sie konnten es nicht formulieren :
Dass doch alles schon da ist , dass die Pflanzen und die Natur alles bieten , was wir brauchen , die Sonne genügend Energie liefert und dass nur die Menschen saudumm sind ...
Ernst Jünger hat ja dafür plädiert , das LSD nur Auserwählten zugänglich sein soll ...
Albert Hofmann : Ja , er wollte das irgendwie nur für die Elite ...
Während Huxley und später Leary sich für die kontrollierte Anwendung für jedermann einsetzten ...
Albert Hofmann : Huxley wollte ja so etwas wie eine neue Religion erreichen .
Das hatte Jünger nie im Sinn .
Er wollte die Eliten erreichen , beziehungsweise meinte , die kämen schon von selbst dazu , das breitet sich aus in ihren Kreisen und das genügt .
Arthur Koestler , ein Freund von Huxley , hat sich einmal kritisch geäußert und LSD mit einem Skilift verglichen ...
Albert Hofmann : Ja , die Geschichte mit dem Bergsteiger , der zu Fuß zum Gipfel aufsteigt , der den Berg erobert und dem anderen , der einfach mit dem Lift hinauffährt .
Nach Koestlers
Ansicht muss man alle Qualen auf sich nehmen , um das richtige Gipfelerlebnis zu haben - aber Huxley erwiderte , dass die Aussicht dieselbe sei .
Wie sehen Sie das ?
Albert Hofmann : Man muss schon wandern .
Man muss sich innerlich vorbereiten - und das allein ist oft schon schwer genug .
Viele Leute wissen ja gar nicht , was Meditation ist .
Aber jetzt sollten wir mal ums
Haus wandern , in die herrliche Sonne draußen - und die Stille anhören .
Die Interview - Zitate Albert Hofmanns stammen aus einem längeren Gespräch , das Mathias Bröckers und Roger Liggenstorfer für ihr Buch " Albert Hofmann und die Entdeckung des LSD - Auf dem Weg nach Eleusis " ( AT - Verlag , 2006 ) führten .

Aus Anlass des 100 .
Geburtstags findet vom 13 .- 15 .

Death penalty for corruption to remain for now
By Guan Xiaomeng ( Chinadaily.com )
Updated : 2005-09-02 17:25
Officials with the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) , China 's top legislative body have denied discussions are under way to abolish the use of capital punishment for those involved in serious economic crimes .
Punishments for such non-violent offenses have long been in the legal limelight in China with many speculating legislators would move to abolish the most serious punishment under the law - the death penalty - in the most egregious cases .
The speculation , countered in statements by Premier Wen Jiabao , remains inconsistent with the current domestic criminal legislative and jurisdictional practices .
It also does not reflect the current fundamental realities in the country , officials said , echoing Wen .
A spokesman for the Supreme People 's Court explained that though the death penalty will for the long term be preserved , application of the punishment is under tighter scrutiny than ever to reduce the number of death sentences .
Courts are acting cautiously when conducting trials on those possibly facing the penalty .
Zakaj pa ti blogaš ?
Ha ?
No , zakaj ?

Najpogostejše vprašanje mojih prijateljic zadnjih dni .
In vprašanje , ki ga prej ali slej zapiše na svoj blog skoraj vsak bloger .
Vem , vem , grozovito dolgočasno vprašanje , ki je bilo zapisano že milijonkrat .
Nekateri menijo , da blogerji blogajo zato , ker iščejo pozornost , ker hočejo biti v koraku z modernimi smernicami , ker se morajo nekako po/hvalit in izraziti ( express yourself ) , ker hočejo biti pripadniki neke skupnosti , ker želijo blog izkoristiti za svojo poslovno promocijo in dodatni zaslužek .
Nekateri blogerji menijo , da imajo za povedat pomembne reči , ki bi jih drugi ljudje morali prebrati .
Ali pa samo zato , ker je kul biti bloger ?
Priznam , tudi sama sem imela podobno mnenje pol leta nazaj .
Sploh na osnovi nekaj površno prebranih blogov , ki so to mnenje vsekakor potrjevali .
Večina ljudi meni o bloganju podobno kot Maddox .
Vzrokov za pisanje blogov ne bom kategorizirala in ne bom jih komentirala .
Saj mnogi pisci blogov pišemo tudi iz večih zelo različnih , a tudi prepletajočih se vzrokov in nagibov .
V štirih mesecih , kar sama pišem blog ( no ja vem , sem še čista fazanka , eh kaj zdaj tu pametujem ? ) , sem prišla do nekaj ugotovitev .
Predvsem pa to tega , da ljudje pišemo bloge še iz številnih drugih razlogov .
Nekateri ga uporabljajo za “ branding ” , delitev svojega znanja , pa tudi za ustvarjanje pozitivne podobe tega , s čimer se ukvarjajo .
V to kategorijo pogosto padejo “ business blogs ” .
Nekateri uporabljajo blog za izpovedno terapijo .
Namesto psihiatra .
Z izpovednimi zapisi si očistijo dušo in olajšajo bremena .
Nekateri pišejo blog , ker v resnici nimajo drugih socialnih stikov .
Pišejo zato , da nekdo bere in se z njimi pogovarja , da vedo da jih nekdo vseeno posluša .
Nekateri pišejo blog , ker neskočno radi pišejo , imajo mnenje , ki ga želijo izraziti , Nekateri uživajo v ustvarjanju , oblikovanju svojega bloga .
Kar nekaj ljudi piše blog za ustvarjanje vzajemne komunikacije .
Nekateri pišejo blog v iskanju popularnosti in rekordnih dosežkov .
Nekateri potrebujejo več samopotrjevanja .
Pisanje blogov mnogim koristi v pridobivanju novih znanj .
Ko pripravljaš prispevek za blog , se ob raziskovanju in prebiranju podobnih tem , lahko veliko naučiš .
Spet eni pišejo blog , ker živijo daleč od družine in prijateljev in so tako nekako povezani .
Zagotovo je tudi nekaj ljudi , ki blogajo v silni želji nad kontrolo – samih sebe in drugih .
Hm , teli zgoraj našteti razlogi niso kaj prida globoki , kajne ?
Večina se v kakšnem od razlogov vsaj malo najdete .
Prav veliko pa tudi ne , kajne ?
Svojo kreativnost po pisanju in ustvarjanju pa ja lahko izražamo še na številne druge načine .
Zakaj ravno blog ?
In nenazadnje : prepričana sem , da obstaja tudi kdo , ki piše blog zato , ker trdno verjame , da lahko s svojim pisanjem spreminja svet .

やや唐突ですが僕の友人のユダヤ系アメリカ人から面白いメモをもらったので、本人了解のもと転載します（名前は一応仮名にしておきます）。原文は英語ですが適当に訳してみました。事実誤認など突っ込みどころ満載なんですがあまりに面白いのでそのままにしてあります。
僕から見ると皮肉が利きすぎているように思うのですけど、本人はいたって大真面目のようです（笑）。どっかに載せるつもりなんだろうか。止めといた方がいいと思うけどなあ。わはは。
日本語で上手な文章を書くには
アイザック・シュワルツ（仮名）
私たちには日本の公立学校に通う小学6年生の娘がいる。彼女は小学生になる前から日本で暮らしているため日本語には不自由していないのだが、毎年の夏休みの課題でどうしても良い評価をもらえないものがある。読書感想文だ。
日本の小学校には課題図書というものがあり、全国の小学生たちはみな同じ本を読んでそれについて感想文を書くことになっている。どうやら私の娘は今年もまた良い評価をもらえなかったようだ。
妻と私自身はアメリカで教育を受けており、娘にはどのように文章を構成するかについて一通り教育をしてきたつもりだ。しかしことここに至って、私たちは根本的に何かが間違っているように思えてきたのだ。
そこで、娘から伝え聞いた教師の評価や、日本でいわゆる名文といわれている文章を調査した結果、少なくとも日米では「良い文章」といわれているものに大きな違いがあることがわかってきた。
以下はその違いをもとに私なりにまとめた、日本語で上手な文章を書くための「べからず（Don'ts）」リストだ。私たちと同様にアメリカで教育を受けた皆さんには信じられない内容だろうが、日本ではこのような特徴を持った文章が――小学生の読書感想文に限らず、新聞の社説でも――良いとされているのだ。何かの参考になれば幸いだ（娘の成績向上とか）。
ところで、私の目下の悩みは、こうした特長を持った日本的「名文」を書くよう、娘を指導するかどうかというものだ。何しろ私自身、このような文章を書くことについてはとても自信があるとはいえない。こうして今書いている文章ですら、自分で挙げた「べからず」をひとつとして守っていないのだから・・・。
日本語で上手な文章を書くには：10の「べからず」
1. 何について述べている文章なのかは最後まで明らかにしてはいけない
日本では、何を問題としているのか、何がテーマなのかが最後までわからない文章が良いとされている。冒頭で目的を述べるなどはもってのほかだ。
具体的には 、 「 一度テーマらしきものを述べた後、すぐにそれを否定し、代わりのテーマは最後まで明らかにしない」といった手法が挙げられる。日本では非常に多様されるレトリックだ。
2. わかりやすい構成の文章を書いてはいけない
通常の文章構成である、イントロダクション、主題、結論、という三部構成は、日本ではあまりに型にはまりすぎており面白みのないものとされている。
曖昧模糊として脱線、反復や省略が多く、読者それぞれに異なる印象を残す文章が「良い文章」なのだ。
3. 結論を冒頭に述べてはいけない
我々にとっては一般的な結論を冒頭で述べることは、日本では「味気ない」ものとされている。読者の楽しみを奪ってしまうためだ。
4. 結論を最後に述べてもいけない
皆さんは驚かれるかもしれないが、日本語の良い文章とされるためには、結論は最後に述べてもいけないのだ。
それでは結論はどこに、と思われるだろうが、とにかく結論らしきものは文章のどの場所であっても明確に述べてはならない。日本では、結論を明確に述べるのは文章の余韻を殺す、ぶしつけなものとされているのだ。
代わりに、まるで俳句のように、結論は読者が行間――文脈（context）とやや似た概念だがより幅が広い――を「読む」ことで見つけるものとされている。当然読者により「結論」は異なるわけだが、日本ではそのような解釈の多様性の存在――曖昧さとも言うが――が良いとされているのだ。
これは非常に高度なテクニックであるため、身に着けるには長期に渡る修練が必要となるだろう。正直今の私にはとてもこのような文章は書くことはできない。
ただ、手っ取り早くそれらしい文章を書くには、「べからず1」と同様に、「一度結論らしきものを述べた後、すぐにそれを否定し、しかし代わりとなる結論は述べない」という手法が使えるだろう。
5. ひとつひとつの文章はできるだけ長く曖昧なものとしなければいけない
日本では、接続詞を多用し、ひとつの文章をできる限り長くするべきとされている。途中で主語や述べている対象が変わったり、文の最初と最後で正反対の主張をしているように見える文章が、味わい深い良い文章なのだ（何度読んでも何も言っていないように読める文章はもっと良い）。
同様に、パラグラフもなるべく改行をせずに、話題が変わってもそのまま続けて長く書くことが望ましい。
6. 主張は断言せず、曖昧に述べなくてはいけない
どんなに根拠のある主張であっても、それを明確に言い切ってはいけない。「・・・と思う」「・・・ではないか」など、自信無げに述べるのがつつましく奥ゆかしい名文の条件だ。
また、できることなら、自分が主張しているのではなく、誰かがそう言っている、と述べる方が良い。特定の誰かでも良いが、「大衆」などの曖昧な主語を用いるのがより望ましい。この場合、著者は「大衆」には含まれないのは暗黙の了解とされる。
達人ともなると、誰がそのような主張をしているのか、まったく特定することができないような文章を書くものだ。感服せざるを得ない。
7. 主張の根拠を明示してはいけない
我々はひとつの主張につき最低三つはサポートとなる議論を用意するべき、と教えられるものだが、日本ではこうした形式をとってはいけない。引用は許されるが、出典は記述してはならない。あまりに形式ばった文とされるためだ。
8. 客観的な記述は控えなくてはならない
何かの理由を述べるときは、なるべく主観的に、自分自身の印象、感情や経験に基いて述べるべきだ。誰かがそういっていた、という伝聞や、昔読んだ歴史小説などに基くのも好ましく、事実多用されている（ただし出典は明記してはならない）。
客観的な事実を具体的な事例やデータと共に挙げることは間違ってもしてはならない。押し付けがましくなり、文章の品格がなくなるからだ。
9. 他人の主張を批評してはいけない
日本では、誰かが書いたものを批評することは、もっともしてはいけないこととされている。どんなに冷静な批評であっても、全人格的な侮辱としてとらえられるからだ。
更に、我々には信じがたいことだが、ある人の主張を批判的に検討することすら、その人への侮辱であると考えられている。日本では、誰かの主張を特定し具体的な批評を行うことは、非常に品性のない行為とされているのだ。
従って、他人が書いたものを批評するときは、曖昧に行わなくてはならない。ここでも、一度書いたことをすぐに否定する、というレトリックが多用される。また、「うまく言えないのだが・・・」
「言葉にならないのだが・・・」などを用いて、自らに非があるように見せかけるのも良いだろう。
私見だが、これは曖昧な結論の多様な可能性の中からひとつだけを取り出して批評するという行為が好ましくないとされていることに起因しているように思える。文章とはすなわちその人の作品であるから、読者はそれを部分に刻まずに、多様な結論の可能性をそのまま受け入れるべきなのだ。
10 . どうしても他人の主張を批評する必要がある場合は、主張そのものではなく、その人の生い立ちや人となりについて述べなくてはならない
これも我々には信じがたいことだが、日本では、他人の主張そのものについての批評は避けられているが、その人の人格に関する論評は大いに行われている。
つまり、ある主張について具体的に検討したい場合は、主張そのものを扱うのではなく、著者の生まれや育ち、人となり、また思想信条を問題としなければならないのだ。
残念ながら、この理由についてだけは、私には今回の調査では皆目見当がつかなかった。娘の進学のためにも、今後も継続して日本的名文の秘密に迫っていくつもりだ。
Washington Roundup
Who would have believed that twitchy paranoiacs are actually onto something ?
Incredibly , they are : the New York Times has revealed that the US National Security Agency ( NSA ) has been spying on American citizens .
Previously , the Agency had shown itself to be scrupulous about avoiding this sort of activity .
But according to numerous un-named sources paraphrased in the Times , the President signed a secret order authorizing him to intercept phone calls and emails from US persons in communication with persons outside the US , and all without the slightest bit of judicial oversight .
The White House claims that a September , 2001 Congressional resolution authorizing the so - called war on terror gives the President authority to conduct domestic surveillance without a warrant , even though it is forbidden by federal law .
Interestingly , the Times says that the spy program was curtailed when it became clear to the Administration that the story was about to come out , which implies something a bit shy of full confidence that the order really was legal .
The US Senate on Friday declined to re-authorize the 16 sunset provisions of the so - called " Patriot " Act , and promptly packed its bags for the holidays .
Senate Republicans fell short of the 60 votes needed to halt a Democrat filibuster , and the Act's 16 sunset provisions are therefore bound to expire at the end of the year .
A large minority of Members believe that the re-authorization conference report lacks adequate provisions for judicial oversight .
Senate majority leader Bill Frist ( Republican , Tennessee ) has threatened to keep the Senate in session until the Act is re-authorized , presumably very briefly , say , until Congress comes back to work next year .
But Frist is on the record saying that a temporary re-authorization is unacceptable , and the White House has echoed this as well .
It does not seem likely that Frist would get more than a temporary agreement , so keeping the Senate in session hardly seems worth the bother .
Meanwhile , the House last week rolled over on the Pat Act and approved the conference report , but it did something uncharacteristically brave as well .
It defied the White House on torture as a method of fighting the so - called war on terror .
The Administration has been extremely keen on stopping an anti-torture bill sponsored by past torture victim and current US Senator John McCain ( Republican , Arizona ) , notwithstanding the fact that the President , the Secretary of State , and the Attorney General have all insisted publicly that the USA does not torture anyone , or condone torture at the hands of its allies .
So why the Administration should be so adamantly opposed to a bill which outlaws something it never does sure is a puzzler .
Although the House passed a resolution , rather than the actual bill , it sent a clear signal to the White House that the veto it had threatened can easily be overridden .
And this had the very pleasant effect of persuading the President to praise McCain and his bill during a press conference .
Updating our recent item
It 's official : Diebold election bugware can't be trusted , we find that the North Carolina Board of Elections has certified Diebold systems ( and two competitors ' systems ) without obtaining all of the source code as required by state law .
Now , it 's quite possible that there 's not much of a story here , as it's unclear if Diebold is being given a pass , quite understandably , because it simply has n't got the source code to some of the software it uses ( physical impossibility is a mighty good defence ) , or if it 's being given special permission to flout the law .
We will know more soon , as the EFF is suing the state elections board .
" The Board of Elections has simply ignored its mandatory obligations under North Carolina election law , " EFF spokesman Matt Zimmerman explains .
We 'll soon see if it really is that simple .
It is also worth noting that company CEO Walden O'Dell resigned unexpectedly last week , to the delight of investors and critics alike .
O'Dell had the rather poor judgment to express publicly his dedication to seeing " Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the President . "
The company has failed to shake off the suspicions raised by such a partisan statement from a fellow in charge of a company that makes notoriously buggy election terminals .
In entertainment news , Washington 's most popular lobbying outfit , the Motion Picture Ass. of America ( MPAA ) , has given the kiss of death , otherwise known as an NC - 17 rating , to a documentary movie critical of - you guessed it , the MPAA .
The movie , entitled This Film Is Not Yet Rated , will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival and will be aired on the Independent Film Channel .
MPAA says that it axed the movie due to " some graphic sexual content " .
Quite a few movie theaters and video rental outfits refuse to carry NC - 17 movies , so only a very small number of people will be perverted by its erotic naughtiness , or its skepticism . ®
Britain has almost doubled the value of arms exports to Israel , according to official figures released yesterday .
Arms exports to Israel approved by the government totalled £ 22.5 m last year , almost twice the amount in 2004 , according the latest annual report on strategic export controls published by four government departments .
The report was released as the Liberal Democrat Leader , Sir Menzies Campbell , yesterday urged Tony Blair to suspend any further arms exports to Israel .
" In light of disproportionate military action by Israel in Lebanon and Gaza the UK government must suspend any further arms exports to Israel , " Sir Menzies wrote to the prime minister .
He said the government was right to ensure there were no arms transfers , either direct or indirect , from Britain to Syria , Iran " or illegal armed groups such as the military wing of Hizbullah " .
He added : " The government must now comply with its own arms export rules and institute an immediate suspension of all UK arms exports to Israel . "
Licences approved for Israel last year included components for combat helicopters , aircraft radars , air - to - surface missiles and airborne electronic warfare equipment .
Special licences were also approved for the sale to Israel of components for military training aircraft , naval radars , naval communications equipment , and optical sensors for unmanned air vehicles .
These do not include components made by British companies in US Apache helicopters and F - 16 bombers sold to Israel .
The government provoked a storm of protest in 2002 by introducing new guidelines on the sale of military components .
It cleared the way for head - up display units ( HUDs , for presenting data without blocking view ) - made by BAE Systems , Britain 's largest arms company - to be sold to the US for use in F - 16 planes .
Ministers said the move was dictated by the interests of British arms companies .
British equipment used in American Apache helicopters supplied to Israel includes missile trigger systems .
Saferworld , an independent London - based thinktank campaigning against the arms trade said yesterday that the Foreign Office 's human rights report states : " The UK opposes the Israeli policy of targeted killings , which are illegal under international law " .
Paul Eavis , director of Saferworld , said yesterday : " The government must assert a coherent policy towards countries that display a disregard for human rights " .
Lebanon 's president accused Israel on Monday of using phosphorous bombs in its attacks , Reuters news agency reported from Paris .
" According to the Geneva Convention , when they use phosphorous bombs and laser bombs , is that allowed against civilians and children ? "
President Emile Lahoud asked on France 's RFI radio .
An Israeli military spokeswoman said : " Everything the Israeli defence forces are using is legitimate " .

Mike Shedlock , in his consistently thoughtful and informative blog , provides an excellent summary of the box canyon in which the Fed finds itself .
In a post titled , Billmon Gets it — Do You ? , he writes :
One of the reasons for these repetitive bubbles is the Fed does not itself know what inflation is .
They think they can micromanage the economy when all they are doing is chasing their tale due to the lagging effect of their actions .
At some point , and I think we are at that point right now , a sort of economic zugzwang [ chess term ] is reached .
I spoke about this in Red Queen Race …
In economic terms , there is no magic mirror .
Bernanke is trapped in “ Wonderland ” but unlike Alice has no way out .
Bernanke gets to choose between hyperinflation and deflation .
The moment he can not run fast enough , the US economy will implode .
If he runs too fast , the value of the US dollar as well as the Fed ’s power will both come to a very abrupt stop .
In effect Bernanke is in Zugzwang and he does not even know it .
Eventually Bernanke ( like the Bank of Japan ) will have to choose deflation .
The reason is simple : hyperinflation will end the game , which in turn would eliminate the wealth of the Fed as well as all of their power .
I mostly agree with Shedlock ’s analysis of where we are and how we got here .
I also recommend his article , Inflation :
What the heck is it ? for an Austrian - minded view of the credit cycle and inflation .
I agree with Shedlock that the Fed will at some point face a choice between deflation and hyperinflation .
I will give a short outline of why this is the case , and then suggest some reasons for choosing the inflation card .
Inflation is the expansion of money in a fractional reserve banking system .
The inflationary effects on prices of monetary expansion have long been understood .
The Austrian economist von Mises developed a theory of the boom and bust cycle based on bank credit expansion .
His analysis showed that inflation not only affects prices in general , but also distorts relative prices between capital goods and consumption goods .
This leads to an over - allocation of productive investment into more credit - sensitive parts of the economy , which is reflected in financial markets through increases in financial asset prices .
The stock market bubble of the 90s was an example of this , as was the subsequent housing bubble .
Markets are always trying to bring prices back to equilibrium .
Under the influence of market forces , investments that were artifacts of an inflationary boom are eventually liquidated in bankruptcy .
It is the adjustment of relative prices that brings the economy back to a sustainable balance of borrowing and saving .
However , this adjustment process tends to be deflationary .
The deflation occurs because , as the artificial forms of life created during the credit expansion phase of the cycle fail and default on their debts , bank credit money is destroyed .
When credit money is destroyed and there is a contraction of the money supply .
This process can feed on itself through the inter - bank clearing mechanism and the debt - deflation spiral ( see here for more discussion of this ) .
The corrective liquidation process can be postponed for some time through the instigation of another bout of inflation .
This has been the Fed ’s strategy since the mid-80s .
When in doubt , print more money .
( See Antony Müller ’s Mr. Bailout for an excellent short history . )
After the collapse of the stock market bubble , the Fed ’s Brobdignagian inflation campaign has succeeded in creating a housing bubble , and now a commodities bubble .
But the ability of a central bank to reinflate is not without limit .
The central bank must eventually face a final choice between hyperinflation and deflation for several reasons .
One reason is that each inflation cycle starts from a position in which the distortions of the previous cycle have not been fully liquidated .
The economy becomes more fragile and less able to digest the next round of money printing .
But the ultimate check on the central bank ’s ability to inflate is hyperinflation .
While the expansion of the supply of money and credit can lead to rising prices , and a high rate of credit expansion will produce a high rate of price inflation , there is no specific rate of expansion that will necessarily result in hyperinflation .
Hyperinflation originates in the money demand side , not the money supply side .
When the population comes to the en masse realization that the central bank has no intention of ever abandoning its policy of continued inflation , they begin to reject the existing fiat currency as a medium of exchange .
Panic selling ensues , as anything that can still be bought for money is bid up in price as people frantically attempt to get rid of all their money while it still has some value .
As money demand approaches zero , prices rapidly multiply then explode .
For example , the current hyperinflation in Zimbabwe has driven the price of a single roll of toilet paper up to a reported $ 145,750 Zimbabwe .
When does the central bank face this limit ?
When the reinflation no longer works to maintain the artificial forms of life that were created during the boom .
This limit is reached because , while the central bank can print money , they ca n’t control exactly where it goes .
The inflationary nature of the credit - driven boom is hidden from most people as long as the prevalence of easy credit does not translate into rising prices of consumption goods .
If for example , assets that make people feel wealthier — stocks and houses — are going up in price , it will not be perceived as a process of monetary debasement .
However , if the monetary injection escapes the confines of asset prices its true inflationary nature becomes more clear to the general population .
If the prices of goods that people buy every day noticeably increase , then the risk of hyperinflation looms .
This process can feed on itself as people begin to sense that their money is worth less and less .
There comes a point where more money expansion will not go into the artificial assets that were created by the earlier rounds , but feed into an acceleration in the increase in the prices of ordinary goods .
This is the point where the central bank must choose between deflation and hyperinflation .
If they do not stop the inflation at this point , the credit expansion will increasingly run up the prices of goods and a rapid destruction of the money will result .
Mises described this point of no return in an oft - quoted passage :
There is no means of avoiding the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit expansion .
The alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as the result of a voluntary abandonment of further credit expansion , or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved .
When a central bank reaches this point , and they are unwilling to allow a deflation to occur , then it must inflate ever more rapidly .
In the case where financial assets have been the prime beneficiaries of previous bouts of inflation , the central bank must be willing to buy up the assets of banks and other leveraged financial entities with freshly printed money in order to prevent the asset prices from adjusting in relation to goods prices .
The adjustment will come instead as goods prices inflate faster than asset prices , so that asset prices deflate in relative terms only .
Must Bernanke choose deflation over inflation , as Shedlock says ?
Shedlock is correct in saying that hyperinflation would destroy the dollar and likely the Fed ’s credibility as well .
Indeed , this would argue against hyper-inflation .
But here are some thoughts on why this reason alone may not be enough , and why we will probably end up with hyperinflation :
If the Fed chooses deflation over inflation , that would also destroy its credibility .
A central bank is supposed to prevent both inflation and deflation .
Milton Friedman blames the Great Depression primarily on the Fed for not inflating enough .
This view is widely accepted among economists ( except Austrians ) .
Bernanke wholly subscribes to this view , to the point of literally apologizing on behalf of all central bankers for the Fed having allowing deflation before he was born .
He has even promised as a central banker in good standing never to let it happen again .
Who would doubt that the Fed would again be blamed by a generation of inflationist economists if it allowed the credit system to suffer a deflationary collapse ?
While a hyperinflation would destroy the banking system , so would a massive deflation .
The US banking system now has 60 — 80 % of its assets invested in housing through the direct ownership of mortgages , as well as indirect ownership through mortgage - backed securities .
A severe deflation would wipe out all of the equity in the banking system .
To therefore conclude that the Fed would choose deflation to save the banking system is a fallacy .
There might be some constituency for deflation , other than the Fed itself ( if you buy Shedlock ’s view of the Fed ) .
But I ca n’t think of what it would be .
On the other hand , there is also political pressure from the entities that would be most harmed from a deflation , most importantly , the financial entities who survive on debt and leverage .
The Fed cannot reliably predict the point at which the next inflation is their last one .
No button lights up on the central bankers economic control panel telling them exactly when they are on their last bubble .
Even if Bernanke were worried about a bit too much inflation , it is likely that he would attempt to postpone the inevitable crisis with one more dose of inflation .
After all , central banks subsist on the conceit that they can manage the economy .
As Hoppe argues in his book Democracy : The God that Failed , the democratic political system acts on a short time horizon .
A crisis postponed is a crisis that someone else will have to deal with , after the next election .
A short time horizon generates a built - in bias toward inflation .
While a deflation would cleanse the system of waste and maladjustment , it would require a degree of pain and forbearance , a virtue in short supply in a democracy .
Under a democratic regime , there is always a demand for the authorities to " do something " to prevent a crisis .
If a deflation were allowed to begin , then as banks began to fail , would there not be a great outcry for the crisis managers at the Fed to come up with some kind of a " plan to save the world , " as they have done so many times ?
What could this plan be , other than some kind of buyout of bank assets ?
Recall the Long Term Capital Management crisis .
A large hedge fund with loans from most of the major Wall Street banks was bailed out rather than allowed to fail .
Bernanke has a staunch ideological inclination toward inflation .
I have written on this topic before in my piece on Bernankeism .
Examination of a number of speeches and academic papers by Bernanke and his cohorts at the Fed reveals a number of crackpot anti-deflation schemes based on the monetization of financial assets .
These schemes are at minimum being studied by Fed researchers , and perhaps being prepared for implementation .
Their writings and speeches all suggest that the deflation card is already off the table .
Are these factors decisive ?
Perhaps not .
No one can say for sure what will happen .
But I certainly wo n’t be placing any bets against Bernanke and his fleet of helicopters .

The Best of Robert Blumen
The corporate spying scandal at Hewlett - Packard Co. has piqued the ire of prosecutors and politicians , but not of Mark Pawlick .
The New Hampshire dad figures the allegations of HP prying into private phone records , tailing board members and sending computer spyware to reporters are just examples of how America has become a society of snoops .
“ There ’s probably more surveillance than anyone is aware of .
It ’s just a fact of life , ” said Pawlick , who himself has resorted to a little spy craft , installing a tracking device on the car of his teenage stepdaughter .
“ These things do n’t surprise us anymore . ”
At a time when your bank tracks how and where you spend every dime , the federal government might be listening to your phone calls and your boss almost surely knows how many minutes you spend on EBay , the notion of personal privacy is changing fast .

HP ’s scandal highlights how conflicted those notions can be , in the same way people tsk- tsk at the invasive tactics of paparazzi as they thumb through the supermarket tabloids .
“ The public has a double standard , ” technology futurist Paul Saffo said , noting that it ’s difficult for people to get riled up when someone else ’s privacy is under attack , particularly if it makes for interesting reading .
At the same time , though , “ we take it for granted we ’re being watched , ” Saffo said .
“ We all know we ’re being watched , but we assume no one who ’s watching us cares . ”
To be sure , there ’s a vast legal and ethical chasm between a parent electronically monitoring a child ’s behavior and a giant corporation such as HP hiring detectives to follow people around or pose as someone to gain access to their private phone records .
That latter practice is known as “ pretexting . ”

The lengths to which HP went may have crossed ethical and legal lines -- California Atty .
Gen. Bill Lockyer is weighing criminal indictments and the FBI is investigating -- but spying has become part of modern life .

“ You really have , in a good and bad sense , a democratization of surveillance technology , ” said Lee Tien , senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a nonprofit technology advocacy group .
For $ 155 , for instance , nervous new parents can buy a wireless camera small enough to hide in a smoke detector to keep tabs on the nanny .

Beth Givens of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse in San Diego knows one man who is such a privacy “ zealot ” that he considers any piece of junk mail a violation of personal space .
But he volunteered that he would willingly do a background check if he felt something was amiss about his daughter ’s boyfriend .
Indeed , he even went dumpster diving to investigate the dealings of a corporation he had invested in .
“ People are conflicted , but they are in all aspects of life , ” Givens said .
“ They have one set of standards for themselves and another for others , including large corporations . ”
Pawlick , for instance , used global positioning technology to monitor where his stepdaughter went -- and how fast .
The tracker e-mailed him when she exceeded the speed limit or drove to parts of town he had designated as off - limits .

“ I was out there basically doing this to protect her from herself , ” Pawlick said .
That sentiment writ large has fueled a significant increase in the amount of personal data collected by the federal government in recent years -- and a certain resignation by the public .
A Gallup poll found in May that 4 in 10 people supported the National Security Agency ’s collection of phone records of average Americans .
“ In a post - 9/11 world , the whole attitude toward privacy and surveillance has had a tendency to trip in favor of surveillance , ” the EFF ’s Tien said .
The 2001 attacks and ensuing war on terrorists opened the door to heightened surveillance by law enforcement and intelligence agencies as well .
They increased taping of Americans ’ phone calls and voicemails and clandestinely accessed bank and credit card transactions .
Authorities are even using supercomputers to crunch enormous amounts of personal data and attempt to predict who might become a terrorist .

Companies do the same , often starting with background checks on prospective workers .
And people make it easier than ever , by posting personal information to social networking websites such as MySpace or pictures to sites such as Flickr .
An electronic monitoring and surveillance survey conducted by the American Management Assn. found that 76 % of companies watch employees ’
Web surfing and half store and review e-mail messages and computer files .
More than half the 526 companies participating said they tracked the phone numbers employees called and how much time they spent on the phone , and an equal number used video surveillance to counter theft , violence and sabotage .
The National Workrights Institute in Princeton , N.J. , said electronic monitoring practices were even more pervasive -- occurring in 92 % of all workplaces .
“ It is today considered to be regular business practice to be monitoring employees , ” said Jeremy Gruber , the advocacy group ’s legal director .
“ And oftentimes , that monitoring is of middle level and rank - and - file employees .
And it is almost always with the direct order or acquiescence of the executives of the corporation . ”

Fair enough , said Chicago law student Emily Ho , but “ I think it ’s all a balancing act .

“ If we do n’t stop and think about what we ’re doing right now , we ’re in serious trouble .
It ’s already bordering on 1984 . ”
Except , unlike in George Orwell ’s dark vision of the future , Winston Smith has just as much power to spy as Big Brother .
And gadgetry is only part of the arsenal .

“ But when information ’s available in a new way , in which it is searchable , it ’s very quick and easy to access , you do n’t have to leave your desk to check how much your neighbor ’s home sold for .
When it ’s that easy to do , I think more people are going to do it . ”
Sometimes , Ruth Houston thinks spying is not only appropriate but also necessary .

One Silicon Valley executive who recently came to Saffo ’s house for dinner matter - of - factly said he read all of his children ’s e-mails .
“ He said , ‘ That ’s the price of your freedom .

LONDON , July 17  A year after the police shot and killed a Brazilian electrician in the subway after apparently mistaking him for a suicide bomber , prosecutors said Monday that they would not charge any individual officers in connection with his death .
But the senior reviewing officer for the Crown Prosecution Service , Stephen O’Doherty , said the death of the Brazilian , 27 - year - old Jean Charles de Menezes , had been the “ cumulative result ” of police errors .
As a result , prosecutors said , the office of the Metropolitan Police commissioner , Sir Ian Blair , would be charged with failing to protect the health and safety of Mr. Menezes .
“ After the most careful consideration , I have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against any individual police officer , ” Mr. O’Doherty said in a statement , explaining that the two officers who fired a total of seven shots at Mr. Menezes genuinely believed he was a terrorist .
To be acquitted of the health and safety charge , the police must establish that they did everything possible to protect Mr. Menezes ’s safety .
If convicted , they face a fine to which there is no limit set by law .
In a statement , they said they were “ concerned and clearly disappointed . ”

--杜甫
This year , Bonkers Bolton and his Gang of Three ( Brits , French , Germans ) have managed to get the other members of the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors and the United Nations Security Council to commit assisted suicide , seriously undermining  as intended  the authority and effectiveness of the United Nations itself .
First , the IAEA  whose primary mission is to " seek to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace , health , and prosperity throughout the world . "
On Feb . 4 , 2006 , Bolton got the IAEA Board to pass a resolution [ . pdf ] that ( a ) begins by stipulating " that nothing in the Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable rights of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research , production , and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination , " but then perversely ( b ) goes on to not only deny Iran its inalienable NPT rights , but also presumes to make additional demands on Iran as an NPT - signatory .
Bolton had already attempted ( but failed ) to drastically modify the NPT at the 2005 NPT Review Conference , removing the demands made on us and the rights bestowed on everyone else .
Now , the IAEA Board " deemed it necessary " that Iran  inter alia  " ratify promptly and implement in full the Additional Protocol " to its NPT Safeguards Agreement .
Of course , the IAEA Board has no authority to make any such demands .
So recess - appointee Ambassador Bolton brought the IAEA resolution before the UN Security Council , which does .
But upon first referral , all Bolton got was a UNSC non-binding presidential statement , which begins ,
" The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and recalls the right of States Party , in conformity with articles I and II of that Treaty , to develop research , production , and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination . ”
Bummer .
Meanwhile , with Bush - Blair acquiescence  if not downright encouragement  the Israelis had launched a bona fide " act of aggression " against Lebanon .
Bolton soon had his hands full , preventing the Security Council from condemning Israel for it flagrant violations of the UN Charter , while strong - arming it into passing Resolution 1696 , which
“ Acting under Article 40 of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations
" Demands , in this context , that Iran shall suspend all enrichment - related and reprocessing activities , including research and development , to be verified by the IAEA . ”
What does that mean  " acting under Article 40 " ?
Well , Bolton had earlier strong - armed the IAEA Board of Governors into asking the Security Council to determine that Iran ’s refusal to re-suspend  as " required " by the UNSC presidential statement  certain IAEA safeguarded activities constituted under Article 39 a “ threat to the peace , breach of the peace , or act of aggression . ”
Article 40 says
" In order to prevent an aggravation of the situation , the Security Council may , before making the recommendations or deciding upon the measures provided for in Article 39 , call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable .
Such provisional measures shall be without prejudice to the rights , claims , or position of the parties concerned .
The Security Council shall duly take account of failure to comply with such provisional measures . "
Now , the Security Council has yet to determine under Article 39 that Iran ’s safeguarded activities constitute a threat to the peace , much less an act of aggression .
So , technically , the Council should n’t yet be " acting under Article 40 . "
Nor should the Council call upon Iran to take without further delay the steps required by the IAEA Board in its resolution of Feb. 4 , which included requiring Iran to " ratify promptly and implement in full the Additional Protocol " to its NPT Safeguards Agreement .
An Additional Protocol  once ratified  can hardly be considered a " provisional measure . "
The Council should n’t be " demanding " that Iran suspend safeguarded uranium enrichment activities .
After all , Bolton and his Gang of Three have made it clear such suspensions will hardly be temporary " provisional measures , " taken " without prejudice " to the exercise of Iran ’s " inalienable rights " under the NPT .
As Iran ’s UN representative , Javad Zarif , put it upon passage of UNSCR 1696 :
“ Today we are witness to an extremely dangerous trend ; while members of the NPT are denied their rights and are punished , those who defy the NPT , particularly the perpetrators of [ the ] current carnage in Lebanon and Palestine , are rewarded by generous nuclear cooperation agreements . "
Having successfully established such a trend , it may not matter to recess - appointee Bolton whether he becomes permanent ambassador to the United Nations or not .
1+1=2
Order
Principia Mathematica ( through section 56 )
from Powell 's Principia Mathematica is famous for taking a thousand pages to prove that 1+1=2 .
Of course , it proves a lot of other stuff , too .
If they had wanted to prove only that 1+1=2 , it would probably have taken only half as much space .
Principia Mathematica is an odd book , worth looking into from a historical point of view as well as a mathematical one .
It was written around 1910 , and mathematical logic was still then in its infancy , fresh from the transformation worked on it by Peano and Frege .
The notation is somewhat obscure , because mathematical notation has evolved substantially since then .
And many of the simple techniques that we now take for granted are absent .
Like a poorly - written computer program , a lot of Principia Mathematica 's bulk is repeated code , separate sections that say essentially the same things , because the authors have n't yet learned the techniques that would allow the sections to be combined into one .
For example , section ∗ 22 , " Calculus of Classes " , begins by defining the subset relation ( ∗22.01 ) , and the operations of set union and set intersection ( ∗22.02 and .03 ) , the complement of a set ( ∗22.04 ) , and the difference of two sets ( ∗22.05 ) .
It then proves the commutativity and associativity of set union and set intersection ( ∗22.51 , .52 , .57 , and .7 ) , various properties like !!\alpha\cap \alpha = \alpha !! ( ∗ 22.5 ) and the like , working up to theorems like ∗ 22.92 : !!\alpha\subset \beta \rightarrow \alpha\cup ( \beta - \alpha ) !!.
Section ∗ 23 is " Calculus of Relations " and begins in almost exactly the same way , defining the subrelation relation ( ∗23.01 ) , and the operations of relational union and intersection ( ∗23.02 and .03 ) , the complement of a relation ( ∗23.04 ) , and the difference of two relations ( ∗23.05 ) .
It later proves the commutativity and associativity of relational union and intersection ( ∗23.51 , .52 , .57 , and .7 ) , various properties like !!\alpha\dot \cap\alpha = \alpha !! ( ∗ 22.5 ) and the like , working up to theorems like ∗ 23.92 : !!\alpha\dot \subset \beta \rightarrow \alpha\dot\cup ( \beta \ dot- \alpha ) !!.
The section ∗ 24 is about the existence of sets , the null set !!\ Lambda !! , the universal set !!{\rm V} !! , their properties , and so on , and then section ∗ 24 is duplicated in ∗ 25 in a series of theorems about the existence of relations , the null relation !!\ dot \Lambda !! , the universal relation !!\ dot {\rm V} !! , their properties , and so on .
That is how Whitehead and Russell did it in 1910 .
How would we do it today ?
A relation from S to T is defined as a subset of S × T and is therefore a set .
Union , intersection , difference , and the other operations are precisely the same for relations as they are for sets , because relations are sets .
All the theorems about unions and intersections of relations , like , just go away , because we already proved them for sets and relations are sets .
The null relation is is the null set .
The universal relation is the universal set .
A huge amount of other machinery goes away in 2006 , because of the unification of relations and sets .
Principia Mathematica needs a special notation and a special definition for the result of restricting a relation to those pairs whose first element is a member of a particular set S , or whose second element is a member of S , or both of whose elements are members of S ; in 2006 we would just use the ordinary set intersection operation and talk about R ∩ ( S×B ) or whatever .
Whitehead and Russell could n't do this in 1910 because a crucial piece of machinery was missing : the ordered pair .
In 1910 nobody knew how to build an ordered pair out of just logic and sets .
In 2006 ( or even 1956 ) , we would define the ordered pair < a , b > as the set {{a} , {a , b}} .
Then we would show as a theorem that < a , b> = < c , d > if and only if a=c and b=d , using properties of sets .
Then we would define A×B as the set of all p such that p = < a , b> ∧ a ∈ A ∧ b ∈ B .
Then we would define a relation on the sets A and B as a subset of A×B .
Then we would get all of ∗ 23 and ∗ 25 and a lot of ∗33 and ∗35 and ∗ 36 for free , and probably a lot of other stuff too .
( By the way , the {{a} , {a , b}} thing was invented by Kuratowski .
It is usually attributed to Norbert Wiener , but Wiener 's idea , although similar , was actually more complicated . )
There are no ordered pairs in Principia Mathematica , except implicitly .
There are barely even any sets .
Whitehead and Russell want to base everything on logic .
For Whitehead and Russell , the fundamental notion is the " propositional function " , which is a function φ whose output is a truth value .
For each such function , there is a corresponding set , which they denote by !! \hat x\phi( x ) !! , the set of all x such that φ ( x ) is true .
For Whitehead and Russell , a relation is implied by a propositional function of two variables , analogous to the way that a set is implied by a propositional function of one variable .
In 2006 , we dispense with " functions of two variables " , and just talk about functions whose ( single ) argument is an ordered pair ; a relation then becomes the set of all ordered pairs for which a function is true .
Russell is supposed to have said that the discovery of the Sheffer stroke ( a single logical operator from which all the other logical operators can be built ) was a tremendous advance , and would change everything .
This seems strange to us now , because the discovery of the Sheffer stroke seems so simple , and it really does n't change anything important .
You just need to append a note to the beginning of chapter 1 that says that ∼p and p∨q are abbreviations for p|p and p|p.|.q|q , respectively , prove the five fundamental axioms , and leave everything else the same .
But Russell might with some justice have said the same thing about the discovery that ordered pairs can be interpreted as sets , a simple discovery that truly would have transformed the Principia Mathematica into quite a different work .
Anyway , with that background in place , we can discuss the Principia Mathematica proof of 1+1=2 .
This occurs quite late in Principia Mathematica , in section ∗ 102 .
My abridged version only goes to ∗ 56 , but that is far enough to get to the important precursor theorem , ∗ 54.43 , scanned below :
The notation can be overwhelming , so let 's focus just on the statement of the theorem , ignore everything else , even the helpful remark at the bottom :
This is the theorem that is being proved ; what follows is the proof .
Now I should explain the notation , which has changed somewhat since 1910 .
First off , Principia Mathematica uses Peano's " dots " notation to disambiguate precedence , where we now use parentheses instead .
The dot notation takes some getting used to , but has some distinct advantages over the parentheses .
The idea is just that you indicate grouping by putting in dots , so that ( 1+2 ) ×( 3+4 ) ×( 5+6 ) is written as 1+2.×.3+4.×. 5+6 .
The middle sub - formula is between a pair of dots .
The ( 1+2 ) sub -formula is between a pair of dots also , but the dot on the left end is superfluous , and we omit it ; similarly , the sub - formula ( 5+6 ) is delimited by a dot on the left and by the end of the formula on the right .
What if you need to nest parentheses ?
Then you use more dots .
A double dot ( :) is like a single dot , but stronger .
For example , we write ( ( 1+2 ) ×3 ) + 4 as 1+2 . × 3 : + 4 , and the double dot isolates the entire 1+2 .
× 3 expression into a single sub -formula to which the +4 applies .
Sometimes you need more levels of precedence , and then you use triple dots (. : and :. ) and quadruple ( : : ) .
This formula , as you see , has double and triple dots .
Translating the dots into standard parenthesis notation , we have $ $ \ast54.43 .
\vdash ( ( \alpha , \ beta \in 1 ) \supset ( ( \alpha\cap \beta = \ Lambda ) \equiv ( \alpha\cup\beta \ in 2 ) ) ) $ $ .
This is rather more cluttered - looking than the version with the dots , and in complicated formulas you can have trouble figuring out which parentheses match with which .
With the dots , it 's always easy .
So I think it 's a bit unfortunate that this convention has fallen out of use .
The !!
\vdash !!
symbol has not changed ; it means that the formula to which it applies is asserted to be true .
!!\supset !! is logical implication , and !!\equiv !! is logical equivalence .
Λ is the empty set , which we write nowadays as ∅. ∩ ∪ and ∈ have their modern meanings : ∩ and ∪ are the set intersection and the union operators , and x∈y means that x is an element of set y .
The remaining points are semantic .
α and β are sets .
1 denotes the set of all sets that have exactly one element .
That is , it 's the set { c : there exists a such that c = { a } } .
Theorems about 1 include , for example : that Λ∉1 ( ∗52.21 ) ,
that if α∈1 then there is some x such that α = { x } ( ∗ 52.1 ) , and
such that α = { } ( ∗52.1 ) , and that {x} ∈1 ( ∗52.22 ) .
2 is similarly the set of all sets that have exactly two elements .
An important theorem about 2 is ∗ 54.3 , which says $ $ \ast54.3 .
\vdash 2 = \hat \alpha\{ ( \exists x ) \> .\> x\in\alpha \> . \> \alpha - \iota`x \in 1 \} . $ $ In Principia Mathematica notation , {x} , the set that contains x and nothing else , is written ι‘x , so this theorem says that 2 is identical with the set of all α such that α has some element x , which , when removed from α , leaves a 1 - element set .
So here is theorem ∗ 54.43 again :
It asserts that if sets α and β each have exactly one element , then they are disjoint ( that is , have no elements in common ) if and only if their union has exactly two elements .
The proof , which appears in the scan above following the word " Dem . " ( short for " demonstration " ) goes like this : " Theorem ∗ 54.26 implies that if α = {x} and β = {y} , then α∪β has 2 elements if and only if x is different from y . "
" By theorem ∗ 51.231 , this last bit ( x is different from y ) is true if and only if {x} and {y} are disjoint . "
" By ∗ 13.12 , this last bit ( {x} and {y} are disjoint ) is true if and only if α and β themselves are disjoint . "
The partial conclusion at this point , which is labeled ( 1 ) , is that if α = {x} and β = {y} , then α∪β ∈ 2 if and only if α∩β = Λ .
The proof continues : " Conclusion ( 1 ) , with theorems ∗ 11.11 and ∗ 11.35 , implies that if there exists x and y so that α is {x} and β is {y} , then α∪β ∈ 2 if and only if α and β are disjoint . "
This conclusion is labeled ( 2 ) .
Finally , conclusion ( 2 ) , together with theorems ∗ 11.54 and ∗ 52.1 , implies the theorem we were trying to prove .
Maybe the thing to notice here is how very small the steps are .
∗ 54.26 , on which this theorem heavily depends , is almost the same ; it asserts that {x}∪{y} ∈ 2 if and only if x≠y .
∗ 54.26 , in turn , depends on ∗ 54.101 , which says that α has 2 elements if and only if there exist x and y , not the same , such that α = {x} ∪ {y} .
∗ 54.101 is just a tiny bit different from the definition of 2 .
Theorem ∗ 51.231 says that {x} and {y} are disjoint if and only if x and y are different .
∗ 52.1 is a basic property of 1 ; we saw it before .
The other theorems cited in the demonstration are very tiny technical matters .
∗ 11.54 says that you can take an assertion that two things exist and separate it into two assertions , each one asserting that one of the things exists .
∗ 11.11 is even slimmer : it says that if φ( x , y ) is always true , then you can attach a universal quantifier , and assert that φ( x , y ) is true for all x and y.
∗ 13.12 concerns the substitution of equals for equals : if x and y are the same , then x possesses a property ψ if and only if y does too .
I have n't seen the later parts of Principia Mathematica , because my copy stops after section ∗ 56 , and the arithmetic stuff is much later .
But this theorem clearly has the sense of 1+1=2 in it , and the later theorem ( ∗110.643 ) that actually asserts 1+1=2 depends strongly on this one .
Although I am not completely sure what is going to happen later on ( I 've wasted far too much time on this already to put in more time to get the full version from the library ) I can make an educated guess .
Principia Mathematica is going to define the number 17 as being the set of all 17 - element sets , and similarly for every other number ; the use of the symbol 2 to represent the set of all 2 - element sets prefigures this .
These sets - of - all - sets - of - a- certain - size will then be identified as the " cardinal numbers " .
The Principia Mathematica will define the sum of cardinal numbers p and q something like this : take a representative set a from p ; a has p elements .
Take a representative set b from q ; b has q elements .
Let c = a∪b .
If c is a member of some cardinal number r , and if a and b are disjoint , then the sum of p and q is r .
With this definition , you can prove the usual desirable properties of addition , such as x +
0 = x , x + y = y + x , and 1 + 1 = 2 .
In particular , 1+1=2 follows directly from theorem ∗ 54.43 ; it 's just what we want , because to calculate 1+1 , we must find two disjoint representatives of 1 , and take their union ; ∗ 54.43 asserts that the union must be an element of 2 , regardless of which representatives we choose , so that 1+1=2 .
Post scriptum : Peter Norvig says that the circumflex in the Principia Mathematica notation is the ultimate source of the use of the word lambda to denote an anonymous function in the Lisp and Python programming languages .
I am sure you know that these languages get " lambda " from the use of the Greek letter λ by Alonzo Church to represent function abstraction in his " λ- calculus " :
In Lisp , ( lambda ( u ) B ) is a function that takes an argument u and returns the value of B ; in the λ- calculus , λu. B is a function that takes an argument u and returns the value of B. Norvig says that Church was originally planning to write the function λu .
B as û.B , but his printer could not do circumflex accents .
So he considered moving the circumflex to the left and using a capital lambda instead : Λu.B .
The capital Λ looked too much like logical and ∧ , which was confusing , so he used lowercase lambda λ instead .
Post post scriptum : Everyone always says " Russell and Whitehead " .
Google results for " Russell and Whitehead " outnumber those for " Whitehead and Russell " by two to one , for example .
Why ?
The cover and the title page say " Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell , F.R.S. " .
How and when did Whitehead lose out on top billing ?
[ Addendum 20060913 : I figured out how and when Whitehead lost out on top billing : 10 December 1950 . ] [ Addendum 20171107 : W. Ethan Duckworth sent me a translation of this proposition into modern notation , which I discussed in a new article . ]

The fresh efforts to quiet him , Dr. Hansen said , began in a series of calls after a lecture he gave on Dec. 6 at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco .
In the talk , he said that significant emission cuts could be achieved with existing technologies , particularly in the case of motor vehicles , and that without leadership by the United States , climate change would eventually leave the earth " a different planet . "
The administration 's policy is to use voluntary measures to slow , but not reverse , the growth of emissions .
After that speech and the release of data by Dr. Hansen on Dec. 15 showing that 2005 was probably the warmest year in at least a century , officials at the headquarters of the space agency repeatedly phoned public affairs officers , who relayed the warning to Dr. Hansen that there would be " dire consequences " if such statements continued , those officers and Dr. Hansen said in interviews .
Among the restrictions , according to Dr. Hansen and an internal draft memorandum he provided to The Times , was that his supervisors could stand in for him in any news media interviews .
Mr. Acosta said the calls and meetings with Goddard press officers were not to introduce restrictions , but to review existing rules .
He said Dr. Hansen had continued to speak frequently with the news media .
But Dr. Hansen and some of his colleagues said interviews were canceled as a result .
In one call , George Deutsch , a recently appointed public affairs officer at NASA headquarters , rejected a request from a producer at National Public Radio to interview Dr. Hansen , said Leslie McCarthy , a public affairs officer responsible for the Goddard Institute .
Citing handwritten notes taken during the conversation , Ms. McCarthy said Mr. Deutsch called N.P.R. " the most liberal " media outlet in the country .
She said that in that call and others , Mr. Deutsch said his job was " to make the president look good " and that as a White House appointee that might be Mr. Deutsch 's priority .
Review
It has been three long years to the day since we last looked at that unusual distribution called Windows .
Although at that time it was considered by many to be little else than a bizarre joke ( who on earth would design an operating system that does n't provide a way to grep files ? ) , a recent rumour about a new release has piqued our curiosity .
Developed by a large group of programmers who , believe it or not , all work in one building , the new version is predicted by some journalists to be one of the most secure operating systems ever created .
Robert Storey , our ardent distribution reviewer , could n't hold on any longer and downloaded the most recent beta version of Windows Vista from a nearby mirror to take a look .
Introduction Greetings to all !
As some of you may recall , it 's been a long three years since I last occupied this space , writing a review of Windows XP - An Operating System You Can Trust .
Sadly , I must confess that the reason for my prolonged absence from this web site is that I was in trouble with the law once again .
As my former readers will no doubt remember , I was previously under the influence of evil Linux hackers .
During that time , I committed several serious crimes - in particular , I violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) and infringed several software patents .
Fortunately , that crime spree was brought to an ignominious end when the Intellectual Property Police raided our Linux Users Group meeting .
Being a first - time offender , I was paroled after only eight months in prison .
I have since gone on to lead a clean and productive life using only safe and secure Microsoft software installed on my computer .
Linux Users Group Meeting
Alas , I must confess to backsliding .
My downfall came in the form of a computer magazine .
Inside the magazine jacket was a CD containing the evil Linux operating system !
I foolishly installed the software , and - just like an alcoholic who claims he 's only going to have " one drink " - I was hooked again !
Fortunately , Windows XP was still installed on my hard drive .
Windows correctly detected the presence of a Linux partition , and the built - in Microsoft Snitchware immediately reported the situation to the Department of Homeland Security .
Since installing Linux was a violation of my parole , I was arrested by the FBI and sentenced to a further two years in a federal penitentiary .
All this might sound tragic , but really , it 's not .
In the end , things worked out for the best .
After only one year in prison , I became eligible for a new experimental rehabilitation program .
I am happy to report that it 's been a great success !
After receiving counselling , medication , electroshock therapy and a prefrontal lobotomy , I am once again a happy Windows user .
As a condition of my early release from custody , the parole board has ordered me to perform 300 hours of community service .
This I have gladly done .
Working in close cooperation with the Business Software Alliance , I have been visiting public schools , lecturing students on the evils of open source software .
I can't begin to describe the satisfaction this work gives me , saving impressionable young minds from the temptation of so - called " free software . "
At the end of my talk , our team hands out T - shirts emblazoned with the motto , " Linux - Just say No ! "
As a further public service , we then audit the students ' computers for pirated software .
Just last week we caught three students with unlicensed video games installed on their machines .
Since they were minors , the students were not arrested - rather , they were put in foster care and their parents were fined US $ 150,000 for each pirated program .
Considering the seriousness of the crime , this was a mere slap on the wrist .
However , since these were first - time offenders , it 's understandable that the authorities should be so lenient .
Installation
This is supposed to be an operating system review , so I apologize for the above digression .
Sometimes I just get carried away with my personal issues - it 's probably just a side effect of the lobotomy .
So let 's get back on topic .
Today , I am reviewing Microsoft 's greatest operating system ever , Windows Hasta La Vista , or WHLV ( which is also the name of a talk radio station in Hattiesburg , Mississippi - Microsoft is now suing them for trademark infringement ) .
But to simplify things , we 'll just call this OS " Windows Vista " or " Vista " from now on .
Those who have been following the latest tech news are well aware of the fact that Vista will not , in fact , be released to the public until early 2007 .
Fortunately , for techies who just can't wait to get their hands on the latest and greatest offerings from Microsoft , there are two simple solutions - pay the Earth to become a Windows developer , or volunteer to be a beta tester .
I chose to do the latter .
The beta version of Windows Vista - officially known as the Community Technology Preview ( CTP ) - can be downloaded through Microsoft 's developers ' site .
Please note that the CTP is a time - limited copy which will self - destruct ( along with your data ) at a secret predetermined date .
I enthusiastically downloaded my copy and began the installation procedure .
This might be a good time to mention that the Vista installation program differs from the Windows XP installer in several significant ways .
For example , when XP installs , it merely wipes out any Linux partitions on the hard drive .
Windows Vista , on the other hand , will go much further - it will mount any Linux partitions it finds and then plant viruses and root kits in /usr / bin .
After all , Linux hackers have been doing stuff like this for years to Window users - now it 's time for some payback .
Just as when you install XP , at the very end of the installation process , Vista insists that you need to type in a user 's registration key .
However , XP requires a mere 25 - digit alpha- numeric key which is not even case - sensitive .
Vista , which is far more secure , requires a 250 - digit key which is case - sensitive and also includes spaces and various symbols .
For example , a valid registration key might look something like this :
5|_4!C|@W/#\r$cw3 r\/1=|\xV|Zb0+aR
t3qh h^0w ilE |r_1 ]
n\/x-( pY ) 5 \C 3k&| \
|3*j[%=G(.
Mx^G$ Hd : " 7{OK4 " GDe:E &y $ C[;}4!s3C|@W/O8@#\r$Uc~w3 r\`/1=|\xV|Z " b>,0 + ]{*$ 4%f_b+a@Q=-^.>c#wC|@=}4!+sG$ ]
Hd:C ) |@W/0+& ] { qC h=G ? ( >,0 + ]
\/1?+n]e{f *^ j0w@~>n V^ " |k\E $
If you make a mistake when typing the key , the installation program will abort and you have to start over from the beginning .
Furthermore , users will be required to retype the key every time they restart Windows .
Leave it to Microsoft to come up with such a clever method to protect us from the evils of software piracy !
Windows Hasta La Vista , baby !
All About Security
As you can see from the foregoing process , Microsoft is very concerned about security .
Indeed , the 250 - digit registration key is only the first step in protecting users from depraved software pirates .
Microsoft has incorporated many other exciting features to ensure that Vista is the most secure OS ever !
Vista comes with built - in support for Microsoft 's Software Quality Assurance program .
The way it works is that if users inadvertently attempt to install a dangerous open source program such as the notorious OpenOffice , Vista will intervene .
The fiendish program wo n't be installed , and Vista will instead download the equivalent closed source program ( in this example , Microsoft Office ) and automatically bill the customer 's credit card .
I can't but express my admiration on this innovative approach to protecting customers , as well as Microsoft 's profits .
Microsoft 's award winning browser , Internet Explorer , has also been beefed up with new security features .
For example , attempting to download illicit MP3 files will result in a security alert being emailed to the RIAA .
Similarly , any attempt to share movies will be reported to the MPAA .
Software pirates will have their activities reported to the Business Software Alliance .
All other suspicious activities will be reported to the Department of Homeland Security and Interpol .
Only through such diligent cooperative efforts between Microsoft and the relevant authorities can we protect our cherished free society .
One frequently requested feature by users is the ability to encrypt the filesystem , and Vista supports this .
However , the filesystem is not encrypted by default - the user has to set this up .
When you enable this feature , Vista sends an email to inform the US National Security Agency ( NSA ) that you have done so .
Then , using the NSA Back Door , FBI agents can periodically check your computer to ensure that your machine contains no terrorist messages , pornography or open source software .
Users might be concerned about having such a back door on their system , but they really should n't be .
The FBI has assured everybody that they will not abuse this power , and only concentrate on catching terrorists and other miscreants .
I see no reason not to believe them .
After all , if you can't trust the FBI , who can you trust ?
Project Cyborg
One of Microsoft 's most innovative projects yet involves the use of Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) tags .
These " tags " - a chip smaller than a grain of rice - have generated much discussion lately .
Large supermarkets and department stores are very interested in placing RFIDs inside of products - then a tag reader at the cash register would automatically ring up the purchase without the need to physically handle the merchandise .
RFIDs have also been used for electronic toll collection .
The chips have also been placed under the skin of dogs and cats in order to identify lost pets .
Most recently , several countries have decided to put RFIDs into " biometric passports " - this makes it much easier for criminals and terrorists to identify wealthy foreign tourists in a crowd , which helps facilitate mugging and kidnapping .
Further expanding on this great new technology , Microsoft plans to use RFIDs with Window Vista in order to facilitate payment .
Here 's how it would work .
First , Vista users would get the tag surgically implanted in a convenient location , most likely the back of the neck .
The RFID would contain an individual 's Windows product registration key , so " chipped " users would no longer need to type it .
Furthermore , customers with the embedded tag would be able to enjoy online shopping without the need to type credit card numbers - a tag reader on their computer would do all the work .
This system is destined to replace Microsoft Passport .
Other uses for the embedded RFID tag would be to alert authorities if users attempt to access forbidden web sites , or send emails to shady individuals on a government watch list .
Furthermore , thanks to Microsoft 's cooperative agreement with with Wal - Mart , chipped customers would no longer need to pay cash or show their credit cards at the checkout stand .
Consumers are going to love these great new convenience features .
Nevertheless , some whiny so - called " privacy advocates " have made a big fuss over Project Cyborg .
Without a doubt , they are a bunch of left - wing Linux loonies who can be counted upon to always oppose the advancement of technology .
Needless to say , it 's a waste of time trying to argue with these Luddites - it 's just best to ignore them .
Special Edition
As you may have read elsewhere , Microsoft plans to release several editions of Windows Vista , thus catering to specialized markets .
For example , several high - ranking government officials and Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates would like a special edition that lacks a registration key , does not monitor online activity , and does n't support Project Cyborg .
Microsoft will generously cater to these customers ' needs by producing a version that meets their requirements - however , it will only run a rare computer based on a CPU called an Itanium , affectionately known to geeks as the Itanic .
Literally dozens of Itanics have been sold so far , and market analysts predict that nearly 100 will be in circulation by year 2010 .
Conclusion
Clearly , with Windows Hasta La Vista , Microsoft has another winner on its hands .
With valuable built - in convenience features and ironclad security , Microsoft has definitely responded to customers ' needs .
Furthermore , erh ... ahh , what 's this ?
Sorry everybody , somebody is at the door .
Just a moment ...
It 's the Intellectual Property Police .
Hmm ... they 've got a warrant .
It seems that by writing this review , I violated the Non-Disclosure Agreement which I clicked on when I downloaded the beta .
Damn , I really need to read those 150 - page End User License Agreements before clicking on " I Agree . "
Oh well , you 've got hand it to Windows Vista - just look at how efficient it was at reporting my illegal activities to the authorities !
What an amazing operating system !
I 'm about to be arrested , so I guess it might be a few more years before you 'll be hearing from me .
Given the circumstances , I can't think of a more appropriate thing to say except , Hasta la vista !

Ver igualmente el genocidio del pueblo iraquí

La visita del actor [ y fotos ] tuvo lugar a mediados de diciembre del año 2004 .
Sin embargo el sitio web ( ver link clicar aquí ) que promociona la visita del actor no muestra ninguna imagen chocante que pueda afectar a la opinión pública de los horrores de esta aventura militar .

Cual debe ser el sentimiento de estos jóvenes militares mutilados que creyeron en un principio en las mentiras de su presidente [ George W. Bush ] que afirmaba que habían armas de destrucción masiva en Irak , las cuales nunca fueron encontradas .
Posteriormente los inspectores de la ONU aseguraron que nunca existieron como lo habían dicho y confirmado varias veces antes de que los EEUU atacasen a Irak .
Saber que esta guerra no es más que una guerra por el petróleo .
En Irak , la resistencia nacional iraquí se ha organizado en el país para recuperar la independencia , la soberanía y sobre todo defenderse de las matanzas masivas y sin distinción de las tropas norteamericanas .
En EEUU igualmente los movimientos pacifistas son cada día más numerosos .
Recordemos que esta guerra neocolonial fue declarada ilegal e injustificada por las Naciones Unidas .

I am aware that spending a lot of time Googling yourself is kind of narcissistic , OK ?
But there are situations , I would argue , when it is efficiently – even forgivably – narcissistic .
When I published a book last year , I wanted to know what , if anything , people were saying about it .
Ego - surfing was the obvious way to do that .
Which is how I stumbled across Some Title .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Some Title identified itself as a blog but obviously was n't one .
Here , reprinted in its entirety , is the paragraph from the site that mentioned me :
Show Disputed Vinland Map Was Made Half Century Before Columbus Trip Audio / Video Columbus : Secrets From The Grave quot ; The Last Voyage of Columbus quot ; : An Epic Tale Charles Mann 's quot ; 1491 quot ; ( Audio
In orthodox bloggy style , the paragraph linked to another Web page .
When I clicked on the link , I was confronted with more gibberish : " Below , " it stated , " you will find some grave robbing in ventura california 1985 news that 's relevant for today . "
Blogs like Some Title are known as " splogs " – spam blogs .
Like email spam , splogs use the most wonderful features of networked communication – its flexibility , easy access , and low cost – in the service of sleazy get - rich - quick schemes .
But whereas email spammers try to induce recipients to buy products , sploggers and other Web spammers make most of their money by getting viewers to click on ads that run adjacent to their nonsensical text .
Web page owners – the spammer , in this case – get paid by the advertiser every time someone clicks on an ad .
Some Title 's creator had almost certainly assembled the site by using software that hops from Web page to Web page , automatically copying text that includes potential search terms .
( My name and my book 's title had been included incidentally , because they appeared in a review or blog that happened to contain keywords sought by the spammer . )
Sploggers do n't care if the resulting Web pages are garbled ; the point is to churn them out chockablock with terms that people might use in search queries , leading them to visit the pages and click ( ka - ching ! ) on the ads .
Just as the proliferation of email spam constantly threatens to inundate email providers , the explosion of blog spam is a besetting problem for the blog industry .
Like most people who poke around the blogosphere , I had occasionally encountered splogs before .
But over the months that I monitored the reaction to my book , they seemed to be rising in number .
More and more of the blogs and Web sites that mentioned my book – or any other topic , for that matter – were spam .
Some 56 percent of active English - language blogs are spam , according to a study released in May by Tim Finin , a researcher at the University of Maryland , Baltimore County , and two of his students .
" The blogosphere is growing fast , " Finin says .
" But the splogosphere is now growing faster . "
To Jason Goldman , product manager for Google 's Blogger hosting service , " the ever - increasing number of splogs is a significant problem that we have to combat . "
No search engine wants users looking for information about , say , auto repair to click on a promising link and end up on a page filled with jabberwocky or a collection of advertisements .
Nor does any blog host want to waste its resources and trash its reputation by providing a home to spammers .
A recent survey by Mitesh Vasa , a Virginia - based software engineer and splog researcher , found that in December 2005 , Blogger was hosting more than 100,000 sploggers .
( Many of these are likely pseudonyms for the same people . )
Google , Goldman promises , is paying serious attention to the problem .
It should be :
The pay - per- click advertising that accounts for most of Google 's income ( and , increasingly , for the incomes of Yahoo and MSN Search , the two other big search engines ) has become an irresistible magnet for hucksters , con artists , and chiselers .
" The three main search engines are gateways to a huge percentage of the US and world economy , " says Anil Dash , a vice president of the blog - hosting company Six Apart .
" If your Web site appears high up on their results , thousands or millions of people will go to it . "
If even a small fraction of those people click on the ads on that site , " you 're going to make a lot of money " – and sploggers are going after it .
Because the ad money is effectively available only to Web sites that appear in the first page or two of search results , spammers devote enormous efforts to gaming Google , Yahoo , and their ilk .
Search engines rank
Web sites in large part by counting the number of other sites that link to them , assigning higher placement in results to sites popular enough to be referred to by many others .
To mimic this popularity , spammers create bogus networks of interconnected sites called link farms .
Blogs – most of which are in essence little more than collections of links with commentary – are particularly useful elements in them .
The result , Dash says , " is what you 'd expect :
The blogosphere is increasingly polluted by spam . "
The mess may have consequences beyond the blogosphere , though .
Blogs are the leading edge of what is often called Web 2.0 , the vision of the Internet as a bottom - up , communal platform for data of all sorts that is generated and continually updated by its users : the image - sharing sites Flickr and YouTube , the social bookmarking destination del.icio.us , the collaborative online encyclopedia Wikipedia , the user - generated Slashdot rival digg , and publicly viewable online calendars like Kiko and CalendarHub .
Unfortunately , the very openness and ease of use that make these Web 2.0 sites popular will inevitably make them perfect targets for spammers , says Matt Mullenweg , developer of the popular WordPress blogging system .
" Extreme vulnerability to spam , " he says , is a defining characteristic of Web 2.0 , and splogs are its first manifestation .
People in the industry disagree about how to beat back spam , or whether it can even be done .
But there 's no dispute that if the blogosphere and the rest of Web 2.0 can't find a way to stop the sleazeballs who are enveloping the Net in a haze of babble and cheesy marketing , then the best features of Web 2.0 will be turned off , and it will go the way of Usenet , which was driven to desuetude by spam .
Some Title , the splog that commandeered my name , was created by Dan Goggins , the proud possessor of a 2005 master 's degree in computer science from Brigham Young University .
Working out of his home in a leafy subdivision in Springville , Utah , Goggins , his BYU friend and partner , John Jonas , and their handful of employees operate " a few thousand " splogs .
" It 's not that many , " Goggins says modestly .
" Some people have a lot of sites . "
Trolling the Net , I came across a PowerPoint presentation for a kind of spammers ' conference that details some of the earnings of the Goggins - Jonas partnership .
Between August and October of 2005 , they made at least $ 71,136.89 .
People in Goggins ' business bristle at the term " splogger . "
They like to be called " search engine marketers . "
And they do n't simply throw a mass of blogs online .
Instead they build complex networks of Web sites , entire online ecosystems of sleaze , twaddle , and gobbledygook .
The main goal is to lure unsuspecting blog readers and other Internet users to spam portals .
Sportals , as they are known , are Web pages consisting almost entirely of pay - per - click links , all of which shunt netsurfers to legitimate commercial Web sites , collecting money along the way for the spammers .
Examples of these doorway pages include debts.com , lasvegasvacations.com , and 90210.com , all owned by industry pioneer Marchex of Seattle ; another is photography.com , run by NameMedia , based in the Boston suburb of Waltham .
Naturally , sportal owners want their properties to appear prominently in search engine results .
The precise algorithms that search engines use to rank pages are as closely guarded – and as valuable – as upcoming Intel chip designs .
Spammers figure them out by stuffing individual splogs and spam pages with potential search terms and links to one another , observing how high the sites appear in search results , then tweaking their pages and trying again .
Repeated over time , Six Apart 's Dash says , " the brute - force approach is effective .
Not that the Google guys are n't smart , but the sheer relentlessness on the side of spammers is formidable , and they eventually get what they want . "
In June , a Romanian tech - blogger who calls himself Ionut Alex .
Chitu discovered that Googling " pizza sauce recipe " turned up a spam page within the first 10 results – prime Web real estate .
The page , he and others quickly learned , was a tiny island in a massive archipelago of spam , millions of pages in size , erected by scammers supposedly in Romania or Argentina , depending on which fake registration data one chose to believe .
Having discovered a lacuna in Google 's indexing system , the spammers shoved search terms into their Web sites ' domain names , which the search algorithm regarded as a sign of their importance .
The pizza - sauce inquiry , for instance , directed viewers to the Web address 1059.pizza.eiqz2q.org , which automatically bounced to a sportal ; one incautious mouseclick later and the viewer would be stuck in a near - endless loop of ad sites .
( Google started deleting the spam colossus from its index within hours of its discovery . )
In addition to creating massive numbers of phony blogs , sploggers sometimes take over abandoned real blogs .
More than 10 million of the 12.9 million profiles on Blogger surveyed by splog researcher Vasa in June were inactive , either because the bloggers had stopped blogging or because they never got started .
( The huge mass of dead blogs is one reason to maintain a healthy skepticism toward the frequently heard claims about the vast growth of the blogosphere . )
" Nobody is watching or moderating the comments and posts on those abandoned blogs , " says Tim Mayer , director of product management for Yahoo search .
As a result , he says , scammers are looking for ways to hack the interface of these blogs to post to them and take advantage of their inbound links to increase the ranking of spam sites .
For obvious reasons , it is difficult for a Google or a Yahoo to discern when a previously valuable site and its links slip over to the dark side and become part of a spam empire .
Not only do sploggers create fake blogs or take over abandoned ones , they use robo - software to flood real blogs with bogus comments that link back to the splog .
( " Great post !
For more on this subject , click here ! " )
Statistics compiled by Akismet , a system put together by WordPress developer Mullenweg that tries to filter out blog spam , suggest that more than nine out of 10 comments in the blogosphere are spam .
Partly as a result , prominent blogs like Instapundit , The Corner , and Talking Points Memo simply refuse to turn on commenting .
Almost as pervasive is trackback spam .
Trackbacks are the familiar mechanism – " see which blogs are talking about this post " – by which Blogger A's discussion of a post by Blogger B can be automatically linked to Blogger B's site .
Spammers will claim on a real blog that their splogs continue the thread of discourse , hoping to lure the real blog 's readers to visit them and click on ads .
" All of a sudden a well - known blogger is linking to a spam blog , " says Natalie Glance , a senior researcher at Nielsen BuzzMetrics , the rating company 's blog - analysis arm .
Because of the link , the splog gets a boost in the search engine ranks – even as its link tarnishes the real blog .
The avalanche of spam places an increasing burden not only on blog hosts but on another equally vital component of the blogosphere : blog - search engines like Technorati and IceRocket , and the so - called ping servers they depend on .
Unlike Google or Yahoo , blog - search firms operate in real time , so as to keep pace with ongoing discussions .
Every time bloggers make posts , their software automatically alerts the network of ping servers that track the blogosphere for blog - search engines .
These tap into the feed from ping servers to refresh their indexes and visit the sites that have new material .
Syndication services that use delivery formats like RSS and Atom also use the ping servers to know when they need to deliver content to subscribers .
Unfortunately , splogs generate content faster than real blogs – no surprise , given that the text is churned out by robo - software , with no need for the splogger to write or think .
Maryland researcher Finin and his students found that splogs produce about three - quarters of the pings from English - language blogs .
Another way of saying this is that the legitimate blogosphere generates about 300,000 posts a day , but the splogosphere emits 900,000 , inundating the ping servers .
" It 's not enough to weed out splogs on the level of the search engines ; you also have to get rid of them in the ping servers , " Glance says .
" It 's a whole second front . "
Splogs are annoying but not illegal .
Still , blog - hosting firms like Six Apart , Blogger , MSN Spaces , and Xanga desperately want to get rid of them .
And blog - search companies would like just as much to eliminate them from their results .
For that to happen , though , the companies must identify the splogs they want to weed out – a harder task than it may seem .
Take Some Title , the splog that mentioned me .
Any human reader can tell instantly , as I did , that the site is tripe .
But even if hosting services and search engines hired armies of people , the blogosphere is simply too big to sift through blogs one by one .
Computers are faster but notoriously unable to distinguish sense from nonsense – they can't tell Some Title from Shakespeare .
The way out of this dilemma is to find mechanisms for computers to identify splogs without reading them , says David Sifry , founder of Technorati , the largest blog - search firm .
The key to doing this , in his view , is to understand that real blogs are a form of expression , but " spam blogs are built essentially to fool search engines . "
They have different characteristics than blogs – characteristics that computers can identify and thus use to eliminate spam from their search results .
" If we see 10,000 pings within 60 seconds , and all the blogs point to the same Web site , it 's really easy to recognize that as a link farm , " Sifry says .
There are other ways to spot offenders .
Like most blogs , Some Title consists of a number of 50 - to 100 - word posts ( incoherent ones , in this case ) , all with hyperlinks to other Web sites .
In real blogs , the hyperlinks ' anchor text – the word or phrase users click on – is generally something innocuous like " previous post " or " interesting discussion . "
Splogs , by contrast , often have search terms in the anchor text ; the anchor text for one Some Title link , for instance , was " grave digger freestyle . "
The links in ordinary blogs usually take users to well - known sites like Flickr and YouTube or prominent blogs like Talking Points Memo and Boing Boing .
By contrast , each link in Some Title takes the user to a spam Web page or another splog .
These sites , moreover , often have odd - looking , superlong URLs that are packed with keywords , because search engines tend to award high ranks to Web sites with keywords in their title , and sploggers are constantly looking for ways to increase their visibility in search engines .
One LiveJournal splog that mentioned me , for example , was called New - york - agency - direct - mail - insurance - marketing .
The grave - robbing Web site had the absurd address www.1michaelgraves7.info/conducting-from-the-grave/ grave-robbing-in-ventura-california-1985.html .
" If it 's a Blogspot blog with more than two dashes , it 's spam , " Mullenweg says .
Simply checking for dashes and search terms in links , in other words , will eliminate many splogs .
Another giveaway : Both Some Title and the grave - robbing page it links to had Web addresses in the .info domain .
Spammers flock to .info , which was created as an alternative to the crowded .com , because its domain names are cheaper – registrars often let people use them gratis for the first year – which is helpful for those , like sploggers , who buy Internet addresses in bulk .
Splogs so commonly have .info addresses that many experts simply assume all blogs from that domain are fake .
But even if blog - search firms use these techniques to identify and remove splogs , the struggle against them will never end .
" The sploggers always adjust , " says Nielsen 's Glance .
" As soon as companies like Google and ourselves get better , the spammers get better . "
Every so often , Google revamps its search algorithms , partly to outwit spammers and bloggers .
The update sets off a " Google dance , " in which legitimate Web site owners and scammers both race to maintain high positions in search engine results .
Dismayingly , this endless arms race may actually be a best - case scenario .
The interactivity of the blogosphere – and of the rest of Web 2.0 – means that sploggers will always have multiple ways of infiltrating the system , explains Gilad Mishne , a computer scientist at the University of Amsterdam who focuses on splogs and Web spam .
And for those other paths , he says , " we 're really in trouble . "
On June 19 , Six Apart 's Anil Dash blogged about his experience beta-testing Microsoft Office 2007 .
His positive review attracted considerable attention , with many other bloggers linking to it – so many , in fact , that Dash was surprised to discover soon after that his post was listed second when people Googled " Office 2007 . "
( It was 10th in MSN Search and 17th in Yahoo . )
If the post 's position does n't change , Dash says , " a year from now it could be a gateway for tens of thousands of software sales , maybe hundreds of thousands .
My wife told me to quit my job and focus on exploiting my search rank . "
It 'd be easy , he jokes .
All he'd have to do is stick up some big pay - per - click ads for Office 2007 and watch visitors click through , collecting a fee each time they did .
The possibility was more than theoretical .
Dash 's posts have attracted attention before , and the attention has sometimes been followed by an email asking if he would , for a fee , tuck a new link somewhere on his site .
The emails were from sploggers .
They wanted to add Dash 's highly ranked post to a link farm .
" I get these offers about once a week , " he says .
" I 've always been a little leery of trying to contact them to find out exactly how much they 'd pay . "
The emails , Dash believes , exemplify the fundamental difficulty in fighting splogs and Web spam .
With the rise of pay - per - click advertising , the big search engines have , in effect , created a kind of currency : ranking in search results .
Put up the right Web site , with the right collection of links and keywords , and – ka-ching !
This cash is available to anyone on earth who can manipulate search engines ' site - ranking systems .
Little wonder that the entire world 's supply of spammers is trying to seize the opportunity .
They are combing through the Net so assiduously that they are attempting to capitalize on individual blog posts about products that wo n't even appear for months to come .
No single company , Dash believes , can withstand that much collective rapacity .
As a result , he says , " there 's going to be a reckoning with the economy that 's building up around search engine rankings , one way or another . "
Something fundamental will have to change , either in the search engine world or the blogosphere , because things can't continue the way they are now .
Technorati's Sifry is more optimistic .
Yes , he says , spam is a problem .
But the people who are crying doom are not taking a wide - angle view .
" You have to recognize that spam is doubling every six months , " he says .
With this in mind , Technorati 's engineers designed its spam filters to be scalable right from the start .
Its continually escalating defenses , Sifry believes , will eventually tame the onslaught of spam , though not eliminate it .
But many researchers also fear that an eventual solution will reduce the openness , ease , and accessibility that is at the heart of the blog world and Web 2.0 .
They note that one method by which the blog - search firms weed out spam is by not trying to include comments and trackback in their searches .
The result is to strip out bloggy interactivity – getting rid of spam by treating Web 2.0 as if it were Web 1.0 .
" The whole purpose of Web 2.0 is user - generated content , " Mullenweg says .
" To make that happen , you want the system as easy and transparent as possible .
But that just lets the spammers in .
So you put in hurdles for them to jump over .
They jump over them , so you put in more hurdles .
And at the end of the day , you have a system that 's not nearly as easy and open and transparent . "
One example : Blogger and other blog - hosting sites now require users to prove they are not spambots before posting comments by identifying a series of distorted letters and numbers .
The protective codes are called Captchas , which stands for " completely automated public Turing tests to tell computers and humans apart . "
In theory , sploggers ' autoposting software can't figure out the distorted images , thus reducing the flow of spam .
But Captchas also make commenting harder .
" It 's a big pain for legitimate users , " Blogger 's Goldman says , " and there are many visually impaired people who can't do it at all . "
( Google recently introduced an audio - based form . )
Nor are Captchas completely effective .
Sploggers are believed to be hiring squads of low - paid people to type through the tests .
" We 're seeing Captchas solved in bursts , which suggests they are working in shifts , " Goldman says .
Mullenweg thinks he has come up with a better approach .
He got serious about fighting spam , he says , when his mother started to blog .
" I went through the last hundred or so people who had pinged WordPress with comments and trackbacks , and it was all spam , " he says .
" Mortgages and Viagra , pills and porn . "
Embarrassed and revolted , Mullenweg decided to fight back .
In his view , even the smartest companies – the Six Aparts and Technoratis – represent single points of failure , something that spammers can target and outwit .
But the bad guys , Mullenweg says , can't beat the " collective , distributed intelligence " of the blogosphere .
When bloggers install his Akismet software , it submits all comments and trackbacks to a Web service that tests them for spamminess , quarantines the bogus ones , and posts the rest .
If any of those are spam , bloggers report them to Akismet , which uses the feedback to improve its filter .
Almost 300,000 bloggers use the software , Mullenweg says , and their input improves the filter every day .
" Essentially what we 're doing is working together .
All the kids that got hit by bullies in school have discovered there 's strength in numbers .
I like to believe that , anyway . "
Despite the effort and expertise behind such technical fixes , Dash does n't think any of them will work in the long run .
" They 're making money on beating you , and you 're losing money fighting them , " he says .
" The economics are on their side . "
Ultimately , he thinks , " the solution is going to be accountability .
You have to know that somebody is who they say they are . "
Six Apart 's TypePad blogging service enforces accountability on its bloggers in one of the simplest ways possible :
It charges them at least $ 4.95 a month to host their blogs .
Not only is the token payment enough to discourage scammers who want to operate thousands of blogs at once , but it also establishes bloggers ' identities by tying them to a bank account .
Because not all companies will follow Six Apart 's template , Dash says , there will have to be some kind of global identifier – an Internet Social Security number , so to speak .
Everyone could select a personal URL , he says , such as their blog address .
" If you use your URL as identification , you can use that to get higher search engine placement . "
He employs a similar system on his own blog , he says .
" Anybody that signs in and authenticates themself or provides their URL can immediately comment .
Anybody that wants to be anonymous , I have to approve it . "
Dash concedes that such global identifiers would alarm privacy activists .
But the other solutions are even worse .
For example , search engines could auction off their search results , thus making people pay for ranking .
Just as monthly payments for blogs would be the death of splogs , paying for search rank would be the death of link farms .
But , says Dash , " a blog like mine would n't have a chance of being the second result for ' Office 2007 . ' "
What is not possible , he believes , is to continue to muddle through .
" The spammers are too good . "
Asked what impact he thinks splogging will have on the future of the Web , Some Title creator Goggins pauses .
" I 'm just making my living , " he says .
" I guess I do n't think about that kind of thing very much . "
The good news , for drug fiends , is that Afghanistan has just harvested its biggest opium crop ever , up a whopping 59 % from last year and big enough to cover 130 % of the entire world market .
The street price for illegal heroin , 92 % of which now comes from Afghanistan , should be way down from Bangkok to London , and for those shooting up in the back alleys of Chicago .
The bad news , for the rest of us , is that in Bush - liberated Afghanistan , billions in drug profits are financing the Taliban .
Remember them , the guys who harbored the Al Qaeda terrorists , who gifted us with the 9/11 attacks five years ago , that President Bush promised to eliminate ?
Well , it turns out that while he was distracted with Iraq , the patrons of terrorism were very much in business back where the 9/11 attack was hatched , turning Afghanistan into a narco - state that provides a lucrative source of cash for the “ evildoers ” Bush forgot about .
The Bush administration has , for half a decade , celebrated its overthrow of the Taliban and subsequent national elections in Afghanistan , but if this is democratic nation - building then the model must be Colombia , the narco - state where the political process masks the real power held by drug lords and radical insurgents .
Afghanistan is dominated not by the government in Kabul but by a patchwork of warlords , terrorist groups and drug traffickers completely addicted to the annual poppy harvest ’s profits .
Or perhaps the model is post- invasion Iraq , because Afghanistan is now statistically as deadly for American soldiers , according to The New York Times , while in both countries suicide bombings and roadside bombings are on the rise and women are retreating to the burka to avoid persecution by armed zealots .
In any case , reported the United Nations this week , “ opium cultivation in Afghanistan is out of control ” despite the expenditure of billions by the West to fight it .
Intelligence estimates of the Taliban ’s cut of this lucrative trade , which represents over a third of the entire Afghan economy , range up to 70 % , according to ABC News .
“ The political , military and economic investments by coalition countries are not having much visible impact on drug cultivation , ” reported the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in its authoritative annual survey .
“ As a result , Afghan opium is fueling insurgency in Western Asia , feeding international mafias and causing 100,000 deaths from overdoses every year . ”
“ The southern part of Afghanistan [ is ] displaying the ominous hallmarks of incipient collapse , with large - scale drug cultivation and trafficking , insurgency and terrorism , crime and corruption , ” added Antonio Maria Costa , the agency ’s director .
Yet on Tuesday , the White House was once again trumpeting that “ we have deprived Al Qaeda of safe haven in Afghanistan and helped a democratic government rise in its place . ”
Considering that Osama bin Laden himself is still reputed to be hiding somewhere along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border and Afghan President Hamid Karzai is desperately dependent on the support of drug lords and warlords to prevent renewed civil war , such claims are a blatant fraud .
The senior British military commander in Afghanistan recently described the situation in the country as “ close to anarchy ” and said NATO forces were “ running out of time ” to salvage the situation .
“ The narcotics industry accounts for over one - third of Afghanistan ’s gross domestic product and poses a threat to that country ’s stability and emerging democracy , ” carefully admits a recent U.S. State Department fact sheet .
What the Bush administration will not confront in Afghanistan , or in Iraq , is that its ill - conceived and disastrously executed nation - building schemes are sinking into the swamp of local and historical realities .
Enamored of American military might but having little understanding of the world beyond , Bush and his team have ignored Gen.
Colin Powell ’s reported “ you break it , you own it ” warnings , floundering after initial military victories and ultimately strengthening the hand of local and international terrorists .
Rather than take care of business in Afghanistan after 9/11 , Bush and clueless U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld allowed bin Laden to slip out of the Tora Bora caves to plan more attacks and the Taliban to regroup .
Instead , Bush and Co. threw the bulk of our military and aid resources into a disastrous attempt to remake oil - rich Iraq , which had nothing to do with 9/11 , into an American puppet state .
With U.S. midterm elections around the corner , embattled Republicans are now desperately claiming to be the only thing standing between us and a bogeyman they are calling “ Islamo - fascism , ” and ridiculously comparing the “ war on terror ” to the fight against the Nazis .
Fortunately , if belatedly , two - thirds of the American electorate now recognize that our president is all hat and no cattle , as they say in Texas , a leader much better at starting wars than winning them .

there 's something wrong with the methodology itself if 90 % of the projects fail to use it properly
I have the uncomfortable feeling that others are making a religion out of it , as if the conceptual problems of programming could be solved by a single trick , by a simple form of coding discipline !

Postscript : The difference between Sashimi and Nigiri
If we 're judging success or failure of a development methodology , we have to judge the results on whether the development itself was successful .
We can't judge whether the software made money , or whether the company 's stock soared .
Such things can be studied , however those are product management problems , not software development problems .
People have criticised Google , saying that althought it has a track record for shipping products , only one , AdWords , is financially successful .
If you want to compare product management methodologies , that 's fine , but you are n't talking about software development .
You have to compare similar kinds of projects , for example you can't compare an in - house IT project with a known ROI ( reduce the time spent entering a new Blort Ticket by 50 % , saving $ 47.32 per week per Fizbang team member ) to speculative product development like a new Web 2.0 calendar .
Who else is trying to create new products ?
Apple ?
Microsoft ?
Dan Bricklin ?
Compare them to Google , and if they are doing a better job of making money with their projects , post a critique of Google 's product management on your blog .
- r.b.
There is only one problem with development methodologies .
Just one .
It affectsmethodologies , agile and otherwise : No methodology can ' fix ' projects that are staffed with underperforming people .
People are more important than process , period .
This is the underlying issue with the language ' wars ' as well .
No magical combination of JSON , static typing , design patterns , IDE whizzies , and frameworks will somehow help a million monkeys produce any of Shakespeare 's works .
Steve Yegge has suggested that if 90 % of the projects adopting a methodology fail , you have to stop blaming the people .
You have to stop saying " you 're not doing it right . "
You have to saySounds reasonable .
But why would this be true for methodologies but not true for programming languages ?
99.999 % of the software written in almost any language ( including Lisp , Python , and Ruby ) is buggy .
Yet we readily say that the problem is the programmer .
We think that some languages are better than others , that some languages help eliminate certain classes of bugs , but we take as a given that good tools are not sufficient unto themselvesfor good results .
We know that the quality of the result is almost entirely driven by the quality of the programmer .
Home Depot might suggest that buying a new table saw will cause beautiful woodwork to appear in your home .
Yet just because a duffer with a table saw cannot make built - in closets all by himself , we do n't abandon table saws outright .
We assume that good woodworking iswith good tools .
And if we are blessed with the skill to make a built - in closet with a hand saw , we know that we can also make the closet with a table saw , and This is my criteria for judging a methodology .
Can it improve a team that is already fundamentally qualified to write software ?
If you want to stop reading here , my statement is that you can only judge a methodology on the basis of the results it delivers for a team that has already proven it can ship software .
You judge it on the basis of .
You do n't compare its results to the results some other team gets , or to your fantasy of what results the team ' ought ' to get .
What I 've written seems obvious .
Yet , billions of dollars are paid every year to people who are selling a different perspective .
What is it that causes companies to buy silver bullet after silver bullet ?
Why do companies lurch from consultant to methodology to programming language like infomercial junkies looking for something that will flatten their tummies without sweaty exercise or unpleasant diets ?
I bifurcate teams into those that are fundamentally qualified and those that are n't .
And I believe that to fix an unqualified team , you start with the people , not the process or the tools .
So what could the rest of the IT industry possibly believe ?
I have observed a belief in a marginal team .
A team that is somehow straddling the fence between incompetence and competence .
They can ship software , but only with help from their process and tools .
If ' marginal ' is too perjorative a term , you could think of them as having
In truth , I have worked with several such teams , so I believe they exist .
However , I believe that such teams are quite rare , while proponents of silver bullets make a living convincing customers that marginal teams are commonplace .
The primary example I have observed of a marginal team is a team composed of individuals who are not working together well , yet they have achieved success on other teams in prior roles .
Something like the Los Angeles Lakers before Phil Jackson arrived .
There is a lot of latent championship potential in the individuals , but the team is n't performing .
Why does the IT industry believe that perhaps most teams that fail are marginal teams ?
They have to believe this , otherwise they would n't waste time and money trying new silver bullets ( " everything should be a stored procedure , " " tests are the only documentation that matter " ) .
My broken - record assertion is that the industry as a whole embraces the above model of a marginal team : latent potential in the individuals .
The difference between the industry and I is that I have an objective measure of latent potential :
The industry does n't apply this test rigorously , if at all .
A typical interview with a developer focuses on patterns and archiecture , on talking about past achievements .
Developer 's do n't juggle .
Developer 's do n't design software .
And especially , managers do n't hire developers with super - strong references from strong employees that have worked with the candidate in the past .
Basically , managers ask developers if they can ship software and then take the candidate 's word for it .
If you take only one thing from this blog post , take this : .
Someone can demonstrate the ability to write software but lack the ability to actually ship software . : nothing in this post should be construed to suggest that people cannot become better developers through study , mentorships , or training .
However , training is to hiring as tools are to skill .
And they are not mutually exclusive , any more than good programmers and good tools are mutually exclusive . )
I believe that the reason why the IT industry believes that most failing teams are marginal rather than outright incompetent is that they believe that these teams are composed of individuals who can write software and managers who can direct work .
All they need are the right tools to write software " better " and better software will emerge .
All they need is a methodology to manage software development better and software will ship .
If you have a marginal team , a team composed of individuals with proven ability to ship working software , you might have something there .
But if a team is n't even marginal , no methodology will help .
And that 's why a useful methodology can still fail to help 90 % of the teams that try it .
For the same reason that Wasabi makes Sushi divine .

Only one US state has allowed same - sex marriages so far
But the court says it is for the legislature to decide whether the state will honour gay marriage or some other form of civil union .
Lawmakers have been given six months to decide whether to change marriage laws .
It follows a case brought by seven gay couples , who claimed that the state 's constitution entitled them to marry .
" Times and attitudes have changed , " the New Jersey State Supreme Court said in its 90 - page ruling .
But it concluded that it " cannot find that the right to same - sex marriage is a fundamental right under our constitution " .
Domestic partnerships
New Jersey is one of only five US states without either a law or a state constitutional amendment blocking same - sex marriage .
Advocates on both sides had believed it was more likely than other states to allow gay people to wed , as it has a tradition of expanding civil rights .
The state authorised domestic partnerships two years ago .
Currently , only Massachusetts allows same - sex marriages .
Massachusetts is the only US state to allow gay weddings
The court 's decision was welcomed as a partial victory by both advocates and critics of gay marriage .
" It may not be a complete win , but it is a very substantial win , " said Matt Coles of the American Civil Liberties Union .
But Michael Behrens , a lawyer for the Coalition to Preserve and Protect Marriage , said the court had stopped short of granting homosexual couples the rights to the benefits of marriage .
In July , the top court in Washington state upheld a gay marriage ban .
The decision followed a string of setbacks for same - sex marriage advocates in other parts of the US , including in several states where votes were held on amending bans on same - sex unions .
Cases similar to that in New Jersey are pending in California , Connecticut , Iowa and Maryland .
Lawyers for the seven couples had asked the court to overturn an appeals court ruling that the New Jersey legislature must decide whether gay marriage should be allowed , rather than the state 's Supreme Court .
The ruling means that the appeals court decision was upheld and it remains the responsibility of the legislature to take the decision on sanctioning gay marriage .
This article is obsolete .
Over the years , I ’ve learned a lot more about schedules and estimates .
A newer , far better method for producing accurate software schedules painlessly is Evidence - Based Scheduling .
Read that instead .
This article remains here for archival purposes , but please do n’t read it !
Last October , the Northeast US was plastered with ads for something called Acela , a new express train running from Boston to Washington .
With TV ads , billboards , and posters everywhere , you ’d think that it would have created some demand for Amtrak ’s new express service .
Well , maybe .
Amtrak did n’t get a chance to find out .
Acela was delayed , and delayed again , so the marketing campaign played out while Acela service was n’t even available .
Which reminded me of something I heard a marketing manager say when his product got a rave review one month before it went on sale : “ Great publicity !
Too bad you ca n’t buy the dang thing ! ”
Testosterone - crazed game companies like to brag on their web sites that the next game will ship “ when it ’s ready ” .
Schedule ?
We do n’t need no stinkin’ schedule !
We ’re cool game coders !
Most companies do n’t get that luxury .
Ask Lotus .
When they first shipped 123 version 3.0 , it required an 80286 computer , which was n’t very common then .
They delayed the product by 16 months while they worked to shoehorn it into the 640 K memory limit of the 8086 .
By the time they were done , Microsoft had a 16 month lead in developing Excel , and , in a great karmic joke , the 8086 was obsolete anyway !
As I write this , Netscape ’s 5.0 web browser is almost two years late .
Partially , this is because they made the suicidal mistake of throwing out all their code and starting over : the same mistake that doomed Ashton - Tate , Lotus , and Apple ’s MacOS to the recycle - bins of software history .
Netscape has seen its browser share go from about 80 % to about 20 % during this time , all the while it could do nothing to address competitive concerns , because their key software product was disassembled in 1000 pieces on the floor and was in no shape to drive anywhere .
That single bad decision , more than anything else , was the nuclear bomb Netscape blew itself up with .
( Jamie Zawinski ’s world - famous tantrum has the details ) .
So , you have to make a schedule .
This is something almost no programmer wants to do .
In my experience , the vast majority just try to get away with not making a schedule at all .
Of the few that make a schedule , most are only doing it because their boss made them do it , halfheartedly , and nobody actually believes the schedule except for upper management , which simultaneously believes that “ no software project is ever on time ” and in the existence of UFOs .
So why does n’t anybody make a schedule ?
Two key reasons .
One , it ’s a real pain .
Two , nobody believes that it ’s worth anything .
Why go to all the trouble working on a schedule if it ’s not going to be right ?
There is a perception that schedules are consistently wrong , and only get worse as time goes on , so why suffer for naught ?
Here ’s a simple , painless way to make schedules that are actually correct .
1 ) Use Microsoft Excel .
Do n’t use anything fancy like Microsoft Project .
The trouble with Microsoft Project is that it assumes that you want to spend a lot of time worrying about dependencies .
A dependency is when you have two tasks , one of which must be completed before the next one can begin .
I ’ve found that with software , the dependencies are so obvious that it ’s just not worth the effort to formally keep track of them .
Another problem with Project is that it assumes that you ’re going to want to be able to press a little button and “ rebalance ” the schedule .
Inevitably , this means that it ’s going to rearrange things and reassign things to different people .
For software , this just does n’t make sense .
Programmers are not interchangeable .
It takes seven times longer for John to fix Rita ’s bug than for Rita to fix Rita ’s bug .
And if you try to put your UI programmer on a WinSock problem , she ’ll stall and waste a week getting up to speed on WinSock programming .
The bottom line is that Project is designed for building office buildings , not software .
2 ) Keep it Simple .
The standard format I use for schedules is so simple you can memorize it .
You start with just seven columns :
If you have several developers , you can either keep a separate sheet for each developer , or you can make a column with the name of the developer working on each task .
3 ) Each feature should consist of several tasks .
A feature is something like adding a spell checker to your program .
Adding a spell checker consists of quite a few discrete tasks that the programmer has to do .
The most important part of making a schedule is making this list of tasks .
Thus the cardinal rule :
4 ) Only the programmer who is going to write the code can schedule it .
Any system where management writes a schedule and hands it off to programmers is doomed to fail .
Only the programmer who is going to do the work can figure out what steps they will need to take to implement that feature .
And only the programmer can estimate how long each one will take .
5 ) Pick very fine grained tasks .
This is the most important part to making your schedule work .
Your tasks should be measured in hours , not days .
( When I see a schedule measured in days , or even weeks , I know it ’s not real ) .
You might think that a schedule with fine grained tasks is merely more precise .
Wrong !
Very wrong !
When you start with a schedule with rough tasks and then break it down into smaller tasks , you will find that you get a different result , not just a more precise one .
It is a completely different number .
Why does this happen ?
When you have to pick fine grained tasks , you are forcing yourself to actually figure out what steps you are going to have to take .
Write subroutine foo .
Create dialog such and such .
Read the wawa file .
These steps are easy to estimate , because you ’ve written subroutines , created dialogs , and read wawa files before .
If you are sloppy , and pick big “ chunky ” tasks ( “ implement grammar correction ” ) , then you have n’t really thought about what you are going to do .
And when you have n’t thought about what you ’re going to do , you just ca n’t know how long it will take .
As a rule of thumb , each task should be from 2 to 16 hours .
If you have a 40 hour ( one week ) task on your schedule , you ’re not breaking it down enough .
Here ’s another reason to pick fine grained tasks : it forces you to design the damn feature .
If you have a hand - wavy feature called “ Internet Integration ” and you schedule 3 weeks for it , you are doomed , buddy .
If you have to figure out what subroutines you ’re going to write , you are forced to pin down the feature .
By being forced to plan ahead at this level , you eliminate a lot of the instability in a software project .
6 ) Keep track of the original and current estimate .
When you first add a task to the schedule , estimate how long it ’s going to take in hours and put that in both the Orig[ inal ] Est[imate ] and Curr[ent ] Est[imate ] columns .
As time goes on , if a task is taking longer ( or shorter ) than you thought , you can update the Curr Est column as much as you need .
This is the best way to learn from your mistakes and teach yourself how to estimate tasks well .
Most programmers have no idea how to guess how long things will take .
That ’s okay .
As long as you are continuously learning and continuously updating the schedule as you learn , the schedule will work .
( You may have to cut features or slip , but the schedule will still be working correctly , in the sense that it will constantly be telling you when you have to cut features or slip ) .
I ’ve found that most programmers become very good schedulers with about one year of experience .
When the task is done , the Curr Est and Elapsed fields will be the same , and the Remain field will recalc to 0 .
7 ) Update the elapsed column every day .
You do not really have to watch your stopwatch while you code .
Right before you go home , or go to sleep under the desk if you ’re one of those geeks , pretend you ’ve worked for 8 hours ( ha ! ) , figure out which tasks you ’ve worked on , and sprinkle about 8 hours in the elapsed column accordingly .
The remaining time field is then calculated automatically by Excel .
At the same time , update the Curr Est column for those tasks to reflect the new reality .
Updating your schedule daily should only take about two minutes .
That ’s why this is the Painless Schedule Method — it ’s quick and easy .
8 ) Put in line items for Vacations , Holidays , etc .
If your schedule is going to take about a year , each programmer will probably take 10 to 15 days of vacation .
You should have a feature in your schedule called vacations , one for holidays , and anything else that consumes people ’s time .
The idea is that the ship date can be calculated by adding up the remaining time column and dividing by 40 — that ’s how many weeks of work are left , including everything .
9 ) Put debugging time into the schedule !
Debugging is the hardest to estimate .
Think back to the last project you worked on .
Chances are , debugging took from 100 % – 200 % of the time it took to write the code in the first place .
This has to be a line item in the schedule , and it will probably be the largest line item .
Here ’s how it works .
Let ’s say a developer is working on wawa .
The Orig Est was 16 hours , but so far it has taken 20 hours and it looks like it needs another 10 hours of work .
So the developer enters 30 under Curr Est and 20 under elapsed .
At the end of the milestone , all these “ slips ” have probably added up to quite a bit .
Theoretically , to accommodate these slips , we have to cut features in order to ship on time .
Luckily , the first feature we can cut is this great big feature called Buffer which has lots o’ hours already allocated for it .
In principle , developers debug code as they write it .
A programmer should never , ever work on new code if they could instead be fixing bugs .
The bug count must stay as low as possible at all times , for two reasons :
1 ) It ’s easier to fix bugs the same day you wrote the code .
It can be very hard and time - consuming to fix bugs a month later when you ’ve forgotten exactly how the code works .
2 ) Fixing bugs is like doing science .
It is impossible to estimate when you will make the discovery and solve the bug .
If there are only one or two outstanding bugs at any given time , it ’s easy to estimate when the product will ship , because there ’s not much un-estimateable science in your future .
On the other hand , if there are hundreds or thousands of outstanding bugs , it is impossible to predict when they will all be fixed .
If developers always fix bugs as they go along , what ’s the point in having a debugging line item ?
Well , even if you try to fix every bug as you go along , at the end of every milestone , there is inevitably a lot of bug fixing when testers ( internal and beta ) find the really hard bugs .
10 ) Put integration time into the schedule .
If you have more than one programmer , inevitably , there will be stuff that two programmers do that is inconsistent and needs to be reconciled .
They might both implement dialog boxes for similar things that are unnecessarily inconsistent .
Somebody will have to go through all the menus , keyboard accelerators , toolbar tools , etc. , cleaning up and organizing all the new menu items that everybody has been adding willy - nilly .
There will be compiler errors that show up as soon as two people check in code .
This has to be fixed , and it should be a line item on the schedule .
11 ) Put buffer into the schedule .
Things tend to run over .
There are two important kinds of buffer you might want to consider .
First : buffer to account for tasks that took longer than originally estimated .
Second : buffer to account for tasks that you did n’t know you would have to do , usually because management has decided that implementing wawa is SUPER IMPORTANT and can not be left out of the next release .
You may be surprised to find that vacations , holidays , debugging , integration , and buffer time add up to more than the actual tasks do .
If you ’re surprised by this , you have n’t been programming for long , have you ?
Ignore these at your peril .
12 ) Never , ever let managers tell programmers to reduce an estimate .
Many rookie software managers think that they can “ motivate ” their programmers to work faster by giving them nice , “ tight ” ( unrealistically short ) schedules .
I think this kind of motivation is brain - dead .
When I ’m behind schedule , I feel doomed and depressed and unmotivated .
When I ’m working ahead of schedule , I ’m cheerful and productive .
The schedule is not the place to play psychological games .
If your manager makes you reduce an estimate , here ’s what to do .
Create a new column in the schedule called Rick ’s Estimate ( assuming your name is Rick , of course . )
Put your estimate in there .
Let your manager do whatever she wants with the Curr Est column .
Ignore your manager ’s estimates .
When the project is done , see who was closer to reality .
I ’ve found that just threatening to do this works wonders , especially when your manager realizes that they ’ve just gotten into a contest to see how slowly you can work !
Why do inept managers try to get programmers to reduce estimates ?
When the project begins , the technical managers go off , meet with the business people , and come up with a list of features which they think would take about 3 months , but would really take 9 .
When you think of writing code without thinking about all the steps you have to take , it always seems like it will take n time , when in reality it will probably take more like 3n time .
When you do a real schedule , you add up all the tasks and realize that the project is going to take much longer than originally thought .
Reality sinks in .
Inept managers try to address this by figuring out how to get people to work faster .
This is not very realistic .
You might be able to hire more people , but they need to get up to speed and will probably be working at 50 % efficiency for several months ( and dragging down the efficiency of the people who have to mentor them ) .
Anyway , in this market , adding good programmers is going to take 6 months .
You might be able to get 10 % more raw code out of people temporarily at the cost of having them burn out 100 % in a year .
Not a big gain , and it ’s a bit like eating your seed corn .
You might be able to get 20 % more raw code out of people by begging everybody to work super hard , no matter how tired they get .
Boom , debugging time doubles .
An idiotic move that backfires in a splendidly karmic way .
But you can never get 3n from n , ever , and if you think you can , please email me the stock ticker of your company so I can short it .
13 ) A schedule is like wood blocks .
If you have a bunch of wood blocks , and you ca n’t fit them into a box , you have two choices : get a bigger box , or remove some blocks .
If you thought you could ship in 6 months , but you have 12 months on the schedule , you are either going to have to delay shipping , or find some features to delete .
You just ca n’t shrink the blocks , and if you pretend you can , then you are merely depriving yourself of a useful opportunity to actually see into the future by lying to yourself about what you see there .
And you know , the other great byproduct of keeping schedules like this is that you are forced to delete features .
Why is this good ?
Suppose you have two features : one which is really useful and will make your product really great ( example : tables in Netscape 2.0 ) , and another one which is really easy and which the programmers would love to code ( example : the BLINK tag ) , but which serves no useful or marketing purpose .
If you do n’t make a schedule , the programmers will do the easy / fun feature first .
Then they ’ll run out of time , and you will have no choice but to slip the schedule to do the useful / important feature .
If you do make a schedule , even before you start working , you ’ll realize that you have to cut something , so you ’ll cut the easy / fun feature and just do the useful / important feature .
By forcing yourself to chose some features to cut , you wind up making a more powerful , better product with a better mix of good features that ships sooner .
I remember working on Excel 5 .
Our original feature list was huge and would have gone way over schedule .
Oh my !
we thought .
Those are all super important features !
How can we live without a macro editing wizard ?
As it turns out , we had no choice , and we cut what we thought was “ to the bone ” to make the schedule .
Everybody felt unhappy about the cuts .
To assuage our feelings , we simply told ourselves that we were n’t cutting the features , we were simply deferring them to Excel 6 , since they were less important .
As Excel 5 was nearing completion , I started working on the Excel 6 spec with a colleague , Eric Michelman .
We sat down to go through the list of “ Excel 6 ” features that had been cut from the Excel 5 schedule .
We were absolutely shocked to see that the list of cut features was the shoddiest list of features you could imagine .
Not one of those features was worth doing .
I do n’t think a single one of them was ever done , even in the next three releases .
The process of culling features to fit a schedule was the best thing we could have done .
If we had n’t done this , Excel 5 would have taken twice as long and included 50 % useless crap features .
( I have absolutely no doubt that this is exactly what ’s happening to Netscape 5 / Mozilla : they have no schedule , they have no definitive feature list , nobody was willing to cut any features , and they just never shipped .
When they do ship , they ’ll have lots of poxy features like IRC clients that they just should n’t have been spending time on . )
Appendix :
Things you should know about Excel
One of the reasons that Excel is such a great product for working on software schedules is that the only thing most Excel programmers use Excel for is maintaining their software schedules !
( Not many of them are running business what - if scenarios … these are programmers , here ! )
Shared Lists Using the File / Shared Lists command allows everyone to open the file at the same time and edit things at the same time .
Since your whole team should be updating the schedule constantly , this really helps .
Auto Filter
This is a great way to filter the schedule so that , for example , you only see all of the features that are assigned to you .
Combined with Auto Sort , you can see all of the features assigned to you in order of priority which is effectively your “ to do ” list .
Cooooool !
Pivot Tables
This is a great way to see summaries and crosstabulations .
For example , you can make a chart showing the remaining hours for each developer for each priority .
Pivot Tables are like sliced bread and chocolate milkshakes .
You gotta learn how to use them because they make Excel a million times more powerful .
The WORKDAY Function from Excel ’s Analysis Toolpak is a great way to get calendar dates out of a Painless Schedule .
Some Q&A on this article : Juggling Tasks in Excel
Safari Software ships a free Excel template , MasterList - XL for task management based on these principles .
Stob Hi Verity , are we up for some more frolics and fun ?
Nope .
It 's a spot test today .
Using your neatest handwriting , write out a standard C++ loop on the nursery blackboard .
No copying .
This will count towards your final grade .
Joy .
What brought this on ?
Oh , ok – gimme the chalk , let 's get it over with :
for ( int i = 0 ; i < ARRAY_SIZE ; i++) { // do something to an array ...
You should be ashamed of yourself .
That code is a crime against modern C++.
Come out with something like that down the ACCU , you could find yourself sentenced to six months mentoring Linus Torvalds through his Visual Basic breakdown .
Ok , clever clogs , so what 's wrong with it ?
Let me count the ways :
You 've used < ' less than ' in the test instead of != ' not equals ' .
These days you are always supposed to test for inequality , in case you later ' port ' the code to use iterators .
But I LIKE the < test .
It 's a nice overrun - preventing sandbank at the back end of the loop , so that one does n't have to be too careful about getting the stopping condition exactly right .
Know what I mean ?
Shush , child .
There may be colleagues or employers reading .
You 've used a post increment i++ instead of a pre increment ++i , thus incurring the certain cost of an unnecessary copy .
Do n't be silly , it 's an int !
The day they change the language name to ++C , that 's the day I 'll start taking pre-incrementing seriously .
That ARRAY_SIZE is a disgusting # define that you are hiding somewhere in the header .
You can't prove that .
It might be a pukka const for all you know .
You have used a C - style array rather than a container class , thus depriving yourself of the STL 's sanity checks and versatility and potential performance gains and what not .
Just because it says ' array ' in the comment , that does n't signify anything .
I 'm pretty sure I 've updated it to a vector , now you mention it .
And anyway , I 'm suspicious about STL containers going faster ' in theory ' .
Was n't it OS / 2 that had a filing system that ran ten times faster than anything else , provided you remembered to run it ' in theory ' rather than ' in practice ' ?
You have used an int rather than an iterator to get at the elements of your structure , meaning you are restricted to containers that support random access .
See , the thing is , iterator declarations do n't half make a mess of the code .
They are such ugly , prickly things ; all full of :: and <> .
And you always have to make two , one for the index and the one to hold end marker , which makes it worse .
The clincher .
You should n't have been using a loop at all .
You should be using an algorithm
Here we go .
Finally we cut to the chase .
I 've been waiting for this .
Do n't take my word for it .
Listen to the voices of the gods .
Prefer algorithms to loops – Mariella Frostrup , 2000 .
Surely ' Bjarne Stroustrup ' ?

I seem to sense that you have some issues ...
I should cocoa !
You come barging in here , with your metropolitan mannerisms ...
... but there 's no need .
Because I agree with you .
Huh ?
You do ?
Oh yes .
I can never get algorithms to match the problem I have in hand .
I sit there looking at the list , wondering if I should be using adjacent_find or remove_copy_if , but they always have this quality of not quite doing what I want ...
Yes !
Yes !
That 's right !
It 's even worse than those bloody awful find_last_but_one_not_of functions you get with substrings !
... so I look at those adapters and binders and try to bodge it together with a bind2nd here and a greater_equal there ...
This is just what happens to me !
And then you give up and write a whole new functor thingy , just for this one loop ?
And then I give up and write a new functor , hidden guiltily in the middle of the implementation of the class I am really working on , thereby blowing the whole reusability thing to smithereens .
And messing up the readability of the code .
And making a complete pickle of the flow .
AND sending the performance to hell on a handcart too , for all I know .
Assuming you can get the sod to compile !
Yeah , you wrestle for 20 minutes with the bizarre error messages the compiler pushes out when you 're mucking about with templates .
Then you notice that the exercise has taken you about nine times as long as it would to bash in an ordinary loop .
You 're all cross and hot and bothered , because you 've just wasted half an hour trying to do the Right Thing , and the result is a complete and utter dog 's breakfast .
Anybody who comes round and tells me that this is intrinsically more reliable than a hand - coded loop will get such a slap ...
Oh God !
It 's such a relief !
All these years , I thought it was just me !
There , there .
Never mind .
It 's all going to be all right .
Would you like to borrow my hanky ?
Thanks .
But Verity , what are we to do ?
If the C++ overlords believe that the construction of nearly every loop should be a sort of inline Sudoku puzzle , surely the problem must be that we are simply too stupid to use the language ?
Well , I reckon I 'm pretty handy , actually .
Fancy myself ten bob each way , as a programmer .
And surely the very fact that you are a Reg reader implicitly puts you above the top quartile , if not decile , of both taste and coding competence .
I do n't think that we are the problem here .
We are good workers blaming our tool .
Damn right , sister !
So is there some sort of workaround ?
Well , the fabulous Boost boys have this library that lets you support llama functions ...
You perhaps mean ' lambda ' functions ...
... which kind of lets you bodge in the code where it belongs , in the loop .
So to do a for loop within a for_each , to steal an example from the Boost site
int a [ 5 ] [ 10 ] ; int i ; for_each ( a , a+5 , for_loop ( var ( i ) =0 , var ( i ) < 10 , ++var ( i ) , _ 1 [ var ( i ) ] += 1 ) ) ;
Hmm , s'pose that looks more like it .
It does , but I say it 's still too hard .
If you look at their examples , you 'll see it gets pretty hairy and ugly as soon as you need to do anything even slightly complicated .
I take it you have an alternative solution ?
Indeed .
If we must write lambda functions to use the standard library properly , then the language should bloody well support lambda functions directly , straight out of the box .
Proper , ordinary , C++ ; not using some near - C++ ersatz syntax that geniuses have toiled over for years using macro and template tricks to make it slightly less ghastly .
Let the compiler take the strain .
If JavaScript can do it , C ++ should be able to too .
Ask any Joel .
Sounds fab .
Where 's your modified version of gcc that supports this stuff ?
< cough > I see myself as more of an Ideas Person .
I leave mere implementation details to Mariella & co .
Quelle surprise .
To end things on a more positive note , how about an example of an iterative algorithm that 's easy - to - use , neat , quick and really does the business ?
Ok , how about this :
Have somebody else hold your glass for you .
Take one sip of liquid or , in severe cases , two .
Eh ?
It 's a cure for hiccups .
Works 100 per cent , at the pub , work and even home .
Try it .
Verity , you are too good to me .
I know . ®
Siestas are popular in continental Europe
Met Office research has predicted by the second half of this century summers like the one in 2003 which killed thousands will become the norm .
Professor Bill Keatinge , a University College London expert on how heat affects the body , said midday rests would be needed to help people cope .
He said without a lifestyle change , the UK could see more people die of heat .
The 2003 heatwave - the hottest summer for 500 years - was linked to 27,000 deaths across Europe , including 2,000 in Britain .
2003 was a foretaste of thing to come if we carry on emitting greenhouse gases
Peter Stott , of the Met Office
During the average summer , 800 people in Britain normally die because of the heat - most commonly through heart attacks or organ damage as the body heats up .
But officials from the Met Office 's climate research unit have predicted the UK could have summers as hot as 2003 - when temperatures hit 35 ºC ( 95 º F ) - every other year .
The study which is yet to be published analysed how climate change would affect temperatures and concluded the hottest days could rise by 7C to top 40C ( 104 ºF ) .
Researcher Peter Stott said : " 2003 was a foretaste of thing to come if we carry on emitting greenhouse gases .
It is likely to become the norm . "
Already this summer temperatures in Spain and Italy have been nudging 40C , prompting reports of heat - related deaths .
Change
Professor Keatinge said a change in habits was needed if temperatures do rise .
" When it is really hot people need to take precautions , especially the elderly .
This means avoiding physical exercise , staying out of the heat .
" Siestas are a good way of doing this , even in central Europe such as Germany they are becoming more common with people working later .
" It is a simple way of staying cool without installing air conditioning . "
Professor Keatinge also said people should eat and drink more during heatwaves .
Mark Gibbs , a Met Office official who advises the NHS on how to prepare for heatwaves , agreed lifestyle changes were needed .
" We need to look at these countries that have already adapted to the heat ... building design , changing lifestyle . "
Sorting algorithms Heapsort
With its time complexity of O ( n log( n ) ) heapsort is optimal .
It utilizes a special data structure called heap .
This data structure is explained in the following .
Definition : Let T = ( V , E ) an almost complete binary tree with a vertex labelling a : V M that assigns to each vertex u a label a ( u ) from an ordered set ( M , ) .
A vertex u V has the heap property if it has no direct descendant with a greater label , i.e. v V : ( u , v ) E a ( u ) a ( v )
T is a heap if all vertices have the heap property , i.e. ( u , v ) E : a ( u ) a ( v )
We call T a semi- heap if all vertices except possibly the root r have the heap property , i.e. ( u , v ) E , u ≠ r : a ( u ) a ( v )
Example : Figure 1 : Heap with n = 10 vertices
Observe that each leaf automatically has the heap property regardless of its label , since it has no descendants .
The data structure of the heapsort algorithm is a heap .
The data sequence to be sorted is stored as the labels of the binary tree .
As shown later , in the implementation no pointer structures are necessary to represent the tree , since an almost complete binary tree can be efficently stored in an array .
Heapsort algorithm
The following description of heapsort refers to Figure 2 ( a ) - ( e ) .
( a ) ( b ) ( c )
(d ) ( e ) Figure 2 : Retrieving the maximum element and restoring the heap
If the sequence to be sorted is arranged as a heap , the greatest element of the sequence can be retrieved immediately from the root ( a ) .
In order to get the next - greatest element , the rest of the elements have to be rearranged as a heap .
The rearrangement is done in the following way :
Let b be a leaf of maximum depth .
Write the label of b to the root and delete leaf b ( b ) .
Now the tree is a semi-heap , since the root possibly has lost its heap property .
Making a heap from a semi- heap is simple :
Do nothing if the root already has the heap property , otherwise exchange its label with the maximum label of its direct descendants ( c ) .
Let this descendant be v .
Now possibly v has lost its heap property .
Proceed further with v , i.e. make a heap from the semi- heap rooted at v ( d ) .
This process stops when a vertex is reached that has the heap property ( e ) .
Eventually this is the case at a leaf .
Making a heap from a semi- heap can conceptionally be implemented by the following procedure downheap :
procedure downheap ( v ) Input : semi-heap with root v Output : heap ( by rearranging the vertex labels ) Method : while v does not have the heap property do choose direct descendant w with maximum label a ( w ) exchange a ( v ) and a ( w ) set v := w
Procedure downheap can be used to build a heap from an arbitrarily labelled tree .
By proceeding bottom - up , downheap is called for all subtrees rooted at inner vertices .
Since leaves are already heaps they may be omitted .
procedure buildheap Input : almost complete binary tree T of depth d ( T ) with vertex labelling a Output : heap ( by rearranging the vertex labels ) Method : for i := d ( T ) – 1 downto 0 do for all inner vertices v of depth d ( v ) = i do downheap ( v )
A call of buildheap is the first step of procedure heapsort , which can now be written down as follows :
procedure heapsort Input : almost complete binary tree with root r and vertex labelling a Output : vertex labels in descending order Method : buildheap while r is not a leaf do output a ( r ) choose leaf b of maximum depth write label a ( b ) to r delete leaf b downheap ( r ) output a ( r )
This simulation illustrates the process of building a heap from an arbitrarily labelled tree .
( Java applet for simulation of function buildheap )
An almost complete binary tree with n vertices has a depth of at most log( n ) .
Therefore , procedure downheap requires at most log( n ) steps .
Procedure buildheap calls downheap for each vertex , therefore it requires at most n ·log ( n ) steps .
Heapsort calls buildheap once ; then it calls downheap for each vertex , together it requires at most 2· n ·log ( n ) steps .
Thus , the time complexity of heapsort is T ( n ) O ( n ·log ( n ) ) .
The algorithm is optimal , since the lower bound of the sorting problem is attained .
An almost complete binary tree with n vertices and vertex labelling a can be stored most efficiently in an array a :
the root is stored at position 0
the two direct descendants of a vertex at position v are stored at positions 2 v +1 and 2 v +2
All vertices at positions 0 , ... , n /2 - 1 are inner nodes , all vertices n / 2 , ... , n - 1 are leaves ( integer division / ) .
The heap with n = 10 vertices of Figure 1 is shown in Figure 3 as an example .
Figure 3 : Array representation of the heap of Figure 1
Using this array representation of the heap , heapsort can be implemented as an in - place sorting algorithm .
In each step of heapsort , the root label a ( r ) is not output but stored at the position of the leaf b that is deleted in the following .
Deleting leaf b means to consider just the array elements left of b as the remaining heap .
In other words : the four steps
output of the label of the root a ( r )
( ) choose leaf b of maximum depth
of maximum depth write label of b to the root
to the root delete leaf b
are replaced by an exchange of the root label and the label of b :
exchange the label of the root with the label of the last leaf and do not consider that leaf anymore
The following Java class HeapSorter encapsulates the functions downheap , buildheap and heapsort .
In order to sort an array b , Heapsort is called with the statement HeapSorter. sort ( b ) .
public class HeapSorter { private static int [ ] a ; private static int n ; public static void sort ( int [ ] a 0 ) { a=a0 ; n=a.length ; heapsort ( ) ; } private static void heapsort ( ) { buildheap ( ) ; while ( n > 1 ) { n--; exchange ( 0 , n ) ; downheap ( 0 ) ; } } private static void buildheap ( ) { for ( int v=n /2- 1 ; v>=0 ; v--) downheap ( v ) ; } private static void downheap ( int v ) { int w=2*v+1 ; while ( w < n ) { if ( w+1 < n ) if ( a [ w+1 ] > a[ w ] ) w++ ; if ( a [ v ] > =a[w ] ) return ; exchange ( v , w ) ; v=w ; w=2*v+1 ; } } private static void exchange ( int i , int j ) { int t=a [ i ] ; a [ i ] =a[j ] ; a[j ] =t ; } }
With its time complexity of O ( n log( n ) ) heapsort is optimal .
Unlike mergesort , heapsort requires no extra space .
On the other hand , heapsort is not stable .
A sorting algorithm is stable , if it leaves the order of equal elements unchanged .
The heap data structure can also be used for an efficient implementation of a priority queue .
A priority queue is an abstract list data structure with the operations insert and extractMax .
With each element in the list a certain priority is associated .
By insert an element together with its priority is inserted into the list .
By extractMax the element with the highest priority is extracted from the list .
Using a heap , both operations can be implemented in time O ( log( n ) ) .
Heapsort was originally published by J.W.J. Williams as Algorithm 232 in the journal Communications of the ACM [ Wil 64 ] .
After witnessing much misuse of the Long Tail phrase , this silly post has finally pushed me over the edge .
It 's time to draw the line .
Long
Tails are found everywhere , but not , you know , actually everywhere .
There are many distortions of the term , but the most common one is to use it as a newly - positive synonym for " fringe " .
Invoking the Long Tail is not a magic wand to explain away the apparent lack of demand for what you 've got .
The Long Tail is not a get - out - of - jail - free card for poor - selling product .
Or weak sectors .
Or bad ideas .
The fact that something is n't popular does n't mean that it 's just a matter of time before it will benefit from all sorts of powerful demand - creation Long Tail effects .
More likely , it 's just not good enough to be commercially interesting , and probably never will be .
Most of the " niche " products in the tail are simply crap .
That 's okay , because some significant fraction of them are n't and with a functioning way to separate the good from the bad , they can be found by those who will appreciate them .
But note the essential element : a functioning way to drive demand .
As I 've mentioned in the original article , for Long Tail effects to work , you need both a head of relatively few hits and a tail of many niches , so that recommendations and other filters can lead consumers from one to the other .
A tail without a head is too noisy and apparently random to get consumer traction ; people need to start with the familiar and then move , via trusted recommendations , to the unfamiliar .
Likewise a head without a tail is too limited in choice ; the odds of finding a niche you want are too low to bother exploring much beyond what you already know .
Thus the two big Long Tail opportunities are :
Aggregating hits and niches into a one big curve , from head to tail .
Creating content and products that can plug into someone else 's aggregated curve .
If what you 're selling is fringe , it may well enjoy Long Tail benefits , but only if it can fit nicely into an existing market that has the capacity to drive demand .
If that market does n't exist , it 's unlikely that throwing some niche products out there is going to create it .
Even if it does exist , those products will only reach their audience if the filters and recommendations are good enough to find them .
While I 'm at it , here are some other things the Long Tail is not ( to protect the guilty I will refrain from linking to the offending examples ) :
Commodification
The LT is about nicheification , which is different .
Simple variety
Offering a few different choices or a bit of customization ( like the sandwich filling options in the risible example above ) is not enough .
Long
Tail effects kick in when you 're expanding variety and choice by orders of magnitude -- from 10 x to infinity .
The case for an all amateur , self - published future
The LT will probably have as much commercial content as ever .
It will just be joined by far more amateur fare , forming a relatively seamless continuum from pros to ams .
The actual end of hits
The LT ends the tyranny of hits , shifting the market equally to niches .
But it certainly acknowledges that some things will continue to be a lot more popular than others .
Powerlaw distributions are as natural as diversity itself .
A focus on small markets at the exclusion of large ones Again , you need both hits and niches to allow the filters and recommendation engines to work , driving demand down the curve from the known to the unknown .
Just any powerlaw Powerlaws are ubiquitous .
Long
Tails are not .
The first shows up anywhere you have variety , inequality , and network effects ( word of mouth ) .
The second requires massive variety and a wide range between the hits and niches .
After all , many short tails are simply truncated powerlaw distributions .
They just are n't , er , long .
Venture capitalists who are tired of bogus Long Tail pitches are invited to point the hapless entrepreneurs to this post .

In Hollywood 's world of air - brushed perfection , Scarlett Johansson 's real - life curves have won her a legion of fans .
Now there is another reason to warm to her .
Like countless women , it seems the 21 - year - old actress has a touch of cellulite .
But she is n't the sort of girl to let a little dimple or two stop her wearing an elegant short dress .
More :
• How a West End show lost Scarlett
Unveiled as the global new face of sportswear firm Reebok , Miss Johansson displayed the dreaded dimpled skin that , it appears , almost no woman is immune from .
Dressed in a skimpy outfit which hid nothing , she exposed her less than perfect thighs at the launch , which is ironically supposed to be based on the actress 's " sporty " look .
In a multi-million pound deal , she will design her own retro-inspired clothing and footwear range which will be known as Scarlett ' hearts ' Rbk .
It is likely that chiefs at the sportswear giant picked the actress for her toned body , which she put on show while playing a tennis player in her recent movie Match Point .
Miss Johansson , who models herself on late curvy icon Marilyn Monroe , does her best to remove herself from the painfully skinny look which many of her peers swear by to get acting work .
Instead the Oscar - winning star says she is determined to keep hold of her curves despite pressure to lose weight .
Talking openly about her twig - like colleagues , she said : " Everyone in Hollywood is so skinny and you 're constantly feeling like you 're not skinny enough . "
The actress even showed off her curves alongside slender British star Keira Knightley when both went naked for the cover of Vanity Fair 's annual Hollywood edition .
Since catapulting to fame in 1998 with her performance in The Horse Whisperer , Miss Johansson has gone on to become one of Hollywood 's most successful young actresses .
In 2004 she won a BAFTA for her lead role in Lost In Translation .
However , while she is a star on the big screen , she has also scooped other fruitful advertising deals , including cosmetic brand L'Oreal , for which she was paid £ 3 million .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
With an outsider moving into the top spot at Boeing , analysts caution that the new boss needs to make sure the managers of the company 's defense and commercial divisions do n't head for the door in a huff .
A departure of either James Albaugh , in charge of Boeing 's integrated defense systems group , or Alan Mulally at the commercial airplanes unit would mean losing decades of experience at the world 's largest aerospace company , as well as the executives ' extensive relationships in their respective industries .
What 's more , both are working on key contracts that will shape Boeing 's financial future .
W. James McNerney Jr. , who 's leaving 3M Co. MMM , - 1.29 % to take the helm at Boeing BA , - 1.84 % , addressed the issue during a conference call Thursday when asked by an analyst about Albaugh and Mulally 's future .
McNerney said he'd spoken with the two and noted that they must have been disappointed at not being picked for the top job .
Nevertheless , he said they offered " enthusiastic support " for his appointment .
" So , I think we are going to work together well and productively , " he added .
All three executives know each other , crossing paths frequently during their decades in the aerospace industry .
McNerney is also a member of Boeing 's board of directors .
Among giants
Running a division at an industrial giant like Boeing gives an executive responsibility for tens of thousands of workers and a business with more sales than most stand - alone companies .
Albaugh and Mulally each run divisions that generated more revenue last year than 3 M 's total $ 20 billion in 2004 sales .
Albaugh 's integrated defense systems group had sales of $ 30.5 billion in 2004 , while Mulally 's commercial airplanes division had sales of $ 21 billion .
Just as McNerney himself was in the running to take over General Electric Co. GE , - 1.85 % before he left for 3 M , is the situation similar at Boeing ?
Not so , said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale .
He indicated that Mulally is in the middle of launching the 787 Dreamliner , Boeing 's first new plane in more than a decade .
And Albaugh is shifting the company 's defense group from a focus on military hardware sales to taking on larger responsibility bringing together different technologies for the Pentagon .
The Future Combat Systems contract with the U.S. Army gives Boeing unprecedented responsibility for different programs that will be all technologically tied together .
" In both cases , there are exciting new programs they are in the midst of , " added Neale .
In an interview with the Seattle Times after McNerney 's announcement , Mulally said he is plans to stay at Boeing .
Also , in messages to workers , both Mulally and Albaugh praised their new box and his selection as Boeing 's next chief .
Wall Street wonders
In April , McNerney , 55 , issued a public statement that said he was not leaving 3 M for Boeing .
Yet he eventually changed his mind and surprised Wall Street with his decision this week .
Analysts who lauded his appointment are still wondering what Mulally or Albaugh will do .
" One unknown stemming from this announcement is the future of the two division heads ... who were in the running for the CEO job , " wrote Prudential Equity Group analyst Jared Muroff .
Just as the Boeing board kept the chief executive selection process under wraps until the very end , it could be expected that any executive looking to jump would be just as discreet .
" Obviously , they 're not going to telegraph they 're about to leave , " said Paul Nisbet , analyst at JSA Research .
Nisbet said that Albaugh -- who is 55 and has been with Boeing since 1975 -- might be more likely to leave than Mulally , who turns 60 this year and joined Boeing in 1969 .
But the departure of either manager would be a big deal .
" I hope that for Boeing 's stake that they decide to stay , " added Nisbet .
The company could always reach into its wallet if it felt like that was necessary .
But so far , Boeing has not done so .
Interim Chairman Lewis Platt said during Thursday 's conference call that the company had not offered any retention packages to either Albaugh or Mulally .
" We have both , Jim [ McNerney ] and I , have talked to them at some length , and they all seemed to be quite committed to staying with the company and supporting Jim , " Platt added .
" So that does not seem to be necessary at this moment . "

The discovery of potential deep - water oil and gas reserves off Cuba 's northern coast has caught the eye of the world 's energy - hungry nations .
The US could see rigs drilling for Cuban oil only 50 miles off Florida
The 44 - year - old US trade embargo , meanwhile , continues to bar American companies from doing business with the Caribbean island .
But , some observers are asking , can the US really afford to risk losing out on valuable energy resources only 50 miles ( 80 km ) off Key West ?
The prospect of nations such as China , Venezuela or India lining up to exploit Cuban oil has already led some politicians to call for the embargo to be relaxed .
They want US oil companies to be able to bid for exploration rights - and for environmental laws to be relaxed to allow drilling in the adjoining US waters .
Others insist the embargo must remain in force in order to keep pressure on Cuba 's President Fidel Castro over human rights .
Gulf promise
Cuba 's share of the Gulf of Mexico was established in 1977 , when it signed treaties with the US and Mexico .
A US Geological Survey report published last year estimates that 4.6 billion barrels of oil and 9.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas could lie within that zone , in the North Cuba Basin .
Cuba had already parcelled its 112,000 sq km ( 43,240 sq mile ) territory into 59 exploration blocks , which it opened up to foreign companies in 1999 .
Initial test drilling results and rising oil prices have combined to make the potential deep - water reserves a promising prospect .
Six foreign companies have signed up for 16 of the blocks , according to Fidel Rivero , director general of Cuba 's state oil company , CUPET .
Canadian firm Sherritt has taken the rights for four blocks and is already involved in on - shore oil production in Cuba , off Varadero - as is China .
It gives an indication that the geology of the area must be extremely positive
Jorge Pinon , energy consultant
India 's ONGC announced its investment in two blocks on Sunday , saying it presented the opportunity of " great finds " .
In May this year it agreed a 30 % stake in a separate six - block venture with Spanish firm Repsol YPF .
A further 30 % share was taken by Norway 's Norsk Hydro .
Jorge Pinon , an energy consultant working for the Institute for Cuban and Cuban - American Studies at the University of Miami , said the involvement of Norsk Hydro - a leading offshore oil producer - was significant .
" It gives an indication that the geology of the area must be extremely positive and has a high possibility of producing oil in commercial quantities , " he told the BBC News website .
However , even if good quality reserves are found , he believes it will be at least five years before production really gets going because deep - water rigs are in short supply .
Rival legislation
The debate over Cuba 's potential oil reserves has been making waves in Congress .
Our current policy does n't serve our energy needs , environmental concerns , or economic principles
Congressman Jeff Flake
This summer , Republicans Jeff Flake and Larry Craig introduced twin bills to the House of Representatives and Senate respectively that would exempt American " big oil " from the embargo .
Congressman Flake , who represents Arizona , described the ban on trade with Cuba as " archaic policy " .
" Our current policy does n't serve our energy needs , environmental concerns , or economic principles , " he said .
Two Florida Democrats , Senator Bill Nelson and Congressman Jim Davis , countered with rival legislation which would deny US visas to the executives of foreign oil firms which drill in Cuban waters .
They warn of the potential environmental threat , should deep - water drilling lead to oil spills .
" At risk are the Florida Keys and the state 's tourism economy , not to mention the $ 8bn that Congress is investing to restore the Everglades , " said Sen Nelson .
Future thaw ?
Meanwhile voices from the Cuban - American lobby argue that loosening the embargo would weaken the US government 's ability to pressure Cuba on human rights .
US oil firms may play a waiting game on Cuban reserves
The Cuban American National Foundation , an anti-Castro exile group based in Miami , has called instead for trade restrictions to be tightened further .
Speculation over a possible future thaw in US - Cuba relations has been heightened by Fidel Castro 's recent illness and temporary delegation of power to his brother , Raul .
While few people believe Cuba 's oil prospects augur an immediate end to the decades - long embargo , some believe it is a step in that direction .
One of those is Kirby Jones , president of the US - Cuba Trade Association , an organisation which seeks to normalise trade relations between the two nations .
" It 's really the 800lb gorilla waiting to knock on the door , " he told the BBC News website .
" As soon as Cuba actually once again initiates exploration - as soon as there 's an oil platform scheduled to be in their waters - I think we will see a lot more interest and US companies very active .
" It 's really the first time ever in the history between the US and Cuba that there is a strategic cost to maintaining the embargo .
" [ Cuba 's oil ] will be explored , there 's no question about that - it's whether the US will share it , or maintain the embargo and let it go to China , India , Norway . "
What we are seeing now is a certain level of interest - but not necessarily something that 's really going to up - end the Cuban embargo
Daniel Erikson
Inter - American Dialogue
Daniel Erikson , Caribbean programmes director at the Inter - American Dialogue , a Washington policy group , points out that Cuba has said US firms would be welcome to explore its waters .
" It 's being watched with a fair amount of interest by oil and gas companies in Texas and elsewhere , " he said .
However , he also sounds a note of caution .
Few firms have the technology to drill deep enough to reach Cuba 's potential oil reserves - and , if proven , their depth would make them costly to exploit .
" Companies are n't going to push for any change to US law unless they really know that Cuba has substantial reserves , " he said .
" So what we are seeing now is a certain level of interest - but not necessarily something that 's really going to up - end the Cuban embargo . "
Ten Essential Development Practices
The following ten tips come from Perl Best Practices , a new book of Perl coding and development guidelines by Damian Conway .
1. Design the Module ’s Interface First
The most important aspect of any module is not how it implements the facilities it provides , but the way in which it provides those facilities in the first place .
If the module ’s API is too awkward , or too complex , or too extensive , or too fragmented , or even just poorly named , developers will avoid using it .
They ’ll write their own code instead .
In that way , a poorly designed module can actually reduce the overall maintainability of a system .
Designing module interfaces requires both experience and creativity .
Perhaps the easiest way to work out how an interface should work is to “ play test ” it : to write examples of code that will use the module before implementing the module itself .
These examples will not be wasted when the design is complete .
You can usually recycle them into demos , documentation examples , or the core of a test suite .
The key , however , is to write that code as if the module were already available , and write it the way you ’d most like the module to work .
Once you have some idea of the interface you want to create , convert your “ play tests ” into actual tests ( see Tip # 2 ) .
Then it ’s just a Simple Matter Of Programming to make the module work the way that the code examples and the tests want it to .
Of course , it may not be possible for the module to work the way you ’d most like , in which case attempting to implement it that way will help you determine what aspects of your API are not practical , and allow you to work out what might be an acceptable alternative .
2. Write the Test Cases Before the Code
Probably the single best practice in all of software development is writing your test suite first .
A test suite is an executable , self - verifying specification of the behavior of a piece of software .
If you have a test suite , you can–at any point in the development process–verify that the code works as expected .
If you have a test suite , you can–after any changes during the maintenance cycle–verify that the code still works as expected .
Write the tests first .
Write them as soon as you know what your interface will be ( see # 1 ) .
Write them before you start coding your application or module .
Unless you have tests , you have no unequivocal specification of what the software should do , and no way of knowing whether it does it .
Writing tests always seems like a chore , and an unproductive chore at that : you do n’t have anything to test yet , so why write tests ?
Yet most developers will –almost automatically –write driver software to test their new module in an ad hoc way :
> cat try_inflections.pl #
Test my shiny new English inflections module ... use Lingua:: EN :: Inflect qw ( inflect ) ; #
Try some plurals ( both standard and unusual inflections ) ... my % plural_of = ( ' house ' => ' houses ' , ' mouse ' => ' mice ' , ' box ' => ' boxes ' , ' ox ' => ' oxen ' , ' goose ' => ' geese ' , ' mongoose ' => ' mongooses ' , ' law ' => ' laws ' , ' mother - in- law ' => ' mothers - in-law ' , ) ; # For each of them , print both the expected result and the actual inflection ... for my $ word ( keys % plural_of ) { my $ expected = $ plural_of { $ word} ; my $ computed = inflect ( " PL_N ( $ word ) " ) ; print " For $ word :
" , " \tExpected : $ expected
" , " \tComputed : $ computed
" ; }
A driver like that is actually harder to write than a test suite , because you have to worry about formatting the output in a way that is easy to read .
It ’s also much harder to use the driver than it would be to use a test suite , because every time you run it you have to wade though that formatted output and verify “ by eye ” that everything is as it should be .
That ’s also error - prone ; eyes are not optimized for picking out small differences in the middle of large amounts of nearly identical text .
Instead of hacking together a driver program , it ’s easier to write a test program using the standard Test : : Simple module .
Instead of print statements showing what ’s being tested , you just write calls to the ok ( ) subroutine , specifying as its first argument the condition under which things are okay , and as its second argument a description of what you ’re actually testing :
> cat inflections .t use Lingua:: EN : : Inflect qw ( inflect ) ; use Test :: Simple qw ( no_plan ) ; my % plural_of = ( ' mouse ' => ' mice ' , ' house ' => ' houses ' , ' ox ' => ' oxen ' , ' box ' => ' boxes ' , ' goose ' => ' geese ' , ' mongoose ' => ' mongooses ' , ' law ' => ' laws ' , ' mother - in - law ' => ' mothers - in - law ' , ) ; for my $ word ( keys % plural_of ) { my $ expected = $ plural_of { $ word} ; my $ computed = inflect ( " PL_N ( $ word ) " ) ; ok ( $ computed eq $ expected , " $ word -> $ expected " ) ; }
Note that this code loads Test : : Simple with the argument qw ( no_plan ) .
Normally that argument would be tests => count , indicating how many tests to expect , but here the tests are generated from the % plural_of table at run time , so the final count will depend on how many entries are in that table .
Specifying a fixed number of tests when loading the module is useful if you happen know that number at compile time , because then the module can also “ meta - test : ” verify that you carried out all the tests you expected to .
The Test :: Simple program is slightly more concise and readable than the original driver code , and the output is much more compact and informative :
> perl inflections.t ok 1 - house -> houses ok 2 - law -> laws not ok 3 - mongoose -> mongooses # Failed test ( inflections .t at line 21 ) ok 4 - goose -> geese ok 5 - ox -> oxen not ok 6 - mother - in - law -> mothers - in - law # Failed test ( inflections .t at line 21 ) ok 7 - mouse -> mice ok 8 - box -> boxes 1..8 # Looks like you failed 2 tests of 8 .
More importantly , this version requires far less effort to verify the correctness of each test .
You just scan down the left margin looking for a not and a comment line .
You might prefer to use the Test :: More module instead of Test : : Simple .
Then you can specify the actual and expected values separately , by using the is ( ) subroutine , rather than ok ( ) :
use Lingua:: EN : : Inflect qw ( inflect ) ; use Test :: More qw ( no_plan ) ; #
Now using more advanced testing tools my % plural_of = ( ' mouse ' => ' mice ' , ' house ' => ' houses ' , ' ox ' => ' oxen ' , ' box ' => ' boxes ' , ' goose ' => ' geese ' , ' mongoose ' => ' mongooses ' , ' law ' => ' laws ' , ' mother - in - law ' => ' mothers - in - law ' , ) ; for my $ word ( keys % plural_of ) { my $ expected = $ plural_of { $ word} ; my $ computed = inflect ( " PL_N ( $ word ) " ) ; #
Test expected and computed inflections for string equality ... is ( $ computed , $ expected , " $ word -> $ expected " ) ; }
Apart from no longer having to type the eq yourself , this version also produces more detailed error messages :
> perl inflections.t ok 1 - house -> houses ok 2 - law -> laws not ok 3 - mongoose -> mongooses # Failed test ( inflections .t at line 20 ) # got : ' mongeese ' # expected : ' mongooses ' ok 4 - goose -> geese ok 5 - ox -> oxen not ok 6 - mother - in - law -> mothers - in - law # Failed test ( inflections .t at line 20 ) # got : ' mothers - in - laws ' # expected : ' mothers - in - law ' ok 7 - mouse -> mice ok 8 - box -> boxes 1..8 # Looks like you failed 2 tests of 8 .
The Test :: Tutorial documentation that comes with Perl 5.8 provides a gentle introduction to both Test : : Simple and Test :: More .
3. Create Standard POD Templates for Modules and Applications
One of the main reasons documentation can often seem so unpleasant is the “ blank page effect . ”
Many programmers simply do n’t know how to get started or what to say .
Perhaps the easiest way to make writing documentation less forbidding ( and hence , more likely to actually occur ) is to circumvent that initial empty screen by providing a template that developers can cut and paste into their code .
For a module , that documentation template might look something like this :
=head1 NAME < Module :: Name > - < One-line description of module 's purpose > =head1 VERSION
The initial template usually just has :
This documentation refers to < Module : : Name > version 0.0.1 .
=head1 SYNOPSIS use < Module : : Name > ; # Brief but working code example (s ) here showing the most common usage(s ) #
This section will be as far as many users bother reading , so make it as # educational and exemplary as possible .
=head1 DESCRIPTION
A full description of the module and its features .
May include numerous subsections ( i.e. , =head2 , =head3 , etc. ) .
=head1 SUBROUTINES / METHODS
A separate section listing the public components of the module 's interface .
These normally consist of either subroutines that may be exported , or methods that may be called on objects belonging to the classes that the module provides .
Name the section accordingly .
In an object - oriented module , this section should begin with a sentence ( of the form " An object of this class represents ... " ) to give the reader a high - level context to help them understand the methods that are subsequently described .
=head1 DIAGNOSTICS
A list of every error and warning message that the module can generate ( even the ones that will " never happen " ) , with a full explanation of each problem , one or more likely causes , and any suggested remedies .
=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
A full explanation of any configuration system (s ) used by the module , including the names and locations of any configuration files , and the meaning of any environment variables or properties that can be set .
These descriptions must also include details of any configuration language used .
=head1 DEPENDENCIES
A list of all of the other modules that this module relies upon , including any restrictions on versions , and an indication of whether these required modules are part of the standard Perl distribution , part of the module 's distribution , or must be installed separately .
=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES
A list of any modules that this module cannot be used in conjunction with .
This may be due to name conflicts in the interface , or competition for system or program resources , or due to internal limitations of Perl ( for example , many modules that use source code filters are mutually incompatible ) .
=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
A list of known problems with the module , together with some indication of whether they are likely to be fixed in an upcoming release .
Also , a list of restrictions on the features the module does provide : data types that cannot be handled , performance issues and the circumstances in which they may arise , practical limitations on the size of data sets , special cases that are not ( yet ) handled , etc .
The initial template usually just has :
There are no known bugs in this module .
Please report problems to < Maintainer name (s ) > ( < contact address > )
Patches are welcome .
=head1 AUTHOR < Author name (s ) > ( < contact address > ) =head1 LICENSE AND COPYRIGHT Copyright ( c ) < year > < copyright holder > ( < contact address > ) .

followed by whatever license you wish to release it under .

The most likely variation will be in the license and copyright , but you may also have specific in - house conventions regarding version numbering , the grammar of diagnostic messages , or the attribution of authorship .
4. Use a Revision Control System
Maintaining control over the creation and modification of your source code is utterly essential for robust team - based development .
And not just over source code : you should be revision controlling your documentation , and data files , and document templates , and makefiles , and style sheets , and change logs , and any other resources your system requires .
Just as you would n’t use an editor without an Undo command or a word processor that can’t merge documents , so too you should n’t use a file system you can’t rewind , or a development environment that ca n’t integrate the work of many contributors .
Programmers make mistakes , and occasionally those mistakes will be catastrophic .
They will reformat the disk containing the most recent version of the code .
Or they ’ll mistype an editor macro and write zeros all through the source of a critical core module .
Or two developers will unwittingly edit the same file at the same time and half their changes will be lost .
Revision control systems can prevent those kinds of problems .
Moreover , occasionally the very best debugging technique is to just give up , stop trying to get yesterday ’s modifications to work correctly , roll the code back to a known stable state , and start over again .
Less drastically , comparing the current condition of your code with the most recent stable version from your repository ( even just a line - by - line diff ) can often help you isolate your recent “ improvements ” and work out which of them is the problem .
Revision control systems such as RCS , CVS , Subversion , Monotone , darcs , Perforce , GNU arch , or BitKeeper can protect against calamities , and ensure that you always have a working fallback position if maintenance goes horribly wrong .
The various systems have different strengths and limitations , many of which stem from fundamentally different views on what exactly revision control is .
It ’s a good idea to audition the various revision control systems , and find the one that works best for you .
Pragmatic Version Control Using Subversion , by Mike Mason ( Pragmatic Bookshelf , 2005 ) and Essential CVS , by Jennifer Vesperman ( O’Reilly , 2003 ) are useful starting points .
5. Create Consistent Command - Line Interfaces
Command - line interfaces have a strong tendency to grow over time , accreting new options as you add features to the application .
Unfortunately , the evolution of such interfaces is rarely designed , managed , or controlled , so the set of flags , options , and arguments that a given application accepts are likely to be ad hoc and unique .
This also means they ’re likely to be inconsistent with the unique ad hoc sets of flags , options , and arguments that other related applications provide .
The result is inevitably a suite of programs , each of which is driven in a distinct and idiosyncratic way .
For example :
> orchestrate source.
txt - to interim.orc > remonstrate +interim.rem - interim.orc > fenestrate --src=interim.rem --dest=final.wdw
Invalid input format > fenestrate -- help Unknown option : -- help .
Type ' fenestrate - hmo ' for help
Here , the orchestrate utility expects its input file as its first argument , while the - to flag specifies its output file .
The related remonstrate tool uses - infile and +outfile options instead , with the output file coming first .
The fenestrate program seems to require GNU - style “ long options : ” -- src=infile and -- dest=outfile , except , apparently , for its oddly named help flag .
All in all , it ’s a mess .
When you ’re providing a suite of programs , all of them should appear to work the same way , using the same flags and options for the same features across all applications .
This enables your users to take advantage of existing knowledge–instead of continually asking you .
Those three programs should work like this :
> orchestrate - i source .
txt -o dest.orc > remonstrate - i source.orc -o dest.rem > fenestrate - i source.rem -o dest.wdw Input file ( ' source.rem ' ) not a valid Remora file ( type " fenestrate -- help " for help ) > fenestrate -- help fenestrate - convert Remora .rem files to Windows .wdw format Usage : fenestrate [ - i < infile > ] [ - o < outfile > ] [ - cstq ] [ - h | - v ] Options : - i < infile >
Specify input source [ default : STDIN ] -o < outfile >
Specify output destination [ default : STDOUT ] -c
Attempt to produce a more compact representation -h Use horizontal ( landscape ) layout -v Use vertical ( portrait ) layout -s Be strict regarding input -t Be extra tolerant regarding input -q Run silent -- version Print version information -- usage Print the usage line of this summary -- help Print this summary -- man Print the complete manpage
Here , every application that takes input and output files uses the same two flags to do so .
A user who wants to use the substrate utility ( to convert that final .wdw file to a subroutine ) is likely to be able to guess correctly the required syntax :
> substrate - i dest.wdw -o dest.sub
Anyone who ca n’t guess that probably can guess that :
> substrate -- help
is likely to render aid and comfort .
A large part of making interfaces consistent is being consistent in specifying the individual components of those interfaces .
Some conventions that may help to design consistent and predictable interfaces include :
Require a flag preceding every piece of command - line data , except filenames .
Users do n’t want to have to remember that your application requires “ input file , output file , block size , operation , fallback strategy , ” and requires them in that precise order : > lustrate sample_data proc_data 1000 normalize log
They want to be able to say explicitly what they mean , in any order that suits them : > lustrate sample_data proc_data - op=normalize - b1000 -- fallback=log
Provide a flag for each filename , too , especially when a program can be given files for different purposes .
Users might also not want to remember the order of the two positional filenames , so let them label those arguments as well , and specify them in whatever order they prefer : > lustrate - i sample_data - op normalize - b1000 -- fallback log -o proc_data
Use a single - prefix for short - form flags , up to three letters ( - v , - i , - rw , - in , - out ) .
Experienced users appreciate short - form flags as a way of reducing typing and limiting command - line clutter .
Do n’t make them type two dashes in these shortcuts .
Use a double -- prefix for longer flags ( -- verbose , -- interactive , -- readwrite , -- input , -- output ) .
Flags that are complete words improve the readability of a command line ( in a shell script , for example ) .
The double dash also helps to distinguish between the longer flag name and any nearby file names .
If a flag expects an associated value , allow an optional = between the flag and the value .
Some people prefer to visually associate a value with its preceding flag : > lustrate - i=sample_data - op=normalize - b=1000 --fallback=log -o=proc_data
Others do n’t : > lustrate - i sample_data - op normalize - b1000 -- fallback log -o proc_data
Still others want a bit each way : > lustrate - i sample_data -o proc_data - op=normalize - b=1000 --fallback=log
Let the user choose .
Allow single - letter options to be “ bundled ” after a single dash .
It ’s irritating to have to type repeated dashes for a series of flags : > lustrate - i sample_data -v -l -x Allow experienced users to also write : > lustrate - i sample_data -vlx
Provide a multi- letter version of every single - letter flag .
Short - form flags may be nice for experienced users , but they can be troublesome for new users : hard to remember and even harder to recognize .
Do n’t force people to do either .
Give them a verbose alternative to every concise flag ; full words that are easier to remember , and also more self - documenting in shell scripts .
Always allow - as a special filename .
A widely used convention is that a dash ( - ) where an input file is expected means “ read from standard input , ” and a dash where an output file is expected means “ write to standard output . ”
Always allow -- as a file list marker .
Another widely used convention is that the appearance of a double dash ( -- ) on the command line marks the end of any flagged options , and indicates that the remaining arguments are a list of filenames , even if some of them look like flags .
6. Agree Upon a Coherent Layout Style and Automate
It with perltidy
Formatting .
Indentation .
Style .
Code layout .
Whatever you choose to call it , it ’s one of the most contentious aspects of programming discipline .
More and bloodier wars have been fought over code layout than over just about any other aspect of coding .
What is the best practice here ?
Should you use classic Kernighan and Ritchie style ?
Or go with BSD code formatting ?
Or adopt the layout scheme specified by the GNU project ?
Or conform to the Slashcode coding guidelines ?
Of course not !
Everyone knows that < insert your personal coding style here > is the One True Layout Style , the only sane choice , as ordained by < insert your favorite Programming Deity here > since Time Immemorial !
Any other choice is manifestly absurd , willfully heretical , and self - evidently a Work of Darkness !
That ’s precisely the problem .
When deciding on a layout style , it ’s hard to decide where rational choices end and rationalized habits begin .
Adopting a coherently designed approach to code layout , and then applying that approach consistently across all your coding , is fundamental to best - practice programming .
Good layout can improve the readability of a program , help detect errors within it , and make the structure of your code much easier to comprehend .
Layout matters .
However , most coding styles –including the four mentioned earlier –confer those benefits almost equally well .
While it ’s true that having a consistent code layout scheme matters very much indeed , the particular code layout scheme you ultimately decide upon does not matter at all !
All that matters is that you adopt a single , coherent style ; one that works for your entire programming team , and , having agreed upon that style , that you then apply it consistently across all your development .
In the long term , it ’s best to train yourself and your team to code in a consistent , rational , and readable style .
However , the time and commitment necessary to accomplish that is n’t always available .
In such cases , a reasonable compromise is to prescribe a standard code - formatting tool that must be applied to all code before it ’s committed , reviewed , or otherwise displayed in public .
There is now an excellent code formatter available for Perl : perltidy .
It provides an extensive range of user - configurable options for indenting , block delimiter positioning , column - like alignment , and comment positioning .
Using perltidy , you can convert code like this :
if ( $ sigil eq ' $ ' ) { if ( $ subsigil eq '? ' ) {
$ sym_table{substr($var_name,2)}=delete $ sym_table{locate_orig_var( $var)} ; $ internal_count++;$has_internal{$var_name} ++ } else { $ {$var_ref} = q{$sym_table {$ var_name}} ; $ external_count + + ; $ has_external {$ var_name} ++ ; }} elsif ( $ sigil eq ' @ ' & & $ subsigil eq '? ' ) { @{$sym_table {$var_name}} = grep {defined $ _} @{$sym_table {$ var_name}} ; } elsif ( $ sigil eq ' % ' && $ subsigil eq '? ' ) { delete $ sym_table{$var_name}{$EMPTY_STR} ; } else { $ {$var_ref} = q{$sym_table{$var_name}} }
into something readable :
if ( $ sigil eq ' $ ' ) { if ( $ subsigil eq '? ' ) { $ sym_table { substr ( $ var_name , 2 ) } = delete $ sym_table { locate_orig_var ( $var ) } ; $ internal_count + + ; $ has_internal{$var_name} ++ ; } else { $ {$var_ref} = q{$sym_table {$ var_name}} ; $ external_count + + ; $ has_external{$var_name} ++ ; } } elsif ( $ sigil eq ' @ ' && $ subsigil eq '? ' ) { @{ $ sym_table {$ var_name} } = grep {defined $ _} @{ $ sym_table { $ var_name} } ; } elsif ( $ sigil eq ' % ' && $ subsigil eq '? ' ) { delete $ sym_table{$var_name}{$EMPTY_STR} ; } else { $ {$var_ref} = q{$sym_table {$var_name}} ; }
Mandating that everyone use a common tool to format their code can also be a simple way of sidestepping the endless objections , acrimony , and dogma that always surround any discussion on code layout .
If perltidy does all the work for them , then it will cost developers almost no effort to adopt the new guidelines .
They can simply set up an editor macro that will “ straighten ” their code whenever they need to .
A paragraph is a collection of statements that accomplish a single task : in literature , it ’s a series of sentences conveying a single idea ; in programming , a series of instructions implementing a single step of an algorithm .
Break each piece of code into sequences that achieve a single task , placing a single empty line between each sequence .
To further improve the maintainability of the code , place a one - line comment at the start of each such paragraph , describing what the sequence of statements does .
Like so :
# Process an array that has been recognized ... sub addarray_internal { my ( $ var_name , $ needs_quotemeta ) = @_ ; # Cache the original ... $ raw .= $ var_name ; # Build meta-quoting code , if requested ... my $ quotemeta = $ needs_quotemeta ?
q{map { quotemeta $ _} } : $ EMPTY_STR ; # Expand elements of variable , conjoin with ORs ... my $ perl5 pat = qq{ ( ??{join q{|} , $ quotemeta \@{$var_name}} ) } ; # Insert debugging code if requested ... my $ type = $ quotemeta ? ' literal ' : ' pattern ' ; debug_now ( " Adding $ var_name ( as $ type ) " ) ; add_debug_mesg ( " Trying $ var_name ( as $ type ) " ) ; return $ perl5 pat ; }
Paragraphs are useful because humans can focus on only a few pieces of information at once .
Paragraphs are one way of aggregating small amounts of related information , so that the resulting “ chunk ” can fit into a single slot of the reader ’s limited short - term memory .
Paragraphs enable the physical structure of a piece of writing to reflect and emphasize its logical structure .
Adding comments at the start of each paragraph further enhances the chunking by explicitly summarizing the purpose of each chunk ( note : the purpose , not the behavior ) .
Paragraph comments need to explain why the code is there and what it achieves , not merely paraphrase the precise computational steps it ’s performing .
Note , however , that the contents of paragraphs are only of secondary importance here .
It is the vertical gaps separating each paragraph that are critical .
Without them , the readability of the code declines dramatically , even if the comments are retained :
sub addarray_internal { my ( $ var_name , $ needs_quotemeta ) = @_ ; # Cache the original ... $ raw .= $ var_name ; # Build meta-quoting code , if required ... my $ quotemeta = $ needs_quotemeta ?
q{map { quotemeta $ _} } : $ EMPTY_STR ; # Expand elements of variable , conjoin with ORs ... my $ perl5 pat = qq{ ( ??{join q{|} , $ quotemeta \@{$var_name}} ) } ; # Insert debugging code if requested ... my $ type = $ quotemeta ? ' literal ' : ' pattern ' ; debug_now ( " Adding $ var_name ( as $ type ) " ) ; add_debug_mesg ( " Trying $ var_name ( as $ type ) " ) ; return $ perl5 pat ; }
8. Throw Exceptions Instead of Returning Special Values or Setting Flags
Returning a special error value on failure , or setting a special error flag , is a very common error - handling technique .
Collectively , they ’re the basis for virtually all error notification from Perl ’s own built - in functions .
For example , the built - ins eval , exec , flock , open , print , stat , and system all return special values on error .
Unfortunately , they do n’t all use the same special value .
Some of them also set a flag on failure .
Sadly , it ’s not always the same flag .
See the perlfunc manpage for the gory details .
Apart from the obvious consistency problems , error notification via flags and return values has another serious flaw : developers can silently ignore flags and return values , and ignoring them requires absolutely no effort on the part of the programmer .
In fact , in a void context , ignoring return values is Perl ’s default behavior .
Ignoring an error flag that has suddenly appeared in a special variable is just as easy : you simply do n’t bother to check the variable .
Moreover , because ignoring a return value is the void - context default , there ’s no syntactic marker for it .
There ’s no way to look at a program and immediately see where a return value is deliberately being ignored , which means there ’s also no way to be sure that it ’s not being ignored accidentally .
The bottom line : regardless of the programmer ’s ( lack of ) intention , an error indicator is being ignored .
That ’s not good programming .
Ignoring error indicators frequently causes programs to propagate errors in entirely the wrong direction .
For example :
# Find and open a file by name , returning the filehandle # or undef on failure ... sub locate_and_open { my ( $ filename ) = @_ ; # Check acceptable directories in order ... for my $ dir ( @DATA_DIRS ) { my $ path = " $ dir / $ filename " ; # If file exists in an acceptable directory , open and return it ... if ( - r $ path ) { open my $ fh , ' < ' , $ path ; return $ fh ; } } # Fail if all possible locations tried without success ... return ; } # Load file contents up to the first < DATA /> marker ... sub load_header_from { my ( $ fh ) = @_ ; # Use DATA tag as end - of - " line " ... local $ / = '< DATA />'; # Read to end - of - " line " ... return < $ fh > ; } # and later ... for my $ filename ( @source_files ) { my $ fh = locate_and_open ( $ filename ) ; my $ head = load_header_from ( $fh ) ; print $ head ; }
The locate_and_open ( ) subroutine simply assumes that the call to open works , immediately returning the filehandle ( $ fh ) , whatever the actual outcome of the open .
Presumably , the expectation is that whoever calls locate_and_open ( ) will check whether the return value is a valid filehandle .
Except , of course , “ whoever ” does n’t check .
Instead of testing for failure , the main for loop takes the failure value and immediately propagates it “ across ” the block , to the rest of the statements in the loop .
That causes the call to loader_header_from ( ) to propagate the error value “ downwards . ”
It ’s in that subroutine that the attempt to treat the failure value as a filehandle eventually kills the program :
readline ( ) on unopened filehandle at demo.pl line 28 .
Code like that –where an error is reported in an entirely different part of the program from where it actually occurred–is particularly onerous to debug .
Of course , you could argue that the fault lies squarely with whoever wrote the loop , for using locate_and_open ( ) without checking its return value .
In the narrowest sense , that ’s entirely correct–but the deeper fault lies with whoever actually wrote locate_and_open ( ) in the first place , or at least , whoever assumed that the caller would always check its return value .
Humans simply are n’t like that .
Rocks almost never fall out of the sky , so humans soon conclude that they never do , and stop looking up for them .
Fires rarely break out in their homes , so humans soon forget that they might , and stop testing their smoke detectors every month .
In the same way , programmers inevitably abbreviate “ almost never fails ” to “ never fails , ” and then simply stop checking .
That ’s why so very few people bother to verify their print statements :
if (! print ' Enter your name : ') { print {*STDLOG} warning => ' Terminal went missing ! ' }
It ’s human nature to “ trust but not verify . ”
Human nature is why returning an error indicator is not best practice .
Errors are ( supposed to be ) unusual occurrences , so error markers will almost never be returned .
Those tedious and ungainly checks for them will almost never do anything useful , so eventually they ’ll be quietly omitted .
After all , leaving the tests off almost always works just fine .
It ’s so much easier not to bother .
Especially when not bothering is the default !
Do n’t return special error values when something goes wrong ; throw an exception instead .
The great advantage of exceptions is that they reverse the usual default behaviors , bringing untrapped errors to immediate and urgent attention .
On the other hand , ignoring an exception requires a deliberate and conspicuous effort : you have to provide an explicit eval block to neutralize it .
The locate_and_open ( ) subroutine would be much cleaner and more robust if the errors within it threw exceptions :
# Find and open a file by name , returning the filehandle # or throwing an exception on failure ... sub locate_and_open { my ( $ filename ) = @_ ; # Check acceptable directories in order ... for my $ dir ( @DATA_DIRS ) { my $ path = " $ dir / $ filename " ; # If file exists in acceptable directory , open and return it ... if ( - r $ path ) { open my $ fh , ' < ' , $ path or croak ( " Located $ filename at $ path , but could not open " ) ; return $ fh ; } } # Fail if all possible locations tried without success ... croak (
" Could not locate $ filename " ) ; } # and later ... for my $ filename ( @source_files ) { my $ fh = locate_and_open ( $ filename ) ; my $ head = load_header_from ( $fh ) ; print $ head ; }
Notice that the main for loop did n’t change at all .
The developer using locate_and_open ( ) still assumes that nothing can go wrong .
Now there ’s some justification for that expectation , because if anything does go wrong , the thrown exception will automatically terminate the loop .
Exceptions are a better choice even if you are the careful type who religiously checks every return value for failure :
SOURCE_FILE : for my $ filename ( @source_files ) { my $ fh = locate_and_open ( $ filename ) ; next SOURCE_FILE if ! defined $ fh ; my $ head = load_header_from ( $fh ) ; next SOURCE_FILE if ! defined $ head ; print $ head ; }
Constantly checking return values for failure clutters your code with validation statements , often greatly decreasing its readability .
In contrast , exceptions allow an algorithm to be implemented without having to intersperse any error - handling infrastructure at all .
You can factor the error - handling out of the code and either relegate it to after the surrounding eval , or else dispense with it entirely :
for my $ filename ( @directory_path ) { #
Just ignore any source files that do n't load ... eval { my $ fh = locate_and_open ( $ filename ) ; my $ head = load_header_from ( $fh ) ; print $ head ; } }
9. Add New Test Cases Before you Start Debugging
The first step in any debugging process is to isolate the incorrect behavior of the system , by producing the shortest demonstration of it that you reasonably can .
If you ’re lucky , this may even have been done for you :
To : DCONWAY@cpan.org From : sascha@perlmonks.org
Subject : Bug in inflect module Zdravstvuite , I have been using your Lingua : : EN : : Inflect module to normalize terms in a data - mining application I am developing , but there seems to be a bug in it , as the following example demonstrates : use Lingua : : EN : : Inflect qw ( PL_N ) ; print PL_N ( ' man ' ) , "
" ; # Prints " men " , as expected print PL_N ( ' woman ' ) , "
" ; # Incorrectly prints " womans "
Once you have distilled a short working example of the bug , convert it to a series of tests , such as :
use Lingua:: EN :: Inflect qw ( PL_N ) ; use Test :: More qw ( no_plan ) ; is ( PL_N ( ' man ' ) , ' men ' , ' man -> men ' ) ; is ( PL_N ( ' woman ' ) , ' women ' , ' woman -> women ' ) ;
Do n’t try to fix the problem straight away , though .
Instead , immediately add those tests to your test suite .
If that testing has been well set up , that can often be as simple as adding a couple of entries to a table :
my % plural_of = ( ' mouse ' => ' mice ' , ' house ' => ' houses ' , ' ox ' => ' oxen ' , ' box ' => ' boxes ' , ' goose ' => ' geese ' , ' mongoose ' => ' mongooses ' , ' law ' => ' laws ' , ' mother - in-law ' => ' mothers - in-law ' , # Sascha 's bug , reported 27 August 2004 ... ' man ' => ' men ' , ' woman ' => ' women ' , ) ;
The point is : if the original test suite did n’t report this bug , then that test suite was broken .
It simply did n’t do its job ( finding bugs ) adequately .
Fix the test suite first by adding tests that cause it to fail :
> perl inflections.t ok 1 - house -> houses ok 2 - law -> laws ok 3 - man -> men ok 4 - mongoose -> mongooses ok 5 - goose -> geese ok 6 - ox -> oxen not ok 7 - woman -> women # Failed test ( inflections .t at line 20 ) # got : ' womans ' # expected : ' women ' ok 8 - mother - in - law -> mothers - in - law ok 9 - mouse -> mice ok 10 - box -> boxes 1..10 # Looks like you failed 1 tests of 10 .
Once the test suite is detecting the problem correctly , then you ’ll be able to tell when you ’ve correctly fixed the actual bug , because the tests will once again fall silent .
This approach to debugging is most effective when the test suite covers the full range of manifestations of the problem .
When adding test cases for a bug , do n’t just add a single test for the simplest case .
Make sure you include the obvious variations as well :
my % plural_of = ( ' mouse ' => ' mice ' , ' house ' => ' houses ' , ' ox ' => ' oxen ' , ' box ' => ' boxes ' , ' goose ' => ' geese ' , ' mongoose ' => ' mongooses ' , ' law ' => ' laws ' , ' mother - in-law ' => ' mothers - in-law ' , # Sascha 's bug , reported 27 August 2004 ... ' man ' => ' men ' , ' woman ' => ' women ' , ' human ' => ' humans ' , ' man-at- arms ' => ' men - at - arms ' , ' lan ' => ' lans ' , ' mane ' => ' manes ' , ' moan ' => ' moans ' , ) ;
The more thoroughly you test the bug , the more completely you will fix it .
10 . Do n’t Optimize Code–Benchmark It
If you need a function to remove duplicate elements of an array , it ’s natural to think that a “ one - liner ” like this :
sub uniq { return keys %{ { map { $_= > 1} @_ } } }
will be more efficient than two statements :
sub uniq { my % seen ; return grep {!$ seen {$_}++} @_ ; }
Unless you are deeply familiar with the internals of the Perl interpreter ( in which case you already have far more serious personal issues to deal with ) , intuitions about the relative performance of two constructs are exactly that : unconscious guesses .
The only way to know for sure which of two–or more–alternatives will perform better is to actually time each of them .
The standard Benchmark module makes that easy :
# A short list of not - quite - unique values ... our @data = qw ( do re me fa so la ti do ) ; # Various candidates ... sub unique_via_anon { return keys %{ { map { $_= > 1} @_ } } ; } sub unique_via_grep { my % seen ; return grep { !
$ seen {$ _}++ } @_ ; } sub unique_via_slice { my %uniq ; @uniq{@_} = ( ) ; return keys %uniq ; } # Compare the current set of data in @data sub compare { my ( $ title ) = @_ ; print "
[ $ title ]
" ; # Create a comparison table of the various timings , making sure that # each test runs at least 10 CPU seconds ... use Benchmark qw ( cmpthese ) ; cmpthese - 10 , { anon => ' my @uniq = unique_via_anon ( @data ) ' , grep => ' my @uniq = unique_via_grep ( @data ) ' , slice => ' my @uniq = unique_via_slice ( @data ) ' , } ; return ; } compare ( ' 8 items , 10 % repetition ' ) ; #
Two copies of the original data ... @data = ( @data ) x 2 ; compare ( ' 16 items , 56 % repetition ' ) ; #
One hundred copies of the original data ... @data = ( @data ) x 50 ; compare ( ' 800 items , 99 % repetition ' ) ;
The cmpthese ( ) subroutine takes a number , followed by a reference to a hash of tests .
The number specifies either the exact number of times to run each test ( if the number is positive ) , or the absolute number of CPU seconds to run the test for ( if the number is negative ) .
Typical values are around 10,000 repetitions or ten CPU seconds , but the module will warn you if the test is too short to produce an accurate benchmark .
The keys of the test hash are the names of your tests , and the corresponding values specify the code to be tested .
Those values can be either strings ( which are eval ’d to produce executable code ) or subroutine references ( which are called directly ) .
The benchmarking code shown above would print out something like the following :
[ 8 items , 10 % repetitions ]
Rate anon grep slice anon 28234/s -- - 24 % - 47 % grep 37294/s 32 % -- - 30 % slice 53013/s 88 % 42 % -- [ 16 items , 50 % repetitions ]
Rate anon grep slice anon 21283/s -- - 28 % - 51 % grep 29500/s 39 % -- - 32 % slice 43535/s 105 % 48 % -- [ 800 items , 99 % repetitions ]
Rate anon grep slice anon
536/s -- - 65 % - 89 % grep 1516 /s 183 % -- - 69 % slice 4855 / s 806 % 220 % --
Each of the tables printed has a separate row for each named test .
The first column lists the absolute speed of each candidate in repetitions per second , while the remaining columns allow you to compare the relative performance of any two tests .
For example , in the final test tracing across the grep row to the anon column reveals that the grep ped solution was 1.83 times ( 183 percent ) faster than using an anonymous hash .
Tracing further across the same row also indicates that grep ping was 69 percent slower ( - 69 percent faster ) than slicing .
Overall , the indication from the three tests is that the slicing - based solution is consistently the fastest for this particular set of data on this particular machine .
It also appears that as the data set increases in size , slicing also scales much better than either of the other two approaches .
However , those two conclusions are effectively drawn from only three data points ( namely , the three benchmarking runs ) .
To get a more definitive comparison of the three methods , you ’d also need to test other possibilities , such as a long list of non-repeating items , or a short list with nothing but repetitions .
Better still , test on the real data that you ’ll actually be “ unique-ing . ”
For example , if that data is a sorted list of a quarter of a million words , with only minimal repetitions , and which has to remain sorted , then test exactly that :
our @data = slurp '/usr/share/biglongwordlist.txt ' ; use Benchmark qw ( cmpthese ) ; cmpthese 10 , { # Note : the non-grepped solutions need a post- uniqification re-sort anon => ' my @uniq = sort ( unique_via_anon ( @data ) ) ' , grep => ' my @uniq = unique_via_grep ( @data ) ' , slice => ' my @uniq = sort ( unique_via_slice ( @data ) ) ' , } ;
Not surprisingly , this benchmark indicates that the grep ped solution is markedly superior on a large sorted data set :
s /iter anon slice grep anon 4.28 -- - 3 % - 46 % slice 4.15 3 % -- - 44 % grep 2.30 86 % 80 % --
Perhaps more interestingly , the grep ped solution still benchmarks as being marginally faster when the two hash - based approaches are n’t re-sorted .
This suggests that the better scalability of the sliced solution as seen in the earlier benchmark is a localized phenomenon , and is eventually undermined by the growing costs of allocation , hashing , and bucket - overflows as the sliced hash grows very large .
Above all , that last example demonstrates that benchmarks only benchmark the cases you actually benchmark , and that you can only draw useful conclusions about performance from benchmarking real data .

最近 Boxxet の創業者 の
You Mon Tsang が、僕のボキャブラリーに 「 バイオニック・ソフトウェア（bionic software ） 」 という新しいミームを吹き込んでくれた。You Mon の定義によれば、 「 生物工学（bionics ）とは、生物原理の工学システムの設計への応用を目的とした生物システムの研究である」。ただ彼が一月前ぐらいに話してくれたとき、彼はもっとなじみやすい定義を用いていた。負傷してテクノロジーにより高速、強力、有能になって再生した宇宙飛行士をフィーチャーした70年代のテレビ番組『600万ドルの男』を引き合いに出したのだ。このイメージをあてはめれば、バイオニック・システムとは、生物システムと機械システムを組み合わせて、どちらか片方だけよりも強力な拡張システムを作り上げるものと言える。
この「生物機能を機械的に強化する（bionic）」ところが、最も成功しているウェブアプリケーションの多くに欠かせないと思う。さかのぼること2003年、私は講演でケンペレンのチェス人形（Mechanical
Turk）を引き合いに出すようになったが、これはウェブアプリケーションと
PC 時代のアプリケーションの違いの一つに、ウェブアプリケーションは実際に利用者をその内部に引き込み、そのアプリの一部として毎日働かせていることがあるのを強調するためである。Google でクロールし、スパムをフィルタし、アルゴリズムをチューニングするプログラマがいなければ、アプリケーションは止まってしまう。新しいサイトに絶えずリンクすることでスパイダーに食わせるユーザがいなくては、クローラは何も新しい情報を得られない。ユーザが深いところでアプリケーションの一部なのである。これがブレイクスルーをもたらすウェブアプリケーションのほぼすべてにおいて、何らかの形であてはまる。
私はこの理念を参加のアーキテクチャ（訳注：日本語訳）と名づけ、Web 2.0 の鍵となる原則の一つとして一般化したが、これはインターネットアプリケーションを設計する際に最も重要な原則の一つは、利用されるほどその力を増すようシステムを設計することであるという理念である。しかし、「バイオニック・システム」という言葉は、このコンセプトにもう一捻り加えてくれる。
You Mon と話をして分かったのは、人間とコンピュータの活動を組み合わせ、どちらか一方が単独で可能なよりも優れた結果を導き出すシステムが広まりつつあり、またそれが明らかになりつつある。Flickr を例にすると 、Flickr はウェブデザインのパレットにタグクラウドを導入した。タグクラウドは、ユーザの活動によりダイナミックに作り上げられる強力なユーザインタフェース要素である。あるいは、digg.com
が積極的にユーザを利用してどのストーリーがフロントページに並ぶか決定しているやり方を考えてみよう（うん、Slashdot が digg のずっと前からこれをやっているのは僕も分かっているけど、digg の場合、この機能がサイトの核心なので） 。
バイオニック・システムが広まり、技術的なバリエーションが洗練されることにより、我々は今まさに真に重要なトレンドの始まりを目の当たりにしているように思える。You

Boxxet は、どんな話題であれそれに関するアテンションを情報集約をしようと思う digg ライクなサイトを効率的に作り、はじめウェブスパイダーにより集められるコンテンツをユーザにモデレートさせるものである（このサイトはまだベータ版でプライベート状態だが、数週間のうちに公開されるはずである。You Mon は今週の水曜日に ETech でプレゼンを行う予定）。例えば Google Alert が、Google の力を利用してフォローしたいどんな話題でも情報を追いかけられるようにするのに対し、Boxxet は気になる話題をフォローするパブリックで共有されるスペースを作成できるようにし、その読者の意見を自動的に生成する結果を向上するのに利用するわけだ。
Amazon の Mechanical
Turk アプリケーションとなると人間と機械の結びつきはより明確だ。Amazon の Mechanical Turk は、人間とコンピュータの処理を組み合わせるためのマーケットプレイスである（確かめたわけではないが、2003年5月に私が
Amazon の従業員が全員参加した会議で行った講演で、ウェブアプリケーションのメタファーとしてチェス人形のコンセプトをフィーチャーしたことが、Amazon のサービスのインスピレーションになったのではないか）。
数週間前に Woodside Fund の Tom Shields にバイオニック・ソフトウェアの話をし、我々は人間をアプリケーションの構成要素として利用することでより知的なシステムを構築しつつあり、昔人口知能に託していた夢がこの新しいモデルにとってかわられつつあるという私の考えを説明した。Tom はそのパラダイムシフトを 、 「 AI が IA になる（人工知 能 （Artificial Intelligence）が知性の拡大 （Intelligence Augmentation）になる」と上手にまとめてくれた。
これがミームの力である。世界を新しい目で見る助けとなるコンセプトを作りつつあるのだ。我々は次世代のバイオニック・システムを作り上げようとしているわけだが、それはいたるところで目にしている。私はその考えが好きだ。人間とコンピュータが一つとなって、いずれか単独の場合を越える能力を生み出すなんて、他の分野にあるかい？
追伸：読者でサイエンス・フィクション好きな方向けだが、Sean McMullen の著作 『Souls in the Great Machine』にこのコンセプトに関する優れた解釈がある。

NORFOLK ( AP ) —
A jury recommended yesterday that a Navy chaplain receive a letter of reprimand for disobeying an order by appearing in uniform at a political press conference at the White House .
The jury also recommended that Lt. Gordon Klingenschmitt forfeit $ 250 pay per month for a year but suggested that the monetary punishment be suspended .
Rear Adm. Frederic Ruhe , commander of the Navy ’s Mid-Atlantic Region , must decide whether to approve the recommendation .
The jury of five officers at Lt. Klingenschmitt ’s special court - martial determined Wednesday that he had disobeyed a superior officer ’s order prohibiting him from wearing his uniform during media appearances without prior permission .
Lt. Klingenschmitt said he believes he was punished for making a political speech in uniform because he prayed in Jesus ’ name .
He had argued that he was allowed to wear his uniform if conducting a “ bona fide worship service . ”
“ I will continue to pray in Jesus ’ name , I will continue to worship in public and I will not be broken , ” he said Wednesday .
Reprimands often end an officer ’s career because they are a permanent part of the service record and prevent promotion to the next grade .
Lt. Klingenschmitt said he would appeal the conviction and fight to remain a chaplain .
He said senior naval officials already had decided to fire him before the March 30 event , which protested Navy policy requiring nondenominational prayers outside of religious services .
Last December , the chaplain went on an 18 - day hunger strike in front of the White House over the right to invoke Jesus ’ name outside such services .

Introduction : lists galore
I learned programming backwards , plunging right on into C and , shortly after , C++ and Java from the very beginning .
I was knee deep in complex data structures , pointers and abstruse template syntax in no time .
And the more complex it all felt , the more i thought i was learning .
Of course , i was clueless .
Reading SICP and learning about functional programming changed it all .
There were many occasions for revelation and awe , but one of my most vivid recollections of that time is my gradual discovery of the power of simplicity .
At about half way into SICP i realised in wonder that that beautiful and powerful world was apparently being constructed out of extremely simple pieces .
Basically , everything was a list .
Of course there were other important ingredients , like procedures as first - class objects , but the humble list was about the only data structure to be seen .
After mulling on it for a little bit , i saw where lists draw their power from : recursion .
As you know , lists are data types recursively defined : a list is either the empty list or an element ( its head ) followed by another list ( its tail ) :
list = [ ]
list = a : list
where i’m borrowing Haskell ’s notation for the empty list ( [ ] ) and the list constructor ( : ) , also known by lispers as ( ) and cons .
So that was the trick , i thought : lists have recursion built - in , so to speak , and once you ’ve read a little bit about functional programming you do n’t need to be sold on the power and beauty of recursive programs .
It is often the case that powerful and beautiful yet simple constructs have a solid mathematical foundation , and only when you grasp it do you really realize how powerful , beautiful and amazingly simple that innocent - looking construct is .
Lists , and recursive operations on them , are an excellent case in point .
But the path connecting them to their mathematical underpinnings is a long and winding one , which lays in the realm of Category Theory .
I first became acquainted of the relationship between categories and recursive programming reading Functional Programming with Bananas , Lenses , Envelopes and Barbed Wire , by Erik Meijer , Maarten Fokkinga and Ross Paterson .
Albeit very enjoyable , this paper presupposes a high degree of mathematical sophistication on the reader ’s side .
I will try in this article to give you a simplified overview of the concepts involved , including Category Theory , its application to programming languages and what funny names like catamorphism , anamorphism or lambda - lifting have to do with your everyday list manipulations .
Of course , i’ll be only scratching the surface : interspersed links and the Further reading section provide pointers to more in - depth explorations of this wonderland .
Categorical interlude
Categories are ( relatively ) simple constructs .
A category consists of a set O of objects , and a set A of arrows between elements of O. Arrows are composable : if there ’s an arrow from a to b , and another one from b to c , there must be an arrow from a to c ( where a , b and c are elements of O ) .
Besides , they are associative : if you have arrows from a to b , b to c , and c to d , you can go from a to d via two different paths , namely , first from a to c and then from c to d , or first from a to b and then from b to d .
Finally , for each element a in O there ’s an identity arrow which goes from a to itself ( called an identity ) , such that following this arrow changes nothing .
These properties are better visualized with a diagram ( or a bit of mathematical notation ) , as shown in the image on the right .
A category captures a mathematical world of objects and their relationships .
The canonical example of a category is Set , which contains , as objects , ( finite ) sets and , as arrows , ( total ) functions between them .
But categories go far beyond modeling sets .
For instance , one can define a category whose objects are natural numbers , and the ‘ arrows ’ are provided by the relation “ less or equal ” ( that is , we say that there is an arrow joining two numbers a and b if a is less or equal than b ) .
What we are trying to do with such a definition is to somehow capture the essence of ordered sets : not only integers are ordered but also dates , lemmings on a row , a rock ’s trajectory or the types of the Smalltalk class hierarchy .
In order to abstract what all those categories have in common we need a way to go from one category to another preserving the shared structure in the process .
We need what the mathematicians call an isomorphism , which is the technically precise manner of stating that two systems are , in a deep sense , analogous ; this searching for commonality amounts to looking for concepts or abstractions , which is what mathematics and ( good ) programming is all about ( and , arguably , intelligence itself , if you are to believe , for instance , Douglas Hofstadter ‘s ideas ) .
To boot , our definition of a category already contains the concept of isomorphic objects .
Think of an arrow from a to b as an operation that transforms a in b .
An arrow from b to a will make the inverse transformation .
If composing both transformations gives you the identity , you are back to the very same object a , and we say that a and b are isomorphic : you can transform one into the other and back at will .
In a deep sense , this concept captures a generic way of expressing equality that pervades all maths : if you ’re not afraid of a little bit of maths , Barry Mazur ‘s essay
When is a thing equal to some other thing ?
is an excellent introduction to Category Theory with an emphasis in the concept of equality .
Among many other things , you will learn how the familiar natural numbers can be understood as a category , or how an object is completely defined by the set of its transformations ( and , therefore , how to actually get rid of objects and talk only of transformations ; i know this is stretching and mixing metaphors ( if not plain silly ) , but this stress in arrows , as opposed to objects , reminded me of Alan Kay ’s insistence on focusing on messages rather than objects ) .
Another introductory article with emphasis on categories as a means to capture sameness is R. Brown and T. Porter ’s Category Theory : an abstract setting for analogy and comparison .
Not only objects inside a category can be transformed into each other .
We reveal the common structure of two disjoint categories by means of a functor mapping across two categories .
A functor consists of two functions : one that maps each object of the first category to an object in the second , and another one putting in correspondence arrows in one category with arrows in the second .
Besides , these functions must preserve arrow composition .
Let me spell this mathematically .
Consider to categories , C and C ’ with object sets O and O ’ and arrow sets A and A ’ .
A functor F mapping C to C ’ will consist then of two functions ( Fo , Fa ) ; the first one taking elements of O to elements of O ’ :
Fo : O -> O ’
Fo(a ) in O ’ for every a in O
and the second one taking arrows from A to arrows in A ’ :
Fa : A -> A ’
Fa(f ) in A ’ for every f in A
and such that , if f is an arrow from a to b in C , Fa(f ) is an arrow from Fo(a ) to Fo(b ) in C ’.
Moreover , we want that following arrows in C is ‘ analogous ’ to following them in C’ , i.e. , we demand that
Fa(fg ) = Fa(f ) Fa(g )
In the left hand side above , we are composing two arrows in C and then going to C’ , while in the right hand side we first take each arrow to C’ and , afterwards , compose them in there .
If C and C ’ have the same structure , these two operations must be equivalent .
Finally , F must preserve identities : if i is the identity arrow for an element a in O , Fa( i ) must be the identity arrow for Fo(a ) in O ’ .
The diagram on the left shows a partial graph ( i’m not drawing the identity arrows and their mappings ) of a simple functor between two categories , and ways of going from an object a in the first category to an object x in the second one which are equivalent thanks to the functor ’s properties .
As you can see in this simple example , the functor gives us the ability of seeing the first category as a part of the second one .
You get a category isomorphism in the same way as between objects , i.e. , by demanding the existence of a second functor from C ’ to C ( you can convince yourself that such a functor does not exist in our example , and , therefore , that the two categories in the diagram are not isomorphic ) .
You have probably guessed by now one nifty property of functors : they let us going meta and define a category whose objects are categories and whose arrows are functors .
Actually , Eilenberg and MacLane ‘s seminal paper General theory of natural transformations used functors and categories of categories to introduce for the first time categories ( natural transformations are structure - preserving maps between functors : this Wikipedia article gives an excellent overview on them ) .
But enough maths for now : it is high time to show you how this rather abstract concepts find their place in our main interest , programming languages .
Categories and programming languages
About the only similarity between C and Haskell programming is that one spends a lot of time typing ASCII arrows .
But of course , Haskell ’s are much more interesting : you use them to declare the type of a function , as in
floor : : Real ->
Int
The above stanza declares a function that takes an argument of type real and returns an integer .
In general , a function taking a single argument is declared in Haskell following the pattern
fun : : a -> b
where a and b are types .
Does this ring a bell ?
Sure it does : if we identify Haskell ’s arrows with categorical ones , the language types could be the objects of a category .
As we have seen , we need identities
id : : a -> a
id x = x
and arrow composition , which in Haskell is denoted by a dot
f : : b -> c
g:: a -> b
fg : : a -> b -> c
fg = f . g
Besides , associativity of arrow composition is ensured by Haskell ’s referential transparency ( no side - effects : if you preserve referential transparency by writing side - effect free functions , it wo n’t matter the order in which you call them ) : we ’ve got our category .
Of course , you do n’t need Haskell , or a statically typed language for that matter : any strongly typed programming language can be modelled as a category , using as objects its types and as arrows its functions of arity one .
It just happens that Haskell ’s syntax is particularly convenient , but one can define function composition easily in any decent language ; for instance in Scheme one would have
( define ( compose f g ) ( lambda ( x ) ( f ( g x ) ) )
Functions with more than one arguments can be taken into the picture by means of currying : instead of writing a function of , say , 2 arguments :
( define ( add x y ) (+ x y ) )
( add 3 4 )
you define a function which takes one argument ( x ) and returns a function which , in turn , takes one argument ( y ) and returns the final result :
( define ( add x ) ( lambda ( y ) (+ x y ) ) )
( ( add 3 ) 4 )
Again , Haskell offers a pretty convenient syntax .
In Haskell , you can define add as :
add x y = x + y
which gets assigned , when applied to integers , the following type :
add : : Int -> ( Int -> Int )
that is , add is not a function from pairs of integers to integers , but a function that takes an integer and returns a function of type Int ->
Int .
Finally , we can also deal with functions taking no arguments and constant values by introducing a special type , called unit or 1 ( or void in C- ish ) , which has a unique value ( spelled ( ) in Haskell ) .
Constants of our language ( as , e.g. , True or 43.23 ) are then represented by arrows from 1 to the constant ’s type ; for instance , True is an 1 -> Boolean arrow .
The unit type is an example of what in category theory is known as a terminal object .
Now that we have successfully modelled our ( functional ) programming language as a category ( call it C ) , we can use the tools of the theory to explore and reason about the language constructs and properties .
For instance , functors will let me recover the original motivation of this post and explore lists and functions on them from the point of view of category theory .
If our language provides the ability to create lists , its category will contain objects ( types ) of the ‘ list of ’ kind ; e.g. [ Int ] for lists of integers , [ Boolean ] for lists of Booleans and so on .
In fact , we can construct a new sub - category CL by considering list types as its objects and functions taking and returning lists as its arrows .
For each type a we have a way of constructing a type , [ a ] in the sub- category , i.e. , we have a map from objects in C to objects in CL .
That ’s already half a functor : to complete it we need a map from functions in C to functions in CL .
In other words , we need a way to transform a function acting on values of a given type to a function acting on lists of values of the same type .
Using the notation of the previous section :
Fo(a ) = [ a ]
Fa(f : a -> b ) = f ' : [ a ] -> [ b ]
Fa is better known as map in most programming languages .
We call the process of going from f to f ' lifting ( not to be confused with a related , but not identical , process known as lambda lifting ) , and it ’s usually pretty easy to write an operator that lifts a function to a new one in CL : for instance in Scheme we would write :
( define ( lift f ) ( lambda ( lst ) ( map f lst ) ) )
and for lift to truly define a functor we need that it behaves well respect to function composition :
( lift ( compose f g ) ) = ( compose ( lift f ) ( lift g ) )
We can convince ourselves that this property actually holds by means of a simple example .
Consider the function next which takes an integer to its successor ; its lifting ( lift next ) will map a list of integers to a list of their successors .
We can also define prev and ( lift prev ) mapping ( lists of ) integers to ( lists of ) their predecessors .
( compose next prev ) is just the identity , and , therefore , ( lift ( compose next prev ) ) is the identity too ( with lifted signature ) .
But we obtain the same function if we compose ( lift next ) and ( lift prev ) in CL , right ?
As before , there ’s nothing specific to Scheme in this discussion .
Haskell even has a Functor type class capturing these ideas .
The class defines a generic lift operation , called fmap that , actually , generalizes our list lifting to arbitrary type constructors :
fmap :: ( a -> b ) -> ( f a -> f b )
where f a is the new type constructed from a .
In our previous discussion , f a = [ a ] , but if your language gives you a way of constructing , say , tuples , you can lift functions on given types to functions on tuples of those types , and repeat the process with any other type constructor at your disposal .
The only condition to name it a functor , is that identities are mapped to identities and composition is preserved :
fmap id = id
fmap ( p . q ) = ( fmap p ) . ( fmap q )
I wo n’t cover usage of type constructors ( and their associated functors ) other than lists , but just mention a couple of them : monads , another paradigmatic one beautifully ( and categorically ) discussed by Stefan Klinger in his Programmer ’s Guide to the IO Monad – Do n’t Panic ( also discussed at LtU ) , and the creation of a dance and music library , for those of you looking for practical applications .
To be continued …
Returning to lists , what the lifting and categorical description above buys us is a way to formalize our intuitions about list operations , and to transfer procedures and patterns on simple types to lists .
In SICP ’s section on Sequences as conventional interfaces , you will find a hands - on , non-mathematical dissection of the basic building blocks into which any list operation can be decomposed : enumerations , accumulators , filters and maps .
Our next step , following the bananas article i mentioned at the beginning , will be to use the language of category theory to provide a similar decomposition , but this time we will talk about catamorphisms , anamorphisms and similarly funny named mathematical beasts .
What the new approach will buy us is the ability to generalize our findings beyond the list domain and onto the so - called algebraic types .
But this will be the theme of a forthcoming post .
Stay tunned .
Further reading
The best introductory text on Category Theory i’ve read is Conceptual Mathematics : A First Introduction to Categories by F. William Lawvere ( one of the fathers of Category Theory ) and Stephen Hoel Schanuel .
It assumes no sophisticated mathematical background , yet it covers lots of ground .
If you feel at home with maths , the best option is to learn from the horse ’s mouth and get a copy of Categories for the Working Mathematician , by Mac Lane .
The books above do not deal with applications to Computer Science , though .
For that , the canonical reference is Benjamin Pierce ’s Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists , but i find it too short and boring : a far better choice is , in my opinion , Barr and Well ’s Category Theory and Computer Science .
A reduced version of Barr and Well ’s book is available online in the site for their course Introduction to Category Theory .
They are also the authors of the freely available Toposes , Triples and Theories , which will teach you everything about monads , and then more .
Marteen Fokkinga is the author of this 80 - pages Gentle Introduction to Category Theory , with a stress on the calculational and algorithmical aspects of the theory .
Unless you have a good mathematical background , you should probably take gentle with a bit of salt .
Let me close by mentioning a couple of fun applications of Category Theory , for those of you that know a bit about it .
Haskell programmers will like this implementation of fold and unfold ( as a literate program ) using F - ( co ) algebras and applied to automata creation , while those of you with a soft spot for Physics may be interested in John Baez ’s musings on Quantum Mechanics and Categories .

Tracking snowclones is hard .
Let 's go shopping !
Michael Kaplan recently offered up a snowclone in need of investigation :
X is hard .
Let 's go shopping !
He was unsure of its origin , but a commenter on his blog wrote :
" Math is hard , let 's go shopping " came from a talking Barbie doll .
Mattel got a lot of heat for that one ( people believed it made the science and math gap between males and females worse ) .
Later models of the Barbie had the phrase deleted .
Well , it 's a bit more complicated than that .
Since talking dolls seem to lend themselves to the embellishments of urban folklore , I thought I 'd track down the origins of this putative Barbie-ism .
It all started in 1992 , when Mattel Inc. rolled out Teen Talk Barbie , the first talking Barbie doll in two decades .
Each Teen Talk Barbie could say four phrases , selected from a total pool of 270 randomly programmed sayings .
The doll was unveiled at the American International Toy Fair in February of ' 92 with great fanfare .
The Washington Post reported on the unveiling with barely concealed sarcasm :
So here we are - a curtain rises , a stage appears and it's TEEN TALK BARBIE !
" You look great ! " Barbie says .
" Want to go shopping ?
Okay , meet me at the mall . "
A thin , leggy blond woman ( one of scores of such creatures brought in for the fair ) introduces the chatty new doll and all her new clothing .
The woman , with her hair and enthusiasm , is Barbie .
She is holding a Barbie .
The two Barbies are having a conversation , except the doll is doing most of the talking .
" Let 's have a campfire ! " says the doll .
" We could take a Hawaiian vacation !
Would n't you love to be a lifeguard ? "
The doll began to be sold to the general public in July , and on Sep. 25 the Wall Street Journal broke the news of some serious objections about one of Teen Talk Barbie 's utterances :
Barbie is a troublemaker .
The latest incarnation of the popular doll is posing a bit of a marketing problem for maker Mattel .
Specifically , the Teen Talk Barbie Doll quips ( among other remarks ) that " Math class is tough . "
That has angered some women educators , who say they are already fighting to sustain schoolgirls ' interest in math and science .
" If Barbie gives the message that math is tough , Barbie could be turning off girls to math and science , and that 's a mistake , " says Anne Bryant , executive director of the American Association of University Women , a research group that issued a report this year titled , " How Schools Shortchange Girls . "
The report found that , although girls and boys both do well in math prior to sixth grade , boys are more likely to score better and take higher - level courses after that time .
Judy Blitch , chairwoman of the education department at Wesleyan College for women in Macon , Ga. , says she and a dozen students called Mattel 's 800 number to protest .
" We were concerned , " says Prof .
Blitch , who bought the doll for her five - year - old daughter .
" We need to do whatever we can to encourage girls in that area .
Barbie represents an important part of girls ' lives and can influence thinking . "
But Mattel mailed Prof .
Blitch a reply that did n't address the issue .
It does n't plan to change the doll , which sells for about $ 25 and says four phrases .
There are 270 sayings randomly programmed into different dolls , such as " Let 's have a beach party " and " Do n't be late for school . "
Says a spokeswoman : " I do n't think math was chosen because it 's more or less difficult .
You can also get a doll that says , ' I 'm studying to be a doctor . ' "
Once the story was picked up by news outlets nationwide , however , Mattel soon caved in to public pressure .
As the New York Times reported on Oct. 21 , Mattel decided to alter the computer chip in Teen Talk Barbie to remove " Math class is tough " from the programmed selection of sayings .
So Barbie did talk vacuously about the difficulty of math ( " Math class is tough " ) and the fun of shopping ( " Want to go shopping ?
Okay , meet me at the mall " ) , but she never put the two sentiments together in one utterance .
( I do n't know if she ever said the exact words " Let 's go shopping , " either .
More likely that was a confusion with another toy marketed to girls in the early '90s : the Pressman Toy Corporation 's board game , " Let 's Go Shopping . " )
That might have been the end of things , but around Christmastime of 1993 came word of a shadowy organization known as the Barbie Liberation Organization , dedicated to switching computer chips between Teen Talk Barbie and her gender - stereotype opposite , Talking Duke G.I. Joe .
( More about the BLO here , though the page inaccurately dates its founding to 1989 . )
The New York Times detailed the BLO 's activities in a Dec. 31 , 1993 article :
Your son tears the wrapping paper off his fierce new " Talking Duke " G. I .
Joe doll and eagerly presses the talk button .
Out comes a painfully chirpy voice that sounds astonishingly like Barbie 's saying , " Let 's go shopping ! "
Does your son :
A ) Furiously vaporize the doll with his own phaser rifle ?
B ) Go shopping with Joe ?
C ) Say : " Mom , I suspect we 're the lucky victims of an elaborate nationwide publicity stunt designed to ridicule sexual stereotyping in children 's toys .
This barbaric little action figure you gave me may turn out to be a valuable collector 's item . "
If the answer is C , your son may be a collector 's item himself , for he has correctly divined the latest socially conscious news media prank to hit the nation 's toy stores .
For the last several months , a group of performance artists based in the East Village of Manhattan has been buying Talking Dukes and " Teen Talk " Barbies , which cost $ 40 to $ 50 each , painstakingly swapping their voice boxes and then , with the aid of cohorts , replacing dolls on the shelves of toy stores in at least two states .
The group , which asserts it has surgically altered 300 dolls , says its aim is to startle the public into thinking about the Stone Age - world view that the dolls reflect .
The result is a mutant colony of Barbies - on - steroids who roar things like " Attack ! " " Vengeance is mine ! " and " Eat lead , Cobra ! "
The emasculated G. I . Joe 's , meanwhile , twitter , " Will we ever have enough clothes ? " and " Let 's plan our dream wedding ! "
Publicity for the BLO 's campaign of doll terror thrust Teen Talk Barbie back into the news and also resurrected the " Math class is tough " controversy from the previous year .
Further proof that Teen Talk Barbie 's inanities had struck a chord in the pop-culture consciousness came when The Simpsons aired an episode on Feb. 17 , 1994 titled " Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy . "
In the episode eight - year - old Lisa launches a campaign against Barbie - esque Malibu Stacy when a talking version of the doll is released .
Here are some of the things Malibu Stacy says ( thanks to The Simpsons Archive ) :
I wish they taught shopping in school .
Let 's bake some cookies for the boys !
Do n't ask me ; I 'm just a girl < giggle > < giggle > .
Now let 's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream .
Thinking too much gives you wrinkles .
My name is Stacy , but you can call me < two - note wolf whistle > .
A few months later , the canonical form of the pseudo - Barbie - ism " Math is hard , let 's go shopping " finally showed up in Usenet discussion , when Nick Fitch used it on May 27 , 1994 in the gay and lesbian newsgroup soc.motss .
But it took another couple of years for the expression to be snowcloned by Usenetters .
The earliest example I 've found is in a Jan. 30 , 1996 post on alt.college.college- bowl
( " College Bowl is hard ... let 's go shopping ! " ) .
On Apr. 25 of that year , one contributor to soc.women.lesbian - and - bi who was stuck on a particular bit of phrasing made the tongue - and - cheek comment , " Language is hard .
Let 's go shopping . "
( Another contributor responded , " Shopping is hard .
Let 's go water skiing . " )
But 1997 was when the snowclone started to achieve popularity on Usenet , particularly on soc.motss where it became an in - joke for some of the regulars ( among the items placed in the snowclone slot that year were " lit crit , " " sociology and metaphysics , " " situational ethics , " and " sacrifice " ) .
It would n't take long for the snowclone to move beyond newsgroups like soc.motss and into wider online usage .
Nowadays just about anything can fill the slot of " math , " from property to navigation to democracy to development theory to the programming language LISP .
Michael Kaplan 's post that set off this investigation stuck address formats in the slot .
And the fact that Kaplan used it without being quite sure of its origins suggests that the snowclone has moved into a new phase , where the template can spread without being considered a direct allusion to something .
Rather , use of the snowclone can now simply allude to other instances of the snowclone .
How very meta .
[ Update , 3/11/06 : Barbie 's thoughts on math and shopping also cropped up in a mid-'90s video game .

Pakistani president Musharraf allegedly said today that Omar Sheikh was an MI6 ( British intelligence services ) agent .
The article covering Musharraf 's statement says " At some point , he probably became a rogue or double agent . "
This is interesting , because Mr. Sheikh is claimed to be one of the masterminds , trainers and / or funders of 9/11 .
Did Mr. Sheikh in fact become a rogue or double agent ?
Or was he still working for MI6 when he played his role in the 9/11 attacks ?
Most “ economists ” are n’t
I ’ve always thought that an economist is someone who understands opportunity cost .
If there is one thing a first - year undergraduate economics course should teach , it ’s an understanding of this concept .
So it ’s alarming to discover that most members of a sample drawn from participants in the profession ’s most important conference are not , at least by my definition , economists .
Via Harry Clarke , I found this paper by Paul Ferraro and Laura Taylor ( guest registration or subscription required ) .
Ferraro and Taylor presented their volunteer subjects with this question :
Please circle the best answer to the following question : ‘ You won a free ticket to see an Eric Clapton concert ( which has no resale value ) .
Bob Dylan is performing on the same night and is your next - best alternative .
Tickets to see Dylan cost $ 40 .
On any given day , you would be willing to pay up to $ 50 to see Dylan .
Assume there are no other costs of seeing either performer .
Based on this information , what is the opportunity cost of seeing Eric Clapton ? ( a ) $ 0
( b ) $ 10
( c ) $ 40
( d ) $ 50 .
Take some time to think before looking over the fold
The correct answer is ( b ) , the net value to you of buying a ticket and attending the Dylan concert , which is your next best alternative .
This is n’t the easiest of opportunity cost questions , and , in a first - year undergraduate exam , it would distinguish those who ’d really learned the concept from those who ’d memorised the definition .
Still it ’s not that difficult , and does n’t involve any tricky thinking about information as in ( say ) the Monty Hall problem ( it ’s adapted from the intro textbook of Frank and Bernanke ) .
Allowing for the fact that some people can get jobs in economics with a good technical training but no real understanding of economics [ 1 ] , I ’d have expected maybe 70 per cent of grad students or PhD qualified economists to get it right .
In the Ferraro and Taylor study , the proportion choosing ( b ) was 21.6 per cent , the least of any answer and worse than if everyone had picked at random .
Since presumably some people did choose at random , this suggests that less than 20 per cent of “ economists ” are actually economists , at least by my definition .
fn1 . I blame game theory myself , but then I always blame game theory .
And opportunity cost reasoning is just as essential to game theory as to economics , even if its role is not so explicit .
WW - II Trophy tank
14 September 2000 , a Komatsu D375A - 2 pulled an abandoned tank from its archival tomb under the bottom of a lake near Johvi , Estonia .
The Soviet - built T34/76A tank had been resting at the bottom of the lake for 56 years .
According to its specifications , it ’s a 27 - tonne machine with a top speed of 53 km / h .
From February to September 1944 , heavy battles were fought in the narrow , 50 km - wide , Narva front in the northeastern part of Estonia .
Over 100,000 men were killed and 300,000 men were wounded there .
During battles in the summer of 1944 , the tank was captured from the Soviet army and used by the German army .
( This is the reason that there are German markings painted on the tank ’s exterior . )
On 19 September 1944 , German troops began an organised retreat along the Narva front .
It is suspected that the tank was then purposefully driven into the lake , abandoning it when its captors left the area .
At that time , a local boy walking by the lake Kurtna Matasjarv noticed tank tracks leading into the lake , but not coming out anywhere .
For two months he saw air bubbles emerging from the lake .
This gave him reason to believe that there must be an armoured vehicle at the lake ’s bottom .
A few years ago , he told the story to the leader of the local war history club “ Otsing ” .
Together with other club members , Mr Igor Shedunov initiated diving expeditions to the bottom of the lake about a year ago .
At the depth of 7 metres they discovered the tank resting under a 3 - metre layer of peat .
Enthusiasts from the club , under Mr Shedunov ’s leadership , decided to pull the tank out .
In September 2000 they turned to Mr Aleksander Borovkovthe , manager of the Narva open pit of the stock company AS Eesti Polevkivi , to rent the company ’s Komatsu D375A - 2 bulldozer .
Currently used at the pit , the Komatsu dozer was manufactured in 1995 , and has 19,000 operating hours without major repairs .
The pulling operation began at 09:00 and was concluded at 15:00 , with several technical breaks .
The weight of the tank , combined with the travel incline , made a pulling operation that required significant muscle .
The D375A - 2 handled the operation with power and style .
The weight of the fully armed tank was around 30 tons , so the tractive force required to retrieve it was similar .
A main requirement for the 68 - tonne dozer was to have enough weight to prevent shoe - slip while moving up the hill .
After the tank surfaced , it turned out to be a ‘ trophy ’ tank , that had been captured by the German army in the course of the battle at Sinimaed ( Blue Hills ) about six weeks before it was sunk in the lake .
Altogether , 116 shells were found on board .
Remarkably , the tank was in good condition , with no rust , and all systems ( except the engine ) in working condition .
This is a very rare machine , especially considering that it fought both on the Russian and the German sides .
Plans are under way to fully restore the tank .
It will be displayed at a war history museum , that will be founded at the Gorodenko village on the left bank of the River Narva .
Looking at the two tracked machines , the modern yellow Komatsu dozer is a reminder of how machine technologies have advanced , and the region ’s prospects of peace and prosperity have brightened .
Preparing to pull it out .
People from the nearby village come to look how it would be done .
Komatsu D375A - 2 is ready to go .
Here it comes …
Through muddy shore of the lake …
What a mint condition .
As it has been mentioned it was captured by Germans and that ’s why there are Nazi symbol on it .
As far it has been known , after a small repair and service they were able to start it ’s diesel engine .

The Gentle People By Nadya Labi The Last Lord Chancellor ?
By William Goodhart Man and the Machines By Benjamin Soskis Suspect Memories By Jascha Hoffman Common Denominator By Nicholas Thompson Money Talks By Andrew Goldstein
The Gentle People
Impressed by their piety , courts have permitted the Amish to live outside the law .
But in some places , the group 's ethic of forgive and forget has produced a plague of incest and let many perpetrators go unpunished .
By Nadya Labi
When she wrote the letter that she hoped would protect her sister , Mary Byler was lying on a twin bed , surrounded by rainbow - colored walls and a sky - blue ceiling decorated with bright white clouds .
A stereo sat on the floor beside her .
There were no signs of the Amish upbringing she had left behind no plain wood furniture or chamber pot .
Nothing except a stuffed doll that had belonged to her 6 - year - old sister .
The little girl had put the doll 's bonnet on backward .
Mary fingered her long brown hair as she thought of her sister .
And she thought about her older brother , Johnny , and his refusal when she 'd asked him to go to therapy the day before .
She started writing .
" When I was 4 years old , I was molested , when I was 6 , I was sexually abused ( rape ) from then on till I was 17 , " the 19 - year - old put down .
" There was nothing I could do about this abuse as it was incest . "
Mary gave the letter to a friend , who drove 30 minutes northwest of the house where Mary was staying in the Wisconsin town of Viroqua , past a couple of dirt roads , a string of red barns , and frozen cornfields .
He waited until nearly midnight on a cold evening last February , and then put the letter in the mailbox at the white shingled home of Sam Mast , an Amish minister in the community where Mary 's family lived during her teenage years .
Mary 's father was killed in a buggy accident when she was 5 ; she remembers him pulling her onto his lap and fondling her at their home in the small town of Sugar Grove , Pa .
After her father 's death , Mary 's family moved 100 miles south to New Wilmington , Pa. , another small town , where the back roads are filled with brown buggies and white shingled homes .
There , Mary 's two older cousins and brothers began molesting her .
Johnny told the police that his cousins encouraged him , " as far as breaking her in . "
( The cousins denied that , but admitted to molesting Mary . )
By the time Mary was in her teens , she was being raped regularly by Johnny , who is seven years older , and her brother Eli , who is four years older .
Once , Eli climbed on top of her while Johnny held her down .
There was no escape .
Mary was grabbed in the bedroom , in the barn , in the outhouse , milking the cows in the morning , and on her way to school .
" It did not matter how hard I tried to hide , " Mary would explain in her letter to Mast , which she also sent to other Amish clergy .
" If I ran upstairs to go to bed or to hide because I was at home with the boys , I 'd be locking my door and turn around and there was someone crawling through my window .
So my windows were always locked . . .
Then they started taking off my door . "
To the hordes of tourists who travel to Pennsylvania Dutch country each year to go to quilting bees and shop for crafts , the Gentle People , as the Amish are known , represent innocence .
They are a people apart , removed in place and arrested in time .
They reject the corruptions of modernity the cars that have splintered American communities and the televisions that have riveted the country 's youth .
The Amish way of life is grounded in agriculture , hard work , and community .
Its deliberate simplicity takes the form of horse - drawn buggies , clothes that could have come from a Vermeer painting , and a native German dialect infused with English words .
The myth of the Amish is amplified in movies like Witness and television shows like Amish in the City .
It 's also fed by a series of practices that reinforce the group 's insularity .
The Amish want to be left alone by the state and to a remarkable extent , they are .
They do n't fight America 's wars or , for the most part , contribute to Social Security .
In 1972 , noting their " excellent record as law - abiding and generally self - sufficient members of society , " the Supreme Court allowed the Amish to take their children out of school after eighth grade .
The license the Amish have been granted rests on the trust that the community will police itself , with Amish bishops and ministers acting in lieu of law enforcement .
Yet keeping order comes hard to church leaders .
" The Amish see the force of law as contrary to the Christian spirit , " said Donald Kraybill , a professor at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania and an expert on the group .
As a result , the Amish shy away from sending people to prison and the system of punishment of " the English , " as the Amish call other Americans .
Once a sinner has confessed , and his repentance has been deemed genuine , every member of the Amish community must forgive him .
This approach is rooted in the Amish notion of Gelassenheit , or submission .
Church members abide by their clergymen ; children obey their parents ; sisters mind their brothers ; and wives defer to their husbands ( divorce is taboo ) .
With each act of submission , the Amish follow the lesson of Jesus when he died on the cross rather than resist his adversaries .
But can a community govern itself by Jesus 's teaching of mercy alone ?
It is sinful for the Amish to withhold forgiveness so sinful that anyone who refers to a past misdeed after the Amish penalty for it has ended can be punished in the same manner as the original sinner .
" That 's a big thing in the Amish community , " Mary said .
" You have to forgive and forgive . "
In some church districts , which encompass only two or three dozen families scattered along back roads , there appear to be many crimes like Johnny and Eli's to forgive .
No statistics are available , but according to one Amish counselor who works with troubled church members across the Midwest , sexual abuse of children is " almost a plague in some communities . "
Some police forces and district attorneys do their best to step in , though they are rarely welcomed .
Others are slow to investigate or quick to let off Amish offenders with light punishments .
When that happens , girls like Mary are failed three times : by their families , their church , and their state .
KATHRYN BYLER , WHO COUNTS MARY AND HER FAMILY AS DISTANT KIN , lives more than 600 miles from them , in Morrow County , Ohio .
The Amish do n't own phones ( some use them only for emergencies ) .
Still , news gets around .
Kathryn knew Mary 's story .
Before her father 's death , Mary told her mother , Sally , that he was molesting her .
At first , Sally did n't believe her daughter .
Mary said that her mother told her , " He says he 's sorry and you have to forgive him . "
After her husband 's death , Sally raised Mary and her eight sons on her own .
Her household was n't the tidiest , and the children did n't always listen to her .
Sally got particularly frustrated with Mary , who had inherited her large almond - shaped eyes and tendency to talk out of turn .
When Mary 's brothers began raping her , she turned to her mother again .
Sally scolded the boys and gave them what Eli described as a light " mother 's tap . "
She also gave them an herb that she hoped would reduce their sex drives .
When the abuse resumed and Mary went back to her mother , she said Sally responded , " You do n't fight hard enough and you do n't pray hard enough . "
" The boys were doing bad things and the mother knew , " Kathryn said .
" What mother would allow that to happen in her house ? "
And yet , it happened in her house as well .
When I knocked on her screen door on a recent autumn afternoon , Kathryn was boiling two large pots of water for her husband Raymond 's bath .
His white shirt hung near the wood - burning stove , along with his spare straw hat .
Raymond was out doing carpentry work .
Kathryn tied on a black bonnet as she came to answer the door .
I had already encountered Kathryn in court documents .
This was the mother who had tried to shield her husband from prosecution , after the boyfriend of one of her three daughters reported to the Ohio police that Raymond was molesting two of the girls .
The abuse began when the older girl was 5 or 6 ; it lasted more than a decade , and included repeated rapes .
( The girl grew up in Pennsylvania near Mary Byler , and told Mary that her father was raping her . )
" I may have been to blame , too , " Kathryn Byler said in court at her husband 's sentencing in December 1998 .
In earlier interviews with detectives , Byler faulted herself for failing to sexually satisfy her husband .
Like Sally , she talked about administering an herbal remedy to reduce his sex drive .
" She knew what was going on .
It was almost , ' Take my daughter by the hand and let 's go to the barn , ' " said Sergeant Paul Mills , who helped investigate the case .
" ' So sayeth her husband , ' and whatever he says is the way it has to be . "
While we talked , Kathryn sat in a rocking chair , which she 'd polished to a high shine .
She wore metal - frame glasses and a dark green dress , pinned together because her church does n't allow zippers .
Beneath her black bonnet , her face was plain and open .
As her religion dictates , she wore no makeup or jewelry .
Though she was afraid to talk and spoke softly , fear did n't stop the words from rushing out of her .
It felt good , she said as she settled into her chair .
Kathryn does n't see her husband as a bad man .
She smiled when she showed me a picture of a lighthouse that Raymond had painted , and she praised him for coming home early that day to help can tomatoes .
Still , he has a nasty temper .
Kathryn hates the foosball table that sits in the middle of her living room , an eyesore of miniature yellow and black men that was a gift from an English friend .
But she has stopped asking Raymond to take it away .
When he gets upset , he shouts , and then she cries .
She has learned to be careful with him .
Years before his arrest , Raymond confessed to molesting one of his daughters and , as Kathryn put it , " made things right in church . "
Kathryn said that she believed he had stopped the abuse , though when her husband sent her out of the house on errands , a part of her wondered .
" I knew he wanted me to go away a lot , but I trusted him , " she said .
" I guess I trusted him too far . "
When their trust is betrayed , women like Kathryn and Sally see themselves as having little recourse .
In 1996 , Sally remarried a man named William Kempf , whom she 'd met on a bus ride .
The cabinetmaker , who is now 78 , had a mean streak , and he took to hitting Sally , Mary , and Mary 's younger half - sister .
" Sally lived eight miles from the nearest police station , " Sally 's lawyer , Russell Hanson , said to explain why his client , who declined to be interviewed , did n't report her sons .
" I was told by one of the elders that women are not permitted to take their horses to town . "
Yet in a shed one door down from the Kempfs ' house sits a white phone .
It 's registered in an English neighbor 's name but is used by the Amish .
Sally did n't call the police because she'd been taught to defer to the men in her household , even if they were her sons , and because she belongs to a community that believes the greater threat comes from without , not within .
Kathryn , for her part , has borne her husband six children .
Four older sons and daughters have left home the oldest girl got married and the middle girl lives with herbut their mother works hard to take care of Raymond and the young son and daughter who still live with them .
Even if the church allowed divorce , Kathryn would n't want one .
She 'd like Raymond to take medication to help calm his temper .
He wo n't , though , so she takes pills to ease her own sadness .
" We 're supposed to forgive , but that 's hard to do , " Kathryn said .
" The only way I can ever truly forgive him is when he dies .
Those were our children , and look what he did . "
THE AMISH CHURCH TRACES ITS ROOTS TO THE 16TH CENTURY , when a group of Swiss dissidents decided the Protestant Reformation was moving too slowly .
They embraced baptism of adults rather than children , a practice that was seen as a threat to the civic order and punished by execution .
The Amish faced persecution and torture , which they relive in their prayers and hymns every other Sunday , when they worship in each other 's homes .
Today , most of the church 's 200,000 members live in the United States , and about half of them are in Pennsylvania and Ohio , concentrated in rural counties that are the heart of Amish country .
There is a sameness to much of the region , with its white shingled homes , dark buggies , and repeating surnames .
As Donald Kraybill explains in his book The Amish and the State , there are two kingdoms in Amish theology : the kingdom of Christ , inhabited by the Amish , and the one in which everyone else lives .
To maintain the boundary between the two worlds , the Amish hold themselves apart from the secular state as much as they can .
In the mid-1900s , dozens of Amish fathers went to prison rather than agree to send their kids to public schools with non-Amish children .
The community opened its own one - room schoolhouses , where the curricula ignored subjects like science and sex education .
A woman who now lives near the Amish in Ohio's Guernsey County reports that many of her neighbors were n't taught that the earth was round .
" A lot of Amish will tell you they do n't want their kids to be educated , " she said .
" The more they know , the more apt they are to leave . "
The Amish tightly circumscribe their world in other ways as well .
For the most part , they do n't file lawsuits , serve on juries , run for political office , or vote ( despite Republican efforts to enlist them in the 2004 election ) .
In 1993 , Martin France , the district attorney in Wayne County , Ohio , prosecuted a case against a driver who killed five Amish children .
France got little support from the victims ' families .
" They did n't want anything to do with me .
They would just say , ' This was God 's will and we 're not going to interfere , ' " he recalled .
An Amish woman who lived next to the site of the accident told France that while she was pinning up her laundry , she saw the driver 's car race down a hill and hit the children , who flew as high as a nearby telephone pole .
But the woman refused to testify ; her bishop would n't allow it .
That bishop was a man in his late 20s who worked in his family 's chair factory .
Amish church leaders are chosen by lotor , as the faithful believe , by the unseen hand of God .
The bishop is the highest clergyman in the hierarchy of each church , and he oversees two ministers and a deacon .
Men and women propose candidates for minister and deacon , and in most districts any man with two or three nominations is considered .
The " elected " clergy is chosen according to a biblical method of casting lots : each man chooses from a pile of identical hymnals , and the one who chooses the book marked with a piece of paper bearing a verse from the Bible becomes a church leader .
The bishop , who is chosen the same way from a field of three ministers , has awesome authority .
He interprets the Ordnung , the unwritten rules that govern each church district , stipulating everything from the size of a man 's hat brim to the paint color on the outside of a house .
When a church member violates the Ordnung , the bishop determines the punishment .
When she turned 17 three years ago , Mary Byler joined the church , as Amish adults must do .
Johnny had stopped raping her when he got married in 1998 .
Mary thinks her new status as a church member protected her from Eli because it meant she had a duty to confess to fornication .
She tried to forget what had happened with her brothers , but she could n't .
When she was 19 , Mary sought succor from her minister , Sam Mast .
As she stood awkwardly in his workshop , Mast said he saw that she was " heavy - hearted . "
But Mary could n't bring herself to tell him what Johnny and Eli had done .
Mast suggested that she confess her sins in church .
" I said , ' Why do n't you go to somebody and just empty it out ? ' " he told me recently .
To some degree , Johnny had confessed his own a few years earlier , when he was 21 .
But he admitted to fornication without saying that he had committed rape or that his victim had been his sister .
The church elders did n't probe .
Bishop Dan Miller listened to Johnny 's confession , and later Mast gave him the letter Mary had written .
But when I spoke with him , Miller said he had " no sense of what was going on . "
He did n't connect Johnny 's confession with Mary 's plea for help .
Johnny 's punishment for his confessed sins lasted two weeks .
During that period , he was shunned , the traditional Amish punishment for serious transgressions .
As if sin were contagious , the community erects a metaphorical fence around the sinner .
Johnny was n't allowed to leave his home except to attend church .
After his punishment , he returned to working in his harness shop .
Mary 's punishment , by contrast , lasts forever .
When she wrote to Mast , Mary hoped that he and Miller would protect her younger sister , who had said things about another brother , David , then 17 , that worried Mary .
" It was little things like , ' David is bad to me , but Mom tells me he 's sorry and I have to forgive him , ' " Mary said .
" I said , this is my voice coming out of her . "
Mary warned the ministers that she would press charges unless something was done .
Nothing happened .
So Mary went to the police .
After the detectives came knocking , the community voted unanimously to excommunicate Mary .
Mast took a break from hammering in his workshop to explain the concept of excommunication to me .
When Mary left her home , she broke her vow to uphold the Ordnung .
The Amish believe that anyone who breaks that vow is damned and must be shunned .
Church members may talk to her only to admonish her to repent and return , Mast said .
He stroked his full beard as he struggled for the right English words .
" We would tell Mary that we think she done wrong and tell her to come back , " he said .
" We could n't take her word for anything .
We would have nothing to do with her . "
As for Mary 's brothers , Miller declared that Johnny and Eli would be shunned for periods of four and six weeks .
" They told us they wanted to quit and were sorry about what happened , " the minister said .
IN THE SHADOW OF A PEELING WHITE HOUSE IN GUERNSEY COUNTY , OHIO , sits a rusty shed .
Its wooden door had swung open on an afternoon in October , revealing black letters that spelled out the name N - O - R - M - A - N B-Y - L - E-R .
Now 72 , Norman was diagnosed a few years ago with depression and the beginnings of dementia .
A photograph of him at the time reveals thin features accented by a coarse white beard and dark , penetrating eyes .
Norman has a history of pedophilia that dates to the 1970s , when he allegedly molested several of his eight daughters and at least one young woman outside his family .
During that period , he confessed in church , repented , and was banished for four weeks .
Aware of her father 's problem , Norman 's youngest daughter " went to great lengths to make sure he was n't alone " with kids , said his public defender , Diane Menashe .
In 1995 , the daughter and her husband , Tobie Yoder , let Norman move onto their property .
Four years later , the Yoders discovered that Norman was molesting three of his granddaughters , ages 3 , 5 , and 8 .
Tobie went to Bishop Moses Miller and the elders in his Swartzentruber district .
That denomination falls on the most restrictive end of the spectrum from Old Order to New Order Amish .
( The New Order allows brighter colored clothing and more modern appliances . )
Bishops like Miller actively police their congregations .
The sins multiply quickly .
Driving a car , using a tractor , masturbating , and drinking alcohol can all trigger the maximum six - week ban .
( At the same time , some Swartzentrubers make allowances , like permitting tobacco and " bed courtship " :
On Saturday nights in Moses Miller 's district , teenage boys are allowed to steal into the rooms of girls their age .
The teens are supposed to keep their clothes on , but the boy is n't expected to leave until milking time the next morning .
Many parents encourage bed courtship because it often leads to early marriages , which make young people less likely to leave the church . )
Moses Miller responded to Tobie Yoder 's appeal by scolding Norman , who told him that in molesting his granddaughters , he was acting " no different than the cows in the field . "
Norman was shunned for six weeks .
But he remained out of control , so volatile that adults in the area feared for their safety .
Eventually Bishop Miller took the unusual step of allowing Yoder to take his father - in - law to a hospital .
Despite Norman 's recurring problems , other bishops say they would not have made the decision that Miller did .
" We have to deal with the sin if it 's once , twice , or thrice , " said Chris Kauffman , the most respected bishop in the Mt. Gilead area of Ohio's Morrow County .
Yet Levi Schwartz , who lives in Mt. Gilead , said the church 's reliance on repentance failed him .
" Sometimes I went into the bedroom and cried because of my sin , " he recalled .
In 1989 Schwartz started molesting one of his daughters .
He kissed the girl , rubbed her , and bared himself to her until she grew old enough to date , and then he moved on to her younger sister .
On a late fall night in his cavernous living room , the 52 - year - old , who has since left the Amish , talked about his past with unnerving ease while one of the daughters he molested sat on a nearby couch .
" I confessed in church a number of times , " Schwartz said .
" I wanted to be clean , so I took it to the ministers .
I thought that would give me grace , and the power to overcome it . "
Schwartz said his bishop , Eli Raber , discouraged Schwartz 's sporadic attempts to get counseling .
( Raber declined to comment . )
In 1994 , Schwartz 's son Benjamin began touching his sisters ; he confessed in church and was shunned for two weeks .
Levi Schwartz , however , was losing faith in the church 's method of punishment .
After one of his daughters started crying while he was molesting her , Schwartz checked himself into Oaklawn Psychiatric Hospital in Indiana .
He asked the girl to pray for him , and she did .
When Norman Byler 's family sent him to Mercy Medical Center in Ohio , he received a week of counseling and was given antipsychotic medication and antidepressants , which he burned instead of taking .
Still , Yoder believes the " doctoring " helped his father - in - law .
" I felt like we had him half decent under control , " he said .
But pedophilia is a hard disease to treat .
Deborah Love , an English neighbor who lived next to the Yoders , saw Norman take his 3 - year - old granddaughter into his woodshed on a fall day in 1999 .
She knew that one of Norman 's daughters had recently moved her family to Iowa after saying that Norman had asked to sleep with one of her girls .
" He was with me enough .
He was n't going to be with my daughter , " Love said the woman told her .
A day after Norman took the 3 - year - old into his shed , Love noticed some dried blood on the girl 's leg .
She called Guernsey County Children 's Services .
The Amish accused Love of lying , and she said she has felt their anger .
When some of the men passed her house , they raised their hats and turned them sideways to avoid looking at her .
Love 's husband said that one young Amish man warned him during hunting season that , " Accidents do happen , so you 'd better be careful . "
In the spring of 2000 , the Loves moved out of the neighborhood .
LAST MARCH , A DETECTIVE IN WISCONSIN phoned trooper Janice Wilson to tell her about statements that Mary and her family had made about rampant incest in the Amish community in which they grew up .
That community is in New Wilmington , Pa. , near where Wilson works .
When she started investigating , she was stunned to hear reports of extensive sexual abuse , and of births resulting from incest .
Amish insiders say the problem is so common that a bishop in the area has preached against it .
Johnny Byler said that , growing up in Lawrence County , he thought it was normal to have sex with his sister .
" Other kids would talk about it , " Johnny said .
When I asked Mary 's cousin , David Wengerd , whether he had molested his sister in addition to Mary , as Mary has charged , he responded , " I 'd rather not answer . "
Janice Wilson and I drove through New Wilmington , past a string of buggies heading to the home of a local Amish man , who was marrying off his daughter .
The white houses we passed had pale blue doors , the only touch of color allowed by the church .
Wilson was despairing over the cases she 'd been unable to crack because no victim would come forward .
Her supervisor , Lieutenant Peter Vogel , echoed her frustration , saying , " The moment we approach them as police , they shut up , the whole clan . "
When the police identify a perpetrator , however , their work in one sense becomes easy .
The Amish ethic of confession extends to answering questions asked by outsiders .
With little prompting from the detectives who questioned him , Norman Byler admitted to manually penetrating his 8 - year - old granddaughter .
He said that he hurt the child to get back at her father , who had refused to take Norman to the hospital to treat a torn muscle .
( Most Swartzentrubers resort to Western medicine only in emergencies . )
Raymond Byler , Levi and Benjamin Schwartz , and Johnny , Eli , and David Byler confessed with similar readiness .
Johnny and Eli were each charged with five counts of sexual assault and pleaded guilty , to two counts and one count , respectively .
David pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting his little sister .
In September , a month before his sentencing , Johnny said he sometimes felt suicidal and could n't understand why he might go to prison .
" Johnny thinks , ' I did a terrible thing but I 've tried to make it right , ' " said Jack Buswell , his attorney .
" He feels let down . "
Yet the confessions of Johnny and other Amish offenders have n't elicited heavy penalties .
Levi Schwartz got probation and his son has not been prosecuted .
The district attorney in Lawrence County said he had not decided whether to prosecute Mary 's cousins , Chris and David Wengerd .
Raymond Byler was sentenced to four years , even though the judge in his case found that he posed " the greatest likelihood of recidivism . "
Norman Byler faced a maximum penalty of 25 years in jail , but prosecutor Keith Plummer recommended that he serve no time beyond the two years he had waited to go on trial .
The judge set aside the plea , saying he was unwilling to countenance such leniency for an offender who had shown " no genuine remorse . "
Norman was sentenced to five years ; before his release last month , he wrote to the Yoders to say he wanted to come home .
The relatively light sentences meted out to these men stand out at a time when sex offenders are punished with increasing harshness .
The fear that many pedophiliacs can't be stopped has led Congress to lengthen sentences for child sex offenders and has persuaded some states to use involuntary civil commitment laws to keep them behind bars indefinitely .
Why did these Amish , by contrast , receive only mercy ?
District attorneys and judges appear to be quick to forgive in the counties that have the largest Amish populations .
The 92,000 Amish who live in Ohio and Pennsylvania generate hundreds of millions in annual tourism revenue .
Brent Yager , who prosecuted Levi Schwartz , would never say that he spared Schwartz to protect the appeal of Pennsylvania Dutch country .
But prosecutors and judges are as steeped in the myth of the Gentle People as anyone .
" Is Schwartz getting a break because he 's Amish ? "
Yager said .
" In some ways , yes .
Is he going to reoffend ?
I do n't think so . "
In Wisconsin , where only 10,000 Amish live , Timothy Gaskell took a harder line in prosecuting Johnny , Eli , and David Byler .
Gaskell also brought misdemeanor charges against Mary 's stepfather , for beating her , and against Sally , for failing to report the abuse of her daughter .
As a result of Gaskell 's efforts , the Kempfs were put on probation , David got a four - year prison sentence , and Eli got eight years in prison .
Johnny , however , was ordered to spend one year at the county jail , and mostly at night .
During the day , the judge said , he could work to keep his farm running .
A crowd of 150 Amish turned out to support Johnny at his sentencing .
IT IS HARD TO THINK OF MARY BYLER AS LUCKY , but in one respect she was :
The state responded when she asked for help .
Anna Slabaugh has a different story .
Anna , who is the eighth of nine children , remembers reading books with her mother as a child .
Fannie Slabaugh taught school when Anna was young , and though reading books was strongly discouraged by the family 's Swartzentruber district , she could n't bear to get rid of the books she had found in an abandoned schoolhouse .
Maybe it was the Nancy Drew mysteries , but Anna never felt she belonged with the Swartzentrubers .
She got upset when her father cut off the tails of the pigs or pulled out the horns of the goats .
She liked to draw , which violated the Ordnung .
And she did n't like the constant dimness :
The church allowed only kerosene , which gives off less light than gas , and candles had to be kept at a low glow .
Whether for wearing her cap too far back on her head or for " acting around " in church , Anna was often in trouble .
Her father was in poor health , because he refused to take insulin for his diabetes , but he knew how to give a good beating .
Sometimes he used the strap , a foot - long piece of rubber common in Amish homes ; at other times , he took Anna " to the woodpile " and hit her with a piece of wood .
When Anna turned 11 , she told me , her 19 - year - old brother began molesting her , stopping just short of intercourse .
When he moved away , another 17 - year - old brother started raping her .
( The court documents involving Anna 's family are sealed . )
Anna did n't try to stop her brothers at first .
" You do n't tell your brothers , who are so much older than you , No , " she said .
But when she got her period at 13 and realized she could have a baby , she started fighting back .
" He would make sure he put a lot of pressure on my top so I could n't breathe , " she said of the younger brother .
Anna wanted help , but she did n't think she would get it from her church .
So she began dropping hints about the abuse to English neighbors .
When they did n't pick up on her cues , she got bolder .
In 2001 , while cleaning house for her family 's landlord , Anna used the phone to call a battered women 's shelter in Mt. Vernon , Ohio .
The counselors on the other end of the line did n't take her seriously .
But after a month of calls , the shelter alerted Children and Family Services Division of Knox County .
When a social worker visited Anna 's home , Anna told her about the sexual abuse .
She also reported that her parents were moving the family to Pennsylvania .
Laurie Roberts , one of the social workers on Anna 's case in Ohio , said she was taught in training that sexual abuse among the Amish is pervasive , and seldom reported .
( The problem is significant enough that the counties near Knox publish a pamphlet to educate the Amish about sexual abuse . )
Yet the county left Anna in her home .
" Oh Gosh , I wish I could get it in those C.S. people that my parents will absolutely kill me now , " Anna wrote at the time to a cousin who had left the Amish .
The social workers " say you 'll have to be hurt by them before we 'll do anything about it , " she continued .
Anna tried to run away .
But when her parents figured out where she was and called the woman who was sheltering her , Anna was sent home .
Fannie began locking Anna in her room .
The family moved to Tionesta , Pa. , where Fannie tried to get her daughter declared mentally ill .
She took Anna to a doctor who found that Anna 's eardrum had collapsed from blows to her head and seemed doubtful that the damage had been caused by buggy accidents as he'd been told .
Fannie next tried a massage therapist , Barbara Burke .
Noticing scars on Anna 's legs , Burke called Children and Youth Services in Clarion County .
On a later visit , Burke massaged Anna 's father while CYS secretly interviewed Anna in the basement .
The agency later visited Anna at her home .
But it did n't take her into protective custody .
( CYS declined to comment . )
When Fannie found out about the CYS visit , she and Anna went with 13 other kids to the home of John Yoder , an Amish dentist who lived an hour and a half away in the town of Punxsutawney .
Yoder 's living room had a recliner with a tin pan and some needles next to it .
Anna watched as the other kids each had one or two bad teeth pulled .
When it was her turn , Yoder shot some novocaine into her upper gum .
She shook her head and told him that two of her lower teeth had cavities .
He shot the lower gum , and asked Fannie which teeth should go .
Anna 's mother answered , " Take them all , " and Yoder pulled along the upper gum , along the lower gum , until every tooth was gone .
" After he had pulled the last tooth , " Anna remembered , " my mom looked at me and said , ' I guess you wo n't be talking anymore . ' "
Anna bled for three days .
Her family ignored her , except to periodically hand her a drink .
She could n't talk , but that did n't matter , because Anna had nothing left to say .
At church , she looked away when other kids pointed at her mouth .
Fannie Slabaugh told me that Anna had asked for her teeth to be pulled .
But the detective who investigated the case , Trooper Michael Pisarchic , said that the other kids who went with Anna to see Yoder said that Anna was being punished .
Meanwhile , CYS was continuing to investigate .
A court date was set for the spring of 2002 .
The bishop in Anna 's district , Moses Shettler , called Barbara Burke and asked her to testify that Anna had mental problems .
Burke refused .
On the Friday before Anna was scheduled to appear in court , soon after her teeth had been pulled , Shettler and a group of elders visited Anna 's parents .
Anna said her parents threatened two days later to take her out to the woodpile , or worse , unless she told her lawyer that she took back her accusations against her brothers .
Stripped of faith in the state to protect her , Anna did as she was told .
Neither Anna 's parents nor John Yoder were ever charged with abuse .
The judge in Anna 's case allowed the younger brother to remain under Amish supervision as long as he had no contact with Anna .
But Anna said he returned home on the day of the hearing .
" They do n't believe it 's any of our business , " said Roberts , Anna 's Ohio social worker , of the Amish attitude toward child abuse investigations .
But it 's the job of social workers , police , and prosecutors to make child abuse their business .
The state 's duty to push past the barriers thrown up by parents and the community can't hinge on the religion they practice .
Its role becomes more essential , not less , when adults wall off children from the outside world .
While the authorities idled , Anna was being watched constantly .
One of her chores was taking the family 's horses out to pasture , within view of the house .
On a morning in June when the animals seemed frisky , Anna clapped her hands .
The horses scattered and she pretended to chase them , cutting across the field to a mailbox , where she dropped off a letter she 'd written to Burke .
" Are you still willing to help , or am I not welcome ? " she wrote .
" I need to get out of here . "
She asked Burke to put a message in a plastic bottle for her and leave it in a ditch by the mailbox .
Two days later , Anna spooked the horses again , and a message was waiting .
" Our arms are open to you and so are our doors , " Burke promised .
Anna burned the note with a lighter and went home .
It was her turn to make supper .
She lit the stove , began heating water , and sat down to write a letter to her family .
The sun was falling when she finished .
Anna climbed out of the kitchen window and ran .
WHEN MARY BYLER LEFT HOME , SHE THREW HER WHITE CAP onto Sam Mast 's driveway and screeched off in the car of a woman who took her in .
In the two years since , Mary has driven by her mother 's house a few times in a black Grand Prix .
" If Mary wants to get away , " Sally asked Eli 's lawyer , Greg Lunde , " why does she keep coming back ? "
When I caught up with Mary , six months after she left the Amish , she insisted that her mother and her brothers were dead to her .
But in the kitchen of the spotless trailer she rents next to Wisconsin 's La Crosse River , she could n't stop talking about them .
Cracking eggs into a mixing bowl to make sugar cookies never mind that it was after midnight she dwelt on how much Johnny , Eli , and David loved her baking .
Though Mary can't quite leave her family behind , she ran from the church and did n't look back .
She pierced her ears last March , earned a GED in April , and got a driver 's license in May .
A friend bought her the Grand Prix , and Mary paid him back on the $ 8 - an - hour salary she earns cleaning a hospital in La Crosse .
Mary took me out to her car to play a Loretta Lynn cassette .
Dressed in shorts and a tight pink T - shirt with a white angel on the front , she shifted a Doral cigarette from her right hand to her left so that she could jab more effectively at the seek button on the car stereo .
She was looking for one song : " Hey , Loretta . "
When it started , Mary jerked her head to the beat .
" Goodbye tub and clothesline , goodbye pots an ' pans , " she belted out , flinging her hair and pounding her right leg .
Her nails painted a matching pink and a silver necklace hanging from her neck , Mary did n't care how many Ordnung rules she was breaking .
She was drunk on freedom .
Nadya Labi is a senior editor at Legal Affairs .
When she wrote the letter that she hoped would protect her sister , Mary Byler was lying on a twin bed , surrounded by rainbow - colored walls and a sky - blue ceiling decorated with bright white clouds .
A stereo sat on the floor beside her .
There were no signs of the Amish upbringing she had left behind no plain wood furniture or chamber pot .
Nothing except a stuffed doll that had belonged to her 6 - year - old sister .
The little girl had put the doll 's bonnet on backward .
Mary fingered her long brown hair as she thought of her sister .
And she thought about her older brother , Johnny , and his refusal when she 'd asked him to go to therapy the day before .
She started writing .
" When I was 4 years old , I was molested , when I was 6 , I was sexually abused ( rape ) from then on till I was 17 , " the 19 - year - old put down .
" There was nothing I could do about this abuse as it was incest .
" Mary gave the letter to a friend , who drove 30 minutes northwest of the house where Mary was staying in the Wisconsin town of Viroqua , past a couple of dirt roads , a string of red barns , and frozen cornfields .
He waited until nearly midnight on a cold evening last February , and then put the letter in the mailbox at the white shingled home of Sam Mast , an Amish minister in the community where Mary 's family lived during her teenage years .
Mary 's father was killed in a buggy accident when she was 5 ; she remembers him pulling her onto his lap and fondling her at their home in the small town of Sugar Grove , Pa .
After her father 's death , Mary 's family moved 100 miles south to New Wilmington , Pa. , another small town , where the back roads are filled with brown buggies and white shingled homes .
There , Mary 's two older cousins and brothers began molesting her .
Johnny told the police that his cousins encouraged him , " as far as breaking her in . "
( The cousins denied that , but admitted to molesting Mary . )
By the time Mary was in her teens , she was being raped regularly by Johnny , who is seven years older , and her brother Eli , who is four years older .
Once , Eli climbed on top of her while Johnny held her down .
There was no escape .
Mary was grabbed in the bedroom , in the barn , in the outhouse , milking the cows in the morning , and on her way to school .
" It did not matter how hard I tried to hide , " Mary would explain in her letter to Mast , which she also sent to other Amish clergy .
" If I ran upstairs to go to bed or to hide because I was at home with the boys , I 'd be locking my door and turn around and there was someone crawling through my window .
So my windows were always locked . . .
Then they started taking off my door .
" To the hordes of tourists who travel to Pennsylvania Dutch country each year to go to quilting bees and shop for crafts , the Gentle People , as the Amish are known , represent innocence .
They are a people apart , removed in place and arrested in time .
They reject the corruptions of modernity the cars that have splintered American communities and the televisions that have riveted the country 's youth .
The Amish way of life is grounded in agriculture , hard work , and community .
Its deliberate simplicity takes the form of horse - drawn buggies , clothes that could have come from a Vermeer painting , and a native German dialect infused with English words .
The myth of the Amish is amplified in movies likeand television shows like .
It 's also fed by a series of practices that reinforce the group 's insularity .
The Amish want to be left alone by the state and to a remarkable extent , they are .
They do n't fight America 's wars or , for the most part , contribute to Social Security .
In 1972 , noting their " excellent record as law - abiding and generally self - sufficient members of society , " the Supreme Court allowed the Amish to take their children out of school after eighth grade .
The license the Amish have been granted rests on the trust that the community will police itself , with Amish bishops and ministers acting in lieu of law enforcement .
Yet keeping order comes hard to church leaders .
" The Amish see the force of law as contrary to the Christian spirit , " said Donald Kraybill , a professor at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania and an expert on the group .
As a result , the Amish shy away from sending people to prison and the system of punishment of " the English , " as the Amish call other Americans .
Once a sinner has confessed , and his repentance has been deemed genuine , every member of the Amish community must forgive him .
This approach is rooted in the Amish notion of , or submission .
Church members abide by their clergymen ; children obey their parents ; sisters mind their brothers ; and wives defer to their husbands ( divorce is taboo ) .
With each act of submission , the Amish follow the lesson of Jesus when he died on the cross rather than resist his adversaries .
But can a community govern itself by Jesus 's teaching of mercy alone ?
It is sinful for the Amish to withhold forgiveness so sinful that anyone who refers to a past misdeed after the Amish penalty for it has ended can be punished in the same manner as the original sinner .
" That 's a big thing in the Amish community , " Mary said .
" You have to forgive and forgive .
" In some church districts , which encompass only two or three dozen families scattered along back roads , there appear to be many crimes like Johnny and Eli's to forgive .
No statistics are available , but according to one Amish counselor who works with troubled church members across the Midwest , sexual abuse of children is " almost a plague in some communities . "
Some police forces and district attorneys do their best to step in , though they are rarely welcomed .
Others are slow to investigate or quick to let off Amish offenders with light punishments .
When that happens , girls like Mary are failed three times : by their families , their church , and their state .
KATHRYN BYLER , WHO COUNTS MARY AND HER FAMILY AS DISTANT KIN , lives more than 600 miles from them , in Morrow County , Ohio .
The Amish do n't own phones ( some use them only for emergencies ) .
Still , news gets around .
Kathryn knew Mary 's story .
Before her father 's death , Mary told her mother , Sally , that he was molesting her .
At first , Sally did n't believe her daughter .
Mary said that her mother told her , " He says he 's sorry and you have to forgive him . "
After her husband 's death , Sally raised Mary and her eight sons on her own .
Her household was n't the tidiest , and the children did n't always listen to her .
Sally got particularly frustrated with Mary , who had inherited her large almond - shaped eyes and tendency to talk out of turn .
When Mary 's brothers began raping her , she turned to her mother again .
Sally scolded the boys and gave them what Eli described as a light " mother 's tap . "
She also gave them an herb that she hoped would reduce their sex drives .
When the abuse resumed and Mary went back to her mother , she said Sally responded , " You do n't fight hard enough and you do n't pray hard enough . "
" The boys were doing bad things and the mother knew , " Kathryn said .
" What mother would allow that to happen in her house ?
" And yet , it happened in her house as well .
When I knocked on her screen door on a recent autumn afternoon , Kathryn was boiling two large pots of water for her husband Raymond 's bath .
His white shirt hung near the wood - burning stove , along with his spare straw hat .
Raymond was out doing carpentry work .
Kathryn tied on a black bonnet as she came to answer the door .
I had already encountered Kathryn in court documents .
This was the mother who had tried to shield her husband from prosecution , after the boyfriend of one of her three daughters reported to the Ohio police that Raymond was molesting two of the girls .
The abuse began when the older girl was 5 or 6 ; it lasted more than a decade , and included repeated rapes .
( The girl grew up in Pennsylvania near Mary Byler , and told Mary that her father was raping her . )
" I may have been to blame , too , " Kathryn Byler said in court at her husband 's sentencing in December 1998 .
In earlier interviews with detectives , Byler faulted herself for failing to sexually satisfy her husband .
Like Sally , she talked about administering an herbal remedy to reduce his sex drive .
" She knew what was going on .
It was almost , ' Take my daughter by the hand and let 's go to the barn , ' " said Sergeant Paul Mills , who helped investigate the case .
" ' So sayeth her husband , ' and whatever he says is the way it has to be .
" While we talked , Kathryn sat in a rocking chair , which she 'd polished to a high shine .
She wore metal - frame glasses and a dark green dress , pinned together because her church does n't allow zippers .
Beneath her black bonnet , her face was plain and open .
As her religion dictates , she wore no makeup or jewelry .
Though she was afraid to talk and spoke softly , fear did n't stop the words from rushing out of her .
It felt good , she said as she settled into her chair .
Kathryn does n't see her husband as a bad man .
She smiled when she showed me a picture of a lighthouse that Raymond had painted , and she praised him for coming home early that day to help can tomatoes .
Still , he has a nasty temper .
Kathryn hates the foosball table that sits in the middle of her living room , an eyesore of miniature yellow and black men that was a gift from an English friend .
But she has stopped asking Raymond to take it away .
When he gets upset , he shouts , and then she cries .
She has learned to be careful with him .
Years before his arrest , Raymond confessed to molesting one of his daughters and , as Kathryn put it , " made things right in church . "
Kathryn said that she believed he had stopped the abuse , though when her husband sent her out of the house on errands , a part of her wondered .
" I knew he wanted me to go away a lot , but I trusted him , " she said .
" I guess I trusted him too far .
" When their trust is betrayed , women like Kathryn and Sally see themselves as having little recourse .
In 1996 , Sally remarried a man named William Kempf , whom she 'd met on a bus ride .
The cabinetmaker , who is now 78 , had a mean streak , and he took to hitting Sally , Mary , and Mary 's younger half - sister .
" Sally lived eight miles from the nearest police station , " Sally 's lawyer , Russell Hanson , said to explain why his client , who declined to be interviewed , did n't report her sons .
" I was told by one of the elders that women are not permitted to take their horses to town .
"
Yet in a shed one door down from the Kempfs ' house sits a white phone .
It 's registered in an English neighbor 's name but is used by the Amish .
Sally did n't call the police because she'd been taught to defer to the men in her household , even if they were her sons , and because she belongs to a community that believes the greater threat comes from without , not within .
Kathryn , for her part , has borne her husband six children .
Four older sons and daughters have left home the oldest girl got married and the middle girl lives with herbut their mother works hard to take care of Raymond and the young son and daughter who still live with them .
Even if the church allowed divorce , Kathryn would n't want one .
She 'd like Raymond to take medication to help calm his temper .
He wo n't , though , so she takes pills to ease her own sadness .
" We 're supposed to forgive , but that 's hard to do , " Kathryn said .
" The only way I can ever truly forgive him is when he dies .
Those were our children , and look what he did .
" THE AMISH CHURCH TRACES ITS ROOTS TO THE 16TH CENTURY , when a group of Swiss dissidents decided the Protestant Reformation was moving too slowly .
They embraced baptism of adults rather than children , a practice that was seen as a threat to the civic order and punished by execution .
The Amish faced persecution and torture , which they relive in their prayers and hymns every other Sunday , when they worship in each other 's homes .
Today , most of the church 's 200,000 members live in the United States , and about half of them are in Pennsylvania and Ohio , concentrated in rural counties that are the heart of Amish country .
There is a sameness to much of the region , with its white shingled homes , dark buggies , and repeating surnames .
As Donald Kraybill explains in his book , there are two kingdoms in Amish theology : the kingdom of Christ , inhabited by the Amish , and the one in which everyone else lives .
To maintain the boundary between the two worlds , the Amish hold themselves apart from the secular state as much as they can .
In the mid-1900s , dozens of Amish fathers went to prison rather than agree to send their kids to public schools with non-Amish children .
The community opened its own one - room schoolhouses , where the curricula ignored subjects like science and sex education .
A woman who now lives near the Amish in Ohio's Guernsey County reports that many of her neighbors were n't taught that the earth was round .
" A lot of Amish will tell you they do n't want their kids to be educated , " she said .
" The more they know , the more apt they are to leave .
" The Amish tightly circumscribe their world in other ways as well .
For the most part , they do n't file lawsuits , serve on juries , run for political office , or vote ( despite Republican efforts to enlist them in the 2004 election ) .
In 1993 , Martin France , the district attorney in Wayne County , Ohio , prosecuted a case against a driver who killed five Amish children .
France got little support from the victims ' families .
" They did n't want anything to do with me .
They would just say , ' This was God 's will and we 're not going to interfere , ' " he recalled .
An Amish woman who lived next to the site of the accident told France that while she was pinning up her laundry , she saw the driver 's car race down a hill and hit the children , who flew as high as a nearby telephone pole .
But the woman refused to testify ; her bishop would n't allow it .
That bishop was a man in his late 20s who worked in his family 's chair factory .
Amish church leaders are chosen by lotor , as the faithful believe , by the unseen hand of God .
The bishop is the highest clergyman in the hierarchy of each church , and he oversees two ministers and a deacon .
Men and women propose candidates for minister and deacon , and in most districts any man with two or three nominations is considered .
The " elected " clergy is chosen according to a biblical method of casting lots : each man chooses from a pile of identical hymnals , and the one who chooses the book marked with a piece of paper bearing a verse from the Bible becomes a church leader .
The bishop , who is chosen the same way from a field of three ministers , has awesome authority .
He interprets the , the unwritten rules that govern each church district , stipulating everything from the size of a man 's hat brim to the paint color on the outside of a house .
When a church member violates the , the bishop determines the punishment .
When she turned 17 three years ago , Mary Byler joined the church , as Amish adults must do .
Johnny had stopped raping her when he got married in 1998 .
Mary thinks her new status as a church member protected her from Eli because it meant she had a duty to confess to fornication .
She tried to forget what had happened with her brothers , but she could n't .
When she was 19 , Mary sought succor from her minister , Sam Mast .
As she stood awkwardly in his workshop , Mast said he saw that she was " heavy - hearted . "
But Mary could n't bring herself to tell him what Johnny and Eli had done .
Mast suggested that she confess her sins in church .
" I said , ' Why do n't you go to somebody and just empty it out ? ' " he told me recently .
To some degree , Johnny had confessed his own a few years earlier , when he was 21 .
But he admitted to fornication without saying that he had committed rape or that his victim had been his sister .
The church elders did n't probe .
Bishop Dan Miller listened to Johnny 's confession , and later Mast gave him the letter Mary had written .
But when I spoke with him , Miller said he had " no sense of what was going on . "
He did n't connect Johnny 's confession with Mary 's plea for help .
Johnny 's punishment for his confessed sins lasted two weeks .
During that period , he was shunned , the traditional Amish punishment for serious transgressions .
As if sin were contagious , the community erects a metaphorical fence around the sinner .
Johnny was n't allowed to leave his home except to attend church .
After his punishment , he returned to working in his harness shop .
Mary 's punishment , by contrast , lasts forever .
When she wrote to Mast , Mary hoped that he and Miller would protect her younger sister , who had said things about another brother , David , then 17 , that worried Mary .
" It was little things like , ' David is bad to me , but Mom tells me he 's sorry and I have to forgive him , ' " Mary said .
" I said , this is my voice coming out of her . "
Mary warned the ministers that she would press charges unless something was done .
Nothing happened .
So Mary went to the police .
After the detectives came knocking , the community voted unanimously to excommunicate Mary .
Mast took a break from hammering in his workshop to explain the concept of excommunication to me .
When Mary left her home , she broke her vow to uphold the .
The Amish believe that anyone who breaks that vow is damned and must be shunned .
Church members may talk to her only to admonish her to repent and return , Mast said .
He stroked his full beard as he struggled for the right English words .
" We would tell Mary that we think she done wrong and tell her to come back , " he said .
" We could n't take her word for anything .
We would have nothing to do with her .
" As for Mary 's brothers , Miller declared that Johnny and Eli would be shunned for periods of four and six weeks .
" They told us they wanted to quit and were sorry about what happened , " the minister said .
IN THE SHADOW OF A PEELING WHITE HOUSE IN GUERNSEY COUNTY , OHIO , sits a rusty shed .
Its wooden door had swung open on an afternoon in October , revealing black letters that spelled out the name N - O - R - M - A - N B-Y -L- E - R. Now 72 , Norman was diagnosed a few years ago with depression and the beginnings of dementia .
A photograph of him at the time reveals thin features accented by a coarse white beard and dark , penetrating eyes .
Norman has a history of pedophilia that dates to the 1970s , when he allegedly molested several of his eight daughters and at least one young woman outside his family .
During that period , he confessed in church , repented , and was banished for four weeks .
Aware of her father 's problem , Norman 's youngest daughter " went to great lengths to make sure he was n't alone " with kids , said his public defender , Diane Menashe .
In 1995 , the daughter and her husband , Tobie Yoder , let Norman move onto their property .
Four years later , the Yoders discovered that Norman was molesting three of his granddaughters , ages 3 , 5 , and 8 .
Tobie went to Bishop Moses Miller and the elders in his Swartzentruber district .
That denomination falls on the most restrictive end of the spectrum from Old Order to New Order Amish .
( The New Order allows brighter colored clothing and more modern appliances . )
Bishops like Miller actively police their congregations .
The sins multiply quickly .
Driving a car , using a tractor , masturbating , and drinking alcohol can all trigger the maximum six - week ban .
( At the same time , some Swartzentrubers make allowances , like permitting tobacco and " bed courtship " :
On Saturday nights in Moses Miller 's district , teenage boys are allowed to steal into the rooms of girls their age .
The teens are supposed to keep their clothes on , but the boy is n't expected to leave until milking time the next morning .
Many parents encourage bed courtship because it often leads to early marriages , which make young people less likely to leave the church . )
Moses Miller responded to Tobie Yoder 's appeal by scolding Norman , who told him that in molesting his granddaughters , he was acting " no different than the cows in the field . "
Norman was shunned for six weeks .
But he remained out of control , so volatile that adults in the area feared for their safety .
Eventually Bishop Miller took the unusual step of allowing Yoder to take his father - in - law to a hospital .
Despite Norman 's recurring problems , other bishops say they would not have made the decision that Miller did .
" We have to deal with the sin if it 's once , twice , or thrice , " said Chris Kauffman , the most respected bishop in the Mt. Gilead area of Ohio's Morrow County .
Yet Levi Schwartz , who lives in Mt. Gilead , said the church 's reliance on repentance failed him .
" Sometimes I went into the bedroom and cried because of my sin , " he recalled .
In 1989 Schwartz started molesting one of his daughters .
He kissed the girl , rubbed her , and bared himself to her until she grew old enough to date , and then he moved on to her younger sister .
On a late fall night in his cavernous living room , the 52 - year - old , who has since left the Amish , talked about his past with unnerving ease while one of the daughters he molested sat on a nearby couch .
" I confessed in church a number of times , " Schwartz said .
" I wanted to be clean , so I took it to the ministers .
I thought that would give me grace , and the power to overcome it .
" Schwartz said his bishop , Eli Raber , discouraged Schwartz 's sporadic attempts to get counseling .
( Raber declined to comment . )
In 1994 , Schwartz 's son Benjamin began touching his sisters ; he confessed in church and was shunned for two weeks .
Levi Schwartz , however , was losing faith in the church 's method of punishment .
After one of his daughters started crying while he was molesting her , Schwartz checked himself into Oaklawn Psychiatric Hospital in Indiana .
He asked the girl to pray for him , and she did .
When Norman Byler 's family sent him to Mercy Medical Center in Ohio , he received a week of counseling and was given antipsychotic medication and antidepressants , which he burned instead of taking .
Still , Yoder believes the " doctoring " helped his father - in - law .
" I felt like we had him half decent under control , " he said .
But pedophilia is a hard disease to treat .
Deborah Love , an English neighbor who lived next to the Yoders , saw Norman take his 3 - year - old granddaughter into his woodshed on a fall day in 1999 .
She knew that one of Norman 's daughters had recently moved her family to Iowa after saying that Norman had asked to sleep with one of her girls .
" He was with me enough .
He was n't going to be with my daughter , " Love said the woman told her .
A day after Norman took the 3 - year - old into his shed , Love noticed some dried blood on the girl 's leg .
She called Guernsey County Children 's Services .
The Amish accused Love of lying , and she said she has felt their anger .
When some of the men passed her house , they raised their hats and turned them sideways to avoid looking at her .
Love 's husband said that one young Amish man warned him during hunting season that , " Accidents do happen , so you 'd better be careful . "
In the spring of 2000 , the Loves moved out of the neighborhood .
LAST MARCH , A DETECTIVE IN WISCONSIN phoned trooper Janice Wilson to tell her about statements that Mary and her family had made about rampant incest in the Amish community in which they grew up .
That community is in New Wilmington , Pa. , near where Wilson works .
When she started investigating , she was stunned to hear reports of extensive sexual abuse , and of births resulting from incest .
Amish insiders say the problem is so common that a bishop in the area has preached against it .
Johnny Byler said that , growing up in Lawrence County , he thought it was normal to have sex with his sister .
" Other kids would talk about it , " Johnny said .
When I asked Mary 's cousin , David Wengerd , whether he had molested his sister in addition to Mary , as Mary has charged , he responded , " I 'd rather not answer .
" Janice Wilson and I drove through New Wilmington , past a string of buggies heading to the home of a local Amish man , who was marrying off his daughter .
The white houses we passed had pale blue doors , the only touch of color allowed by the church .
Wilson was despairing over the cases she 'd been unable to crack because no victim would come forward .
Her supervisor , Lieutenant Peter Vogel , echoed her frustration , saying , " The moment we approach them as police , they shut up , the whole clan .
" When the police identify a perpetrator , however , their work in one sense becomes easy .
The Amish ethic of confession extends to answering questions asked by outsiders .
With little prompting from the detectives who questioned him , Norman Byler admitted to manually penetrating his 8 - year - old granddaughter .
He said that he hurt the child to get back at her father , who had refused to take Norman to the hospital to treat a torn muscle .
( Most Swartzentrubers resort to Western medicine only in emergencies . )
Raymond Byler , Levi and Benjamin Schwartz , and Johnny , Eli , and David Byler confessed with similar readiness .
Johnny and Eli were each charged with five counts of sexual assault and pleaded guilty , to two counts and one count , respectively .
David pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting his little sister .
In September , a month before his sentencing , Johnny said he sometimes felt suicidal and could n't understand why he might go to prison .
" Johnny thinks , ' I did a terrible thing but I 've tried to make it right , ' " said Jack Buswell , his attorney .
" He feels let down . " Yet the confessions of Johnny and other Amish offenders have n't elicited heavy penalties .
Levi Schwartz got probation and his son has not been prosecuted .
The district attorney in Lawrence County said he had not decided whether to prosecute Mary 's cousins , Chris and David Wengerd .
Raymond Byler was sentenced to four years , even though the judge in his case found that he posed " the greatest likelihood of recidivism . "
Norman Byler faced a maximum penalty of 25 years in jail , but prosecutor Keith Plummer recommended that he serve no time beyond the two years he had waited to go on trial .
The judge set aside the plea , saying he was unwilling to countenance such leniency for an offender who had shown " no genuine remorse . "
Norman was sentenced to five years ; before his release last month , he wrote to the Yoders to say he wanted to come home .
The relatively light sentences meted out to these men stand out at a time when sex offenders are punished with increasing harshness .
The fear that many pedophiliacs can't be stopped has led Congress to lengthen sentences for child sex offenders and has persuaded some states to use involuntary civil commitment laws to keep them behind bars indefinitely .
Why did these Amish , by contrast , receive only mercy ?
District attorneys and judges appear to be quick to forgive in the counties that have the largest Amish populations .
The 92,000 Amish who live in Ohio and Pennsylvania generate hundreds of millions in annual tourism revenue .
Brent Yager , who prosecuted Levi Schwartz , would never say that he spared Schwartz to protect the appeal of Pennsylvania Dutch country .
But prosecutors and judges are as steeped in the myth of the Gentle People as anyone .
" Is Schwartz getting a break because he 's Amish ? "
Yager said .
" In some ways , yes .
Is he going to reoffend ?
I do n't think so .
" In Wisconsin , where only 10,000 Amish live , Timothy Gaskell took a harder line in prosecuting Johnny , Eli , and David Byler .
Gaskell also brought misdemeanor charges against Mary 's stepfather , for beating her , and against Sally , for failing to report the abuse of her daughter .
As a result of Gaskell 's efforts , the Kempfs were put on probation , David got a four - year prison sentence , and Eli got eight years in prison .
Johnny , however , was ordered to spend one year at the county jail , and mostly at night .
During the day , the judge said , he could work to keep his farm running .
A crowd of 150 Amish turned out to support Johnny at his sentencing .
IT IS HARD TO THINK OF MARY BYLER AS LUCKY , but in one respect she was :
The state responded when she asked for help .
Anna Slabaugh has a different story .
Anna , who is the eighth of nine children , remembers reading books with her mother as a child .
Fannie Slabaugh taught school when Anna was young , and though reading books was strongly discouraged by the family 's Swartzentruber district , she could n't bear to get rid of the books she had found in an abandoned schoolhouse .
Maybe it was the Nancy Drew mysteries , but Anna never felt she belonged with the Swartzentrubers .
She got upset when her father cut off the tails of the pigs or pulled out the horns of the goats .
She liked to draw , which violated the .
And she did n't like the constant dimness :
The church allowed only kerosene , which gives off less light than gas , and candles had to be kept at a low glow .
Whether for wearing her cap too far back on her head or for " acting around " in church , Anna was often in trouble .
Her father was in poor health , because he refused to take insulin for his diabetes , but he knew how to give a good beating .
Sometimes he used the strap , a foot - long piece of rubber common in Amish homes ; at other times , he took Anna " to the woodpile " and hit her with a piece of wood .
When Anna turned 11 , she told me , her 19 - year - old brother began molesting her , stopping just short of intercourse .
When he moved away , another 17 - year - old brother started raping her .
( The court documents involving Anna 's family are sealed . )
Anna did n't try to stop her brothers at first .
" You do n't tell your brothers , who are so much older than you , No , " she said .
But when she got her period at 13 and realized she could have a baby , she started fighting back .
" He would make sure he put a lot of pressure on my top so I could n't breathe , " she said of the younger brother .
Anna wanted help , but she did n't think she would get it from her church .
So she began dropping hints about the abuse to English neighbors .
When they did n't pick up on her cues , she got bolder .
In 2001 , while cleaning house for her family 's landlord , Anna used the phone to call a battered women 's shelter in Mt. Vernon , Ohio .
The counselors on the other end of the line did n't take her seriously .
But after a month of calls , the shelter alerted Children and Family Services Division of Knox County .
When a social worker visited Anna 's home , Anna told her about the sexual abuse .
She also reported that her parents were moving the family to Pennsylvania .
Laurie Roberts , one of the social workers on Anna 's case in Ohio , said she was taught in training that sexual abuse among the Amish is pervasive , and seldom reported .
( The problem is significant enough that the counties near Knox publish a pamphlet to educate the Amish about sexual abuse . )
Yet the county left Anna in her home .
" Oh Gosh , I wish I could get it in those C.S. people that my parents will absolutely kill me now , " Anna wrote at the time to a cousin who had left the Amish .
The social workers " say you 'll have to be hurt by them before we 'll do anything about it , " she continued .
Anna tried to run away .
But when her parents figured out where she was and called the woman who was sheltering her , Anna was sent home .
Fannie began locking Anna in her room .
The family moved to Tionesta , Pa. , where Fannie tried to get her daughter declared mentally ill .
She took Anna to a doctor who found that Anna 's eardrum had collapsed from blows to her head and seemed doubtful that the damage had been caused by buggy accidents as he'd been told .
Fannie next tried a massage therapist , Barbara Burke .
Noticing scars on Anna 's legs , Burke called Children and Youth Services in Clarion County .
On a later visit , Burke massaged Anna 's father while CYS secretly interviewed Anna in the basement .
The agency later visited Anna at her home .
But it did n't take her into protective custody .
( CYS declined to comment . )
When Fannie found out about the CYS visit , she and Anna went with 13 other kids to the home of John Yoder , an Amish dentist who lived an hour and a half away in the town of Punxsutawney .
Yoder 's living room had a recliner with a tin pan and some needles next to it .
Anna watched as the other kids each had one or two bad teeth pulled .
When it was her turn , Yoder shot some novocaine into her upper gum .
She shook her head and told him that two of her lower teeth had cavities .
He shot the lower gum , and asked Fannie which teeth should go .
Anna 's mother answered , " Take them all , " and Yoder pulled along the upper gum , along the lower gum , until every tooth was gone .
" After he had pulled the last tooth , " Anna remembered , " my mom looked at me and said , ' I guess you wo n't be talking anymore . '
" Anna bled for three days .
Her family ignored her , except to periodically hand her a drink .
She could n't talk , but that did n't matter , because Anna had nothing left to say .
At church , she looked away when other kids pointed at her mouth .
Fannie Slabaugh told me that Anna had asked for her teeth to be pulled .
But the detective who investigated the case , Trooper Michael Pisarchic , said that the other kids who went with Anna to see Yoder said that Anna was being punished .
Meanwhile , CYS was continuing to investigate .
A court date was set for the spring of 2002 .
The bishop in Anna 's district , Moses Shettler , called Barbara Burke and asked her to testify that Anna had mental problems .
Burke refused .
On the Friday before Anna was scheduled to appear in court , soon after her teeth had been pulled , Shettler and a group of elders visited Anna 's parents .
Anna said her parents threatened two days later to take her out to the woodpile , or worse , unless she told her lawyer that she took back her accusations against her brothers .
Stripped of faith in the state to protect her , Anna did as she was told .
Neither Anna 's parents nor John Yoder were ever charged with abuse .
The judge in Anna 's case allowed the younger brother to remain under Amish supervision as long as he had no contact with Anna .
But Anna said he returned home on the day of the hearing .
" They do n't believe it 's any of our business , " said Roberts , Anna 's Ohio social worker , of the Amish attitude toward child abuse investigations .
But it 's the job of social workers , police , and prosecutors to make child abuse their business .
The state 's duty to push past the barriers thrown up by parents and the community can't hinge on the religion they practice .
Its role becomes more essential , not less , when adults wall off children from the outside world .
While the authorities idled , Anna was being watched constantly .
One of her chores was taking the family 's horses out to pasture , within view of the house .
On a morning in June when the animals seemed frisky , Anna clapped her hands .
The horses scattered and she pretended to chase them , cutting across the field to a mailbox , where she dropped off a letter she 'd written to Burke .
" Are you still willing to help , or am I not welcome ? " she wrote .
" I need to get out of here . "
She asked Burke to put a message in a plastic bottle for her and leave it in a ditch by the mailbox .
Two days later , Anna spooked the horses again , and a message was waiting .
" Our arms are open to you and so are our doors , " Burke promised .
Anna burned the note with a lighter and went home .
It was her turn to make supper .
She lit the stove , began heating water , and sat down to write a letter to her family .
The sun was falling when she finished .
Anna climbed out of the kitchen window and ran .
WHEN MARY BYLER LEFT HOME , SHE THREW HER WHITE CAP onto Sam Mast 's driveway and screeched off in the car of a woman who took her in .
In the two years since , Mary has driven by her mother 's house a few times in a black Grand Prix .
" If Mary wants to get away , " Sally asked Eli 's lawyer , Greg Lunde , " why does she keep coming back ?
" When I caught up with Mary , six months after she left the Amish , she insisted that her mother and her brothers were dead to her .
But in the kitchen of the spotless trailer she rents next to Wisconsin 's La Crosse River , she could n't stop talking about them .
Cracking eggs into a mixing bowl to make sugar cookies never mind that it was after midnight she dwelt on how much Johnny , Eli , and David loved her baking .
Though Mary can't quite leave her family behind , she ran from the church and did n't look back .
She pierced her ears last March , earned a GED in April , and got a driver 's license in May .
A friend bought her the Grand Prix , and Mary paid him back on the $ 8 - an - hour salary she earns cleaning a hospital in La Crosse .
Mary took me out to her car to play a Loretta Lynn cassette .
Dressed in shorts and a tight pink T - shirt with a white angel on the front , she shifted a Doral cigarette from her right hand to her left so that she could jab more effectively at the seek button on the car stereo .
She was looking for one song : " Hey , Loretta . "
When it started , Mary jerked her head to the beat .
" Goodbye tub and clothesline , goodbye pots an ' pans , " she belted out , flinging her hair and pounding her right leg .
Her nails painted a matching pink and a silver necklace hanging from her neck , Mary did n't care how manyrules she was breaking .
She was drunk on freedom .
Ein Bekenntnis zum freien und kostenlosen Zugang zu den Ergebnissen der wissenschaftlichen Forschung hat heute Brandenburgs Ministerin für Wissenschaft , Forschung und Kultur , Johanna Wanka , abgegeben , Sie sprach zur Eröffnung der Berlin 4 Open Access Konferenz in Golm bei Potsdam .
Die Ministerin – von Haus aus Professorin für Mathematik – schränkte aber bei allem Verständnis für die Bedürfnisse der Forscher und Studenten ein , dass sie als Politikerin auch die Interessen der anderen Beteiligten im wissenschaftlichen Publikationswesen berücksichtigen müsse , weil " den Urhebern und Verwertern , also den Verlagen , dadurch Einnahmen entgehen " .
Preissteigerungen von 25 bis 30 Prozent jährlich als Folge monopolähnlicher Strukturen im wissenschaftlichen Verlagswesen könne sich allerdings auch ein reiches Land wie die Bundesrepublik nicht leisten , meinte Wanka .
" Den Versorgungsauftrag , den eine Hochschule hat , kann sie immer schwieriger erfüllen " , warnt die Ministerin vor der " Gefährdung für den volkswirtschaftlichen Standort " .
Hinzu komme , dass Wissen fast immer von der öffentlichen Hand finanziert wird .
Der Staat finanziere einen großen
Teil der wissenschaftlichen Forschung , bezahle die Gehälter der Autoren und müsse anschließend die Kosten für die Abonnements der wissenschaftlichen Zeitschriften aufbringen .
" Eigentlich bezahlen wir die Publikation dreimal " , meint die Ministerin , deshalb sei für sie eine Kostenreduktion durch Open Access Publishing " unbedingt auch im Interesse der öffentlichen Kassen " .
Von politischer Seite unterstütze sie wie auch ihre Kollegen in der Kultusministerkonferenz daher die Bestrebungen zu neuen Formen des wissenschaftlichen Publizierens wie beispielsweise die Einrichtung von Hochschulservern für die Veröffentlichungen der Universitätsforscher .
Die Qualitätssicherung der wissenschaftlichen Aufsätze durch das klassische Peer Review , das im traditionellen System die Verleger organisieren , müsse beim Open Access Publishing , wie Wanka betonte , " adäquat auch im Internet realisiert sein " .
Auf der dreitägigen Konferenz im Albert - Einstein - Institut der Max - Planck - Gesellschaft ( MPG ) diskutieren zurzeit etwa hundert Experten aus dem In - und Ausland , wie der freie Zugang zu wissenschaftlichen Informationen und Kulturgütern in die Tat umgesetzt werden kann .
Die Veranstaltung steht in der Folge der Berliner Erklärung über offenen Zugang zu wissenschaftlichem Wissen " , die im Oktober 2003 von der MPG , der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft , der Fraunhofer - Gesellschaft , der Helmholtz - Gemeinschaft und der Wissenschaftsgemeinschaft Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz initiiert wurde .
Der Berliner Erklärung haben sich inzwischen mehr als 150 Forschungseinrichtungen in aller Welt angeschlossen .

Outside the iron gates of the Iranian embassy , braced against the winter sleet in woollen caps and ankle - length chupans , hundreds of Afghan men roll out blankets and kneel towards Mecca .
At each bow the men's noses merge with the slushy grey mixture of mud , snow and sewage that covers the rutted pavements and roads of Kabul .
Their prayers are for a new life elsewhere and food for their starving families - they are queueing in the dawn 's half light to leave Afghanistan .
' I wish I had n't come back home from Iran after the Taliban left .
I had a better life there , I had occasional work at least , so I am going back . '
Zahair Mohammad stands in the line trying , with hundreds of others , to get an Iranian visa .
' I was thinking positively for a long time about rebuilding a life here in Kabul , where I was born , but I was wrong , very wrong .
It 's time to go .
I need to work abroad , like most , as a cheap labourer and send money home .
What we 're hearing on the radio about a new Afghanistan is nothing but a dream . '
He gestures at the kilometre - long queue .
' I was a refugee before and now I 'm choosing to become one again .
I 'm not alone . '
Five years after the Taliban were deposed by a US - led military alliance , Afghanistan remains entrenched in poverty .
Intense frustration with the government , particularly among refugees who returned amid promises of change , is growing .
The Observer has learnt that such is the demand among ordinary Afghans to leave that this weekend the Interior Ministry has run out of the basic materials to make passports .
According to human rights watchdogs , the huge increase in economic migrants exposes the shortcomings of Western - led reconstruction , estimated to have cost $ 8 bn ( £ 4.5 bn ) so far , failures which are disturbingly apparent in the overflowing slums of the capital , Kabul .
Hundreds of thousands may have returned from Pakistan and Iran , swelling the city 's population to more than two million , but with local unemployment running at 70 per cent there is simply no future for them .
A United Nations report concluded last year that Afghanistan remains one of the world 's least developed countries , ranking 173rd out of 178 countries surveyed .
For every 1,000 babies born in Afghanistan , 142 die before their first birthday .
An Afghan woman dies in pregnancy every half - hour .
Overall life expectancy is estimated at just under 42 years .
Three - quarters of adults are illiterate and few girls go to school .
But no problem haunts the country more than its displaced peoples - the UN estimates four million Afghans are refugees in Pakistan and Iran , and another two million are uprooted in their own country .
The total , a fifth of the population , represents the largest refugee crisis in the world .
' Refugees who returned to Afghanistan after the Taliban have become fed up with promises and not seeing much improvement practically , ' said Wadir Safi , a law professor at Kabul University .
' Millions returned hoping some brave new world awaited them , but found no work , no housing and no hope .
The billions of dollars ' worth of aid apparently given to date has made little difference to the lives of ordinary Afghans .
Now the men have no option but to leave again , in order to support their families , who must remain behind .
They may not be fleeing persecution this time , but they are escaping unimaginable poverty and can no longer sit by as their families starve . '
Last week , following a crisis conference in London , international donors , led by the US and the UK , pledged more than £ 5.9bn to Afghanistan in a wide - ranging reconstruction programme known as the Afghan Compact .
President Hamid Karzai claimed much progress had been made and the money would ensure it continues .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said : ' The transformation of Afghanistan was remarkable , but incomplete . '
In Kabul people are asking : ' What transformation ? '
In the bombed remains of Kabul 's Ministry of Energy , Nasir Salam , aged eight , skips through the mud , his jacket flapping in the wind , exposing his skinny ribs .
He is running towards a vast mound of rubbish where children are playing with kites , one of Afghanistan 's most popular pastimes , although the kites are composites of plastic bags and greasy lengths of string .
The youngsters are badly malnourished , their hair and flesh a mass of sores .
their chests wheezing .
On the road that runs parallel to the slum , their mothers congregate , dressed in filthy burqas and chadris , eyes visible through latticed slits as they bang on car windows begging for money .
Others like them had earlier caught a bus to beg in central Kabul , hoping that passing aid workers will spare a dollar .
Idle men are everywhere , standing in small groups amid creeks of raw sewage .
Nasir and his parents are among hundreds of families who have taken up residence in this abandoned compound - most were refugees , encouraged to return home from Iran or Pakistan , after the fall of the Taliban but now destitute .
The buildings where some are squatting have collapsed ceilings , but they offer some respite from the cold .
Few charities come here .
The only visitors in the past month have been officials from a government ministry who came to inspect the site and said they would evict the squatters and reclaim the land for the state .
Nasir 's father , Allahnazzar , 47 , says he would leave , if he could .
' What is there for us here ?
There are hundreds of thousands like us , perhaps millions .
There is no work .
We are squatting in the corner of a bombed building for shelter , there is no clean water and children die from disease here every month .
Many friends who were with me in Pakistan after the Taliban took power have gone back to find work as labourers .
Abroad they can work and send money back to their families to help them survive . '
In a far corner of the slum , 20 - year - old Enayatullah Khan has invited neighbours to his ' home ' for a celebration .
He is clutching his Afghan passport , empty save for an Iranian visa .
He is due to leave the next day .
' I know I will earn money in Iran , I will get work as a labourer and with spring coming I will work in the fields .
I am young , I do n't mind leaving Kabul , most of my friends have gone . '
Outside the Ministry of Interior , a cottage industry has sprung up supplying services to those who want to leave the country , from roadside photographers providing passport pictures to local people filling out forms for the illiterate .
Tariq has raised the money to buy an ancient camera and takes at least 200 passport snaps a day .
' The demand is high .
Everyone wants to go to Iran and Pakistan to work , young and old , nobody wants to stay here .
The queue for the visas is so large that the traffic police marshal it .
But what you are seeing here is the people who want to enter within the law , probably because they have been put in jail as illegal immigrants before and do n't want that again .
' Hundreds of thousands more will go over the border illegally , what other option do they have , ' he adds , pointing across the street where a group of men have monopolised a playground .
' Look at them , they are playing on a children 's roundabout , there is nothing else to do . '
According to a UK obesity expert when women move in with their man they very often put on weight as a result .
Men says Haslam are really very bad for women .
He says eating with a partner becomes a social event , where women often eat larger portions and indulge in richer foods and wines and more extravagant food .
When those factors are combined with taking the contraceptive pill or having babies , a woman 's waistline can severely suffer , says Haslam .
Dr Haslam says research shows women tend to gain weight once they cohabit and begin to share meals with men who intrinsically have higher energy needs and therefore appetites .
The weekly shopping list may change from the basic fruit and veg to include indulgent treats , and couples may go out to restaurants for meals more often .
Women also may do less exercise when they are in a relationship , skipping a trip to the gym to spend quality time with their partner .
Apparently the contraceptive they chose to use can also have an impact .
The contraceptive pill , which is taken by 3.5 million British women , has been associated with a slight weight gain among some users , on average 4lb in the first three months .
Repeated pregnancies can also lead to weight gain .
Changes in society 's attitude also means women may be less physically active than their great - grandmothers were , doing less housework thanks to technology , and getting partners to share the load or paying others to do it for them .
In the past studies have shown that married couples gain weight while those who divorce lose weight .
Dr Haslam does fortunately stress that it is important not to generalise and that being in a relationship has numerous positive influences and gains too .
He says however it is important for individuals to look at their own lifestyles and make healthy changes if they need to , as obesity has been shown to decrease life expectancy by seven years at the age of 40 .
The study is published in The Lancet medical journal .

German BMW Banned From Google
BMW.de as seen from Google :
PageRank zero and a “ sorry ” page .
From what it looks like , the German websites of car maker BMW have been kicked out of the Google index .
BMW.de at this time has a PageRank of 0 .
A search for BMW Germany , which only days ago yielded BMW . de as a top result , now does n’t show any sign of BMW . de at all .
Instead , BMW.com – BMW ’s international site – is on top for this search .
The reason for the ban is likely to be that the BMW websites have been caught employing a technique used by black - hat search engine optimizers : doorway pages .
German and international bloggers last week were quick to spread the news .
As you may know , a doorway page is stuffed full of keywords that the site feels a need to be optimized for ; however , as opposed to real pages , this doorway is only displayed to the Googlebot .
Human visitors will be immediately redirected to another page upon visit .
And that ’s exactly what happened at BMW.de , as reported Wednesday .
While BMW almost immediately removed the pages after the news broke ( after having them live for almost 2 years ) , apparently it was too late .
German BMW are now suffering what is known as the “ Google death penalty ” : a ban from almost any imaginable top search result , and a degrading of the PageRank to the lowest possible value .
Consequently , a search for gebrauchtwagen bmw , which had a page at BMW .
de as top result on Wednesday last week , now shows AutoScout 24.de as top result .
( Interestingly enough , the second result at this moment is the report on this blog . )
A search for BMW . de using Google ’s site operator does n’t yield any results , either .
( Note that sometimes , different Google data centers return different results , so this change may not yet be visible on all of Google . )
How many pages exactly are affected by this is hard to tell , but a search on Yahoo for BMW .
de returns 41,500 pages – including cached copies of many of the keyword - stuffed doorway pages , like bmw.de/bmw-kauf.html , which now return a “ file not found ” message .
Most of the pages can still be accessed from Yahoo ’s cache , while others – like a doorway page stuffed with the phrase “ BMW review ” – are missing from Yahoo ’s cache , but can still be accessed at Archive.org if you disable JavaScript .
This penalty is a good example of what can happen to sites going against the Google webmaster guidelines – no matter how big or important one might deem the site .
Google writes :
“ If an SEO creates deceptive or misleading content on your behalf , such as doorway pages or ’ throwaway ’ domains , your site could be removed entirely from Google ’s index . ”
In a nut - shell , Google ’s guidelines go back to a single philosophy : webmasters should optimize for humans , not machines , because Google does n’t like to be cheated .
The irony here is that BMW .
de is a highly inaccessible site right from the front - page : a JavaScript - only navigation prevents access by certain browsers , browser settings or media ( such as handheld browsers ) , and it also prevents search bots from effectively crawling the site .
It might well be that BMW ’s doorway pages were a reaction to the otherwise inaccessible site structure ; needless to say , the worst possible reaction .
As Mario Sixtus put it in the German Handelsblatt blog on Wednesday :
“ Such usage of SEO practices – otherwise known from porn or casino sites – are likely to add another chapter to that best - selling book , ’ The project manager ’s guide to covering up smaller errors with even bigger ones . ’ ”

This post , along with seventy - eight others , is collected in the book Utopia Is Creepy .
From the start , the World Wide Web has been a vessel of quasi-religious longing .
And why not ?
For those seeking to transcend the physical world , the Web presents a readymade Promised Land .
On the Internet , we ’re all bodiless , symbols speaking to symbols in symbols .
The early texts of Web metaphysics , many written by thinkers associated with or influenced by the post - 60s New Age movement , are rich with a sense of impending spiritual release ; they describe the passage into the cyber world as a process of personal and communal unshackling , a journey that frees us from traditional constraints on our intelligence , our communities , our meager physical selves .
We become free - floating netizens in a more enlightened , almost angelic , realm .
But as the Web matured during the late 1990s , the dreams of a digital awakening went unfulfilled .
The Net turned out to be more about commerce than consciousness , more a mall than a commune .
And when the new millenium arrived , it brought not a new age but a dispiritingly commonplace popping of a bubble of earthly greed .
Somewhere along the way , the moneychangers had taken over the temple .
The Internet had transformed many things , but it had not transformed us .
We were the same as ever .
The New New Age
But the yearning for a higher consciousness did n’t burst with the bubble .
Web 1.0 may have turned out to be spiritual vaporware , but now we have the hyper - hyped upgrade : Web 2.0 .
In a profile of Internet savant Tim O’Reilly in the current issue of Wired , Steven Levy writes that “ the idea of collective consciousness is becoming manifest in the Internet . ”
He quotes O’Reilly : “ The Internet today is so much an echo of what we were talking about at [ New Age HQ ] Esalen in the ’ 70s – except we did n’t know it would be technology - mediated . ”
Levy then asks , “ Could it be that the Internet – or what O’Reilly calls Web 2.0 – is really the successor to the human potential movement ? ”
Levy ’s article appears in the afterglow of Kevin Kelly ’s sweeping “ We Are the Web ” in Wired ’s August issue .
Kelly , erstwhile prophet of the Long Boom , surveys the development of the World Wide Web , from the Netscape IPO ten years ago , and concludes that it has become a “ magic window ” that provides a “ spookily godlike ” perspective on existence .
“ I doubt angels have a better view of humanity , ” he writes .
But that ’s only the beginning .
In the future , according to Kelly , the Web will grant us not only the vision of gods but also their power .
The Web is becoming “ the OS for a megacomputer that encompasses the Internet , all its services , all peripheral chips and affiliated devices from scanners to satellites , and the billions of human minds entangled in this global network .
This gargantuan Machine already exists in a primitive form .
In the coming decade , it will evolve into an integral extension not only of our senses and bodies but our minds …
We will live inside this thing . ”
The revelation continues :
There is only one time in the history of each planet when its inhabitants first wire up its innumerable parts to make one large Machine .
Later that Machine may run faster , but there is only one time when it is born .
You and I are alive at this moment .
We should marvel , but people alive at such times usually do n’t .
Every few centuries , the steady march of change meets a discontinuity , and history hinges on that moment .
We look back on those pivotal eras and wonder what it would have been like to be alive then .
Confucius , Zoroaster , Buddha , and the latter Jewish patriarchs lived in the same historical era , an inflection point known as the axial age of religion .
Few world religions were born after this time .
Similarly , the great personalities converging upon the American Revolution and the geniuses who commingled during the invention of modern science in the 17th century mark additional axial phases in the short history of our civilization .
Three thousand years from now , when keen minds review the past , I believe that our ancient time , here at the cusp of the third millennium , will be seen as another such era .
In the years roughly coincidental with the Netscape IPO , humans began animating inert objects with tiny slivers of intelligence , connecting them into a global field , and linking their own minds into a single thing .
This will be recognized as the largest , most complex , and most surprising event on the planet .
Weaving nerves out of glass and radio waves , our species began wiring up all regions , all processes , all facts and notions into a grand network .
From this embryonic neural net was born a collaborative interface for our civilization , a sensing , cognitive device with power that exceeded any previous invention .
The Machine provided a new way of thinking ( perfect search , total recall ) and a new mind for an old species .
It was the Beginning .
This is n’t the language of exposition .
It ’s the language of rapture .
The Cult of the Amateur
Now , lest you dismiss me as a mere cynic , if not a fallen angel , let me make clear that I ’m all for seeking transcendence , whether it ’s by going to church or living in a hut in the woods or sitting at the feet of the Maharishi or gazing into the glittering pixels of an LCD screen .
One gathers one ’s manna where one finds it .
And if there ’s a higher consciousness to be found , then by all means let ’s get elevated .
My problem is this :
When we view the Web in religious terms , when we imbue it with our personal yearning for transcendence , we can no longer see it objectively .
By necessity , we have to look at the Internet as a moral force , not as a simple collection of inanimate hardware and software .
No decent person wants to worship an amoral conglomeration of technology .
And so all the things that Web 2.0 represents – participation , collectivism , virtual communities , amateurism – become unarguably good things , things to be nurtured and applauded , emblems of progress toward a more enlightened state .
But is it really so ?
Is there a counterargument to be made ?
Might , on balance , the practical effect of Web 2.0 on society and culture be bad , not good ?
To see Web 2.0 as a moral force is to turn a deaf ear to such questions .
Let me bring the discussion down to a brass tack .
If you read anything about Web 2.0 , you ’ll inevitably find praise heaped upon Wikipedia as a glorious manifestation of “ the age of participation . ”
Wikipedia is an open - source encyclopedia ; anyone who wants to contribute can add an entry or edit an existing one .
O’Reilly , in a new essay on Web 2.0 , says that Wikipedia marks “ a profound change in the dynamics of content creation ” – a leap beyond the Web 1.0 model of Britannica Online .
To Kevin Kelly , Wikipedia shows how the Web is allowing us to pool our individual brains into a great collective mind .
It ’s a harbinger of the Machine .
In theory , Wikipedia is a beautiful thing – it has to be a beautiful thing if the Web is leading us to a higher consciousness .
In reality , though , Wikipedia is n’t very good at all .
Certainly , it ’s useful – I regularly consult it to get a quick gloss on a subject .
But at a factual level it ’s unreliable , and the writing is often appalling .
I would n’t depend on it as a source , and I certainly would n’t recommend it to a student writing a research paper .
Take , for instance , this section from Wikipedia ’s biography of Bill Gates , excerpted verbatim :
Gates married Melinda French on January 1 , 1994 .
They have three children , Jennifer Katharine Gates ( born April 26 , 1996 ) , Rory John Gates ( born May 23 , 1999 ) and Phoebe Adele Gates ( born September 14 , 2002 ) .
In 1994 , Gates acquired the Codex Leicester , a collection of writings by Leonardo da Vinci ; as of 2003 it was on display at the Seattle Art Museum .
In 1997 , Gates was the victim of a bizarre extortion plot by Chicago resident Adam Quinn Pletcher .
Gates testified at the subsequent trial .
Pletcher was convicted and sentenced in July 1998 to six years in prison .
In February 1998 Gates was attacked by Noël Godin with a cream pie .
In July 2005 , he solicited the services of famed lawyer Hesham Foda .
According to Forbes , Gates contributed money to the 2004 presidential campaign of George W. Bush .
According to the Center for Responsive Politics , Gates is cited as having contributed at least $ 33,335 to over 50 political campaigns during the 2004 election cycle .
Excuse me for stating the obvious , but this is garbage , an incoherent hodge - podge of dubious factoids ( who the heck is “ famed lawyer Hesham Foda ” ? ) that adds up to something far less than the sum of its parts .
Here ’s Wikipedia on Jane Fonda ’s life , again excerpted verbatim :
Her nickname as a youth — Lady Jane — was one she reportedly disliked .
She traveled to Communist Russia in 1964 and was impressed by the people , who welcomed her warmly as Henry ’s daughter .
In the mid-1960s she bought a farm outside of Paris , had it renovated and personally started a garden .
She visited Andy Warhol ’s Factory in 1966 .
About her 1971 Oscar win , her father Henry said : “ How in hell would you like to have been in this business as long as I and have one of your kids win an Oscar before you do ? ”
Jane was on the cover of Life magazine , March 29 , 1968 .
While early she had grown both distant from and critical of her father for much of her young life , in 1980 , she bought the play “ On Golden Pond ” for the purpose of acting alongside her father — hoping he might win the Oscar that had eluded him throughout his career .
He won , and when she accepted the Oscar on his behalf , she said it was “ the happiest night of my life . ”
Director and first husband Roger Vadim once said about her : “ Living with Jane was difficult in the beginning … she had so many , how do you say , ‘ bachelor habits . ’
Too much organization .
Time is her enemy .
She can not relax .
Always there is something to do . ”
Vadim also said , “ There is also in Jane a basic wish to carry things to the limit . ”
This is worse than bad , and it is , unfortunately , representative of the slipshod quality of much of Wikipedia .
Remember , this emanation of collective intelligence is not just a couple of months old .
It ’s been around for nearly five years and has been worked over by many thousands of diligent contributors .
At this point , it seems fair to ask exactly when the intelligence in “ collective intelligence ” will begin to manifest itself .
When will the great Wikipedia get good ?
Or is “ good ” an old - fashioned concept that does n’t apply to emergent phenomena like communal on - line encyclopedias ?
The promoters of Web 2.0 venerate the amateur and distrust the professional .
We see it in their unalloyed praise of Wikipedia , and we see it in their worship of open - source software and myriad other examples of democratic creativity .
Perhaps nowhere , though , is their love of amateurism so apparent as in their promotion of blogging as an alternative to what they call “ the mainstream media . ”
Here ’s O’Reilly : “ While mainstream media may see individual blogs as competitors , what is really unnerving is that the competition is with the blogosphere as a whole .
This is not just a competition between sites , but a competition between business models .
The world of Web 2.0 is also the world of what Dan Gillmor calls ‘ we , the media , ’ a world in which ‘ the former audience , ’ not a few people in a back room , decides what ’s important . ”
I ’m all for blogs and blogging .
( I ’m writing this , ai n’t I ? )
But I ’m not blind to the limitations and the flaws of the blogosphere – its superficiality , its emphasis on opinion over reporting , its echolalia , its tendency to reinforce rather than challenge ideological extremism and segregation .
Now , all the same criticisms can ( and should ) be hurled at segments of the mainstream media .
And yet , at its best , the mainstream media is able to do things that are different from – and , yes , more important than – what bloggers can do .
Those despised “ people in a back room ” can fund in - depth reporting and research .
They can underwrite projects that can take months or years to reach fruition – or that may fail altogether .
They can hire and pay talented people who would not be able to survive as sole proprietors on the Internet .
They can employ editors and proofreaders and other unsung protectors of quality work .
They can place , with equal weight , opposing ideologies on the same page .
Forced to choose between reading blogs and subscribing to , say , the New York Times , the Financial Times , the Atlantic , and the Economist , I will choose the latter .
I will take the professionals over the amateurs .
But I do n’t want to be forced to make that choice .
Scary Economics
And so , having gone on for so long , I at long last come to my point .
The Internet is changing the economics of creative work – or , to put it more broadly , the economics of culture – and it ’s doing it in a way that may well restrict rather than expand our choices .
Wikipedia might be a pale shadow of the Britannica , but because it ’s created by amateurs rather than professionals , it ’s free .
And free trumps quality all the time .
So what happens to those poor saps who write encyclopedias for a living ?
They wither and die .
The same thing happens when blogs and other free on - line content go up against old - fashioned newspapers and magazines .
Of course the mainstream media sees the blogosphere as a competitor .
It is a competitor .
And , given the economics of the competition , it may well turn out to be a superior competitor .
The layoffs we ’ve recently seen at major newspapers may just be the beginning , and those layoffs should be cause not for self - satisfied snickering but for despair .
Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur .
I for one ca n’t imagine anything more frightening .
In “ We Are the Web , ” Kelly writes that “ because of the ease of creation and dissemination , online culture is the culture . ”
I hope he ’s wrong , but I fear he ’s right – or will come to be right .
Like it or not , Web 2.0 , like Web 1.0 , is amoral .
It ’s a set of technologies – a machine , not a Machine – that alters the forms and economics of production and consumption .
It does n’t care whether its consequences are good or bad .
It does n’t care whether it brings us to a higher consciousness or a lower one .
It does n’t care whether it burnishes our culture or dulls it .
It does n’t care whether it leads us into a golden age or a dark one .
So let ’s can the millenialist rhetoric and see the thing for what it is , not what we wish it would be .
Biologically inspired computing arose around 20 years ago with the development of algorithms that simulate various aspects of natural processes to calculate useful results .
For instance , neural networks imitate some aspects of learning in mammalian brains to learn complex patterns ; simulated annealing simulates how metals cool into low - energy crystalline states to solve difficult minimization problems ; and genetic algorithms use abstractions of mechanisms from evolution ( selection , crossover , mutation ) to traverse large search spaces .
All have found their way into the computing mainstream , and all are regularly used in a wide range of real - world problems .
In this article , I examine a related technique that in many cases is the equal or better of existing optimization algorithms for a wide range of problems .
Ant colony optimizers ( ACOs ) model ensembles of virtual insects that cooperate on various tasks .
Remarkably , such ensembles can be used to produce answers to a range of complex problems , even though the simulated insects and the means they use to communicate are extremely simple .
For instance , ACOs are currently being used to simulate complex routing problems in telecommunications networks , where the topology of the network can vary over time .
Ant colony algorithms are closely associated with Marco Dorigo , who described the concept in his Ph.D. thesis in 1992 .
Ant colony optimization is an example of a swarm algorithm .
If you have read Michael Crichton 's thriller Prey ( HarperCollins , 2002 ) , which luridly describes swarms of semi-intelligent nanobots in competition with humans , you are familiar with some of the ideas behind this relevantly recently developed area .
In a swarm algorithm , a large number of agents cooperate to achieve a global aim without requiring any central control point .
Swarm - based systems are highly fault - tolerant because the failure of one component in a swarm does not significantly degrade the overall performance of the system .
This makes them particularly suitable for hazardous or remote environments , and the U.S. military and NASA are currently researching their use .
The US authorities have yet to comment on the case
Azar Iqbal , from Cheadle , Greater Manchester , was sent home on a plane at Atlanta last Thursday - despite officials allowing his family through .
He said he was shocked when US police allegedly saw him as a security threat as the group headed for Disneyland .
The US Department for Homeland Security told the BBC it did not comment on individual cases .
A statement for the United States Customs and Border Protection said it denied entry for " thousands of individuals every year on grounds of inadmissibility " .
Mr Iqbal said he was also told Asian people needed a special visa .
The whole experience was completely demeaning
Azar Iqbal
The incident is alleged to have taken place on the day British airports were put on alert over a reported plot to blow up several Transatlantic flights .
Mr Iqbal said after landing at Atlanta he was questioned by immigration officers who asked if he knew any of the terror suspects arrested in Britain .
He had already been cleared by airport security in Manchester before he boarded the 0900 BST Delta flight .
Mr Iqbal was travelling with his wife Rizwana and their three children Ibrahim , 5 , Murvah , 10 , and Mohin , 14 .
Mr Iqbal 's family were allowed to enter the country
He said : " It all started with the immigration man saying he wanted to ask me a couple of questions and they took me and my family to a secure area , where they quizzed me for four hours .
" They asked if I had heard about the arrests in Britain that had happened earlier that day .
They said did I know any of the people involved ?
" I was really upset and said that there was no way I would know or associate with these people .
" The whole experience was completely demeaning .
One of them even said sarcastically ' we did n't tell you to come to America on holiday ' after we complained about our treatment .
" They went through all the suitcases including the children 's belongings before telling me I was being sent back because I needed a visa despite having a British passport . "
' No documentation '
A spokeswoman for Delta Airlines said : " This is an issue which you would have to take up with the American authorities .
" Delta is not behind Mr Iqbal being refused entry into the United States . "
Mark Hunter , Liberal Democrat MP for Cheadle , said he would be writing to the Home Office and to the American embassy to ask for an explanation .
" He appears to have been turned back at Atlanta airport with no clear explanation , and he has been handed no documentation , " he said .
" All he has is a hand written note that has been entered into his passport by an official in Atlanta .
" I do n't see why our citizens should have to put up with it . "
When it comes to the profit potential of blogs , Nick Denton , founder of Gawker Media , calls himself a skeptic .
It 's a surprisingly pessimistic perspective coming from the Brit who has launched a network of 13 theme blogs – including Fleshbot ( porn ) , Gawker and Defamer ( gossip ) , Gizmodo ( gadgets ) and Wonkette ( politics ) .
His most popular properties ( Defamer , Gizmodo and Gawker ) report between 4 million and 6 million visits per month and millions more pageviews , he and his top talent have been featured in articles in the ink - and - pulp press ( Wired , The New York Times Magazine ) and Denton rarely misses an opportunity to trumpet ads on his sites for blue - chip companies like Absolut , Audi , Sony , Nike , Viacom , Disney and Condé Nast .
Media Hack
So you can forgive his competitors for not buying into his deflationary spin :
As David Hauslaib , founder of Jossip and the newly launched Queerty , put it : " Nick infamously downplays the profit potential of blogging the same way Tom Cruise 's sister - slash - publicist Lee Ann DeVette pretends his relationship with Katie Holmes is authentic .
Even people outside the industry know it 's a sham . "
Hauslaib credits part of Denton 's success to his ability to keep mainstream publishers away from his medium , guaranteeing he 'll be the biggest player when media buyers come knocking .
But Hauslaib believes there are plenty of seats left in the arena .
There could an additional handful of gossip sites to compete with Gawker ( and Jossip , for that matter ) , and ad dollars would continue to flow in .
" I 'd love to see another half - dozen professional gay blogs surface that , in theory , would compete with Queerty , " Hauslaib said , " but more importantly , they'd be validating the space and attracting even more ad dollars for everyone . "
This is a theory that Jason Calacanis – the founder of Weblogs , who Denton refers to as his " endlessly entertaining rival " – subscribes to .
Calacanis is perhaps the blogosphere 's biggest booster .
I half expect him to claim that blogs will one day provide the cure for world hunger , cancer and bad hair .
But he deserves credit for spotting a business opportunity at a time when many people viewed blogs as a digital wasteland ( complete with typos , bad grammar and lowercase letters running amok ) .
Calacanis employs 120 bloggers and publishes 90 blogs – including Engadget ( which covers consumer electronics ) and Blog Maverick , typed by billionaire entrepreneur and Dallas Mavericks ' owner Mark Cuban – with his writers making anywhere from $ 200 to $ 3,000 a month .
( One presumes Cuban does n't do it for the money . )
On average , Weblog salaries are about a quarter to half what a mid-level editorial job would pay , without the daily office commute .
" Not to mention ( bloggers ) get to write about the topic they are most passionate about , " said Calacanis , who claims to be on track to collect more than $ 1 million in Google AdSense payments over the next year .
" So , for our folks , it is like they are making money off their hobby .
Think a scuba diver or video - game player making $ 500 to $ 1,500 a month writing about scuba diving or video games . "
What do you have to do to earn $ 500 ?
Publish 125 entries a month , monitor comments , respond to readers and delete offensive comments – all for about $ 4 a post .
At least , according to a contract leaked to the internet last month .
Naturally , Denton , for one , is n't impressed with Calacanis ' wage scale ( " We pay rather more than that " ) or his business model ( " It 's easy to launch hundreds of websites , but much harder to establish brands , online as much as off " ) .
Whether you are Calacanis , Denton or Hauslaib , to create a profitable blog requires much more than a keyboard , an internet connection and too much caffeine .
You need a talented writer entertaining enough to hold an audience , a consistent publishing schedule , content worth linking to by other bloggers and worthy of press coverage , marketing savvy to sell advertising or enlist third - party networks and , as a culmination of all of this , plenty of traffic .
Says Hauslaib : " If a blog debuted with virtually zero startup costs , then it takes little to earn a profit .
One ad will do it .
But at the bare minimum , a lone blogger will likely need to attract high four - to five - figure daily visitor figures to even attempt a blog - based livable wage . "
Which led me to ask Nick Denton how much he earns from his blogs .
" We 've never gotten into the numbers , " he said .
" We 're a private company , and we prefer the focus to be on the stories ( rather ) than on the business model . "
Well , how much does he pay his bloggers ?
The amount floating around the internet is $ 2,500 a month per blogger plus traffic bonuses , courtesy of a talk Lockhart Steele , Gawker Media managing editor , gave at New York University last spring .
Denton claims that was supposed to be off the record , " which is why we have n't done any more events at NYU since .
But whatever . "
Patrick Phillips , the adjunct instructor who organized the event , supplied me with two e-mails he had sent Gawker that stipulated the talk would be tape - recorded and used as a basis for an interview to be posted on his website , I Want Media .
" The most common number quoted has indeed been $ 2,500 per month , " Denton continues , adding that it 's wrong because some writers produce more than others and get paid accordingly – " but it 's not embarrassingly wrong . "
I run some numbers by him that I picked up about his pay structure .
I say the two bloggers at Gawker earn about $ 5,000 a month .
Defamer : Between $ 7,000 and $ 10,000 a month .
Gizmodo : $ 7,000 to $ 8,000 .
And Fleshbot : $ 7,000 to $ 8,000 a month .
" Your numbers for the individual writers are particularly wild guesses , " Denton replied .
" And they are embarrassingly wrong .
If you 're making them up – nice try !
If not , you 've been misled .
Badly . "
Or there 's a third possibility .
Perhaps I 've just experienced the Denton deflationary spin machine .

Adam L. Penenberg is an assistant professor at New York University and assistant director of the business and economic reporting program in the school 's department of journalism .
Within the past two years , Oracle , IBM and Microsoft have all released freely available versions of their flagship database servers , a move that would have been unheard of just a few years ago .
While their respective representatives would argue the move was made in order to better accommodate the needs of all users , it 's fairly clear that continued pressure from open source alternatives such as MySQL and PostgreSQL have caused these database juggernauts to rethink their strategies within this increasingly competitive market .
While PostgreSQL 's adoption rate continues to accelerate , some folks wonder why that rate is n't even steeper given its impressive array of features .
One can speculate that many of the reasons for not considering its adoption tend to be based on either outdated or misinformed sources .
In an effort to dispel some of the FUD ( fear , uncertainty , and doubt ) surrounding this impressive product , instead , I 'll put forth several of the most commonplace reasons companies have for not investigating PostgreSQL further .
Reason # 1 : It does n't run on Windows PostgreSQL has long supported every modern Unix - compatible operating system , and ports are also available for Novell NetWare and OS / 2 .
With the 8.0 release , PostgreSQL 's support for all mainstream operating systems was complete , as it included a native Windows port .
Now , you can install the PostgreSQL database on a workstation or laptop with relative ease , thank to an installation wizard similar to that used for installing Microsoft Word or Quicken .
Reason # 2 : No professional development and administration tools
Most users who are unfamiliar with open source projects tend to think DB administrators manage them entirely through a series of cryptic shell commands .
Indeed , while PostgreSQL takes advantage of the powerful command - line environment , there are a number of graphical - based tools available for carrying out tasks such as administration and database design .
The following list summarizes just a few of the tools available to PostgreSQL developers : Database modeling : Several commercial and open source products are at your disposal for data modeling , some of which include Visual Case and Data Architect .
Administration and development :
There are numerous impressive efforts going on in this area , and three products are particularly promising .
pgAdmin III has a particularly long development history and is capable of handling practically any task ranging from simple table creation to managing replication across multiple servers .
Navicat PostgreSQL offers features similar to pgAdmin III and is packaged in a very well - designed interface .
A good , Web - based tool is phpPgAdmin .
Reporting : PostgreSQL interfaces with all mainstream reporting tools , including Crystal Reports , Cognos ReportNet , and the increasingly popular open source reporting package JasperReports .
Reason # 3 : PostgreSQL does n't support my language Today 's enterprise often relies on an assortment of programming languages , and if the sheer number of PostgreSQL API contributions available are any indication , the database is being used in all manner of environments .
The following links point to PostgreSQL interfaces for today 's most commonly used languages : C++ , C# , JDBC , Perl , PHP , Python , Ruby and Tcl .
Interfaces even exist for some rather unexpected languages , with Ada , Common Lisp and Pascal all coming to mind .
Reason # 4 : There 's nobody to blame when something goes wrong
The misconception that open source projects lack technical support options is curious , particularly if one 's definition of support does not involve simply having somebody to blame when something goes wrong .
You can find the answers to a vast number of support questions in the official PostgreSQL manual , which consists of almost 1,450 pages of detailed documentation regarding every aspect of the database , ranging from a synopsis of supported data types to system internals .
Proprietary vendors ' free databases : Database heavyweights IBM , Microsoft and Oracle have all recently released free versions of their products .
More information about the respective products can be found by navigating to the following links : IBM DB2 Express - C
Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2
Oracle Database 10g Express Edition
The PostgreSQL documentation is available for online perusal and downloading in PDF format .
For more help , there are a number of newsgroups accessible through Google groups , with topics ranging across performance , administration , SQL construction , development and general matters .
If you 're looking for a somewhat more immediate response , hundreds of PostgreSQL devotees can be found logged into IRC ( irc.freenode.net # postgresql ? ) .
You can plug in to IRC chat clients for all common operating systems ( Windows included ) at any given moment .
For instance , on a recent Wednesday evening , there were more than 240 individuals logged into the channel .
Waking up the next morning , I found more than 252 logged in , including a few well - known experts in the community .
The conversation topics ranged from helping newcomers get logged into their PostgreSQL installation for the first time to advanced decision tree generation algorithms .
Everyone is invited to participate and ask questions no matter how simplistic or advanced .
For those users more comfortable with a more formalized support environment , other options exist .
CommandPrompt Inc.'s PostgreSQL packages range from one - time incident support to 24x7 Web , e-mail and phone coverage .
Recently , Pervasive Software Inc. jumped into the fray , offering various support packages in addition to consulting services .
Open source services support company SpikeSource Inc. announced PostgreSQL support last summer , along with integration of the database into its SpikeSource Core Stack .
Gilbert T. Sewall , director of the American Textbook Council , a nonprofit group that monitors history textbooks , said he was not familiar with this particular incident .
But Mr. Sewall said the publishing industry had a tendency to see authors ’ names as marketing tools .
“ The publishers have a brand name and that name sells textbooks , ” he said .
“ That ’s why you have well - established authorities who put their names on the spine , but really have nothing to do with the actual writing process , which is all done in - house or by hired writers . ”
The industry is replete with examples of the phenomenon .
One of the most frequently used high school history texts is “ Holt the American Nation , ” first published in 1950 as “ Rise of the American Nation ” and written by Lewis Paul Todd and Merle Curti .
For each edition , the book appeared with new material , long after one author had died and the other was in a nursing home .
Eventually , the text was reissued as the work of another historian , Paul S. Boyer .
Professor Boyer , emeritus professor of history at the University of Wisconsin at Madison , acknowledged that the original authors had supplied the structure of the book that carries his name .
But he said that as he revises the text , he adds new scholarship , themes and interpretations .
He defended the disappearance of the original authors ’ names from the book , saying it would be more misleading to carry their names when they had no say in current editions .
“ Textbooks are hardly the same as the Iliad or Beowulf , ” he added .
Richard Blake , a spokesman for Harcourt Education , a division of Holt , said none of the editors involved in the extended use of the Todd and Curti names were still with the company .
But he said that now “ all contributors and reviewers on each edition are listed in the front of the book , ” and that naming new principal authors depended largely on the extent of their contributions .
The similarities in the Prentice Hall books were discovered by James W. Loewen , who is updating his 1995 best seller , “ Lies My Teacher Told Me : Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong . ”

“ Treatment of 9/11 and the two Iraq wars and the Florida election of 2000 are among the more important pieces of our past , ” Mr. Loewen said .
“ I think that these authors should have actually written these passages they claim to write . ”
A federal judge ruled Thursday that the government 's warrantless wiretapping program is unconstitutional and ordered an immediate halt to it .

In 1979 , Anna Diggs Taylor became the first black woman judge to be appointed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan .
Nineteen years later , she became the first black woman Chief Judge for that circuit as well .
Taylor had great difficulty obtaining her first job as an attorney for the Office of Solicitor for the U.S. Department of Labor , despite graduating form the prestigious Yale Law School in 1957 .
Very few opportunities existed for a black woman in law at this time .
In 1961 , Taylor relocated from the Washington D.C. area to Detroit , Michigan .
Here she was involved in both public and private practice until her appointment to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan , on which she continues to serve .
Taylor ’s position has enabled her to open doors for other women and minorities to pursue and achieve their dreams .
She strives for gender and racial equality in the law and currently serves on the Joint Steering Committee of the Gender and Racial Ethnic Fairness Task Forces for the Sixth Circuit .

I do not yet know anything more than what is in this AP article , but if it is accurate , it is extraordinary news -- extraordinarily good news -- on every level .
I will update this post continuously as I get more information , particularly once I get the opinion :
This is the case brought by the ACLU against the Bush administration directly .
Some background on the case is here , where I previously noted that it seemed the judge was , at the very least , intent on scrutinizing , rather than blindly accepting , the Bush administration 's claims .
This also means , presumably , that this is now the second consecutive federal court to reject the Bush administration 's invocation of the " state secrets " doctrine as a means of avoiding judicial review .
This is huge news , obviously .
More to follow .* * * I went to the CNN website to see if they had anything on this decision , and saw a bright red box at the top with urgent " BREAKING NEWS " language in it , so I naturally assumed they were reporting it .
Then I read this inside the flamboyant box : I have no doubt that infinitely more coverage will be devoted to that issue on every news program today than on the fact that a federal court just ruled that the President 's warrantless eavesdropping program is unconstitutional *
* * * The opinion is here ( .pdf ) ; the injunction order is here ( .pdf ) .
I will have analysis on this shortly .* * * * I have read the opinion .
Here is my immediate analysis of it .
It is a very strong opinion in some places , weak in others , but is rather straightforward -- and sometimes eloquent -- in its almost always unequivocal rejection of the Bush administration 's arguments : , the court rejected the administration 's assertion of the " state secrets " doctrine with regard to the NSA eavesdropping program on the ground that the program has already been publicly confirmed by the administration , and that all of the known facts necessary to rule on the plaintiffs ' claims -- namely , that the administration is eavesdropping without warrants -- are already publicly known .
The court adopted the reasoning of Judge Walker who , as noted above , rejected the administration 's invocation of this doctrine on the same ground .
( The court here did , however , grant the administration 's motion to dismiss the part of the case challenging the constitutionality of the data - mining program , on the ground that it has not yet been confirmed , and litigation of its legality would therefore require disclosure of state secrets ) . , the court ruled that the plaintiffs have standing to challenge the legality of the NSA program even though they cannot prove they have been eavesdropped on , because they have suffered actual harm merely from knowing that the Government is eavesdropping .
They all allege that they have extensive communications with the Middle East by telephone and fear that the administration is listening in without a warrant .
Some are attorneys who fear the administration is eavesdropping on their conversations with their clients and witnesses , and they allege that these clients and witnesses have ceased communicating with them openly as a result .
Thus , the court held that these plaintiffs are suffering actual harm in their ability to carry out their professional duties as a result of the administration 's warrantless eavesdropping program .
That actual harm confers on them standing to challenge the legality of the program .
The court also emphasized , in an excellent section I will quote shortly , that it is vital to our democracy that the administration 's conduct not remain beyond the reach of judicial scrutiny . , the court ruled -- rather emphatically and without much doubt -- that warrantless eavesdropping violates the Fourth Amendment 's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures ( generally speaking , searches undertaken in the absence of a probable cause warrant ) .
Citing the 1972 Supreme Court decision in the Keith case ( more on that here ) -- which held that warrantless eavesdropping is unconstitutional in the context of investigating domestic terrorist groups -- the court held ( admittedly without much reasoning or even explicit arguments ) that the same reasoning applies to make warrantless eavesdropping unconstitutional in the context of investigating international terrorist groups . , the court ruled independently -- again , without all that much reasoning -- that the NSA program violates the plaintiffs '
First Amendment rights , apparently because it chills ( deters ) their free expression .
Since the plaintiffs know the Government can eavesdrop without warrants on conversations of those groups and individuals deemed " subversive , " the program abridges free expression in a way that the First Amendment prohibits . , the court relied upon Youngstown to hold that the Executive 's powers in the national security area do not entitle him to act beyond the law or the Constitution , and that courts are empowered under our Constitution to enjoin and restrict the exercise even of national security powers , even in times of war , when the President 's conduct violates the law or the Constitution . , the court swiftly and dismissively rejected the administration 's claim that the AUMF constitutes authorization to eavesdrop in violation of FISA , noting that FISA is an extremely specific statute while the AUMF says nothing about eavesdropping .
In any event , as the court noted , since the court found warrantless eavesdropping unconstitutional , Congress could not authorize warrantless eavesdropping by statute . , the court made its scorn quite clear for the administration 's
Yoo theory of executive power because , as the court put it , " there are no hereditary kings in America and no powers not created by the Constitution . "
Citing Youngstown again , the court made clear that even in time of war , and even with regard to the President 's Commander - in - Chief powers , the President is subject to constitutional restrictions -- a proposition long unquestioned in our system of government until the Bush administration began inventing radical theories of executive power . , and really quite extraordinarily , the court ( a ) declared the NSA program to be in violation of FISA , the First Amendment and Fourth Amendment and ( b ) issued a permanent injunction enjoining the Bush administration from continuing to eavesdrop in violation of FISA .
This is not the most scholarly opinion ever .
It has argumentative holes in it in several important places .
But it is correct in its result and it is an enormous victory for the rule of law .
It took real courage for Judge Diggs Taylor to issue this Opinion and Order -- it is hard to overstate how much courage it took .
It will obviously be appealed .
But as of right now , it is illegal , according to this federal court , for the Bush administration to continue to implement its " Terrorist Surveillance Program , " and since it is grounded in constitutional conclusions , nothing -- such as Arlen Specter 's dreaded bill -- could change that .* * * * I 've heard reports that the reliably vile Rush Limbaugh is already attacking the judge personally -- she 's a Carter appointee , etc .
First , the judge who rejected the Bush administration 's attempt to have the California / AT&T litigation dismissed ( Judge Vaughn Walker ) -- on whose reasoning Judge Diggs Taylor relied -- is a Bush 41 appointee .
Secondly , the Judge 's background is extremely impressive , making it quite hard , even for the likes of Rush Limbaugh , to demonize her or demean her abilities :
One can only fathom the personal attacks that will be spewing forth against her .* * * * According to the ACLU , the Justice Department has notified them that they intend to ask the District Court Judge to stay her decision pending appeal to the Sixth Circuit ( meaning the injunction would not apply immediately , but would only be activated if the decision were affirmed on appeal ) .
Typically , with a decision of this magnitude -- particularly one that changes , rather than preserves the status quo -- a court would stay the decision .
I was surprised that she did not stay it on her own ( perhaps the Government did not ask ) .
Ordinarily , I would be inclined to think that it was almost automatic that the decision would be stayed , but given how dismissive she was of the administration 's arguments -- and how unequivocal were her conclusions that this program violates the constitutional rights of Americans -- I would n't be all that shocked if she refused to ( the administration could still then ask the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to stay the Order ) .* * * * * Let 's see what our friends in the Bush follower crowd are saying .
Legal scholar Jeff Goldstein immediately puts the spotlight on the Judge personally , and highlights " that she was married to Michigan Democratic Representative ( 1955 - 1980 ) Charles C Diggs , Jr. ( divorced 1971 ) and S Martin Taylor ( active in both the Coleman Young and Jimmy Carter campaigns ) " and that " was the first African - American woman appointed to a federal judgeship in Michigan . . . .
Taylor has used her positions to advance civil rights throughout the United States . "
He then announces that he " think (s ) this ruling will be overturned on appeal . "
And , needless to say , included in the first 10 comments is a plea that the President defy the order , along with a call for the judge to be drowned .
Ace of Spades is so beside himself that he seems sadly deflated ; he merely dutifully launches the two standard Bush smears at the Judge , but without much feeling -- he doubts she " takes terrorism seriously " and he " question (s ) her sanity . "
Writing on Michelle Malkin's blog , Mary Katherine Ham also focuses on the Judge 's background , quoting a Detroit Free Press profile which describes her as " a liberal with Democratic roots and defended civil - rights workers in the South in the 1960s . "
The article ( and Ham ) point out , however , that " people who know her say she will follow the law -- not her politics -- in deciding the case ... "
And this is what National Review Corner readers learned about this decision :
It 's a " Terrorist - Friendly ruling " from a " Carter appointee . "
So , so far we have - ( 1 ) the Judge was appointed by Jimmy Carter ; ( 2 ) the Judge is African - American and works on " civil rights " matters ; ( 3 ) she is insane ; ( 4 ) she does not take terrorism seriously ; ( 5 ) this is a victory for the terrorists ; ( 6 ) President Bush should defy the Order .
That 's a predictable enough beginning , but the smear machine is going to have to work a little harder , because that is not all that impressive of an attack so far .
I recommend the Free Press profile -- read that and decide if her abilities and fairness can be legitimately demonized .* * * * More pro-Bush reaction is compiled here , including this from Jawa Report ( " lets hope the first bomb that comes here is dropped on this judges head " ) and this from Debbie Schussel ( " She seems to hate America and fairness almost as much as the Plaintiffs do " ) .
And some nice race - based smearing can be found by Gateway Pundit here ( her husband was a Congressman whose " district included downtown Detroit and some of the city 's poorest neighborhoods .
He was the first chairman of the Congressional black Caucus " ) .
That 's really relevant .* * * * Let 's resoundingly clear up two widely disseminated misconceptions , the first of which is being quite deliberately tossed around : (1) Even with this Order , the Bush administration .
They just have to do so with approval of the FISA court -- just like all administrations have done since 1978 , just as the law requires , and just as they did when eavesdropping as part of the surveillance they undertook on the U.K. terror plot .
(2) The court 's ruling that warrantless eavesdropping violates the Fourth and First Amendments clearly means ( although the decision is far from a model of clarity ) that Congress cannot authorize warrantless eavesdropping with legislation , which would preclude enforcement of the Specter bill .
This is clearest when the court rejects the administration 's argument that the AUMF implicitly authorized violations of FISA .
The court ruled that : ( a ) the AUMF cannot be read to amend FISA , but that ( b ) even if it could be so read , it would not matter , because Congress cannot authorize an unconstitutional program :
Op. at 39 ( emphasis added ) .
If Congress is not empowered to authorize this program through the AUMF ( because the program is unconstitutional ) , then there is no good argument as to why the Specter bill can .

Editor 's Note :
The first installment of a series of stories on Golden Gate Bridge suicides , which appeared Sunday , contained material that had appeared in the Oct. 13 , 2003 , edition of the New Yorker magazine .
The story should have attributed quotations from Ken Baldwin of Angels Camp and Marin County Coroner Ken Holmes to the magazine .
It also used language nearly identical to that of the magazine to describe the California Highway Patrol 's decision to halt the official count of suicides at 997 and to describe the unofficial 1,000th death .
*****
One - thousand , two - hundred eighteen dead .
The lives of families devastated .
Sixty - eight years of debate about a suicide barrier .
Today , The Chronicle begins a seven - part series looking at the darker side of the Golden Gate Bridge .
The conclusion is inescapable : A suicide barrier would prevent deaths .
Golden Gate Bridge district directors voted in March to authorize a $ 2 million feasibility study , which has not yet been fully funded .
The stories this week provide the context , background , meaning and a human dimension for the decisions that will follow .
We take it for granted -- those of us who spend our lives here .
But the potency of the Golden Gate Bridge , in its symbolism and beauty , is probably unmatched by any other urban structure in the world .
On those halcyon afternoons when fog threads the bridge 's harp strings and suspension cables , when clouds settle over the East Bay hills and the sun catches diamonds in the bay , this greatest of vistas exhibits itself proudly : tawny hills of Marin , shimmering bulk of Angel Island , raw beacon of Alcatraz and the lazy , Mediterranean contours of San Francisco .
This is the view , on a good day , that greets the suicide before he jumps -- a panorama enthralling in its harmony of land , sea and sky .
Even when the cooling fog blunts the view , the vast majority of jumpers take their last step facing east instead of west toward the Pacific .
The Golden Gate Bridge is the world 's No. 1 suicide magnet , in part because it makes suicide so easy .
People jump and kill themselves there , an average of 19 a year .
In the peak year , 1977 , there were 40 suicides .
Some dive not expecting obscurity or oblivion but a kind of grace -- a welcoming body of water that inducts the jumper into nature .
" I 'd heard the water just sweeps you under , " Ken Baldwin of Angels Camp in Calaveras County , who survived his jump in 1985 , told the New Yorker magazine .
In fact , there 's nothing peaceful in a jump from the bridge .
Once a person dives , depending on where he or she jumps , the body plummets 240 to 250 feet in four seconds , traveling about 75 mph , and hits the water with the force of a speeding truck meeting a concrete building .
Some die instantly from extensive internal injuries ; others drown in their own blood .
The jump is fatal 98 percent of the time .
The Chronicle 's research indicates that at least 1,218 suicides were reported between the time the bridge opened , on May 27 , 1937 , and this past Friday .
Local mental health experts believe that number could be higher , considering the suicides who jump and go undetected , their bodies floating out to sea .
Three to 1 , they 're men , according to a recent study by the Psychiatric Foundation of Northern California that compiled Marin County coroner 's reports from January 1995 to July 2005 .
Eighty - seven percent are Bay Area residents -- exploding the myth that people flock from around the world to die here .
They range from 14 to 85 , with an approximate median age of 41 .
Some leave suicide notes ; most do n't .
An estimated 26 jumpers have survived , according to San Francisco Suicide Prevention and the Marin County coroner .
Beyond those numbers , it 's difficult to draw a collective profile .
The first jumper , on Aug. 7 , 1937 , was Harold Wobber , a World War I veteran .
Wobber turned to a stranger on the walkway -- saying , " This is as far as I go " -- and took his last step .
Robert Byther , a 27 - year - old Navy veteran , flew from Virginia to San Francisco in December 1980 specifically to jump off the bridge to protest the election of Ronald Reagan as president .
Filomeno De La Cruz , 33 , celebrated Thanksgiving with relatives in 1993 , then walked his 2 - year - old son along the bridge .
Around 5 p.m. , De La Cruz lifted the child from his stroller , grasped him in his arms and jumped over the guardrail .
" He was going through a divorce and custody fight , " a homicide inspector said at the time .
Weldon Kees , 40 , was a poet and filmmaker who produced KPFA 's radio show " Behind the Movie Camera . "
Kees parked his 1954 Plymouth Savoy at the bridge parking lot on July 18 , 1955 , left his keys in the ignition and disappeared .
His body was never recovered .
Fifty years later , Jonathan Zablotny , a senior at International High School , took his life .
" Overall he had more reasons to be happy than to kill himself , " wrote Zablotny 's friend Patrick Fitzgerald in a letter to the bridge district board .
" He told no one and left no note .
All we know is that he left for school Tuesday morning and never got there .
That afternoon he was dead . "
Tho the dark be cold and blind ,
Yet her sea - fog 's touch is kind ,
And her mightier caress
Is joy and the pain thereof ;
And great is thy tenderness ,
O cool , grey city of love !
Poet George Sterling wrote those words in 1923 , and the late Chronicle columnist Herb Caen was fond of quoting the last line .
Sterling 's words effuse romantic notions of San Francisco , its generous spirit and the " tenderness " of its residents .
In a city defined by loss and impermanence -- settled by gold speculators , razed by earthquake and fire , notorious as an open port where anything goes -- Sterling found forgiveness and redemption , a balm for loneliness .
We like to feel good about where we live -- to believe that San Francisco retains its warmth and charitable heart .
But the " cool , grey city of love " has for 68 years neglected an epidemic of death .
Whereas officials at the Eiffel Tower , Empire State Building and other suicide landmarks recognized a crisis and erected suicide barriers , the Golden Gate Bridge still offers a welcome mat to someone in search of a quick exit .
We sense the tragedy but view it in the abstract , rationalizing the deaths with a laissez - faire attitude : " They have a right to end their lives if they choose . "
During the months of reporting on this series , the majority of people interviewed voiced this sentiment , often in glib terms .
" If they did n't have the Golden Gate Bridge , they 'd just kill themselves another way . "
Jose Maldonado , associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford , says suicide " is one of those things people do n't talk about , especially when it has to do with matters of pride , especially with people in your own family .
That can be extrapolated to society at large .
People in San Francisco do n't want to talk about suicide in their own city . "
Denial is powerful .
San Franciscans joke about bridge suicides in the offhand way we poke fun at a losing ball team or a scandal - tinged public official .
The suicides themselves are vaguely perceived .
In the '90s , a suicide club was formed to predict the exact date that the 1,000th suicide would jump to his or her death .
As the death toll approached , a local disc jockey promised a case of Snapple to the victim 's family .
In June 1995 , trying to stem the countdown fever , the California Highway Patrol halted its official count at 997 .
In early July , Eric Atkinson , 20 , became the unofficial thousandth .
His body was never found after witnesses saw him jump .
Richard Seiden , a suicidologist and professor emeritus of behavioral science at UC Berkeley , remembers a greeting card he found in a gift shop .
On the outside was a pen-and - ink drawing of the bridge .
On the inside , this sentiment : " Do n't jump to conclusions ! "
In 1978 Seiden published a study of 515 people who were prevented from jumping off the bridge .
He found that only 6 percent went on to kill themselves .
Seiden , now retired , has written of the bridge 's " mystical allure " for suicides -- its combination of beauty , lethality , romance and efficiency .
That allure , complex and ultimately mysterious , can be broken down into five factors .
ACCESSIBILITY
For Eve Meyer , executive director of San Francisco Suicide Prevention and a passionate advocate for a suicide barrier , accessibility is the biggest factor in making the bridge a magnet for death .
" It 's something you can accomplish relatively easily , " she says , " and that 's what makes it so dangerous . "
The railing is 4 feet high , and the parking lot is a short distance from the bridge .
Within two to five minutes of parking one 's car or getting off a bus , one can dive over the railing .
No need to buy a gun or to stash pills ; none of the bother of hanging or asphyxiation .
Says Meyer , " It 's almost like saying , ' If you 're a failure , you can always do this . ' "
In his original plans , chief engineer Joseph Strauss considered the bridge 's potential as a suicide site and designed railings 5 1/2 feet high .
On May 7 , 1936 , a year before the opening of the bridge , Strauss boasted to the San Francisco Call - Bulletin that the bridge was " practically suicide - proof . "
" The guard rails , " he was quoted as saying , " are five feet and six inches high and are so constructed that any persons on the pedestrian walk could not get a handhold to climb over them .
The intricate telephone and patrol systems will operate so efficiently that anyone acting suspiciously would be immediately surrounded .
Suicide from the bridge is neither possible nor probable . "
By the time the bridge opened a year later , Strauss ' promise had evaporated .
It 's unclear when the plans were modified , but at some point architect Irving Morrow , originally hired to design the entryways and bridge plazas , went to work on the guardrails .
Morrow reduced them to 4 feet , and in doing so created a stage for decades of self - slaughter .
Today , after seven failed campaigns to pressure the Golden Gate Bridge , Highway and Transportation District into building a suicide barrier , the bridge remains a nearly foolproof method for suicide .
One of this year 's fatalities , Lois Anne Houston , was 75 and overweight , but even for her the 4 - foot rail was no deterrent .
" Some people already have the Golden Gate Bridge in their mind , in the same way others have a gun in the closet , " says Kay Redfield Jamison , professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and author of a noted book on the psychology of suicide , " Night Falls Fast : Understanding Suicide . "
" The particular place or means of suicide is obviously highly idiosyncratic , but it 's a function of what 's available . "
FINALITY
Suicides have a special language .
Like carpenters they want to know which tools .
They never ask why build .
-- from the Anne Sexton poem " Wanting to Die "
Marissa Imrie was a straight - A student at Santa Rosa High School when she jumped off the bridge in December 2001 .
After her death , Marissa 's mother , Renee Milligan , looked on her computer and found that Marissa had researched a Web site on suicide .
She also had bought a book , Geo Stone 's " Suicide and Attempted Suicide : Methods and Consequences , " and learned that a jump from the bridge is far deadlier than suicide methods typically favored by women and girls : Poison is 15 percent effective ; drug overdose , 12 percent ; wrist cutting , 5 percent .
On Amazon.com , a customer review describes Stone 's book as " a cookbook .
But instead of teaching you how to make a souffle or Peking Duck , it has recipes for death . "
Poison , drugs and wrist slashing are all potentially fatal , but in each case there 's a window of time in which victims are open to second thoughts .
With death imminent , their lives might seem more valuable or the cost of their death to family and friends too high .
So they call 911 , a friend or a relative .
With a leap from the bridge , second thoughts are useless .
Although some suicides and suicide attempts are carried out with ambivalence -- they 're a cry for help , a desperate plea for acknowledgment -- there are those who want only to die .
In such cases , the belief that one method of suicide is especially deadly can bring comfort .
" The amount of pain and suffering that leads up to suicide is very hard for people to grasp who have n't been very profoundly depressed , " says Jamison , who once made a suicide attempt and later described it in her 1995 book , " An Unquiet Mind : A Memoir of Moods and Madness . "
" It 's just so incredibly painful .
People are really desperate .
And one aspect of that desperation is really wanting to die and have a very final way . "
THE WERTHER EFFECT
In January 1933 , two classmates from a Tokyo school jumped into Mount Mihara , an active volcano on the Japanese island of Oshima .
Weeks later , six more leaped into the volcano .
Soon tourists were gathering to witness the suicides , which totaled 140 that year , 160 the next .
Barriers were erected ; it 's no longer a suicide destination .
" Various places develop a reputation as suicide landmarks , " says suicidologist Seiden .
" Hanging trees and lovers ' leaps and places like the Golden Gate Bridge start to get a notoriety .
They develop a self - propelling momentum . "
In 1974 , sociologist David Phillips gave a new name to suicide contagion .
He called it the Werther effect , taking the name from " The Sorrows of Young Werther , " an 18th century German novel by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe .
The story of a young man 's suicide by pistol after a failed romance , " Sorrows " inspired a rash of copycat suicides -- many of whom dressed for death in the style of the novel 's tragic hero -- until the book was banned in several countries .
Newspaper and media accounts are believed to contribute to the Werther effect , which is why The Chronicle stopped reporting each Golden Gate Bridge suicide more than 20 years ago .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Association of Suicidology issued guidelines urging the media to downplay the suicides .
Marin County Coroner Ken Holmes said he went to the local media when the number approached 850 .
" We weaned them , " Holmes told the New Yorker magazine .
But , he added , " the lack of publicity has n't reduced the number of suicides at all . "
The Eiffel Tower in Paris , the Empire State Building in New York , the Arroyo Seco Bridge in Pasadena and the Bloor Street Viaduct in Toronto were notorious suicide magnets until barriers were erected .
Tellingly , when a suicide barrier was appended to the Bloor Street Viaduct -- after 480 deaths in 85 years -- people did n't drift to another bridge and create a new suicide magnet .
" When suicide becomes difficult , " Meyer says , " people do not switch to another method .
They tend to get help .
This is what happened in England when the formula for gas ovens was changed " -- carbon - monoxide levels were reduced -- " and it became harder for people to purchase certain over - the - counter drugs .
The suicide rate went down .
England has a suicide rate half the size of ours because they 're so aggressive about it . "
GRANDEUR
Mark Finch , 33 , was a tall , high - strung Englishman living in San Francisco .
Stylish , gifted and chronically depressed , he was in the process of coming off the antidepressant Effexor when he jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge on Jan. 14 , 1995 .
When he died , having left his leather briefcase on the bridge 's pedestrian walkway and a number of suicide notes on his office desk , his friends were stunned .
Jenni Olson , his co-director at the San Francisco International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival , recently made a film , " The Joy of Life , " that deals in part with Finch 's suicide and the bridge 's long legacy of death .
Why the bridge and not another form of suicide ?
" Of course , given his personality , I just thought , ' Oh , how Mark ' that it would be so spectacular .
He does n't do anything in a small way , " Olson said .
She sent copies of her film to the bridge 's board of directors , and believes it influenced the members ' decision in March to explore the possibility of a suicide barrier .
" The Joy of Life , " which played at the Castro Theatre in June , was shot on a 16 mm film stock that renders colors in rich , saturated tones and provides physical evidence of the bridge 's grandeur .
Filmed from below to emphasize its massive bulk and from a distance to capture its elegant Art Deco design and spectacular natural setting , the bridge looks iconic -- staggeringly beautiful .
It 's difficult to imagine another man-made structure so perfectly conformed to a setting of exquisite natural beauty .
" There is a kind of form to it , a certain grace and beauty , " a suicide survivor once told David Rose , a psychiatrist at UCSF Medical School .
" There 's something aesthetically pleasing about it , " said S.I. Hayakawa , the onetime president of San Francisco State who became a U.S. senator in 1976 .
Alfred Hitchcock capitalized on the bridge 's allure -- and dramatically enriched its mythology -- when he staged a powerful scene in his 1958 thriller , " Vertigo , " nearby .
Kim Novak , playing the mysterious Madeleine , drops rose petals into the bay at Fort Point -- under the shadow of the giant bridge .
Suddenly she jumps in and , in a sweeping gesture of movie - star heroism , Jimmy Stewart dives into the turbulent water and carries out the soaking Novak in his arms .
When glamour and beauty are required for a death site , the Golden Gate Bridge can't be topped .
For those who select it for suicide , says Jamison , there 's an attraction in " seeing for the last time something that is truly beautiful .
Perhaps doing it in a very beautiful , spectacular , dramatic way adds meaning to something that otherwise does n't have as much meaning as one would like . "
The beauty factor is perplexing , Jamison says , because most suicides occur in ordinary places : garages , attics , subway or train platforms .
" They 're not anything associated in any way with beauty .
To me it 's quite unusual in suicide literature .
Of course , it 's a very small percentage of suicides that jump from the bridge .
But there is a quality to it that is very haunting . "
JOINING THE HERD
Suicide is taboo in most world cultures -- perceived as a sin and affront to God , a callous rebuke to one 's family , the ultimate in ingratitude .
In America , suicide is often disdained , just like the depression that triggers it , as a lack of moral fiber .
" People think depression is like having lung cancer , " says Stanford 's Jose Maldonado . " ' You did it to yourself .
If you were n't so weak , you 'd pull yourself up by your bootstraps . ' "
In 1959 , a Chronicle story on the " enigma " of bridge suicides quoted East Bay psychiatrist Malcolm A. Sowers : " When someone jumps from that bridge , he is , in a way , joining all those who went before .
And that 's important , I believe , because even in suicide , people do n't like to be too far removed from the herd . "
Seiden of UC Berkeley dismisses that notion .
" Most of the people who are suicidal are so wound up in themselves , so depressed and so unable to see beyond the tip of their nose that the idea of becoming part of this larger congregation would n't really appeal to them .
They 're really stuck in one place , sort of glued into the fact that there 's no hope for them , no future , no alternatives .
They get a kind of tunnel vision . "
Perhaps the bridge 's necrology of suicide is tied to the city 's tradition of tolerance and nonjudgment , if not connected , as well , to the notion of San Francisco as a city of transplants , people who migrate from other parts of the country to find comfort and acceptance .
Once the seeker reaches land 's end , the gateway to the Pacific , does he find what Jack Kerouac called the city 's " end of continent sadness " ?
Finding that San Francisco is like any place -- short on miracles , incapable of erasing the past -- does he give up , believing he 's used his last option ?
There are no simple answers .
Jenni Olson conjectures that suicides choose the Golden Gate Bridge in part to spare their friends and family the horror of discovering their bodies .
By jumping off the bridge , and leaving the dirty work to the Coast Guard rescuers and coroners , Olson said , a suicide removes one major aspect of trauma for the survivors .
Whatever the elements that impel a person to jump off the bridge , it 's important to remember that every suicide is marked by irrationality .
" Suicide is a closed world , with its own irresistible logic , " wrote critic and novelist A. Alvarez in " The Savage God , " a response to the suicide of a friend , poet Sylvia Plath .
" Everything makes sense and follows its own strict rules ; yet , at the same time , everything is also different , perverted , upside down . "
The majority of suicides , Jamison wrote in " Night Falls Fast , " are people suffering from major depression , bipolar disorder or schizophrenia .
Often they 've gone off their medication ; in many cases drugs and alcohol exacerbate their disorders .
Divorce , reversal of fortune , disease or other crises can precipitate suicide , but these conditions are rarely unaccompanied by underlying mental disorders .
Immediate circumstances can inflame the suicidal mind , Alvarez writes , but " they are like a trivial border incident which triggers off a major war .
The real motives which impel a man to take his own life are elsewhere ; they belong to the internal world , devious , contradictory , labyrinthine , and mostly out of sight . "
In his landmark book on depression , " Darkness Visible , " William Styron described his illness as " a howling tempest in the brain , " " an unnameable tide that obliterated any enjoyable response to the living world . "
Plath , dead at 30 after sticking her head in a gas oven , described the quality of her despair as " owl 's talons clenching my heart . "
For a personality in crisis , the accessibility of the Golden Gate Bridge can be the tipping point between life and death .
" It 's like leaving a row of bottles of poison in front of a baby , " says Meyer of San Francisco Suicide Prevention .
" And they 're all pretty and have bows on them . "
The majority of bridge suicides are preventable , she says , because so many are impulsive .
Strangely , the greatest stumbling block in the building of a suicide barrier is the attitude of a population that prides itself on open - mindedness .
" I had someone come up to me as I was walking to some hearings and he said , ' They should put up a diving board so those people can jump off it . '
I said , ' Now say to me , " They should put up a diving board so my son could jump off of it . " ' "

6 International schools in Jakarta exclude teaching and learning activities inside the school .
The policy for holidays is the authority of the school as an effort to prevent the spread of the Corona COVID - 19 virus .
“ That the virus is spreading , so if it is suspected at the school that the potential is indeed medically it must be 14 days ( holiday ) with two days in control , ” said jokowi as president of Indonesian
Based on data from the Department of Education , international schools that are on holiday include ACG School , Mentari School , Cikal , Beacon Academy , Taipe School and JIS .
There are foreign teachers and students in international schools .
This makes the school worried about the spread of the Corona virus in their environment .
“ Most of the international schools are even foreigners .
So they urgently decided to go home learning under the supervision of teachers with the assistance of parents , so there …

ITHACA , N.Y . --
Tippy tulips ?
Droopy daffodils ?
Try giving them a jigger of gin .
A Cornell University horticulturist has found that giving some potted plants diluted alcohol stunts the growth of leaves and stems but does n't bother the blossoms .
That 's a good thing , if you do n't want the flowers to get so tall they flop over .
You can use whiskey , vodka , gin or tequila -- or even plain ethanol if you happen to have it .
But wine and beer do n't work .
The booze has to be diluted with water to a concentration of four tosix percent alcohol .
William Miller , director of Cornell 's Flower Bulb Research Program , reported his findings in the April issue of Hort - Technology , a peer - reviewed journal .
Miller 's study focused on paperwhite narcissus and other daffodils but he 's also had promising results with tulips .
If you want to try it , add one part 80 - proof liquor to seven parts water .
Wait until daffodil shoots are several inches tall before applying the diluted booze .

This is a fantastic program !
Easy to use , plenty of options to tinker with , and fantastic results .
It even runs well on Linux with Wine ( I 'm using a Lenovo U260 with an Intel i5 processor and Linux Mint 11 to make that assessment ) .
There is only one bug that I can find -- the multiprocessor algorithm stops all sectors when one of the processors finishes its task , leaving the image with one computed sector and ( $number_of_processors - 1 ) incomplete sectors .
The single - processor algorithms , however , are quite satisfactory .

What is DADVSI ?
The DADVSI ( roughly " Author Rights and other Rights in the Information Society " ) is the French transcription of the European EUCD ( European Union Copyright Directive ) text , which itself is very similar to the American DMCA ( Digital Millenium Copyright Act ) .
The main goal of this law is to restrict the rights of digital content purchasers .
It most notably forbids them to work around technical content protection measures ( oh , by the way , it does not precisely describe was a technical content protection measure is , neither what is considered as working around ) .
Doing so , writing or publishing software allowing to do so , or even merely talking about ways to do so is illegal with this law .
On March 14th and 15th , this law was passed at the French " Assemblée Nationale " ( House of Representatives ) .
Despite the promises made by the French Ministry of Culture , this law does not protect Free Software , nor working around DRM for " legal " purposes .
Moreover , an amendment was adopted that punishes with 3 years in jail any person that would write , distribute or promote a software that is " obviously " aimed at illegal file sharing ( except if it is " only " aimed at legal sharing ) .
This amendment is nicknamed the Vivendi - Universal Amendment .
Guess why ...
VideoLAN is directly impacted , most notably for its DVD reading capability
This means that VLC will be considered as illegal in France as soon as this law is officially promulgated .
The penalty for distributing or promoting software that works around DRM is 6 months in jail and a 30 000 euros fine .
Here is a non-exhaustive list of free software that are impacted :
VLC ( reads DVD , works around iTunes DRM )
Mplayer ( reads DVD )
Totem ( reads DVD )
More generally , any free software DVD player
Bittorent ( P2P , could be used for illegal sharing )
e Mule and all its variants ( P2P , could be used for illegal sharing )
Sharpmusique ( works around iTunes DRM )
FairTunes ( works around iTunes DRM )
Any software that works around any DRM , either on music files or others

The French website eucd .
info collects a large number of related articles and documentation , and has a dedicated English - speaking section .
We would like to thank all the people who are working on spreading information about DADVSI , most notably EUCD .info .
We also thank the MPs who have tried to raise attention on the dangers of this text and who have tried ( but failed ) to limit its nefarious effects .
Français , ceci vous concerne directement .
La loi DADVSI ( Droits d'Auteur et Droits Voisins dans la Société de l'Information ) est la transcription en droit français de la directive EUCD ( European Union Copyright Directive ) , qui est elle même inspirée du DMCA ( Digital Millenium Copyright Act ) américain .
L'effet principal de ce texte est de restreindre fortement les droits des particuliers achetant des produits culturels .
DADVSI s'oppose ainsi directement à l'exception de copie privée en autorisant les producteurs de contenu à mettre en place des mesures techniques ( DRM ) l'interdisant , et surtout en interdisant aux acquéreurs de contourner ces mesures .
( La loi ne définit toutefois pas précisément ni la notion de mesure technique de protection , ni la notion de contournement ) .
Contourner une mesure de protection , écrire ou diffuser un logiciel permettant de la contourner , ou faire connaître des moyens de le faire sont considérés comme illégaux dans le cadre de cette loi .
Les éléments principaux de cette loi ont été adoptés les 14 et 15 mars 2006 à l'Assemblée Nationale par une grande partie de la majorité UMP .
Malgré les promesses et les dénégations du Ministre de la Culture , M. Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres , cette loi ne protège en aucun cas le Logiciel Libre ni le contournement des DRM à des fins d'usage licite d'une oeuvre légalement acquise .
De plus , un amendement , surnommé Amendement Vivendi-Universal a été adopté .
Celui - ci punit de 3 ans de prison et 300 000 euros d'amende toute personne développant , distribuant , faisant la promotion , ou parlant d'un logiciel " manifestement " destiné au partage illicite de fichier ( à l'exception des logiciels uniquement destinés au partage légal ) .
Cette loi concerne directement VLC , notamment pour ses capacités à lire les DVD
Dès la promulgation de cette loi en France , VLC sera considéré comme illégal , et les développeurs et distributeurs passibles de 6 mois de prison et 30 000 euros d'amende .
Voici une liste non-exhaustive de logiciels libres touchés par ces mesures :
VLC ( lecture de DVD , contournement des DRM iTunes )
Mplayer ( lecture de DVD )
Totem ( lecture de DVD )
Plus généralement , tous les lecteurs de DVD libres
Bittorent ( logiciel de P2P , pouvant ê tre utilisé pour du partage illégal )
e Mule et toutes ses variantes ( logiciels de P2P , pouvant ê tre utilisés pour du partage illégal )
Sharpmusique ( contournement des DRM iTunes )
FairTunes ( contournement des DRM iTunes )
Tout logiciel qui contournerait les DRM , que ce soit sur des fichiers musicaux ou autres

Was ist DADVSI ?
Die DADVSI ( grob übersetzt " Autorenrechte und andere Rechte in der Informationsgesellschaft " ) ist die französische Umsetzung des europäischen EUCD - Textes ( European Union Copyright Directive ) , welcher dem amerikanischen DMCA ( Digital Millenium Copyright Act ) recht ähnlich ist .
Das Hauptziel dieses Gesetzes ist die Rechte der Käufer digitaler Inhalte einzuschränken .
Insbesondere verbietet es ihnen technische Schutzmechanismen zu umgehen .
( dabei weder definiert , was eine technische Kopierschutzmethode ist , noch was als Umgehung betrachtet wird )
Dies zu tun , Software zu entwickeln oder zu verffentlichen , die dies ermöglicht oder sogar nur über Möglichkeiten zu sprechen , wird mit diesem Gesetz illegal werden
VideoLAN ist davon direkt betroffen , insbesondere wegen der Fähigkeit , DVDs zu lesen .
Dies bedeutet , dass VLC in Frankreich als illegal angesehen werden wird , wenn das Gesetz offiziell verabschiedet ist .
Die Strafe für das Vertreiben oder Bewerben von Software , die DRM umgeht , wird 6 Monate im Gefängnis und eine Geldstrafe über 30.000 Euro betragen .
Hier eine unvollstndige Liste von betroffener freier Software :
VLC ( liest DVDs , umgeht das DRM von iTunes )

The Quantum Mechanics of Users
People have commented that " creating passionate users " means nothing more than " listening to users like we always have -- DUH ! "
But if it were that simple , we 'd all be producing -- and using -- products and services that people love .
That meet real needs .
That fulfill real desires .
That help people kick - ass .
How , then , to explain the Grand Canyon - sized gap between what users really want and what we so often produce as a direct result of our sincere listening ?
Maybe the physics is wrong ...
Light can behave as a wave , until you ask it to explain how it got from point A to point B , in which case it can behave as a particle .
In other words , asking light to explain itself can change the very nature of how we perceive it .
And this notion that sometimes " observing an event changes the event " comes up in many areas of quantum physics .
But it 's not just the subatomic world that gets weird when you look too closely -- in some cases , asking a user to explain his choices changes his choices !
In his book Blink , Malcolm Gladwell ( author of The Tipping Point ) gives an example where students were asked to rank order 44 different kinds of strawberry jams .
When compared with the rankings of experts , the students did fairly well -- " even those of us who are n't jam experts known good jam when we taste it . "
But -- and here 's where it gets weird -- when the students were asked in advance to provide not just the rankings but a written explanation of their choices , the student rankings lost virtually all correlation with that of the experts .
As Gladwell puts it , " By making people think about jam , [ the researchers ] turned them into jam idiots . "
Think about that when you 're asking for user feedback whether as focus groups , user questionnaires , or even usability testing ( although the implications are different for each of these things ) .
So how can we hope to learn anything about what our users want and need if the very act of answering a question could change their answer ?
We have to get better at making inferences from what we observe without intervention .
We have to get to the spirit of what we observe , rather than focusing on the specific details .
We have to reconize that what they do says much more than what they say , especially when they 're not saying anything at all .
Readers here left some great comments about this on my earlier Listening to users post :
Tim said :
The comments about listening to what the users are saying , what they 're not saying , and how it 's being said reminds me of the quote by Claude Debussy , " Music is the silence between the notes . "
And Matthew Moran said :
It is not that we should not listen to clients / users but we should not let their limited understanding of what is possible , limit where the solution / software / project can go .
It is important to listen and draw additional information into the open .
In this way , we can discover what is truly desired but never contemplated from the client 's perspective .
Paulo Eduardo
Neves said :
Gilberto Gil , a great brazilian musician and the country current minister of culture , has a verse that says : " The people knows what they want , but the people also wants what they do n't know " .
Eric Stephens offered this link great post from Mark Hurst on Customer Research that includes :
" In our non-directed listening labs , we ask customers to use the Internet in the way they normally use it at home or work .
While we do have a goal for the research , we try to let the customers lead us to the answer , rather than the other way around . "
And Stu Max made it simple :
I guess that 's how I 'd wish you would reframe your point :
You 've always got to listen to your users , but sometimes you 've got to listen beyond the words .
In addition to listening to users , we should observe them as a wildlife photographer or naturalist would -- in the users native habitat , from a distance , with as little intervention as possible .
We have to look for the whys based on the whats of their behavior .
And when we do ask questions , the questions should be not just on specific behaviors ( " why did you do it that way ? " ) but also ( perhaps more importantly ) about what they value at an abstract level ( " what does it mean to you to be using [ whatever ] in your [ work / life ] ?
How does it help you in ( or prevent you from ) kicking ass ? " )
This does n't mean we should n't sweat the details -- down to the last interface pixel , book font , metal finish , or drum beat .
It all matters .
And much of it can come from questioning users directly .
The trouble is that this is where we tend to spend nearly all of our " listen to users " effort .
We field complaints , solicit feedback , and accept customer requests .
In other words , we focus on the trees and miss the forest .
Why not become " user naturalists " and find out what really makes our users inspired / frustrated / motivated / hopeless / passionate ?
Maybe the best way to find out what they need and want from our product ( or from a future product we hope to develop ) is by asking about something other than the product .
Maybe they say they 're satisfied with our product ( or the category of products in which ours belongs ) , but we need to ask if they 're satisfied with the very nature of what they 're using our product for .
Maybe asking about their favorite hobbies -- the things they are passionate about -- can help shine a light toward a new feature or capability ( a new slider ) we had n't previously imagined .
One that nobody ever associated with this type of product or service .
While we can still ask why they chose the blue button , we must understand that if we tell them in advance that they 'll need to explain their choice , that knowledge could change the outcome .
It might cause them to click the blue button when they would have clicked the green one !
When you collapse the wave function , make sure that what you get is not simply what you caused by looking . : )

" Schrodinger 's Kittens " is a good book that deals with the waveform / particle duality of light and the wacky phenomenon of " the act of observation changes the outcome . "
It gets weirder than you think - if you dig this type of stuff Kathy check out " The Holographic Universe " too for another mind - blowing read .
You are right on with this analogy as it relates to querying users .
I do n't remember the strawberry jam example from Blink but the one he gave that really resonated with me was the experiment in which they asked college students to pick a poster they wanted for their dorm room .
Almost everyone opted for abstract art .
Then the experimenters conducted the same exercise only they asked the students to explain their choice .
The result was that nearly everyone ended up picking these lame posters with kittens and rainbows and crap - the kind of stuff you find in a doctor 's office .
Their justifications were responses like " because they 're cute and remind me of this time when blah blah " ( the theory is that they were subconsciously contriving those answers in realtime to apparently gain the approval of the experimenter ) .
And the true test then came with the satisfaction poll they conducted later that year ( because the students actually had to live with the poster they chose ) .
The ones that had to explain their choice ended up _hating_ their posters .
The minute you try to dissect a gut decision you 've thwarted the " thinslicing " from occurring and disarm your instinct .
Consistent with this research , using non-interfering usability studies would seem to promise the best means to get true feedback on software and web apps .
good stuff kathy .

I remember an exercise that swatch did when they first came out ; organising a display in a hotel foyer , then picking people off the street to ask which watch design they 'd choose if they were getting one that day .
The market researcher duly noted the persons choice .
On the way out , they were asked to " just take one watch off the other stand on the way out to keep as a thankyou for participating " .
Which all did .
The two stands were identical .
However , the watches chosen for the research and which were taken were completely different ...
I think it 's " Say 's law " that suggests you 'll never know the facts until you ship something .
Market research and people have a habit of not mixing too well !

Kathy ,
One reason I 'm so big on the use of personas , scenarios and storyboarding in Web design is that I see and feel something " missing " in the process of _only_ observing , asking , listening and thinking about what users do .
C.S. Lewis ( of Narnia fame ) wrote something very interesting in his essay , " Myth Became Fact " ( found in his collection , _God in the Dock_ .
Forgive the long quote because he says it so much better than I could :
" Human intellect is incurably abstract ...
Yet the only realities we experience are concrete -- this pain , this pleasure , this dog , this man .
While we are loving the man , bearing the pain , enjoying the pleasure , we are not intellectually apprehending Pleasure , Pain or Personality .
When we begin to do so , on the other hand , the concrete realities sink to the level of mere instances or examples : we are no longer dealing with them , but with that which they exemplify .
This is our dilemma -- either to taste and not to know or to know and not to taste -- or , more strictly , to lack one kind of knowledge because we are in an experience or to lack another kind because we are outside it .
As thinkers , we are cut off from what we think about ; as tasting , touching , willing , loving , hating , we do not clearly understand .
The more lucidly we think , the more we are cut off ; the more deeply we enter into reality , the less we can think .
You can not _study _
Pleasure in the moment of the nuptial embrace , nor repentance while repenting , nor analyse the nature of humour while roaring with laughter ...
" Of this tragic dilemma , myth is the partial solution .
In the enjoyment of a great myth , we come nearest to understanding as a concrete what can otherwise be understood only as an abstraction . "
Whew .
Well , I take this a bit further than Lewis .
Given that our minds are wired for story , I believe stories can be a bridge between knowledge and experience .
While watching , asking , listening to our users , we are removed from their experience .
Lewis might say we 're in the world of abstract thought and thus cannot fully understand what the user is experiencing .
My " partial solution " are personas , scenarios and stories based upon the findings of my user analysis .
I obsessively and dutifully gather all I can directly from users and let it stew in my mind .
At some point , imagination kicks in .
The abstract data begins to emerge in narratives that can take the form of personas , scenarios or stories about the user experience of the project I 'm working on .
As I work these stories out , they help me " enter into " the users ' experiences more fully than I could by producing a mere report or PowerPoint of my findings .
And stories are more powerful ways to communicate those findings to the project team .

A couple of these thoughts are echoed in agile programming - the idea of user stories , and the reality of getting * something * no matter how small , but which is of some use , into their hands - because that 's when what they REALLY want starts to come out , and also when what they did n't know they wanted is teased out .

Great points ( as always ) .
What you are describing is termed ethnography by anthropoligists .
Ethnography is a method of studying and learning about a person or group of people .
Typically , ethnography involves the study of a small group of subjects in their own environment .
Rather than looking at a small set of variables and a large number of subjects ( " the big picture " ) , the ethnographer attempts to get a detailed understanding of the circumstances of the few subjects being studied .
Ethnographic accounts , then , are both descriptive and interpretive ; descriptive , because detail is so crucial , and interpretive , because the ethnographer must determine the significance of what she observes without gathering broad , statistical information .
Clifford Geertz , whose thoughts about culture are excerpted in the Other Important Definitions of Culture , is famous for coining the term " thick description " in discussing the methodology of the ethnographer .

I 'm finding that my anthropological knowlege is actually benefiting my IT carreer -- after all anthropology is the study of humans , and users are human .
It somtimes helps me to fill in the gap between what users say they want , and what they actually need to accomplish their goals .
Ric 's comment about " teasing out " what users did n't know they wanted is right on target .
To me , it 's analogous to unpicking embroidery - slow careful examination of the puzzle - but in reverse !

Amazing .
Not even a hint of the word ' empathy ' .
Is this really about creating passionate users ?
By observing them like some weird wildlife species ?
I thought we 've already made some progress in that field ( like , putting yourself in your user 's shoes ) .
But no , no mention of any empathy .
It 's a bleedin ' shame !

It is interesting to me that although we couch our verbiage in scientific analysis and the Graeco - Romans used allegorical language that many times the message is the same as it has been for centuries .
In the legend of Eros ( Cupid ) and Psyche - Everything is fine with Psyche 's marriage until she decides to examine her husband .
While Eros represents unthinking desire - Psyche represents objective analysis .
When Psyche attempts to use objective analysis to examine unthinking desire ( allegorically she lights an oil lamp to gaze upon her husband ) - unthinking desire is lost through examination .
As long as the students were asked which Strawberry Jam they prefered the answers they gave reflected their Desire without Analysis ( Eros ) but as soon as students were asked to apply Psyche ( objective analysis ) , Desire ( eros ) is lost .
Bulfinch 's rendering of the Psyche and Eros story is available at : http://www.bulfinch.org/fables/bull11.html

I do n't know how you continue to keep producing such super content .
This discussion reminded me of a brief set of guidelines my partner wrote for conducting surveys .
It boils down to asking people what they 've DONE vs asking them what they 'd do ?
It 's never the same thing .
The guidelines are available among the freebies at http://www.wizardacademypress.com/goodies.asp
Just scroll about 2 /3rds of the way down the page and look for the guy with the binoculars .
Keep up the great work !

I have to agree with Dave about the " superb content " .
The problem you describe , Kathy , relates to why it is so difficult for executives to appreciate the value of market research .
Since most people are themselves consumers , they think they are already experts on the market .
Since anyone can listen to customers , most people consider themselves qualified market researchers .
Yet listening to customers is not enough .
Asking questions is n't enough .
You have to ask the right questions in the right way .
Often the questions you ask are n't the questions you ultimately want answered ( see http://cauvin.blogspot.com/2005/08/framing-survey-questions.html).
And in some cases you 're better off with the ethnographic approach you mention , in which you observe without disturbing or asking any questions .

the thing is that no one really knows what want .
that takes way too much time and introspection to figure out .
so what people do is they look around and see what everyone else is doing and wanting and then use that instead because it feels like something they would want too .
basically desire is appropriated instead of created because its just too damn hard otherwise .
this is why there are some people who look deep into the structure and usability of things in order to come up with things to make life easier on the folks that have better things to do and cant be bothered .
a big problem comes when you look so deep that you forget that other people do not .
so the things that you might find valuable in the depths end up being extraneous to those on the surface because your point of view is skewed .
the hardest thing is to bring both of these perspectives together in a meaningful productive way .

I 've had quite pleased users through the give and take of an iterative design process .
But I 've only had screamingly orgasmic users when giving them what they 've asked others for repeatedly .

The big yammer these days in the United States is to the effect that globalisation is here to stay : it 's wonderful , get used to it .
The chief cheerleader for this point of view is Thomas Friedman , columnist for the New York Times and author of The World Is Flat .
The seemingly unanimous embrace of this idea in the power circles of America is a marvellous illustration of the madness of crowds , for nothing could be further from the truth than the idea that globalisation is now a permanent fixture of the human condition .
Today 's transient global economic relations are a product of very special transient circumstances , namely relative world peace and absolutely reliable supplies of cheap energy .
Subtract either of these elements from the equation and you will see globalisation evaporate so quickly it will suck the air out of your lungs .
It is significant that none of the cheerleaders for globalisation takes this equation into account .
In fact , the American power elite is sleepwalking into a crisis so severe that the blowback may put both major political parties out of business .
The world saw an earlier phase of robust global trade run from the 1870s to a dead stop in 1914 .
This was the boom period of railroad construction and the advent of the ocean - going steamship .
The great powers had existed in relative peace since Napoleon 's last stand .
The Crimean war was a minor episode that took place in backwaters of Eurasia , and the Franco - Prussian war was a comic opera that lasted less than a year - most of it the static siege of Paris .
The American civil war hardly affected the rest of the world .
This first phase of globalisation then took off under coal - and - steam power .
There was no shortage of fuel , the colonial boundaries were stable , and the pipeline of raw materials from them to the factories of western Europe ran smoothly .
The rise of a middle class running the many stages of the production process provided markets for all the new production .
Innovations in finance gave legitimacy to all kinds of tradable paper .
Life was very good for Europe and America , notwithstanding a few sharp cyclical depressions and recoveries .
Trade boomed between the great powers .
The belle époque represented the high tide of hopeful expectations .
In America , it was called the progressive era .
The 20th century looked golden .
It all fell apart in 1914 .
Historians are still baffled about what really brought on the first world war .
What did France or Britain really care about Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand , heir to the throne of a country already in deep eclipse ?
There were no active contests over territory at the time , not even in the Asian or African colonies .
And yet the diplomatic failures of that fateful summer led to the great slaughter of the trenches , the death of a substantial portion of the younger generation , and a virtual nervous breakdown of authority in politics and culture .
It would take a depression , fascism , and a second world war to resolve these issues and a new round of globalisation did not ramp up again until the mid-1960s .
It may be significant that the first collapse of globalisation occurred as the coal economy was transitioning into an oil economy , with deep geo-political implications for who had oil ( America ) and those who might seek to control the other major region closest to Europe that possessed it ( then the Caspian , since Arabian oil was as yet undiscovered ) .
The first world war was settled by those nations ( Britain and France ) that were friendly with the greatest producer of oil most readily accessed .
Germany was the loser and again in the reprise for its poor access to oil .
Japan suffered similarly .
We are now due for another folding up of the periodic global trade fair as the industrial nations enter the tumultuous era beyond the global oil production peak , which I have named the long emergency .
The economic distortions and perversities that have built up in the current era are not hard to see , though our leaders dread to acknowledge them .
The dirty secret of the US economy for at least a decade now is that it has come to be based on the ceaseless elaboration of a car - dependent suburban infrastructure - McHousing estates , eight - lane highways , big - box chain stores , hamburger stands - that has no future as a living arrangement in an oil - short future .
The American suburban juggernaut can be described succinctly as the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world .
The mortgages , bonds , real estate investment trusts and derivative financial instruments associated with this tragic enterprise must make the judicious goggle with wonder and nausea .
Add to this grim economic picture a far - flung military contest , already under way , really , for control of the world 's remaining oil , and the scene grows darker .
Two - thirds of that oil is in the possession of people who resent the west ( America in particular ) , many of whom have vowed to destroy it .
Both America and Britain have felt the sting of freelance asymmetrical war - makers not associated with a particular state but with a transnational religious cause that uses potent small arms and explosives to unravel western societies and confound their defences .
China , a supposed beneficiary of globalisation , will be as desperate for oil as all the other players , and perhaps more ruthless in seeking control of the supplies , some of which they can walk to .
Of course , it is hard to imagine the continuation of American chain stores ' manufacturing supply lines with China , given the potential for friction .
Even on its own terms , China faces issues of environmental havoc , population overshoot , and political turmoil - orders of magnitude greater than anything known in Europe or America .
Viewed through this lens , the sunset of the current phase of globalisation seems dreadfully close to the horizon .
The American public has enjoyed the fiesta , but the blue - light special orgy of easy motoring , limitless air - conditioning , and super - cheap products made by factory slaves far far away is about to close down .
Globalisation is finished .
The world is about to become a larger place again .

Just a few years ago , World Trade Organisation officials used to act hurt when described by social activists as irresponsible , secretive bureaucrats who trampled over national sovereignty and placed free trade over the environment or human rights .
But that was when the global - trade policeman ruled on disputes that had little bearing on Europeans .
The WTO court 's latest ruling will greatly increase the number of people who believe the organisation needs radical reform , if not burial .
This week three judges emerged after years of secret deliberation to rule that Europe had imposed a de facto ban on GM food imports between 1999 and 2003 , violating WTO rules .
The court also ruled that Austria , France , Germany , Greece , Italy and Luxembourg had no legal grounds to impose their own unilateral import bans .
" Europe guilty ! " shouted the US press .
" This is glorious news for the Bush administration , " said one blogger .
Actually , the judges said much more , but in true WTO style no one has been allowed to know what .
A few bureaucrats in the US , EU , Argentina and Canada have reportedly seen the full 1,045 - page report , and an edited summary of some of its conclusions has been leaked .
But no one , it seems , will take responsibility for the ruling , which may force the EU to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to compensate some of the world 's most heavily subsidised farmers , and could change the laws of at least six countries that have imposed GM bans .
In fact the US has mostly won a lot of new enemies .
Rather than going away , as the biotech companies and Washington fervently hoped , the opposition to GM foods seems to have been growing since 2004 when the case was brought to the WTO .
Europe , its member states and its consumers all rejected the ruling last week , making the WTO look even more out of touch and incompetent to rule on issues about the environment , health and consumer choice .
The European commission , which has been trying to force GM crops into Europe over the heads of its member states , says the ruling is " irrelevant " because its laws have already been changed .
Meanwhile , individual countries who dislike being told what to eat or grow by the EC as much as the WTO say they will resist any attempts to make them accept GM .
In the past few days Hungary has declared that it is in its economic interests to remain GM - free , and Greece and Austria have affirmed their total opposition to the crops .
Italy has called the WTO ruling " unbalanced " and Poland 's prime minister has pledged to keep the country GM - free .
Local government is even more opposed : more than 3,500 elected councils in 170 regions of Europe have declared themselves GM - free .
There is little the WTO , the EC or the US can do in face of this coalition of the unwilling .
If the US again tries to impose its GM products on Europe - as it did in the 90s , sparking the whole debacle - the attempt will backfire .
Europe 's biotech industry may now try to force the EC to use the WTO judgment to get the six countries with import bans to repeal anti-GM laws , but it will meet an even broader , more determined movement .
In fact , Washington and the US companies are not that bothered by Europe 's predictable reaction .
Europe has all but dropped off the world 's GM map .
The companies and the supermarkets know there is little or no demand for GM crops , and that Europe 's subsidised farmers are reluctant to alienate the public further by growing them .
It is now clear that the real reason the US took Europe to the WTO court was was to make it easier for its companies to prise open regulatory doors in China , India , south - east Asia , Latin America and Africa , where most US exports now go .
This is where millions of tonnes of US food aid heads , and where US GM companies are desperate to have access , buying up seed companies and schmoozing presidents and prime ministers .
More than two - thirds of exported US corn now goes to Asia and Africa , where once it went to Europe .
As the Monsanto man said this week about the WTO ruling : " Our feeling is that it 's important for countries other than the EU to have science - based regulatory frameworks . "
Like the tobacco industry , GM companies are now focusing almost exclusively on developing countries .
But here the industry is meeting stiff opposition from powerful unions and farming groups .
Brazil has caved in , but Bolivia may shortly become the first Latin American country to fully reject GM .
Some Indian states are deeply opposed , and there have been major demonstrations in the Philippines , Korea , Indonesia and elsewhere .
India 's largest farmers ' organisation this week said the result of the WTO verdict would be that the US would become more aggressive in dumping GM food on to developing countries .
The US maintains that through the WTO it has won a great victory for free trade , and passed a significant milestone in US attempts " to have GM crops accepted throughout the world " .
Perhaps , but the battle is far from won , and in the meantime anyone opposing the crops is being reclassed as an enemy of America .
Within hours of the WTO decision , José Bové , the French farmer who has led European protests , arrived in New York to give an invited talk to Cornell students about GM food - and was immediately sent back to France by the US government .

The fossil teeth and jawbones of two new species of tiny monkey - like creatures that lived 37 million years ago have been sifted from ancient sediments in the Egyptian desert , researchers have reported .
They said their findings firmly establish that the common ancestor of living anthropoids — including monkeys , apes and humans — arose in Africa and that the group had already begun branching into many species by that time .
Also , they said , one of the creatures appears to have been nocturnal , the first example of a nocturnal early anthropoid .
The researchers published their discovery of the two new species — named Biretia fayumensis and Biretia megalopsis — in an article in the October 14 , 2005 , issue of the journal Science .
First author on the paper was Erik Seiffert of the University of Oxford and Oxford University Museum of Natural History .
Other co-authors were Elwyn Simons and Prithijit Chatrath of Duke University , William Clyde of the University of New Hampshire , James Rossie of Stony Brook University , Yousry Attia of the Egyptian Geological Museum , Thomas Bown of Erathem - Vanir Geological in Boulder , Colo. , and Mark Mathison of Iowa State University .
The research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Leakey Foundation .
Field work in Egypt was facilitated by the Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority and the Egyptian Geological Museum .
The researchers discovered the fossils over the course of the last few years at a site called Birket Qarun Locality 2 ( BQ - 2 ) about 60 miles southwest of Cairo in the Fayum desert .
BQ - 2 has only been systematically excavated for about four years , said Seiffert , in contrast to a much younger Fayum site , called L - 41 , which has been explored for the last 22 years by Simons and his colleagues .
“ BQ - 2 and surrounding localities have tremendous potential , which is exciting because they are so much older than other Fayum sites , ” said Seiffert .
“ There will certainly be much more information about early anthropoid evolution coming out of BQ - 2 over the next few years . ”
The sediments at BQ - 2 lie nearly 750 feet below those of L - 41 and were dated at around 37 million years old by measuring telltale variations in magnetic fields in the sediments due to ancient fluctuations in the earth ’s magnetic fields .
According to Simons , other anthropoids exist at BQ - 2 and will soon be described ,
The latest fossils of the new species consist of tiny teeth and jaws , whose shapes yield critical clues about the species whose mouths they once occupied .
For example , a tooth root from the species Biretia megalopsis is truncated , indicating that it had to make room for the larger eyesocket of a nocturnal animal .
“ These finds seem to indicate that Biretia megalopsis must have had very large eyes , and so was likely nocturnal , ” said Seiffert .
“ This has never been documented in an early anthropoid .
The simplest explanation is that Biretia ’s nocturnality represents an evolutionary reversal from a diurnal ancestor , but that conclusion is based solely on the probable pattern of relationships .
If down the road we find out that our phylogeny was wrong , Biretia could end up being very significant for our understanding of the origin of anthropoid activity patterns . ”
According to Simons , analyses of the teeth of the two species clearly place them as members of a group called parapithecoids , known as “ stem ” anthropoids because they constitute the species of early creatures from which the subsequent “ crown ” anthropoid line arose .
“ The finding of these parapithecoids from such an ancient time confirms that crown anthropoids — a group including all modern anthropoids — have their earliest known beginnings in Africa , ” said Simons .
“ They show that findings by other researchers of isolated examples of possible higher primate fossils in Asia do not constitute evidence of an ancestral crown anthropoid lineage there . ”
According to Seiffert , the latest findings help fill in the gap between later anthropoids and the oldest undisputed anthropoid , called Algeripithecus , found in Algeria , which lived around 45 million years ago .
That species had been characterized by only a few teeth , which precluded significant insight into the species , said Seiffert .
Seiffert also noted that previously , the only evidence for anthropoids at 37 million years ago in Africa was a single tooth , attributed to a species called Biretia piveteaui .
What ’s more , the latest discoveries of the two species suggest that a 57 - million - year - old African primate called Altiatlasius from Morocco might even be the earliest anthropoid ancestor .
From Duke University
It seems too good to be true : a new source of near - limitless power that costs virtually nothing , uses tiny amounts of water as its fuel and produces next to no waste .
If that does not sound radical enough , how about this : the principle behind the source turns modern physics on its head .
Randell Mills , a Harvard University medic who also studied electrical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , claims to have built a prototype power source that generates up to 1,000 times more heat than conventional fuel .
Independent scientists claim to have verified the experiments and Dr Mills says that his company , Blacklight Power , has tens of millions of dollars in investment lined up to bring the idea to market .
And he claims to be just months away from unveiling his creation .
The problem is that according to the rules of quantum mechanics , the physics that governs the behaviour of atoms , the idea is theoretically impossible .
" Physicists are quite conservative .
It 's not easy to convince them to change a theory that is accepted for 50 to 60 years .
I do n't think [ Mills 's ] theory should be supported , " said Jan Naudts , a theoretical physicist at the University of Antwerp .
What has much of the physics world up in arms is Dr Mills 's claim that he has produced a new form of hydrogen , the simplest of all the atoms , with just a single proton circled by one electron .
In his " hydrino " , the electron sits a little closer to the proton than normal , and the formation of the new atoms from traditional hydrogen releases huge amounts of energy .
This is scientific heresy .
According to quantum mechanics , electrons can only exist in an atom in strictly defined orbits , and the shortest distance allowed between the proton and electron in hydrogen is fixed .
The two particles are simply not allowed to get any closer .
According to Dr Mills , there can be only one explanation : quantum mechanics must be wrong .
" We 've done a lot of testing .
We 've got 50 independent validation reports , we 've got 65 peer - reviewed journal articles , " he said .
" We ran into this theoretical resistance and there are some vested interests here .
People are very strong and fervent protectors of this [ quantum ] theory that they use . "
Rick Maas , a chemist at the University of North Carolina at Asheville ( UNC ) who specialises in sustainable energy sources , was allowed unfettered access to Blacklight 's laboratories this year .
" We went in with a healthy amount of scepticism .
While it would certainly be nice if this were true , in my position as head of a research institution , I really would n't want to make a mistake .
The last thing I want is to be remembered as the person who derailed a lot of sustainable energy investment into something that was n't real . "
But Prof Maas and Randy Booker , a UNC physicist , left under no doubt about Dr Mill 's claims .
" All of us who are not quantum physicists are looking at Dr Mills 's data and we find it very compelling , " said Prof Maas .
" Dr Booker and I have both put our professional reputations on the line as far as that goes . "
Dr Mills 's idea goes against almost a century of thinking .
When scientists developed the theory of quantum mechanics they described a world where measuring the exact position or energy of a particle was impossible and where the laws of classical physics had no effect .
The theory has been hailed as one of the 20th century 's greatest achievements .
But it is an achievement Dr Mills thinks is flawed .
He turned back to earlier classical physics to develop a theory which , unlike quantum mechanics , allows an electron to move much closer to the proton at the heart of a hydrogen atom and , in doing so , release the substantial amounts of energy he seeks to exploit .
Dr Mills 's theory , known as classical quantum mechanics and published in the journal Physics Essays in 2003 , has been criticised most publicly by Andreas Rathke of the European Space Agency .
In a damning critique published recently in the New Journal of Physics , he argued that Dr Mills 's theory was the result of mathematical mistakes .
Dr Mills argues that there are plenty of flaws in Dr Rathke 's critique .
" His paper 's riddled with mistakes .
We 've had other physicists contact him and say this is embarrassing to the journal and [ Dr Rathke ] wo n't respond , " said Dr Mills .
While the theoretical tangle is unlikely to resolve itself soon , those wanting to exploit the technology are pushing ahead .
" We would like to understand it from an academic standpoint and then we would like to be able to use the implications to actually produce energy products , " said Prof Maas .
" The companies that are lining up behind this are household names . "
Dr Mills will not go into details of who is investing in his research but rumours suggest a range of US power companies .
It is well known also that Nasa 's institute of advanced concepts has funded research into finding a way of using Blacklight 's technology to power rockets .
According to Prof Maas , the first product built with Blacklight 's technology , which will be available in as little as four years , will be a household heater .
As the technology is scaled up , he says , bigger furnaces will be able to boil water and turn turbines to produce electricity .
In a recent economic forecast , Prof Maas calculated that hydrino energy would cost around 1.2 cents ( 0.7 p ) per kilowatt hour .
This compares to an average of 5 cents per kWh for coal and 6 cents for nuclear energy .
" If it 's wrong , it will be proven wrong , " said Kert Davies , research director of Greenpeace USA .
" But if it 's right , it is so important that all else falls away .
It has the potential to solve our dependence on oil .
Our stance is of cautious optimism . "
Alternative energy
Cold fusion
More than 16 years after chemists ' claims to have created a star in a jar imploded in acrimony , the US government has said it might fund more research .
Mainstream physicists still balk at reports that a beaker of cold water and metal electrodes can produce excess heat , but a hardy band of scientists across the world refuse to let the dream die .
Methane hydrates
The US and Japan are leading attempts to tap this source of fossil fuel buried beneath the seabed and Arctic permafrost .
A mixture of ice and natural gas , hydrates are believed to contain more carbon than existing reserves of oil , coal and gas put together .
Solar chimneys
Sunlight heats trapped air , which rises through a giant chimney and drives turbines .
Leonardo da Vinci designed such a power tower and the Australian company Enviromission plans to build one .
Despite being scaled down recently , the concrete chimney will still stand some 700 metres over the outback .
Nuclear fusion
Turns nuclear power on its head by combining atoms rather than splitting them to release energy - copying the reaction at the heart of the sun .
After years of arguments the world has agreed to build a test reactor to see whether it works on a commercial scale .
Called Iter , it could be switched on within a decade .
Wave generators
No longer a dead duck , the hopes of engineers are riding on bobbing floats again .
The British company Trident Energy recently unveiled a design that uses a linear generator to convert the motion of the sea into electricity .
A wave farm just a few hundred metres across could power 62,000 homes .

WE HAVE ALWAYS PROCESSED OUR FOOD ; this is an activity that is uniquely human .
We cook our food — that is one type of processing –as well as ferment , grind , soak , chop and dry .
All of these are types of food processing .
Traditional processing has two functions : to make food more digestible and to preserve it for use during times when food is n’t readily available .
Nutritious , long - lasing processed foods including pemmican , hard sausage and old - fashioned meat puddings and haggis , as well as grain products , dairy products , pickles — everything from wine and spirits to lacto - fermented condiments .
Farmers and artisans — bread makers , cheese makers , distillers , millers and so forth — processed the raw ingredients into delicious foods that retained their nutritional content over many months or even years , and kept the profits on the farm and in the farming communities where they belonged .
Unfortunately , in modern times , we have substituted local artisanal processing with factory and industrial processing , which actually diminishes the quality of the food , rather than making it more nutritious and digestible .
Industrial processing depends upon sugar , white flour , processed and hydrogenated oils , synthetic food additives and vitamins , heat treatment and the extrusion of grains .
BREAKFAST CEREALS
Let ’s look at the processing involved in the typical American breakfast of cereal , skim milk and orange juice .
Cold breakfast cereals are produced by a process called extrusion .
Grains are mixed with water , processed into a slurry and placed in a machine called an extruder .
The grains are forced out of a tiny hole at high temperature and pressure , which shapes them into little o’s or flakes or shreds .
Individual grains passed through the extruder expand to produce puffed wheat , oats and rice .
These products are then subjected to sprays that give a coating of oil and sugar to seal off the cereal from the ravages of milk and to give it crunch .
In his book Fighting the Food Giants , biochemist Paul Stitt describes the extrusion process , which treats the grains with very high heat and pressure , and notes that the processing destroys much of their nutrients .
It denatures the fatty acids ; it even destroys the synthetic vitamins that are added at the end of the process .
The amino acid lysine , a crucial nutrient , is especially damaged by the extrusion process .
Even boxed cereals sold in health food stores are made using the extrusion process .
They are made with the same kind of machines and mostly in the same factories .
The only “ advances ” claimed in the extrusion process are those that will cut cost , regardless of how the process alters the nutrient content of the product .
With so many millions of boxes of cereal sold each year , one would expect to see published studies showing the effects of these cereals on animals and humans .
But breakfast cereals are a multi-billion dollar industry that has created huge fortunes for a few people .
A box of cereal containing a penny ’s worth of grain sells for four or five dollars in the grocery store–there is probably no other product on earth with such a large profit margin .
These profits have paid for lobbying efforts and journal sponsorships that have effectively kept any research about extruded grains out of the scientific literature and convinced government officials that there is no difference between a natural grain of wheat and a grain that has been altered by the extrusion process .
THE RAT EXPERIMENTS
Unpublished research indicates that the extrusion process turns the proteins in grains into neurotoxins .
Stitt describes an experiment , conducted in 1942 by a cereal company but locked away in the company ’s file cabinet , in which four sets of rats were given special diets .
1
One group received plain whole wheat grains , water and synthetic vitamins and minerals .
A second group received puffed wheat ( an extruded cereal ) , water and the same nutrient solution .
A third set was given water and white sugar .
A fourth set was given nothing but water and synthetic nutrients .
The rats that received the whole wheat lived over a year on this diet .
The rats that got nothing but water and vitamins lived about two months .
The animals on a white sugar and water diet lived about a month .
The study showed that the rats given the vitamins , water and all the puffed wheat they wanted died within two weeks — even before the rats that got no food at all .
These results suggest that there was something very toxic in the puffed wheat itself !
Proteins are very similar to certain toxins in molecular structure , and the pressure of the puffing process may produce chemical changes that turn a nutritious grain into a poisonous substance .
Another unpublished experiment was carried out in 1960 .
Researchers at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor were given eighteen laboratory rats .
These were divided into three groups : one group received cornflakes and water ; a second group was given the cardboard box that the cornflakes came in and water ; the control group received rat chow and water .
The rats in the control group remained in good health throughout the experiment .
The rats eating the box became lethargic and eventually died of malnutrition .
The rats receiving the cornflakes and water died before the rats that were eating the box !
( The first box rat died the day the last cornflake rat died . )
Furthermore , before death , the cornflakes - eating rats developed aberrant behavior , threw fits , bit each other and finally went into convulsions .
Autopsy revealed dysfunction of the pancreas , liver and kidneys and degeneration of the nerves of the spine , all signs of insulin shock .
2
The startling conclusion of this study was that there was more nourishment in the box than in the cornflakes .
This experiment was designed as a joke , but the results were far from funny .
Most Americans eat boxed cereals today .
Because these are fortified with synthetic nutrients , the USDA can claim that they are as healthy as the grains from which they are made .
Many of these cereals contain at least 50 percent of calories as sugar .
Those sold in health food stores may be made of whole grains and fewer sweeteners .
However , these whole grain extruded cereals are probably more dangerous than their refined grain counterparts sold in the supermarkets , because they are higher in protein , and it is the proteins in these cereals that are rendered toxic by this type of processing .
THE EXTRUSION PROCESS
When we put cereals through an extruder , it alters the structure of the proteins .
Zeins , which comprise the majority of proteins in corn , are located in spherical organelles called protein bodies .
The scientific literature does contain one study on extruded grains , which investigated changes in protein body , shape and release of encapsulated alpha-zeins as a result of the extrusion processing .
3
Researchers found that during extrusion , the protein bodies are completely disrupted and the alpha-zeins dispersed .
The results suggest that the zeins in cornflakes are not confined to rigid protein bodies but can interact with each other and other components of the system , forming new compounds that are foreign to the human body .
The extrusion process breaks down the organelles and disperses the proteins , which then become toxic .
When the proteins are disrupted in this way , it can adversely affect the nervous system , as indicated by the cornflake experiment .
OLD FASHIONED PORRIDGE
There is only one way to put these companies out of business , and that is not to eat their food .
So , what are you going to have for breakfast instead of cheerios and corn flakes ?
Eggs–any style–are always a good choice .
As for grain , old - fashioned porridges made from non-extruded grains provide excellent nourishment at an economical price .
Grains such as oats should be cut or rolled and then soaked overnight in a warm , acidic medium to neutralize the many anti-nutrients naturally occurring in grains , such as irritating tannins , digestion - blocking enzyme inhibitors and mineral - blocking phytic acid .
This treatment can also gently break down complex proteins in grains .
You soak the grains in warm water plus one tablespoon of something acidic , like whey , yoghurt , lemon juice or vinegar .
The next morning , your grain will cook in just a few minutes .
It ’s best to eat your porridge with butter or cream , like our grandparents did .
The nutrients in the dairy fats are needed in order for you to absorb the nutrients in the grains .
Without the fat - soluble vitamins A , D and K 2 , you cannot absorb the minerals in your food .
Furthermore , the fats in butter and cream slow down the release of glucose into the bloodstream , so that your blood sugar remains stable throughout the morning .
MILK
Milk is one of nature ’s most perfect foods .
Most of our milk comes from a sacred animal , the cow .
Today , however , in the industrial system , we imprison cows indoors for their entire lives ; we give them inappropriate feed such as soy , bakery waste , citrus peel cake and the swill from ethanol production , foods that cows are not designed to eat .
The confinement environment and the inappropriate feed make these cows sick , so they need antibiotics and other drugs .
We breed them to give huge amounts of milk , and give them hormones to increase milk production as well .
These cows produce large quantities of watery milk with only half the amount of fat compared to milk produced by old - fashioned cows eating green grass .
Then this milk is shipped to factories for processing .
Inside the plants , the milk is completely remade .
As described by Emily Green in the Los Angeles Times , 4 centrifuges separate the milk into fat , protein and various other solids and liquids .
Once segregated , these are recombined at specific levels set for whole , lowfat and no - fat milks .
Of the reconstituted milks , whole milk will most closely approximate original cow ’s milk .
What is left over will go into butter , cream , cheese , dried milk , and a host of other milk products .
The dairy industry promotes lowfat milk and skim milk because they can make more money on the butterfat when used in ice cream .
When they remove the fat to make reduced - fat milks , they replace it with powdered milk concentrate , which is formed by high temperature spray drying .
Then the milk is sent by tanker trucks ( which are not refrigerated ) to bottling plants .
The milk is pasteurized at 161 oF for fifteen seconds by rushing it past superheated stainless steel plates .
If the temperature is 230 oF ( over the boiling point ) , the milk is considered ultrapasteurized .
This ultrapasteurized milk will have a distinct cooked milk taste , but it is sterile and shelf stable .
It may be sold in the refrigerated section of the supermarket so the consumer will think it is fresh , but it does not need to be .
The milk is also homogenized by a pressure treatment that breaks down the fat globules so the milk wo n’t separate .
Once processed , the milk will last for weeks , not just days .
Processing makes the milk difficult to digest and renders the proteins allergenic .
Animals fed pasteurized milk exclusively develop nutrient deficiencies and become infertile after several generations .
5
Fortunately , Real Milk from pasture - fed cows , milk that is not pasteurized , processed or homogenized , is becoming more widely available .
In fact , demand for Real Milk is growing rapidly .
To find Real Milk in your area , visit realmilk.com
In order to make powdered milk , fluid is forced through a tiny hole at high pressure and then blown out into the air .
This causes a lot of nitrates to form , and the cholesterol in the milk becomes oxidized .
Contrary to popular opinion , cholesterol is not a demon but your best friend ; you do n’t have to worry about consuming foods containing cholesterol , except that you do not want to consume oxidized cholesterol .
Evidence indicates that oxidized cholesterol can initiate the process of atherosclerosis .
6
Powdered milk is added to reduced - fat milks and milk products to give them body .
So , when you consume reduced - fat milk or yoghurt , thinking that it will help you avoid heart disease , you are actually consuming oxidized cholesterol , which can initiate the process of heart disease .
ORANGE JUICE
Now , let ’s turn to the orange juice , part of our “ healthy breakfast ” of cereal , lowfat milk and juice .
An article from Processed and Prepared Foods 7 describes a “ a new orange juice processing plant is completely automated and can process up to 1,800 tons of oranges per day to produce frozen concentrate , single strength juice , oil extracted from the peel and cattle feed . ”
The new method of producing juice puts the whole orange in the machine .
Another abstract states : “ Various acid sprays for improving fruit peel quality and increasing juice yield are added to these processed oranges . ”
8
These compounds are added to extract as much juice as possible , as well as the oil out of the skin .
The conventional orange crop is sprayed heavily with pesticides called cholinesterase inhibitors , which are very toxic to the nervous system .
When they put the whole oranges into the vats and squeeze them , all that pesticide goes into the juice .
Then they add acids to get every single bit of juice out of these oranges .
So commercial orange juice can be a very toxic soup .
This may be one reason that consumption of fruit juice is associated with increased rates of dementia .
9
What about the peel used for cattle feed ?
The dried , left - over citrus peel from orange juice production is processed into cakes , which are still loaded with cholinesterase inhibitors .
Mark Purdey , in England , has shown how this practice correlates with mad cow disease .
10 The use of organophosphates either as a spray on the cows or as a component of their feed , causes degeneration of the brain and nervous system in the cow , and if it ’s doing it to the cow , there ’s a possibility it may be doing it to you also .
The U.S. government tries to give the impression that pasteurization of juice is necessary to ensure our safety .
However , it might surprise you to learn that researchers have found fungus that is resistant to pressure and heat in processed juices .
They found that seventeen percent of Nigerian packages of orange juice and twenty percent of mango and tomato juices contained these heat - resistant fungi .
They also found E. coli in the orange juice ; it was pressure resistant and had survived pasteurization .
11
So there is plenty of danger from contamination in these pasteurized juices .
In one study , heat - treated and acid - hydrolyzed orange juice was tested for mutagenic activity .
The authors found that the heating process produced intermediate products which , under test conditions , gave rise to mutagenicity and cytotoxicity .
12
In other words , there were cancer - causing compounds in the orange juice .
In another study , gel filtration and high performance liquid chromatography were used to obtain mutagenic fractions from heated orange juice .
13
So if you want juice with your breakfast , avoid commercial processed orange juice .
Instead , squeeze yourself a couple of organic oranges or an organic grapefruit–in other words , process the juice yourself !
Mix that fresh juice with sparkling water and a pinch of salt for a delicious spritzer .
NATURAL NOURISHING BROTHS
In the past , many traditional cultures made use of animal bones to make broth .
They recognized the health - giving properties of bone broth as well as wonderful flavors broth gave to soups , sauces , gravies and stews .
Modern science has shown us that homemade bone broths are indeed the healing wonders of the food pharmacopia ; they provide minerals in abundance , strengthen bones and sinews , heal the gut and help us detoxify .
The gelatin in homemade bone broth is a natural digestive aid .
14
INDUSTRIAL SOUPS
Most commercial soup bases and sauces contain artificial meat - like flavors that mimic those we used to get from natural , gelatin - rich broth .
These kinds of short cuts mean that consumers are shortchanged .
When the homemade stocks were pushed out by the cheap substitutes , an important source of minerals disappeared from the American diet .
The thickening effects of gelatin could be mimicked with emulsifiers , but , of course , the health benefits were lost .
Gelatin is a very healthy thing to have in your diet .
It helps you digest proteins properly and is supportive of digestive health overall .
Research on gelatin and natural broths came to an end in the 1950s when food companies discovered how to induce maillard reactions –the process of creating flavor compounds by mixing reduced sugars and amino acids under increased temperatures–and produce meat - like flavors in the laboratory .
In a General Foods Company report issued in 1947 , chemists predicted that almost all natural flavors would soon be chemically synthesized .
15 Following the Second World War , American food companies discovered monosodium glutamate , a food ingredient the Japanese had invented in 1908 to enhance food flavors , including meat - like flavors .
Humans actually have receptors on the tongue for glutamate — it is the protein in food that the human body recognizes as meat–but the glutamate in MSG has a different configuration , which cannot be assimilated properly by the body .
Any protein can be hydrolyzed ( broken down into its component amino acids ) to produce a base containing MSG .
When the industry learned how to synthesize the flavor of meat in the laboratory , using inexpensive proteins from grains and legumes , the door was opened to a flood of new products , including boullion cubes , dehydrated soup mixes , sauce mixes , TV dinners , and condiments with a meaty taste .
The fast food industry could not exist without MSG and artificial meat flavors , which beguile the consumer into eating bland and tasteless food .
The sauces in many commercially processed foods contain MSG , water , thickeners , emulsifiers and caramel coloring .
Your tongue is tricked into thinking that you are consuming something nutritious , when in fact it is getting nothing at all except some very toxic substances .
Even dressings , Worcestershire sauce , rice mixes , flavored tofu , and many meat products have MSG in them .
Almost all canned soups and stews contain MSG , and the “ hydrolyzed protein ” bases often contain MSG in very large amounts .
So - called homemade soups in most restaurants are usually made by mixing water with a powdered soup base made of hydrolyzed protein and artificial flavors , and then adding chopped vegetables and other ingredients .
Even things like lobster bisque and fish sauces in most seafood restaurants are prepared using these powdered bases full of artificial flavors .
The industry even thinks it is too costly to just use a little onion and garlic for flavoring –they use artificial garlic and onion flavors instead .
It ’s all profit based with no thought for the health of the consumer .
Unfortunately , most of the processed vegetarian foods are loaded with these flavorings , as well .
The list of ingredients in vegetarian hamburgers , hot dogs , bacon , baloney , etc. , may include hydrolyzed protein and “ natural ” flavors , all sources of MSG .
Soy foods are loaded with MSG .
Food manufacturers get around the labeling requirements by putting MSG in the spice mixes ; if the mix is less than fifty percent MSG , they do n’t have to indicate MSG on the label .
You may have noticed that the phrase “ No MSG ” has actually disappeared .
The industry does n’t use it anymore because they found out that there was MSG in all the spice mixes ; even Bragg ’s amino acids had to take “ No MSG ” off the label .
HEALTH PROBLEMS
While the industry was adding MSG to food in larger and larger amounts , in 1957 scientists found that mice became blind and obese when MSG was administered by feeding tube .
In 1969 , MSG - induced lesions were found in the hypothalamus region of the mouse brain .
Subsequent studies pointed in the same direction .
MSG is a neurotoxic substance that causes a wide range of reactions in humans , from temporary headaches to permanent brain damage .
It is also associated with violent behavior .
We have had a huge increase in Alzheimer ’s , brain cancer , seizures , multiple sclerosis and diseases of the nervous system , and one of the chief culprits is the flavorings in our food .
16
Ninety - five percent of processed foods contain MSG , and , in the late 1950s , it was even added to baby food .
Manufacturers say they have voluntarily taken it out of the baby food , but they did n’t really remove it ; they just called it “ hydrolyzed protein ” instead .
An excellent book , Excitotoxins , by Russell Blaylock , describes how nerve cells either disintegrate or shrivel up in the presence of free glutamic acid if it gets past the blood - brain barrier .
The glutamates in MSG are absorbed directly from the mouth to the brain .
Some investigators believe that the great increase in violence in this country starting in 1960 is due to the increased use of MSG beginning in the late 1950s , particularly as it was added to baby foods .
INDUSTRIAL FATS AND OILS
The food processing empire is built on industrial fats and oils , extracted from corn , soybeans and other seeds .
Crude vegetable oil–which is dark , sticky and smelly –is subjected to horrendous processing to produce clean - looking cooking oils , margarine , shortening and spreads .
The steps involved in processing usually include degumming , bleaching , deodorizing , filtering and removing saturates to make the oils more liquid .
17 In the process , the nutrients and antioxidants disappear–but not the pesticides .
Most processors also add a hexane solvent in order to squeeze the very last drop of oil out of the seeds .
Caustic refining , the most widely used process for oil refining , involves adding very alkaline , chemicals to the oil .
In order to make a solid fat out of liquid oil , manufacturers subject the oils to a process called partial hydrogenation .
The oil is extracted under high temperature and pressure , and the remaining fraction of oil is removed with hexane solvents .
Manufacturers then steam clean the oils , a process that removes all the vitamins and all the antioxidants — but , of course , the solvents and the pesticides remain .
These oils are mixed with a nickel catalyst and then , under high temperature and pressure , they are flooded with hydrogen gas .
What goes into the reactor is a liquid oil ; what comes out of that reactor is a smelly mass resembling grey cottage cheese .
Emulsifiers are mixed in to smooth out the lumps , and the oil is then steam cleaned once more , to get rid of the horrible smell .
The next step is bleaching , to get rid of the grey color .
At this point , the product can be called “ pure vegetable shortening . ”
To make margarines and spreads , artificial flavors and synthetic vitamins are added .
But the government does not allow the industry to add synthetic color to margarine –they must add a natural color , such as annatto–a comforting thought .
The margarine or spread is then packaged in blocks and tubs and advertised as a health food .
Saturated fat is the type of fat found in such foods as lard , butter and coconut oil .
Saturated fat molecules are straight , so they pack together easily .
That is why saturated fats are solid at room temperature .
Unsaturated fats have a little bend at each double bond , with two hydrogen atoms sticking out on the same side .
And when that molecule gets incorporated into your cells , the body wants those two hydrogen atoms to be on the same side of the carbon chain , forming an electron cloud ; that is where controlled chemical interactions take place .
During the process of partial hydrogenation , one of those hydrogen atoms is moved to the other side , causing the molecule to straighten out so that it behaves chemically like a saturate — although biochemically it behaves very differently .
The original , unsaturated molecule is called a “ cis ” fatty acid , because the two hydrogens are together , and then it becomes a trans fatty acid , because the two hydrogens are across from each other ( “ trans ” means “ across ” ) .
Your body does n’t know that this new molecule is something that has never existed in nature before , and when you eat one of these trans fatty acids , it gets built into your cell membranes .
Because of the chemical rearrangement , the reactions that should happen can’t take place .
Enzymes and receptors do n’t work anymore .
The more trans fatty acids that you eat , the more partially hydrogenated your cells become and the more chaos that you are going to have on the cellular level .
All of the margarines , shortenings and even low - trans - fat spreads are made with these harmful ingredients .
They ’re used in chips and crackers , and most restaurants use them for cooking fries .
Until the early 1980s , fast food outlets and restaurants cooked the fries in tallow , which is a very safe fat , but now they use partially hydrogenated soybean oil .
In the past , when you made desserts for your kids , at least the sugar they contained came with butter , eggs , cream and nuts — all good wholesome foods .
Now manufacturers can imitate the butter , eggs , cream and nuts , so all you have is sugar , industrial oils and artificial ingredients in these instant puddings , pastries and other artificial desserts .
Many diseases have been associated with the consumption of trans fatty acids — heart disease , cancer , and degeneration of joints and tendons .
The only reason that we are eating this stuff is because we have been told that the competing saturated fats and oils — butter , lard , coconut oil , palm oil , tallow and suet — are bad for us and cause heart disease .
Such assertions are nothing but industry propaganda .
THE WESTERN PRICE
Weston A. Price , DDS , discovered that as populations adopt processed foods , with each generation the facial structure becomes more and more narrow .
Healthy faces should be broad .
We are all designed to have perfectly straight teeth and not get cavities .
When you are eating real , nutrient - dense foods , you get the complete and perfect expression of the genetic potential .
We were given a perfect blueprint .
Whether or not the body temple is built according to the blueprint depends , to a great extent , on our wisdom in food choices .
When primitive societies abandoned the traditional diet and began to eat processed foods , the next generation developed narrowed facial structure and many diseases .
We know that if you continue this diet for three generations , reproduction ceases .
This is the terrible price of the West , the Western Price .
Civilization will die out unless we embrace the food ways of our ancestors .
That means turning our backs on processed foods and getting back into the kitchen , to prepare real foods –containing healthy fats –for ourselves and our families .
OPTIMAL FOOD PREPARATION — MADE WITH LOVE
Food preparation is actually a sacred activity : According to esoteric lore , “ If a woman could see the sparks of light going forth from her fingertips when she is cooking , and the energy that goes into the food she handles , she would realize how much of herself she imbues into the meals that she prepares for her family and friends .
It is one of the most important and least understood activities of life that the feelings that go into the preparation of food affect everyone who partakes of it .
This activity should be unhurried , peaceful and happy because the energy that flows into that food impacts the energy of the receiver .
“ That is why the advanced spiritual teachers of the East never eat food prepared by anyone other than their own chelas ( disciples ) .
The person preparing the food may be the only one in the household who is spiritually advanced .
An active charge of happiness , purity and peace will pour forth into the food from him , and this pours forth into the other members of the family and blesses them . ”
18
To be healthy , we need to prepare our own food , for ourselves and our families .
This does n’t mean you have to spend hours in the kitchen , but you do need to spend some time there , preparing food with wisdom and love .
If no one in the family has time to prepare food , you need to sit down and rethink how you are spending your time , because this is the only way to get nourishing foods into your children .
We can return to good eating practices one mouth at a time , one meal at a time , by preparing our own food and preparing it properly . ∆

The suspect vessel ignored orders from the Churchill
Enlarge Image
The guided missile destroyer USS Winston S Churchill went in pursuit of a suspect vessel after receiving a report of piracy , the navy said .
When other efforts failed , the Churchill fired warning shots to bring the boat to a halt .
There have been numerous attacks by pirates off Somalia , some of the most dangerous waters in the world .
The US navy 's Fifth Fleet , which is based in Bahrain and patrols the Indian Ocean , received reports of " an attempted act of piracy " approximately 50 miles ( 80 km ) off the Somali coast on Friday , it said in a statement .
No government
The Churchill shadowed the suspect vessel , and tried to make contact over the radio , before resorting on Saturday to " aggressive manoeuvring in an attempt to stop the vessel " .
When this failed , " Churchill fired warning shots .
The vessel cut speed and went dead in the water , " the statements said .
Later an unspecified number of sailors were taken off the vessel and a quantity of small arms was recovered , the navy said .
Piracy , including hijackings and hostage - taking , has become common off anarchic Somalia , where there has been no effective central government since 1991 .
An attack late last year against a luxury cruise liner was repelled by an ear - splitting acoustic device .
Shipping companies say there have been 35 incidents of piracy off the Indian Ocean coast of Somalia in the past nine months .
The transitional Somali government has signed a $ 50 m ( £ 28 m ) two - year deal with a private US marine security company to carry out coastal patrols .
However , it is not clear where this money would come from , as the government has not effectively taken office .
The security company has not started work .
David Kelley is the executive director of The Objectivist Center , celebrated in some libertarian circles as a forum for moderate randianism .
This is what Kelley has to say about the response to the acts of terror on September 11 :
" Negotiation is an exercise of reason that civilized people use to resolve their differences .
We are not dealing with civilized people .
We must cease the policy of excusing their violence by their poverty and trying to buy them off with subsidies .
We are not dealing with people who seek such gain .
We must declare war on the terrorists and use whatever force it takes to render them incapable of posing any further threat . "
Kelley is advocating war with " whatever force it takes " against enemies who are less than human ( not " civilized people " ) .
This is the voice of the reasonable Objectivist faction .
What about the unreasonable faction ?
Leonard Peikoff  the " intellectual heir " of Ayn Rand  is the founder of The Ayn Rand Institute , the fountainhead of orthodox Objectivism .
His reaction is  unsurprisingly  similiar to Kelley 's , but even more indiscriminate .
Americas enemies , it seems , are Arabs in general :
" The Arabs embodied in extreme form every idea - selfless duty , anti-materialism , faith or feeling above science , the supremacy of the group - which our universities and churches , and our own political Establishment , had long been preaching as the essence of virtue . "
And what are Americans to do about the blatantly religious Arab altruists ?
Simple .
Kill 'em all  inflict " mass death " upon the citizens of Towelhead Nations :
" To those who oppose war , I ask : If not now , when ?
How many more corpses are necessary before this country should take action ?
The choice today is mass death in the United States or mass death in the terrorist nations . "
Many libertarians are attracted to the remnants of Aristotelian philosophy within Objectivism .
Those elements are conspicuously absent in the Objectivist proposals provoked by terrorism .
The enemy is a faceless , barely human , collective entity .
No references are made to the Just War doctrine .
They say that war brings out the best and the worst in people .
That goes for Objectivists too , and it is not a pleasant revelation for libertarians .

The Best of Milton Batiste
House Republicans called on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to prosecute businesses shut down yesterday by their illegal alien employees who took the day off to participate in protests of immigration legislation .
“ Too often , we presume that fault lies with the illegal migrant worker , but we need to recognize that the employer broke the law by hiring the illegal alien , ” wrote Republican Reps .
Jack Kingston of Georgia and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee .
“ We believe the federal government has an obligation to enforce the nation ’s immigration laws and must actively investigate any and all instances where it is apparent industries have knowingly and willingly hired those who entered this country illegally . ”
In a letter to ICE Assistant Secretary Julie Myers , Mr. Kingston and Mrs. Blackburn noted “ the multiple reports in the news media today regarding companies which have been forced to halt operations because large numbers of their employees appear to be in the United States illegally and are participating in the protest rallies . ”
“ ICE has an obligation to use this public information to enforce immigration laws , ” they wrote .
“ We respectfully request that you look into this matter and report back to us on your findings . ”
Rep . Tom Tancredo , Colorado Republican , meanwhile , observed that the “ Day Without Immigrants ” would have been a “ boon ” for taxpayers if they could have taken the day off from paying all the costs associated with the illegal alien community .
“ The activist protesters are trying to confuse the American public by lumping legal immigrants with illegal aliens , ” Mr. Tancredo said .
“ A day without legal immigrants would be a day without almost all Americans .
A day without illegal aliens , on the other hand , would be a boon to the American taxpayer . ”
He said the government pays out more than $ 10 billion annually in health care , education and incarceration costs for illegal aliens .
He also said the government may be forgoing as much as $ 35 billion in lost tax revenue to the underground labor market .
“ Americans do n’t respond well to illegal aliens who demand amnesty .
As I ’ve said before , that does n’t play well in Peoria , ” Mr. Tancredo said .
“ Every time illegal aliens and their supporters take to the streets , it drives home the point to most Americans that illegal immigration is a problem in their hometowns , and that we urgently need to get control of our borders . ”
In the Senate , Republicans introduced a resolution affirming that statements of “ national unity ” such as the national anthem should be recited or sung in English .
Sen. Lamar Alexander , Tennessee Republican and author of the resolution , said the protesters ’ message gets “ lost in translation ” when the “ Star - Spangled Banner ” is rewritten in Spanish .
“ Ours is a diverse nation , but diversity is not our greatest accomplishment , ” he said .
“ Jerusalem is diverse .
The Balkans are diverse .
Iraq is diverse .
What makes America unique is that we have taken all that magnificent diversity and turned it into one nation . ”

About shfs
Shfs is a simple and easy to use Linux kernel module which allows you to mount remote filesystems using a plain shell ( ssh ) connection .
When using shfs , you can access all remote files just like the local ones , only the access is governed through the transport security of ssh .
Shfs supports some nice features :
file cache for access speedup
perl and shell code for the remote ( server ) side
could preserve uid / gid ( root connection )
number of remote host platforms ( Linux , Solaris , Cygwin , ... )
Linux kernel 2.4.10 + and 2.6
arbitrary command used for connection ( instead of ssh )
persistent connection ( reconnect after ssh dies )
The code was originally developed as an assignment for an Operating Systems course at the Charles University , Prague .
Hilfslieferung Kenia spendet für Deutschland
Als Mitarbeiter eines Krankenhauses in Kenia davon hörten , dass auch in Deutschland arme Menschen um Lebensmittel anstehen müssen , entschlossen sie sich zu helfen .
Heute kommt in Berlin eine Kaffee - und Teespende für Hartz - IV - Empfänger an .
Notionally a leftwing movement , the Anti-Germans were born after the collapse of the Berlin wall .
While most Germans rejoiced at the end of the cold war , the Anti-Germans feared that a united Germany might lead to a fourth Reich - and a return of antisemitism .
Most of Germany 's far left has been robustly pro-Palestinian .
But the Anti-Germans have consistently championed the state of Israel - a position that has led them into bed with some very strange people .
The movement is in the unusual position of liking both Karl Marx , and that other great Karl , George Bush 's neo -conservative guru , Karl Rove .
" Er , they are a bit hard to explain , " says Rüdiger Göbel , deputy editor of the leftwing daily Junge Welt in Berlin .
" They are a typically German phenomenon .
They feel that Germany has a special historical responsibility for Israel , and that any criticism of Israel is antisemitic . "
I first came across them last year .
I was covering a demonstration of neo -Nazis protesting against the wartime destruction of Dresden by British bombers and the deaths of thousands of German civilians .
As well as shouting , " Nie wieder Deutschland " ( Never again Germany ) , the anti-Germans held up banners with the slogan : " Bomber Harris , do it again . "
They even pelted the skinheads with homemade paper aeroplanes with RAF insignia .
Another chant went : " You lost the war , you did , you lost the war , you did . "
( I left the march feeling that Germany still had , well , some issues left over from the second world war . )
Manfred Dahlmann , a leading Anti-German and contributor to the movement 's house journal , Bahamas , admits that , these days , the group has more in common with the right than the left .
There is a direct link between " Islamic " fascism and the fascism invented by the Nazis , he claims .
During the World Cup , the Anti-Germans had a hard time as millions of ordinary Germans decorated their balconies in red , gold and black flags ; even German dogs wore patriotic colours .
At this month 's pro-Israeli demo , the Anti-Germans did get to wave a flag , however .
The American one .
Do they ever have any fun ?
" We do n't have much fun , " Dahlmann concedes .
" But we are not ascetics .
We drink beer and wine " .

The men , who play British inmates at the detention camp , were returning from the Berlin Film Festival where the movie won a Silver Bear award .
One of the actors , Rizwan Ahmed , said a police officer asked him if he intended to make any more " political " films .
The men were released quickly and not arrested , said Bedfordshire police .
Inquiry
" Six people were stopped under the Terrorism Act .
This is something that happens all the time and obviously at airports and train stations , " said a spokeswoman .
" There is a heightened state of security since the London bombings .
Public safety is paramount . "
Actor Farhad Harun was also questioned , along with Shafiq Rusul and Rhuhel Ahmed , the men whose detention in Guantanamo is chronicled in the film .
The film depicts treatment meted out at the camp
Mr Ahmed also alleges that he was verbally abused by a police officer and had his mobile phone taken from him for a short period .
The actor also claims that he was told by police that he could be held for up to 48 hours without access to a lawyer .
He says he was initially questioned at the airport 's baggage pick - up area and taken to a separate room when he demanded to know why .
Human rights organisation Reprieve , who Mr Ahmed has asked to speak on his behalf , called Thursday 's incident an " ugly farce " .
Suspects
They have called for an urgent inquiry into what happened while one of the film 's producers , Melissa Parmenter , said the detention was outrageous .
Bedfordshire police have said they will issue another statement specifically concerning the allegations made by Mr Ahmed and Reprieve .
The Road to Guantanamo , directed by British film - maker Michael Winterbottom , tells the story of the Tipton Three .
The men from the West Midlands went to Pakistan to arrange a wedding and eventually found themselves at the US camp .
They were picked up in Afghanistan and believed to be terrorist suspects and were eventually released from Guantanamo Bay in 2004 without charge .
The film , shot in Afghanistan , Pakistan and Iran , was made at a cost of £ 1.5 m .
Introduction
Welcome to Virtual Dimension : a free , fast , and feature - full virtual desktop manager for Windows platform .
The main goal of this open - source project is indeed to enhance the Microsoft " Window Manager " up to the level of usual Unix Window Manager , by providing virtual desktops , as well as some additional features , like always on top , window shading ...
I guess those already used to working with any flavor of Unix and X11 have already understood the interest of such a project .
In my opinion , anybody who used it for more than a couple of minutes may find it hard to revert to a single desktop .
However , some people , most probably Windows users , may not understand what this is .
So , first of all , what is a virtual desktop ?
Simply said , a " desktop " is what you see when you run windows : the actual windows desktop , with the icons on it ; some open windows ; some minimized windows .
The main goal of the project is thus to allow working with only some of the applications visible at a time .
Later , some other windows may be visible .
The program thus allows to have a few set of applications / windows , where you can simply choose which group is visible , and switch between one group or the other .
Now , one may ask what is the interest of such a thing ?
Well , this is quite simple .
If you only have a few windows open at any time , I guess there is n't much interest .
However , if you are working with lots of applications , you desktop can easily become overcrowded : you lose time finding your windows , taskbar buttons are too small for you to read the text and find the right window , using drag and drop becomes a nightmare ...
The solution is Virtual Dimension .
Indeed , using Virtual Dimension , you could have all your chat and irc windows on one virtual desktop ; your email client and browser windows on another ; and your text editor and debugger on a third one .
This way , you only have what you need before you , yet you can easily switch to another desktop when you need to access the other applications ...
Features
Add a new dimension to your Windows environment with multiple desktops :
Unlimited number of desktops
Optional preview window , allowing to select the desktop to switch to , and to access many of the functions
Tray icon , allowing easy access to most functions without taking much place on the desktop
Specific settings for each desktop ( wallpaper , desktop background color , ...)
Ability to move a window from one desktop to the other , and to have a window be present on all desktops
Customizable shortcuts to use the application efficiently
Feeling lost with all your desktops ?
Virtual Dimension has powerful features to help you :
Assign a meaningful name to each desktop , and select a different wallpaper for each desktop .
Virtual Dimension supports BMP , JPEG , GIF , PNG , TIFF and EMF images , on all platforms , and with no speed loss ( as opposed to Active Desktop )
Each desktop can be assigned a global hotkey .
Switching to this specific desktop is now as simple a pushing a few keys
You can activate the next / previous desktop using customizable hotkeys
Optionally , you can have an OSD ( On Screen Display ) window appear whenever you switch desktop , displaying the name of the activated desktop .
The OSD appearance can be fully configured .
At your choice , ALT + TAB can present the list of all windows , or only the windows that are present on the current desktop
It is also possible to configure the application so that moving the mouse to the edge of the screen automatically switches to the neighbooring desktop
The preview window is a powerful tool which allows you to get the most out of Virtual Dimension :
Preview window displays the list of windows on each desktop
Context menu allows to access special features for each window or desktop
You can use drag and drop to simply move a window from one desktop to the other
Switching desktop is as easy as a single mouse click
Appearance can be customized with custom colors or background image
Optionally transparent preview window ( Windows 2000 / XP only )
The window docks itself to the screen borders , and be hide itself automatically after some time , in order to take as little space as possible !
( note that it can hide only if docked )
Additionally , Virtual Dimension allows you to access special features :
You can make any window be " always on top "
All windows can be made partially translucent
You now have the possibility to minimize any window to the tray
You can maximize the width or height of a window , with a single click or customizable keystroke
To work even faster , you can move a window to another desktop with only a keystroke of your choice
Virtual Dimension also allows you to easily kill any window
In order to access all those features in a more convenient fashion , and thus work faster , Virtual Dimension can optionally integrate with the shell .
This allows to access many operations with a single click , as if they were supported directly by Windows !
The system menu gets a new " Virtual Dimension " submenu , allowing to switch desktop , make a window transparent or always on top ...
If a window is setup to be minimized to tray , clicking on the minimize button will put it to the tray .
You do not need to go through Virtual Dimension for this to happen !
Shift + Maximize ( using the button or menu item ) will maximize the width of the window
Ctrl + Maximize ( using the button or menu item ) will maximize the height of the window
Shift + Close ( using the button or menu item ) will kill the window
Virtual Dimension allows you to change many settings on your applications .
Maybe you like this transparent shell .
Or you want your email client to be always visible , whatever desktop you are on .
To make your life easier , Virtual Dimension allows you to :
Save the settings you use for each kind of window
Automatically restore saved settings when the window appears , or when Virtual Dimension starts
Optionally , save / restore the size / position of your windows
Optionally , automatically save the settings as you use them ( though this feature does not always work very well ... )
Screenshots

Requirements
Virtual Dimension in action !
Where you can see :
The aim is to have the program be as portable and compatible as possible .
However , some functionalities may not be available on all platform .
Provided you got a decently recent version of Internet Explorer , it should work just fine .
The application is expected to run on Windows 98 / Me as well as NT / 2000 / XP .
It may also work just fine on Windows 95 .
Note however that transparency is only supported on Windows 2000 / XP
If you test the application , please let me know if it does not work on your platform , including a somewhat detailed description of what happens .

Using auto_ptr Effectively
This article appeared in C/C++ Users Journal , 17 ( 10 ) , October 1999 .
Most people have heard of the standard auto_ptr smart pointer facility , but not everyone uses it daily .
That 's a shame , because it turns out that auto_ptr neatly solves common C++ design and coding problems , and using it well can lead to more robust code .
This article shows how to use auto_ptr correctly to make your code safer -- and how to avoid the dangerous but common abuses of auto_ptr that create intermittent and hard - to - diagnose bugs .
Why Call It an " Auto " Pointer ?
auto_ptr is just one of a wide array of possible smart pointers .
Many commercial libraries provide more sophisticated kinds of smart pointers that can do wild and wonderful things , from managing reference counts to providing advanced proxy services .
Think of the Standard C++ auto_ptr as the Ford Escort of smart pointers : A simple general - purpose smart pointer that does n't have all the gizmos and luxuries of special - purpose or high - performance smart pointers , but that does many common things well and is perfectly suitable for regular daily use .
What auto_ptr does is own a dynamically allocated object and perform automatic cleanup when the object is no longer needed .
Here 's a simple example of code that 's unsafe without auto_ptr :
// Example 1 ( a ) : Original code
//
void f ()
{
T* pt ( new T ) ;
/*... more code ...*/
delete pt ;
}
Most of us write code like this every day .
If f( ) is a three - line function that does n't do anything exceptional , this may be fine .
But if f( ) never executes the delete statement , either because of an early return or because of an exception thrown during execution of the function body , then the allocated object is not deleted and we have a classic memory leak .
A simple way to make Example 1 ( a ) safe is to wrap the pointer in a " smarter " pointer - like object that owns the pointer and that , when destroyed , deletes the pointed - at object automatically .
Because this smart pointer is simply used as an automatic object ( that is , one that 's destroyed automatically when it goes out of scope ) , it 's reasonably called an " auto " pointer :
// Example 1 ( b ) : Safe code , with auto_ptr
//
void f ()
{
auto_ptr < T> pt ( new T ) ;
/*... more code ...*/
} // cool : pt 's destructor is called as it goes out
// of scope , and the object is deleted automatically
Now the code will not leak the T object , no matter whether the function exits normally or by means of an exception , because pt's destructor will always be called during stack unwinding .
The cleanup happens automatically .
Finally , using an auto_ptr is just about as easy as using a built - in pointer , and to " take back " the resource and assume manual ownership again , we just call release ( ) :
// Example 2 : Using an auto_ptr
//
void g()
{
T* pt1 = new T ;
// right now , we own the allocated object
// pass ownership to an auto_ptr
auto_ptr < T> pt2 ( pt1 ) ;
// use the auto_ptr the same way
// we 'd use a simple pointer
* pt2 = 12 ; // same as " * pt1 = 12 ; "
pt2->SomeFunc( ) ; // same as " pt1->SomeFunc ( ) ; "
// use get ( ) to see the pointer value
assert ( pt1 == pt2.get ( ) ) ;
// use release ( ) to take back ownership
T* pt3 = pt2.release ( ) ;
// delete the object ourselves , since now
// no auto_ptr owns it any more
delete pt3 ;
} // pt2 does n't own any pointer , and so won't
// try to delete it ...
OK , no double delete
Finally , we can use auto_ptr 's reset ( ) function to reset the auto_ptr to own a different object .
If the auto_ptr already owned an object , though , it first deletes the already - owned object , so calling reset ( ) is much the same as destroying the auto_ptr and creating a new one that owns the new object :
// Example 3 : Using reset ( )
//
void h()
{
auto_ptr < T> pt ( new T ( 1 ) ) ;
pt.reset ( new T ( 2 ) ) ;
// deletes the first T that was
// allocated with " new T ( 1 ) "
} // finally , pt goes out of scope and
// the second T is also deleted
Wrapping Pointer Data Members
Similarly , auto_ptr can be used to safely wrap pointer data members .
Consider the following common example that uses the Pimpl ( or , compiler - firewall ) Idiom : [ 1 ]
// Example 4 ( a ) : A typical Pimpl
//
// file c.h
//
class C
{
public :
C( ) ;
~C ( ) ;
/*...*/
private :
class CImpl ; // forward declaration
CImpl* pimpl_ ;
} ;
// file c.cpp
//
class C:: CImpl { /*...*/ } ;
C::C( ) : pimpl_ ( new CImpl ) { }
C::~C( ) { delete pimpl_ ; }
In brief , C's private details are split off into a separate implementation object that 's hidden behind an opaque pointer .
The idea is that C's constructor is responsible for allocating the private helper " Pimpl " object that contains the class 's hidden internals , and C's destructor is responsible for deallocating it .
Using auto_ptr , however , we find an easier way :
// Example 4 ( b ) : A safer Pimpl , using auto_ptr
//
// file c.h
//
class C
{
public :
C( ) ;
/*...*/
private :
class CImpl ; // forward declaration
auto_ptr < CImpl > pimpl_ ;
} ;
// file c.cpp
//
class C:: CImpl { /*...*/ } ;
C::C( ) : pimpl_ ( new CImpl ) { }
Now the destructor does n't need to worry about deleting the pimpl_ pointer , because the auto_ptr will handle it automatically .
In fact , if there 's no other reason for explicitly writing a destructor , we do n't need to bother with a custom destructor at all any more .
Clearly , this is easier than managing the pointer manually , and it follows the good practice of wrapping resource ownership in objects -- a job that auto_ptr is well suited to do .
We 'll revisit this example again at the end .
Ownership , Sources , and Sinks
This is nifty stuff all by itself , but it gets better :
It 's also very useful to pass auto_ptrs to and from functions , as function parameters and return values .
To see why , first consider what happens when you copy an auto_ptr :
An auto_ptr owns the object that it holds a pointer to , and only one auto_ptr may own an object at a time .
When you copy an auto_ptr , you automatically transfer ownership from the source auto_ptr to the target auto_ptr ; if the target auto_ptr already owns an object , that object is first freed .
After the copy , only the target auto_ptr owns the pointer and will delete it in due time , while the source is set back to a null state and can no longer be used to refer to the owned object .
For example :
// Example 5 : Transferring ownership from
// one auto_ptr to another
//
void f ()
{
auto_ptr < T> pt1 ( new T ) ;
auto_ptr < T> pt2 ;
pt1->DoSomething ( ) ; // OK
pt2 = pt1 ; // now pt2 owns the pointer ,
// and pt1 does not
pt2->DoSomething ( ) ; // OK
} // as we go out of scope , pt2's destructor
// deletes the pointer , but pt1's does nothing
But be careful to avoid the pitfall of trying to use a non-owning auto_ptr :
// Example 6 : Never try to do work through
// a non-owning auto_ptr
//
void f ()
{
auto_ptr < T> pt1 ( new T ) ;
auto_ptr < T> pt2 ;
pt2 = pt1 ; // now pt2 owns the pointer , and
// pt1 does not
pt1->DoSomething ( ) ;
// error !
following a null pointer
}
With that in mind , we start to see how well auto_ptr works with sources and sinks .
A " source " is a function or other operation that creates a new resource , and then typically hands off and relinquishes ownership of the resource .
A " sink " is a function that does the reverse , namely that takes ownership of an existing object ( and typically disposes of it ) .
Instead of just having sources and sinks return and take bald pointers , though , it 's usually better to return or take a smart pointer that owns the resource :
// Example 7 : Sources and sinks
//
// A creator function that builds a new
// resource and then hands off ownership .
//
auto_ptr < T> Source ( )
{
return auto_ptr <T >( new T ) ;
}
// A disposal function that takes ownership
// of an existing resource and frees it .
//
void Sink ( auto_ptr < T> pt )
{
}
// Sample code to exercise the above :
auto_ptr < T> pt( Source ( ) ) ; // takes ownership
Note the elegance of what 's going on here :
1. Source ( ) allocates a new object and returns it to the caller in a completely safe way , by letting the caller assume ownership of the pointer .
Even if the caller ignores the return value ( of course , you would never write code that ignores return values , right ? ) , the allocated object will always be safely deleted .
At the end of this article , I 'll demonstrate why returning an auto_ptr is an important idiom .
It turns out that returning a result by wrapping it in something like an auto_ptr is sometimes the only way to make a function strongly exception - safe .
2. Sink ( ) takes an auto_ptr by value and therefore assumes ownership of it .
When Sink( ) is done , the deletion is performed as the local auto_ptr object goes out of scope ( as long as Sink ( ) itself has n't handed off ownership to someone else ) .
The Sink ( ) function as written above does n't actually do anything with its parameter , so calling " Sink ( pt ) ; " is a fancy way of writing " pt.reset ( 0 ) ; " , but normally a sink function would do some work with the object before freeing it .
Things Not To Do , and Why Not To Do Them
Beware :
Never use auto_ptrs except in one of the ways I just described above .
I have seen many programmers try to use auto_ptrs in other ways just as they would use any other object .
The problem with this is that auto_ptrs are most assuredly not like any other object .
Here 's the fundamental issue , and I 'll highlight it to make sure it stands out :
For auto_ptr , copies are NOT equivalent .
It turns out that this has important effects when you try to use auto_ptrs with generic code that does make copies and is n't necessarily aware that copies are n't equivalent ( after all , usually copies are ! ) .
Consider the following code that I regularly see posted on the C++ newsgroups :
// Example 8 : Danger , Will Robinson !
//
vector < auto_ptr < T> > v ;
/* ... */
sort ( v.begin( ) , v.end ( ) ) ;
It is never safe to put auto_ptrs into standard containers .
Some people will tell you that their compiler and library compiles this fine , and others will tell you that they 've seen exactly this example recommended in the documentation of a certain popular compiler ; do n't listen to them .
The problem is that auto_ptr does not quite meet the requirements of a type you can put into containers , because copies of auto_ptrs are not equivalent .
For one thing , there 's nothing that says a vector can't just decide to up and make an " extra " internal copy of some object it contains .
For another , when you call generic functions that will copy elements , like sort ( ) does , the functions have to be able to assume that copies are going to be equivalent .
At least one popular sort internally takes a copy of a " pivot " element , and if you try to make it work on auto_ptrs it will merrily take a copy of the pivot auto_ptr object ( thereby taking ownership and putting it in a temporary auto_ptr on the side ) , do the rest of its work on the sequence ( including taking further copies of the now - non - owning auto_ptr that was picked as a pivot value ) , and when the sort is over the pivot is destroyed and you have a problem :
At least one auto_ptr in the sequence ( the one that was the pivot value ) no longer owns the pointer it once held , and in fact the pointer it held has already been deleted !
So the standards committee bent over backwards to do everything it could to help you out :
The Standard auto_ptr was deliberately and specifically designed to break if you try to use it with the standard containers ( or , at least , to break with most natural implementations of the standard library ) .
To do this , the committee used a trick : auto_ptr 's copy constructor and copy assignment operator take references to non-const to the right - hand - side object .
The standard containers ' single - element insert ( ) functions take a reference to const , and hence wo n't work with auto_ptrs .
Interlude : The const auto_ptr Idiom
One cute and intentional result of this engineering of auto_ptr is that const auto_ptrs never lose ownership : Copying a const auto_ptr is illegal , and in fact the only things you can do with a const auto_ptr are dereference it with operator * ( ) or operator ->( ) or call get ( ) to inquire about the value of the contained pointer .
This means that we have a clear and concise idiom to express that an auto_ptr can never lose ownership :
// Example 9 : The const auto_ptr idiom
//
const auto_ptr < T> pt1 ( new T ) ;
// making pt1 const guarantees that pt1 can
// never be copied to another auto_ptr , and
// so is guaranteed to never lose ownership
auto_ptr < T> pt2 ( pt1 ) ; // illegal
auto_ptr < T> pt3 ;
pt3 = pt1 ; // illegal
pt1.release ( ) ; // illegal
pt1.reset ( new T ) ; // illegal
Now that 's what I call const !
So if you want to declare to the world that an auto_ptr can never be changed and will always delete what it owns , this is the way to do it .
The const auto_ptr idiom is a useful and common technique , and one that you should keep in mind .
auto_ptr and Exception Safety
Finally , auto_ptr is sometimes essential to writing exception - safe code .
Consider the following function :
// Example 10 ( a ) : Exception - safe ?
//
String f ()
{
String result ;
result = " some value " ;
cout << " some output " ;
return result ;
}
This function has two visible side effects :
It emits some output , and it returns a String .
A detailed examination of exception safety is beyond the scope of this article , [ 2 ] but the goal we want to achieve is the strong exception - safety guarantee , which boils down to ensuring that the function acts atomically -- even if there are exceptions , either all side effects happen or none of them do .
Although the code in Example 10 ( a ) comes pretty close to achieving the strong exception - safety guarantee , there 's still one minor quibble , as illustrated by the following client code :
String the Name ;
the Name = f( ) ;
The String copy constructor is invoked because the result is returned by value , and the copy assignment operator is invoked to copy the result into the Name .
If either copy fails , then f( ) has completed all of its work and all of its side effects ( good ) , but the result has been irretrievably lost ( oops ) .
Can we do better , and perhaps avoid the problem by avoiding the copy ?
For example , we could let the function take a non-const String reference parameter and place the return value in that :
// Example 10 ( b ) : Better ?
//
void f( String& result )
{
cout << " some output " ;
result = " some value " ;
}
This may look better , but it is n't , because the assignment to result might still fail which leaves us with one side effect complete and the other incomplete .
Bottom line , this attempt does n't really buy us much .
One way to solve the problem is to return a pointer to a dynamically allocated String , but the best solution is to go a step farther and return the pointer in an auto_ptr :
// Example 10 ( c ) : Correct ( finally ! )
//
auto_ptr < String > f()
{
auto_ptr < String > result = new String ;
* result = " some value " ;
cout << " some output " ;
return result ; // rely on transfer of ownership ;
// this can't throw
}
This does the trick , since we have effectively hidden all of the work to construct the second side effect ( the return value ) while ensuring that it can be safely returned to the caller using only nonthrowing operations after the first side effect has completed ( the printing of the message ) .
We know that , once the cout is complete , the returned value will make it successfully into the hands of the caller , and be correctly cleaned up in all cases :
If the caller accepts the returned value , the act of accepting a copy of the auto_ptr causes the caller to take ownership ; and if the caller does not accept the returned value , say by ignoring the return value , the allocated String will be automatically cleaned up as the temporary auto_ptr holding it is destroyed .
The price for this extra safety ?
As often happens when implementing strong exception safety , the strong safety comes at the ( usually minor ) cost of some efficiency -- here , the extra dynamic memory allocation .
But , when it comes to trading off efficiency for correctness , we usually ought to prefer the latter !
Make a habit of using smart pointers like auto_ptr in your daily work .
auto_ptr neatly solves common problems and will make your code safer and more robust , especially when it comes to preventing resource leaks and ensuring strong exception safety .
Because it 's standard , it 's portable across libraries and platforms , and so it will be right there with you wherever you take your code .

Cracking safes with thermal imaging
( as a more viable alternative to mind reading )
Copyright ( C ) 2005 by Michal Zalewski ( lcamtuf@coredump.cx )
This inexplicably brief " research " paper presents an interesting physical world attack that may be easily deployed by a determined attacker to compromise many high - security access control systems in use today .
Although this paper 's findings are hardly groundbreaking ( and in some ways , are downright obvious ) , it includes some cool pictures of what should be most certainly taken into account in risk management , secure zone planning , and when drafting operating procedures for high - risk areas .
But most of all , I just wanted to share ;-)
In short , virtually all keypad entry systems - as used in various applications , including building access control , alarm system control , electronic lock safes , ATM input , etc - are susceptible to a trivial low - profile passphrase snooping scheme .
This attack enables the attacker to quickly and unobtrusively recover previously entered passphrases with a high degree of success .
This is in contrast to previously documented methods of keypad snooping ; these methods were in general either highly intrusive - required close presence or installation of specialized hardware - or difficult to carry out and not very reliable ( e.g. , examining deposited fingerprints - works in low - use situations only , and does not reveal the ordering of digits ) .
The attacker can perform the aforementioned attack by deploying an uncooled microbolometer thermal imaging ( far infrared ) camera within up to approximately five to ten minutes after valid keycode entry .
Although this may sound outlandish , the heat transferred during split - second contact of individual keys with human body ( even through , for example , gloves ) is significant enough and dissipates slowly enough to make this possible after the area has been cleared of all personnel .
Furthermore , since the image can be acquired from a considerable distance ( 1 - 10 meters is easy to achieve ) , the attacker can afford to maintain a remarkably low profile through the process .
To put things in perspective , portable ( handheld ) thermal imaging devices , such as the one pictured above , are commercially available without major restrictions from manufacturers such as Flir or Fluke .
Prices begin at $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 for brand new units , and top - of - the - line models boast a 0.05 K thermal resolution at impressively low sensor noise levels .
The " return on investment " can be quite high in most illicit uses , and indeed - historically , ATM phishers were known to be willing to spend money on specialized equipment such as custom assemblies that included high - end digital cameras with wireless access .
As such , the scheme is not as outlandish as it might have seemed .
The following sequence of images demonstrates the feasibility of the attack ; in this case , the target is LA GARD ComboGard 3035 electronic lock ( with rubber keys ) installed on an industrial - grade safe :
Keypad in idle state - in visible light ( left ) and in thermal imaging ( right ) .
Minimal ambient temperature variations are present due to different thermal characteristics of materials used in the safe .
A sequence of keys is being pressed ( 1 - 5 - 9 ) .
The difference in colors on the right is due to IR camera automatically adjusting to relatively high temperature of human body , to avoid overexposure and blooming .
Code entry complete .
All pressed keys are still clearly readable in this thermogram ; the sequence of digits can be infered from the relative temperature of these spots - ones with lower registered temperature ( more faint color ) were pressed earlier than others .
There are some real - world considerations , of course : reuse of digits in a code , very rapid code entry , vastly differing keypress times , and other code entry quirks ( say , victim 's habit of resting his palm on the keypad ) may render the attack less successful , and may make results more ambiguous .
That said , it 's still nifty , and apparently not limited to bad science - fiction or computer games ; civilian access to sufficiently advanced technology is possible .
All in all , many airports , numerous bank branches , and various other entities , might want to reconsider the effectiveness of their defenses .
A proper defense against such techniques would be not to rely on keypad - only access control in easily accessible areas , unless additional advanced countermeasures can be implemented ( well - implemented scrambling keypads originally intended to thwart fingerprint or key wear analysis , for example ) .
Smart - card , biometric , or plain old key - based protection can be added to reduce exposure .
Side thought : in terms of safe cracking , another interesting area of research is differential power analysis ( DPA ) of electronic locks .
High - security locks on small - and medium - size safes usually have external connectors that can be used to supply emergency battery power to the device ; these usually directly connect to the same route that is used to supply primary power , and as such can be used to measure power consumption characteristics and / or capture CPU - generated feedback noise , and possibly to differentiate between valid and invalid keycodes as digits are entered .
If you happen to have a good ' scope lying around , give it a try .
Oh - wanna buy a brick ?

Requiem for an operator
by Barry Warsaw
August 24 , 2006
Summary
Guido kills <> in Python 3000 .
I am sad .
Advertisement
I heard the news today , oh boy This came in my email today : Author : guido.van.rossum
Date : Thu Aug 24 05:53:23 2006 New Revision : 51538 Killed the <> operator .
You must now use !=.
I knew this day would come and yet I 'm still sad .
Having known Guido as long as I have , I also know that the likelihood he 'll change his mind is about the same as Tim Peters eating anything other than Kung Pao chicken at an outing to China King restaurant .
Still , I have a strong attachment to this operator so I 'm returning to my blog in final remembrance and to once again explain why I like <> so much more than !=.
The argument for <>
There are several reasons why I think <> is the better spelling for inequality .
First , it 's symmetrical and thus feels more closely related to its opposite , == for equality .
Split either symbol vertically down the center and the two sides are mirrors of each other .
The symmetry appeals to my eye .
Second , <> stands out much better in code that already has == and = strewn about it .
Maybe it 's just me , but != is less visually distinct and my eye has a much harder time picking this out .
It always has for C and Java , will so in Python code as well .
Third and most importantly , <> is much easier to type ( on a US keyboard at least ) .
Think of the chording you have to do on a keyboard to type the two inequality operators .
For <> , you hold the left shift down with your left pinkie , and then hit comma and period with the second and third fingers of your right hand .
Quick and easy .
With !=
I have to go through these movements :
Hold right shift with my right pinkie and stretch my left ring finger all the way up to the 1 key
( or hold left shift with my pinkie while doing the same left ring finger stretch )
Let up on the shift key and stretch my right ring finger up to the = key at the opposite side of the keyboard
There 's no question that != is more awkward and slower to type .
For me it 's actually more painful too .
The argument for !=
Let 's examine some of the arguments I 've heard in favor of != instead of <>.
First , TOOWTDI .
This Python guiding principle stands for " There 's Only One Way To Do It " , and it 's a principle that should be honored in this case too .
Note however , this does n't really argue in favor of either symbol -- it could just as appropriately be invoked for keeping <> and ditching !=.
Another argument I 've heard is that !
is a common character meaning " not " so != clearly means " not equal " , while <> means " less than and greater than " and that 's nonsensical .
Well , != does not mean " not equal " , it means " not an assignment " which is equally < wink > nonsensical .
To literally mean " not equal " in Python , you 'd have to write !== and no one 's suggesting that !
Third , I 've heard that people coming from Java and C will be more comfortable with != than <> because that 's what those languages use .
This does n't hold much water for me because any programmer worth their salt will understand that they have to make adjustments when they switch languages .
How often do you type semicolons at the end of your Python statements ?
How often do you type colons at the end of your C conditionals ?
Yeah , me neither .
Switching to <> when writing Python would actually be a good thing because it re-enforces the differences between Python and C / Java .
A Farewell Ultimately I believe this change was made because Guido simply likes != better than <> and thus it comes down to a religious argument .
Since he 's the BDFL and Python is his language , he gets to make these decisions .
I do n't have to like it , but I 'll learn to live with it ... eventually .
In the meantime , here 's my Ode to Inequality : One 's not assignment but looks like such
One 's less and more but not by much
One 's within reach , an easy touch One looks like C , a useful crutch
My fingers ache and stretch and pull
To type the Py three inequal
The end is near for symbol 's duel I mourn the loss of diamond jewel The BDFL 's made his choice
To heed the call of Java 's voice Some will cry and some rejoice
And sed will lend a heavy hoist I 'll linger then on Py two dot
So I can have my equal not The angle brackets killed and caught In Guido 's evil bang key plot
So join me now in sweet revolt To Ruby , Perl , or Tcl bolt Naw , I 'm just kidding truth be told But would n't that be quite a jolt ?
I 'm just an old crumudgeon , moody
Who thinks bang equals looks like doody
So call me nuts or call me snooty I guess I 'll eat my TOOWTDI fruity
Talk Back !

Get your game face on
I ’ve written in the past about the “ Uncanny Valley ” — the phenomenon that as computer graphics become more and more lifelike , the characters they create look more and more ghoulish .
The problem , as I wrote in Slate last year , is that we humans are good at anthropomorphizing very crudely - drawn figures , such as Charlie Brown or Calvin and Hobbes .
We fill in the details and find them cute and cuddly .
But when a graphical representation of a human becomes so close to reality that it ’s 99 % perfect , our attention shifts — and we suddenly start noticing the 1 % that is n’t right .
Usually it ’s something wrong with the face :
The eyes look dead , the skin does n’t move correctly .
The characters start looking , quite inadvertantly , like zombies .
I sometimes wonder whether computer games and animators will ever get past this hump ; maybe we ’ll always find nearly - realistic human animations freaky - looking .
Ah , but maybe there ’s a much , much weirder solution waiting in the wings .
What if people — real people , in real life — stop looking fully realistic , and start looking almost - not - quite - real ?
This is the incredibly interesting idea put forward in a new essay by Robert Fabricant , a creative director at Frog Design .
He points out that the rise of plastic surgery is producing a new wave of people who look just as surreal as our computerized avatars .
As he writes :
It is ironic that , as we perfect the algorithms for simulating facial expressions in 3D software , we are embracing cosmetic treatments that reduce the fidelity and individuality of our own facial expressions .
Over the last few years there has been a 20 - 50 % annual increase in the number of minimally - invasive cosmetic procedures ( depending on the procedure ) .
And there has been an utter acceptance and celebration of cosmetic surgery in the media with shows like Fox ’s “ The Swan ” and ABC ’s “ Extreme Makeover . ”
It is easy to imagine a point in the future when these two trends converge and we all look like Angelina Jolie — errr , Lara Croft .
That chart above is from Fabricant ’s essay , and wittily illustrates the merging of these two trends .
He also points out lots of other weird mergings of digital and real - life aesthetics , including the Xbox game Yourself !
Fitness , in which a hot virtual chick enjoins you to develop a body as perfectly sculpted as hers .

Warning : Certain Smells May Make
You a Dangerous Driver ( Really ! )
by www.SixWise.com
The sense of smell has a remarkable ability to conjure up memories , change our mood -- even affect our ability to concentrate .
But even more than that , smells have a unique link directly to our emotions .
Think of a " good " smell ( fresh baked cookies or bread , fresh - cut flowers , etc. ) and chances are that you start to feel a boost in your mood .
Then think of a " bad " smell ( pollution , rotten meat , etc. ) and the opposite is likely to occur .
This is because , " No other sensory system has direct access to the amygdala -- the emotional center of your brain , " says Rachel Herz of the Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia .
" Memories brought back by odors are experienced in a much more emotionally potent way than those from other sensory cues .
In a most basic and primitive way , smells tell us what to approach and what to avoid . "
What makes a safe driver ?
According to the RAC Foundation , the smells in your car may make all the difference .
But would you believe that smells not only have the power to affect our moods , they have the power to affect our behaviors as well ?
Roll Down the Windows , Something Stinks !
The British RAC Foundation , a motoring organization , conducted research into the relationship between smells and driving after an odor study by Bryan Raudenbush of the Wheeling Jesuit University in West Virginia was released .
They found that smells have a major effect on the way we drive .
Said Sue Nicholson , head of campaigns for the RAC Foundation , " It 's astounding how much the smell in a car can affect a driver 's mood and actions .
Smell is a very powerful sense and could result in a lack of concentration or over - reaction to minor irritations on the road -- which can turn into potentially life threatening incidents . "
In fact , the " right " smell in a car can help the driver : Recognize dangers sooner
Stay focused on the road ahead
Forgive other people 's driving errors
Find a bit of romance But , get a whiff of the " wrong " smell , and the driver may be compelled to : Speed
Doze off
Succumb to road rage
Get in a serious accident Conrad King , the RAC Foundation 's consultant psychologist , had this to say : " More than any other sense , the sense of smell circumnavigates the logical part of the brain and acts on the limbic and emotional systems .
This is why the smell of perfume can turn men into gibbering idiots , the smell of baking bread can destroy the best intentions of a dieter and the smell of baby powder can make a child - averse individual become quite broody ...
When we bring cars into the equation , however , the ability of various smells to over or under stimulate us as drivers can have catastrophic results . "
Would You Recognize Your Car's Smell ?
Ever notice how you can no longer smell your own perfume or aftershave a few minutes after you put it on ?
Or how people with body odor never seem to notice they have it ?
These things happen because of a phenomenon called " nose fatigue . "
No matter how bad or good the smell , after awhile your nasal receptor cells get " numb " to the constant stimulation and stop sending messages to your brain .
The result is that , at least for the time being , you can no longer smell that particular scent .
The same thing happens in cars , and drivers are often de-sensitized to the smells that are there .
So , they 're less likely to notice whether or not their behavior is being affected .
Worst Smells for Driving Like to eat while driving ?
The smell of fast food wrappers could make you irritable and more susceptible to road rage .
The RAC Foundation reported that the following smells are the most dangerous ones while you 're on the road : Chamomile , jasmine and lavender :
They make drivers too relaxed .
Fast food wrappers , fresh bread and pastry :
These make drivers hungry and in a hurry to get something to eat .
The result ?
Irritability and an increased risk of speeding and road rage .
Fresh - cut grass , pine woods and roadside flowers :
These things may send drivers on a trip down memory lane ... to the extent that their daydreaming takes their mind off the road and the speed at which they 're traveling .
Plus , those with allergies may be thrown off by sneezing and watery eyes .
Leather seats and oil :
Older drivers may become nostalgic , thinking back to the thrill of their first cars , and adopt more risky driving behaviors .
Certain perfumes and aftershaves :
These may ignite sexual thoughts in both male and female drivers , making them more focused on romance than on the road .
Best Smells for Driving Driving by the ocean and catching a whiff of salty sea air may be just the thing for safe drivers :
It can help relieve stress and calm the mind .
Looking for that safe driver discount on your auto insurance policy ?
These scents may help : Peppermint and cinnamon :
They improve concentration levels and make drivers less irritable .
Lemon and coffee :
These , too , help drivers achieve high concentration levels and clear thinking .
New car smell ( a combination of cleaning products and organic solvents ) :
This tends to make people more cautious about their driving and improves concentration .
Sea ozone : A breath of salty sea air may make drivers breathe deeply , which helps relieve stress , relax the muscles and calm the mind .
The worst of all ?
It may be having no scent at all .
Studies of astronauts have found that when there 's a lack of any odor it can lead to irritability and olfactory hallucinations .
Some day , your car may be capable of detecting your mood and automatically adjusting the smell in your car to help calm or invigorate you , according to the RAC Foundation 's Motoring Toward 2050 Report .
The system may also automatically adjust seat position , temperature and lighting based on your mood .
But , you do n't have to wait that long to reap the benefits of this study .
As Nicholson said , " Before 2050 ... motorists can help do this for themselves .
A small cinnamon or mint scented room freshener sachet placed in a car could help to keep drivers alert , refreshed and focused . "
Of course , if you opt for this choice , be sure to find one scented with natural oils and not their synthetic counterparts .

Death Star Firepower
Written : 1998.10.31
Last Revised : 1999.01.24
Exactly how powerful is the Death Star ?
With a little bit of physics and a little bit of math , we can determine just how much power you would need in order to blow up a planet .
Let 's start with what we know .
The Death Star is capable of destroying any inhabitable planet in the galaxy , blasting it into rubble and hurling the rubble into space at fantastic speeds .
This is one of the central defining events of the Star Wars trilogy .
In fact , not only did we see the planet Alderaan destroyed in a cataclysmic explosion , but we also saw Han Solo arrive a few minutes later , only to see nothing but a light " meteor shower . "
This indicates that not only was the planet destroyed , but most of its mass was already dispersed far away from its original location .
Oneof the tributary beams of the Death Star superlaser ( click to enlarge )
The superlaser beam lances out toward the planet ( click to enlarge )
How much energy did it take to destroy Alderaan ?
In order to answer this question , we must first address a few myths :
" A planet can be destroyed by breaking it up into pieces , without having to blow it apart completely " .
This fails to account for the forces of gravity .
Even if you created a hypothetical weapon that sliced a planet cleanly in half , the planet 's gravity would immediately slam the two halves back together again .
Everyone on the surface would undoubtedly die , but the planet itself would be intact .
" A planet can be destroyed by vaporizing or melting it alone " .
Contrary to popular belief , vapourization alone will not totally destroy the planet , although it will render it quite useless for habitation .
Much of a planet 's mass is in liquid form already , and even if it were all vaporized , it would only turn into a gas planet .
This gas planet would eventually cool and solidify again .
" Alderaan might have been a very tiny planet , so it would have been very easy to destroy " .
There is a fairly narrow range of planet types which can support human life .
A human - habitable planet must have sufficient gravity to have retained an atmosphere after its formation , so Alderaan simply could not have been an extremely small planet .
Furthermore , the Death Star has been explicitly described to be capable of destroying any inhabited planet .
So if we can't use melting energy or vaporization energy , how do we determine the energy requirement to destroy a planet ?
The answer , in one word , is gravity .
If you wish to destroy a planet , you must scatter its mass so quickly that the forces of gravity cannot reverse the expansion process .
In other words , you must accelerate the planet 's entire mass to escape velocity .
Another way of saying this is that you must bring the planet 's gravitational potential energy state up to zero .
The concepts of gravititational potential energy and escape velocity are both discussed in the science page .
Using those concepts , the energy requirement for blasting a planet apart can be calculated .
Alderaan 's fiery death
In this document , we will discuss three different methods for evaluating the energy requirement for scattering a planetary mass at sufficient velocity to overcome gravitational attraction .
We will evaluate two of those methods .
Method 1 : Surface Escape Velocity
The surface escape velocity for an Earth - like planet is roughly 11.2 km / s .
How did we determine this ?
We used Newton 's formula for gravitational potential energy , which is :
In this formula , G is the gravitational constant , which is 6.67E - 11 m³ /( s²·kg ) .
The two mass figures m1 and m2 are the masses of the two bodies being gravitationally attracted toward one another , and the radius r is the distance between the two bodies .
If we substitute m1 = 5.97 E24kg for the Earth 's mass and r = 6.37E6 m into the above equation , we can easily rearrange the equation to determine that the escape velocity for any mass m2 at the surface of the planet is roughly 11.2 km /s .
Therefore , the most straightfoward method of determining the energy requirement for planetary destruction is to simply substitute the planet 's mass and surface escape velocity into the classical kinetic energy equation as follows :
KE = ½mv²
KE=½( 5.97E24kg ) ( 1.12E4 m/s ) ²
KE=3.7E32 joules
Therefore , the surface escape velocity method yields a minimum energy estimate of 3.7E32 joules .
This represents an upper limit for the binding energy of an Earth - like planet , since the escape velocity is not constant .
As the outer layers of the planet are blown off , the underlying portions of the planet will have a lower escape velocity .
As an aside , the Death Star actually blew Alderaan apart at far greater velocity than necessary , so this figure relates to a minimum - scale planetary explosion , rather than the absurdly rapid explosion we see in the movie .
Method 2 : Gravitational Binding Energy - Constant Density
How do we account for the fact that the escape velocity is not constant ?
To solve this problem , we must resort to Sir Isaac Newton again , and employ calculus ( a branch of mathematics in which he was a pioneer ) .
We can use calculus to calculate the gravitational potential energy ( and by extension , the escape velocity ) not just at the surface , but for all points between the surface and the centre of the planet .
By adding up all of these values , we can determine the gravitational binding energy of a planet to a far higher level of accuracy than we achieved with method # 1 .
This process is known as integration , and if you are curious about the basic principles behind it , click here .
For a more detailed tutorial on calculus , you may wish to visit Karl 's Calculus Tutor which , interestingly enough , happens to touch upon the subject of Alderaan .
In any case , if we refer again to Newton 's gravitational potential energy formula :
We can integrate this function from the centre of a planet to its surface , by slicing the planet up into an infinite number of thin " shells " .
Essentially , we are peeling the planet 's skin off layer by layer , like an onion .
Each slice has an infinitesimally small thickness , which we shall henceforth refer to as dr .
For each slice , we can therefore determine the mass m1 of the slice itself , and the mass m2 of the planet inside the slice :
In these formulas , ρ is density ( Earth 's average density is roughly 5.5E3 kg / m³ ) .
The volume of the thin shell is the surface area formula A=4πr² multiplied by the thickness of the shell dr , and we multiply this volume by ρ to get mass m1 .
The volume of the underlying sphere is the spherical volume formula V=4/3πr³ , and we multiply this volume by ρ to get mass m2 .
Let 's suppose we are trying to determine m1 and m2 for a thin shell roughly 2000 km deep , so that its radius is roughly 4000 km .
In this situation , m1 would be 1.1E18 dr kg and m2 would be 1.5E24 kg .
Now that we have formulas for m1 and m2 , we can substitute them into Newton 's gravitational potential energy formula and integrate from 0 to r ( from the centre to the surface ) :
This formula is accurate but over - complicated .
It can be substantially simplified by remembering that density is a function of planetary mass and volume , and that volume is a function of radius :
When these equations are substituted into the gravitational binding energy formula , the result is :
Now , we can easily see that many of the terms in the above formula cancel out , so that the equation simplifies to a much more convenient form :
Now , we have a formula for the total binding energy of a planet of uniform density , and all you need is the mass and radius of the planet in question .
In the case of Earth , we can easily substitute G=6.6726E - 11 m³ /( s²·kg ) , M=5.97E24 kg , and r=6.371E6 m to the above formula .
The result is 2.2E32 joules , which anyone can independently verify with their own calculations .
This represents a lower limit for the gravitational binding energy of a planet , because the density of a planet is not constant ; it is always highest in the centre .
Therefore , the ratio of mass to volume will increase as the outer layers are " peeled away " rather than staying constant .
This will increase the gravitational binding energy .
We have now determined a lower limit ( 2.2E32 joules ) and upper limit ( 3.7E32 joules ) for the gravitational binding energy of an Earth - like planet .
If we want to improve the accuracy of our estimates even further , we have to account for the planetary density gradient in the planet , using a third method :
Method 3 : Gravitational Binding Energy - Variable Density
A real planet 's density is , of course , not uniform .
A real planet 's density will be extremely high in its core , where the combination of heavy metals and enormous pressure will result in densities in excess of 1E4 kg / m³ , and it will drop off in the mantle and crust .
In the case of Earth , the density at the surface is perhaps one quarter of the density at the core .
Unfortunately , the only way to incorporate the density gradient into our integration is to perform a curve - fit on the planetary density gradient of an Earth - like planet .
This curve fit will result in ρ being a function of r , and it will complicate the integration because we were able to remove the ρ term as a constant from the integration when we were assuming uniform density .
Worse yet , the density of a planet is not a nice smooth curve - there are several sharp transitions in the density of a planet , so the integration would have to be broken up into several pieces , each of which deals with a specific density gradient and range of radii .
This is not an insurmountable difficulty of course , but it is nevertheless a significant amount of extra work .
Curtis Saxton used planetary density gradients to arrive at the most accurate available figure for the planetary gravitational binding energy of an Earth - like planet in the Star Wars Technical Commentaries , which has been calculated to be about 2.4E32 joules .
Conclusion
Although three different methods are described here ( in order of increasing difficulty ) , they all yield results in the same order of magnitude .
The first two methods define upper and lower limits , thus " bracketing " the true figure .
The third method is the most ambitious , and attempts to determine where the actual binding energy lies , between the lower and upper limits .
All three figures are consistent , and in the same order of magnitude .
This demonstrates their accuracy , and the first two methods are simple enough that anyone with a calculator can independently verify the numbers .
This information therefore dispels some longstanding notions that it is possible to disrupt a planet without having to supply energy in the range of 1E32 joules .
Hopefully , this document will also be somewhat educational , for those who are not already familiar with the machinations behind the numbers and formulae .
Please note that the preceding figures discuss the lower limit , upper limit , and probable value for the gravitational binding energy of a planet .
This binding energy is , in turn , the absolute lower limit for the energy that the Death Star must have imparted to Alderaan .
However , these figures are extremely conservative because of the speed and violence of the Alderaan explosion .

Addendum
For those who wish to experiment with different values of planetary diameter and surface gravity ( I used Earth - like proportions for all of these calculations ) , a planetary parameter calculator is now available .
Click here to experiment with different sizes and gravity strengths , to see what sort of unusual planet you can dream up !
Keep in mind that this parameter calculator is intended only for illustrative and educational purposes - in the real universe , there is a typical process of natural planetoid formation that tends to exclude the formation of extreme high - density or low - density planetary bodies .
Even gas - giants like Jupiter have average densities in excess of 1000 kg / m³ , and planets composed entirely of uranium or some other such high - density element simply do not exist .
The page will allow you to experiment with hypothetical planets of virtually any density and size , but you should not fool yourself into thinking that such planets are realistic .
Also , you should keep in mind that the Newtonian gravity functions in the page formulae work well for normal planetary bodies but not for extreme conditions like black holes or other super - dense objects .
A life without left turns
My father never drove a car .
Well , that 's not quite right .
I should say I never saw him drive a car .
He quit driving in 1927 , when he was 25 years old , and the last car he drove was a 1926 Whippet .
" In those days , " he told me when he was in his 90s , " to drive a car you had to do things with your hands , and do things with your feet , and look every which way , and I decided you could walk through life and enjoy it or drive through life and miss it . "
At which point my mother , a sometimes salty Irishwoman , chimed in : " Oh , bull — — ! " she said .
" He hit a horse . "
" Well , " my father said , " there was that , too . "
So my brother and I grew up in a household without a car .
The neighbors all had cars — the Kollingses next door had a green 1941 Dodge , the VanLaninghams across the street a gray 1936 Plymouth , the Hopsons two doors down a black 1941 Ford — but we had none .
My father , a newspaperman in Des Moines , would take the streetcar to work and , often as not , walk the 3 miles home .
If he took the streetcar home , my mother and brother and I would walk the three blocks to the streetcar stop , meet him and walk home together .
Our 1950 Chevy
My brother , David , was born in 1935 , and I was born in 1938 , and sometimes , at dinner , we 'd ask how come all the neighbors had cars but we had none .
" No one in the family drives , " my mother would explain , and that was that .
But , sometimes , my father would say , " But as soon as one of you boys turns 16 , we 'll get one . "
It was as if he was n't sure which one of us would turn 16 first .
But , sure enough , my brother turned 16 before I did , so in 1951 my parents bought a used 1950 Chevrolet from a friend who ran the parts department at a Chevy dealership downtown .
It was a four - door , white model , stick shift , fender skirts , loaded with everything , and , since my parents did n't drive , it more or less became my brother 's car .
Having a car but not being able to drive did n't bother my father , but it did n't make sense to my mother .
So in 1952 , when she was 43 years old , she asked a friend to teach her to drive .
She learned in a nearby cemetery , the place where I learned to drive the following year and where , a generation later , I took my two sons to practice driving .
The cemetery probably was my father 's idea .
" Who can your mother hurt in the cemetery ? " I remember him saying once .
For the next 45 years or so , until she was 90 , my mother was the driver in the family .
Neither she nor my father had any sense of direction , but he loaded up on maps — though they seldom left the city limits — and appointed himself navigator .
It seemed to work .
The ritual walk to church Still , they both continued to walk a lot .
My mother was a devout Catholic , and my father an equally devout agnostic , an arrangement that did n't seem to bother either of them through their 75 years of marriage .
( Yes , 75 years , and they were deeply in love the entire time . )
He retired when he was 70 , and nearly every morning for the next 20 years or so , he would walk with her the mile to St. Augustin 's Church .
She would walk down and sit in the front pew , and he would wait in the back until he saw which of the parish 's two priests was on duty that morning .
If it was the pastor , my father then would go out and take a 2 - mile walk , meeting my mother at the end of the service and walking her home .
If it was the assistant pastor , he'd take just a 1 - mile walk and then head back to the church .
He called the priests " Father Fast " and " Father Slow . "
After he retired , my father almost always accompanied my mother whenever she drove anywhere , even if he had no reason to go along .
If she were going to the beauty parlor , he'd sit in the car and read , or go take a stroll or , if it was summer , have her keep the engine running so he could listen to the Cubs game on the radio .
( In the evening , then , when I 'd stop by , he 'd explain : " The Cubs lost again .
The millionaire on second base made a bad throw to the millionaire on first base , so the multimillionaire on third base scored . " )
If she were going to the grocery store , he would go along to carry the bags out — and to make sure she loaded up on ice cream .
As I said , he was always the navigator , and once , when he was 95 and she was 88 and still driving , he said to me , " Do you want to know the secret of a long life ? "
" I guess so , " I said , knowing it probably would be something bizarre .
" No left turns , " he said .
" What ? " I asked .
" No left turns , " he repeated .
" Several years ago , your mother and I read an article that said most accidents that old people are in happen when they turn left in front of oncoming traffic .
As you get older , your eyesight worsens , and you can lose your depth perception , it said .
So your mother and I decided never again to make a left turn . "
" What ? " I said again .
" No left turns , " he said .
" Think about it .
Three rights are the same as a left , and that 's a lot safer .
So we always make three rights . "
" You 're kidding ! " I said , and I turned to my mother for support .
" No , " she said , " your father is right .
We make three rights .
It works . "
But then she added : " Except when your father loses count . "
I was driving at the time , and I almost drove off the road as I started laughing .
" Loses count ? " I asked .
" Yes , " my father admitted , " that sometimes happens .
But it 's not a problem .
You just make seven rights , and you 're okay again . "
I could n't resist .
" Do you ever go for 11 ? " I asked .
" No , " he said .
" If we miss it at seven , we just come home and call it a bad day .
Besides , nothing in life is so important it can't be put off another day or another week . "
My mother was never in an accident , but one evening she handed me her car keys and said she had decided to quit driving .
That was in 1999 , when she was 90 .
She lived four more years , until 2003 .
My father died the next year , at 102 .
They both died in the bungalow they had moved into in 1937 and bought a few years later for $ 3,000 .
( Sixty years later , my brother and I paid $ 8,000 to have a shower put in the tiny bathroom — the house had never had one .
My father would have died then and there if he knew the shower cost nearly three times what he paid for the house . )
He continued to walk daily — he had me get him a treadmill when he was 101 because he was afraid he'd fall on the icy sidewalks but wanted to keep exercising — and he was of sound mind and sound body until the moment he died .
A happy life One September afternoon in 2004 , he and my son went with me when I had to give a talk in a neighboring town , and it was clear to all three of us that he was wearing out , though we had the usual wide - ranging conversation about politics and newspapers and things in the news .
A few weeks earlier , he had told my son , " You know , Mike , the first hundred years are a lot easier than the second hundred . "
At one point in our drive that Saturday , he said , " You know , I 'm probably not going to live much longer . "
" You 're probably right , " I said .
" Why would you say that ? " he countered , somewhat irritated .
" Because you 're 102 years old , " I said .
" Yes , " he said , " you 're right . "
He stayed in bed all the next day .
That night , I suggested to my son and daughter that we sit up with him through the night .
He appreciated it , he said , though at one point , apparently seeing us look gloomy , he said : " I would like to make an announcement .
No one in this room is dead yet . "
An hour or so later , he spoke his last words : " I want you to know , " he said , clearly and lucidly , " that I am in no pain .
I am very comfortable .
And I have had as happy a life as anyone on this earth could ever have . "
A short time later , he died .
I miss him a lot , and I think about him a lot .
I 've wondered now and then how it was that my family and I were so lucky that he lived so long .
I can't figure out if it was because he walked through life .
Or because he quit taking left turns .

I ’m not sure how I feel about web .py using my name and a quote out of context as an endorsement .
On the one hand , they at least include a link to the original context , but on the other , they make my faint praise look much more positive than it was .
My original comment pointed out various issues with e.g. its SQL quoting implementation , and also noted that “ it ’s about as far away as possible from something I would write . ”
While I ’m flattered that they thought me worth using in this way , I probably would ’ve been just as flattered if they ’d quoted me saying “ it ’s about as far away as possible from something I or Jim Fulton would write ” , and it arguably might be a better endorsement than the bits they actually quoted . 🙂
I doubt it ’s a malicious misquoting , however .
They also quoted Guido , including both his positive comment and his giving it an “ F ” for undocumented code and excessive magic .
It still bothers me a little bit that the quote makes it look like I endorse web.py , especially since they tacked on the fact that I ’m the creator of WSGI .
I try very hard to stay framework - neutral in my official capacity ( such as it is ) .
To be perfectly clear , I do n’t endorse any particular framework as the be -all end - all of web programming .
I believe that Python probably has the greatest diversity of novel web programming paradigms of any programming language , and this rich legacy is a treasure to be preserved – even as frameworks consolidate over time .
It should not be lightly discarded for whatever the flavor of the month is .
As such , I found the inflammatory rhetoric and unabashed advocacy in the comments on Guido ’s blog to be embarrassingly petty – especially since a lot of them were from people whose frameworks are n’t really offering much ( capability - wise ) that other Python frameworks have n’t been doing for years .
To a large extent , the newest wave of Python web frameworks are more about developer - friendliness than about innovation per se .
And I have nothing against that , but sometimes I worry that it ’s like working on the cupholders when we have n’t got fuel injection figured out yet .
On the other hand , I suppose everybody already knows they ’d like a cupholder , without needing a lot of explanation why it ’d be a good idea to have one .
Some things just “ sell ” better than others , due to their obviousness .
A fact of life , but occasionally a frustrating one .
Do you know the difference between a mutex and a spinlock ?
You know exactly what kind of locks are employed in e.g. OpenMP ?
You find hierarchical locks boring and recursive spinlocks only make you yawn ?
Then you will most likely NOT enjoy reading this article , and I encourage you to stop reading now , as it is way too basic for you – do n’t worry , though , as I have a way more advanced article in the pipeline :-) .
Seriously , stop !
Now would n’t that be an interesting statistic as to how many of my readers just stopped reading at this point , because they already know everything I have to offer in this article :-) .
Unfortunately , I will have to cope without this knowledge for now .
Anyways , since you are still reading I will assume that I can tell you something interesting today ( or so I hope ) – and if not , you would CFLink , right ?
( Now , that ’s an innovation !
A call to action right at the beginning of my post !
Will see how this turns out 😉 )
I will start out this article with a quick introduction as to why mutual exclusion is necessary and how it is done with locks and will then turn to some interesting variations of it .
I will not cover semaphores , monitors or all the other techniques to guarantee mutual exclusion , but will concentrate on locks and their variations ( which includes mutex variables and spinlocks ) .
Why Mutual Exclusion is Needed for Shared Memory
Let ’s assume we do not use Mutual Exclusion for a second and two of our threads want to increment a shared variable , conveniently called i with a nice and simple command such as i++.
Now what ’s really happening is , that ( depending on your architecture ) , not one command is carried out by your processor , but most likely three :
load value of i into a register ( lets call it r1 ) increment r1 by 1 store value in r1 back into i
And we did not even need assembler for that ( have I mentioned that I do not particularly like assembler ? ) !
Anyways , let ’s see what could happen in the worst case with our example and two threads ( assuming i had a value of 1 beforehand ) :
Thread 1 : load value of i into a register on processor 1 ( lets call it r1 ) [ i=1 , r1=1 ]
Thread 2 : load value of i into a register on processor 2 ( lets call it r2 ) [ i=1 , r1=1 , r2=1 ]
Thread 1 : increment r1 by 1 [ i=1 , r1=2 , r2=1 ]
Thread 2 : increment r2 by 1 [ i=1 , r1=2 , r2=2 ]
Thread 1 : store value in r1 back into i [ i=2 , r1=2 , r2=2 ]
Thread 2 : store value in r1 back into i [ i=2 , r1=2 , r2=2 ]
The values in brackets are there to remind you what exactly is stored inside the variable and registers at this point in time .
Remember , steps 1 and 2 , 3 and 4 , 5 and 6 are happening in parallel , on two different CPUs !
i should have been incremented two times , so the final result should be i=3 .
Yet , it is not , as can be seen at the end of step 6 .
And that ’s why we need mutual exclusion , as two threads working on the same data at the same time is a recipe for disaster !
By the way , you do not even need two processors for this to happen :
When you have two threads running on a single processor and the scheduler decides to stop thread 1 after it has just loaded the value of i into its register , you have the same dilemma .
How Mutual Exclusion is Done
Now that we have seen the problem , lets take a look at the solution .
Simply put , we need to stop the two threads from working on the same data at the same time ( that ’s why it ’s called mutual exclusion after all ) .
The most common way to do this today is by using locks .
A lock can be either locked or unlocked ( sometimes also referred to as set or unset ) .
And it really behaves like a lock on an ordinary door in the real world :
You enter a room , you lock the door because you do not want to be disturbed , do whatever you need to do in there , unlock the door and only then can somebody else enter .
If anybody tries to enter the room while you are still in there , he has to wait .
As long as you do not forget to lock or unlock the door , this algorithms guarantees mutual exclusion and protects the so called critical region .
And this is what the whole thing would look like using a parallel programming system ( OpenMP in this case ) :
Actually , the lock needs to be initialized beforehand and destroyed sometime afterwards as well , but that ’s not too difficult either .
Furthermore , in OpenMP there is a way to do this even easier , like this :
< View plain text > c
# pragma omp critical { i ++ ; }
Or even simpler , like this :
< View plain text > c
# pragma omp atomic i ++;
This basically does the same thing , except you do not need to worry about initialization and destruction of the lock and you cannot forget to unlock the mutex accidentally , but this is not what this article is about , so I will leave it at that and return to our regularly scheduled locks .
Actually , that is all I wanted to say about how locks work in general .
If you stick to the algorithm ( lock , change , unlock ) at any time the shared resource is worked on , you are fine .
If you do n’t , you code may still break ;-) .
In my experience , the most difficult thing to get right is not to understand the reason why mutual exclusion is necessary or even how it is done , but the most difficult thing is to spot all the places in the code where it is needed .
But then again , even that is not that difficult and my students usually do get it right the second or third time at the latest .
OK , now that you know the basics , on to the more interesting variations I promised earlier .
Mutex
The mutex is the most well - known way to enforce mutual exclusion ( it better be , with a name like that 😉 ) .
It basically behaves like the lock sketched above :
When a thread tries to lock a mutex , it is either acquired ( if no other thread presently owns the mutex ) or the requesting thread is put to sleep until the lock is available again ( in case another thread presently owns the lock ) .
When there are multiple threads waiting on a single lock , the order in which they are awoken is usually not determined .
So much for the mutex , let ’s now take a look at spinlocks .
Spinlocks
The functions associated with spinlocks are syntactically equivalent to the ones mentioned for mutexes , the subtle difference lays in the way the wait for the lock is handled : Contrary to mutexes , threads are not put to sleep on spinlocks , but instead continue to spin ( that means trying to acquire the lock in this context ) .
Therefore , they usually have a quicker response time ( as no thread needs to be woken up as soon as the lock is unlocked ) , but also do waste processor cycles ( a process commonly known as busy waiting ) .
Spinlocks are very common in High Performance Computing , because in this field most of the time each thread is scheduled on its own processor anyways and therefore there is not much to gain by putting threads to sleep ( which is a quite time - consuming process after all ) .
It depends on your threading system , which lock - variant is provided to you .
Pthreads for example used to have only mutexes , but now provides both .
OpenMP is silent about the issue in the specification , therefore the compiler vendors are free to use whatever variety they wish ( as far as I remember , many use a mixture of both , where a thread is spinning for a predefined amount of time and if the lock could not be acquired then , it is put to sleep ) .
Check the documentation of your threading system for details about your locks , with the information provided above it should be pretty easy to find out .
Recursive Locks
There is another , orthogonal dimension to locking , though .
What happens , when a thread that already owns a lock tries to lock it again ?
The answer is usually a deadlock – the thread will hang .
Why would you want to do a thing like that ?
The common answer to that is : inside recursive functions or functions calling each other from inside the critical region ( while both setting the lock ) .
But honestly , I have not seen this used in practice a whole lot and it is usually a sign that something is wrong with your synchronisation patterns anyways – remember , you want your critical regions to be as small and fast as possible , so it is usually not the hottest idea to be calling any functions in there !
But just in case you still need it or encounter code that already employs recursive locks I will say a few words about them :
In addition to the normal locking functionality described above , recursive locks employ an internal counter to monitor , how many times they have been locked by the same thread ( oh , did I forget to mention that ?
–
It is possible to set the same lock multiple times from the same thread with recursive locks and that is the main difference between normal locks and them ) .
The counter is also decreased every time the thread unsets the lock and only if the counter reaches zero , the lock is made available to the other threads again .
Recursive locks can be combined with the mutex or the spinlock - variety , so e.g. recursive spinlocks are possible as well .
Timed Locks
There are times , when a thread wants to enter a critical region , but has other things to do if the region is presently locked .
A very common way to deal with this situation is to test the lock beforehand .
A very simple example ( you guessed it , in OpenMP 😉 ) will make this clearer :
< View plain text > c
while ( ! omp_test_lock ( & my_lock ) ) { /* we did not get the lock !
* -> therefore , do some other work * then try again ... */ } /* at this point in the code , omp_test_lock returned * successfully and has therefore acquired the lock * -> do something with the locked resource ... * ... and finally unlock it again */ omp_unset_lock ( & my_lock ) ;
But actually , this is not what timed locking is about .
An alternative to the way of dealing with the problem described above would be , to give the normal set_lock - function an additional timing - value ( such as e.g. 200 ms ) .
The function will block normally , but if the lock is not acquired by that time , the function will return anyways and indicate somehow , that it has failed to acquire the lock .
This can be useful e.g. in embedded systems , where it is required that certain timing constraints are obeyed ( such as no thread shall wait more than 200ms on a lock , or something has gone wrong – although you would probably phrase that constraint a little different in your specification 😛 ) .
And in that case , a watchdog thread ( or process ) could be notified that makes sure that the system is working properly .
Timed locks are not very common ( I think POSIX has them now ) , but still your threading system may have them and they are an important building block in certain niches ( e.g. embedded systems ) .
Theoretically , they can be combined with all the other variations suggested above and therefore a timed , recursive mutex is possible .
Hierarchical Locks
I first heard about hierarchical locks at Europar last week .
This does not necessarily mean they are the newest invention in town ( the first paper I could find on them dates back to 2002 – the locks are called RH - locks in there and it is a very good read if you want to know more implementation details of locks ) .
It is way more likely that there is much more to locking than I know about or can describe in one article , especially since this is not my field of research :-) .
Anyways , hierarchical locks lock exactly like normal locks from the outside , their difference is in the implementation .
I apologize for mixing in an implementation detail here , after all I have not told you about other such details , such as queue locks vs. backoff locks – because this is an article for programmers , not for compiler writers .
Nevertheless , I found the concept interesting enough to mention it here , especially after my last article about locality .
Hierarchical locks operate under the premise that it is a good idea to let threads with a high memory locality ( e.g. threads scheduled on the same node , working on the same data or data that are close together in memory ) acquire the locks consecutively , as this will reduce cache misses .
This sounds logical , although I do not have any experience whatsoever about it .
The idea was invented for CC - NUMA machines and that ’s where its strengths are .
And the best thing about it is : the programmer does not need to care , as the locality improvements are managed automatically by the runtime system .
I do not see why hierarchical looks cannot be combined with any of the locks described above , so maybe you are in the market for a hierarchical , timed , nested spinlock 😀 ?
Further Reading
If you want to know more about locking and thread - programming in general , I wholeheartedly recommend what I like to call the POSIX Threads Bible by David Butenhof – Programming with POSIX Threads .
Or if you are more into Java , I hear Java Concurrency in Practice is a very good read .
I have not really found a great book on Thread - Programming with C# – the best one appears to be Programming C# , although it contains only a single chapter on threaded programming .
If you find a better one , please let me know .
Locking Summary
This article has grown so big that I need a summary for it ;-) .
I am inclined to promise anyone who has managed to read this far a beer , but since my blog audience has grown considerably during the last month ( with about 150 regular subscribers and about 600 unique visitors a day ) and this article will be on the net for a long time , this may not be such a great idea .
Especially , since I do n’t even drink beer .
Therefore , I will promise to answer any on topic comments you will leave here , instead :P .
Anyways , the topic of this article was mutual exclusion with locks .
After a not so short introduction to locking and why it is needed , I have showed some variations among them you may encounter when dealing with locking .
First of all , I looked at spinlocks and mutex variables .
The major difference between them is , that mutex variables put waiting threads to sleep , while with spinlocks waiting threads actively continue to try to acquire the lock .
The second variety I pointed out were recursive locks , which make it possible to set the same lock multiple times by the same thread .
Next were timed locks , that do exactly that : they time out after a certain period of waiting time , returning control back to the calling thread .
And finally , I looked at hierarchical locks , an implementation detail that promises better performance by exploiting locality , especially on bigger machines .
What I have not covered in this article are more implementation details ( not that I know many more , as I said this field is not my research area ) , as well as more exotic concepts for mutual exclusion ( lockless data - structures , anyone ? ) .
If there is sufficient interest , I might do that later .
Have I forgotten anything ?
Or did I get a detail wrong ?
