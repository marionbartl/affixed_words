In this article by Stoyan Stefanov , you ’ll learn about the prototype property of the function objects .
Understanding how the prototype works is an important part of learning the JavaScript language .
After all , JavaScript is classified as having a prototype - based object model .
There ’s nothing particularly difficult about the prototype , but it is a new concept and as such may sometimes take some time to sink in .
It ’s one of these things in JavaScript ( closures are another ) which , once you “ get ” them , they seem so obvious and make perfect sense .
As with the rest of the article , you ’re strongly encouraged to type in and play around with the examples ; this makes it much easier to learn and remember the concepts .
The following topics are discussed in this article :
Every function has a prototype property and it contains an object
Adding properties to the prototype object
Using the properties added to the prototype
The difference between own properties and properties of the prototype
__proto__ , the secret link every object keeps to its prototype
Methods such as isPrototypeOf ( ) , has OwnProperty ( ) , and property IsEnumerable ( )
The prototype Property
The functions in JavaScript are objects and they contain methods and properties .
Some of the common methods are apply ( ) and call ( ) and some of the common properties are length and constructor .
Another property of the function objects is prototype .
If you define a simple function foo ( ) you can access its properties as you would do with any other object :
>>> function foo(a , b) {return a * b;}
>>> foo.length
2
>>>foo.constructor
Function ( )
prototype is a property that gets created as soon as you define the function .
Its initial value is an empty object .
>>> typeof foo.
prototype
“ object ”
It ’s as if you added this property yourself like this :
>>> foo.prototype = {}
You can augment this empty object with properties and methods .
They wo n’t have any effect of the foo( ) function itself ; they ’ll only be used when you use foo ( ) as a constructor .
Adding Methods and Properties Using the Prototype
Constructor functions can be used to create ( construct ) new objects .
The main idea is that inside a function invoked with new you have access to the value this , which contains the object to be returned by the constructor .
Augmenting ( adding methods and properties to ) this object is the way to add functionality to the object being created .
Let ’s take a look at the constructor function Gadget ( ) which uses this to add two properties and one method to the objects it creates .
function Gadget ( name , color ) {
this .name = name ;
this .color = color ;
this.whatAreYou = function ( ) {
return ' I am a ' + this .color + ' ' + this .name ;
}
}
Adding methods and properties to the prototype property of the constructor function is another way to add functionality to the objects this constructor produces .
Let ’s add two more properties , price and rating , and a getInfo ( ) method .
Since prototype contains an object , you can just keep adding to it like this :
Gadget.prototype.price = 100 ;
Gadget.prototype.rating = 3 ;
Gadget.prototype.getInfo = function ( ) {
return ' Rating : ' + this .rating + ' , price : ' + this .price ;
} ;
Instead of adding to the prototype object , another way to achieve the above result is to overwrite the prototype completely , replacing it with an object of your choice :
Gadget.prototype = {
price : 100 ,
rating : 3 ,
getInfo : function ( ) {
return ' Rating : ' + this .rating + ' , price : ' + this .price ;
}
} ;
Using the Prototype ’s Methods and Properties
All the methods and properties you have added to the prototype are directly available as soon as you create a new object using the constructor .
If you create a newtoy object using the Gadget ( ) constructor , you can access all the methods and properties already defined .
>>> var newtoy = new Gadget ( ' webcam ' , ' black ' ) ;
>>> newtoy.name ;
“ webcam ”
>>> newtoy.color ;
“ black ”
>>> newtoy.whatAreYou( ) ;
“ I am a black webcam ”
>>> newtoy.price ;
100
>>> newtoy.rating ;
3
>>> newtoy.getInfo( ) ;
“ Rating : 3 , price : 100 ”
It ’s important to note that the prototype is “ live ” .
Objects are passed by reference in JavaScript , and therefore the prototype is not copied with every new object instance .
What does this mean in practice ?
It means that you can modify the prototype at any time and all objects ( even those created before the modification ) will inherit the changes .
Let ’s continue the example , adding a new method to the prototype :
Gadget.prototype.get = function ( what ) {
return this [ what ] ;
} ;
Even though newtoy was created before the get ( ) method was defined , newtoy will still have access to the new method :
>>> newtoy.get ( ' price ' ) ;
100
>>> newtoy.get ( ' color ' ) ;
“ black ”
Own Properties versus prototype Properties
In the example above getInfo ( ) used this internally to address the object .
It could ’ve also used Gadget . prototype to achieve the same result :
Gadget.prototype.getInfo = function ( ) {
return ' Rating : ' + Gadget.prototype.rating + ' , price : ' + Gadget.prototype.price ;
} ;
What ’s is the difference ?
To answer this question , let ’s examine how the prototype works in more detail .
Let ’s again take our newtoy object :
>>> var newtoy = new Gadget ( ' webcam ' , ' black ' ) ;
When you try to access a property of newtoy , say newtoy .
name the JavaScript engine will look through all of the properties of the object searching for one called name and , if it finds it , will return its value .
>>> newtoy.name
“ webcam ”
What if you try to access the rating property ?
The JavaScript engine will examine all of the properties of newtoy and will not find the one called rating .
Then the script engine will identify the prototype of the constructor function used to create this object ( same as if you do newtoy.constructor.prototype ) .
If the property is found in the prototype , this property is used .
>>> newtoy.rating
3
This would be the same as if you accessed the prototype directly .
Every object has a constructor property , which is a reference to the function that created the object , so in our case :
>>> newtoy.constructor
Gadget ( name , color )
>>> newtoy.constructor.prototype.rating
3
Now let ’s take this lookup one step further .
Every object has a constructor .
The prototype is an object , so it must have a constructor too .
Which in turn has a prototype .
In other words you can do :
>>> newtoy.constructor.prototype.constructor
Gadget ( name , color )
>>> newtoy.constructor.prototype.constructor.prototype
Object price=100 rating=3
This might go on for a while , depending on how long the prototype chain is , but you eventually end up with the built - in Object ( ) object , which is the highest - level parent .
In practice , this means that if you try newtoy .
toString ( ) and newtoy does n’t have an own toString ( ) method and its prototype does n’t either , in the end you ’ll get the Object ’s toString ( )
>>> newtoy.toString ( )
“ [ object Object ] ”
Overwriting Prototype ’s Property withOwn Property
As the above discussion demonstrates , if one of your objects does n’t have a certain property of its own , it can use one ( if exists ) somewhere up the prototype chain .
What if the object does have its own property and the prototype also has one with the same name ?
The own property takes precedence over the prototype’s .
Let ’s have a scenario where a property name exists both as an own property and as a property of the prototype object :
function Gadget ( name ) {
this .name = name ;
}
Gadget.prototype.name = ' foo ' ;
“ foo ”
Creating a new object and accessing its name property gives you the object ’s ownname property .
>>> var toy = new Gadget ( ' camera ' ) ;
>>> toy.name ;
“ camera ”
If you delete this property , the prototype ’s property with the same name ” shines through ” :
>>> delete toy.name ;
true
>>> toy.name ;
“ foo ”
Of course , you can always re-create the object ’s own property :
>>> toy.name = ' camera ' ;
>>> toy.name ;
“ camera ”
A foreign aircraft has been forced to land in Iran after violating Iranian airspace , Iranian media say .
State Al - Alam TV said the aircraft was Hungarian and not American , discounting earlier reports by Iran 's semi-official Fars news agency .
The aircraft and those on board were allowed to continue their journey after being questioned , the reports said .
The Pentagon denied any of its planes had been involved in such an incident and said none had landed in Iran .
" All our aircraft are accounted for and we have no reports of any aircraft landing in Iran , " Lt Col Patrick Ryder told reporters .
White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said officials were checking the " various and conflicting " Iranian reports .
It comes at a time of heightened tension between the United States and Iran over Tehran 's nuclear programme .
The US severed diplomatic ties with Iran in 1980 after US nationals were taken hostage by Iranian radicals in Tehran .
Released
The Arabic - language Al - Alam TV quoted an unnamed senior military official as saying the plane landed at Mehrabad airport on 30 September .
The official said the aircraft was a Hungarian aid plane which strayed into Iranian airspace .
Initial reports from Fars said it was an American plane and was carrying eight people , including five senior US generals .
It said the plane was intercepted by Iranian fighter jets and forced to land at an unspecified airport .
Iranian media said those on board were freed the following day and the plane was allowed to complete its journey to Afghanistan .
US presidential candidate Barack Obama 's campaign this evening released a new video regarding John McCain 's role in the savings - and - loan scandal of the late 1980s and early 1990s .
McCain was one of the so - called Keating Five .
He was rebuked by a US Senate ethics panel for exercising undue influence on behalf of Charles Keating , a campaign contributor and chairman of Lincoln Savings - and - Loan .
McCain was accused of pressuring regulators to go easy on Keating who had made large contributions to McCain and allowed the senator access to his private jet .

The Performing Rights Society , the UK outfit collecting royalties for the music industry , seems it will stop at nothing as it demands money from small businesses , charities , playschools , and now , kids ' community centers , all so that they can listen to music without fear of prosecution .
The UK’s Performing Rights Society ( PRS ) is a non-profit organization , setup to ensure that the music industry continues to make plenty more profits on an on - going regular basis .
For years now , they have collected license fees from companies that use music as part of their businesses , such as pubs , clubs and restaurants .
Some might argue that these type of companies benefit commercially from playing music to the public , so a license fee , although not particular popular , can be absorbed as a legitimate business expense .
However , recently the PRS has been getting more and more aggressive in its quest to funnel cash to its paymasters .
It now sees every UK organization – commercial or otherwise – as a legitimate target to intimidate with threats of legal action , should they dare to play a radio , TV or DVD within earshot of the public without a license .
Small businesses playing the radio for personal entertainment to pass the working day , charities , tea rooms , corner shops and even community centers are being targeted by this outfit .
Bizarrely , they are currently going after the British police , who have been refusing to pay .
It ’s clear , they care about just one thing – money .
To get this money the PRS go after people like the 61 year - old mechanic Paul Wilson , who has worked alone at his garage for 23 years since he was 15 .
He ca n’t afford the PRS license , so now he has to work in silence .
“ When I was first contacted by the PRS I thought somebody was having a laugh with me , ” he said .
But really , this is no laughing matter .
After the demands for money , Mr Wilson told the PRS to take his radio to prove he was n’t listening to it , but the PRS warned that the police could come round to do spot checks .
Meanwhile , the garage next door to Mr Wilson also received a PRS letter , so they are maintaining radio silence too .
Just regular people trying to earn a living , being chased down for money to listen to a radio at work .
It ’s astonishing .
When the small guy gets hit by these type of issues it really annoys people in the copyright debating community .
However , if you really want to widen the debate and spread some really bad PR , it ’s going to take tactics which show how low you are prepared to go .
For instance , you could go after a charity trying to raise funds via a tea-room , discover their staff radio can be overheard , and demand money from them .
But it is possible to further outrage people .
And this is what these type of collection outfits are doing , by widening their campaigns to start going after the softest most impressionable target in the country – kids .
Last week we reported how the MPLC , a Hollywood royalty collection outfit , ( illegally ) demanded money from kindergartens in Ireland , so that the kids could watch DVDs there .
But going after children is n’t exclusively an MPLC tactic , the PRS are doing it too .
Part of the claim against the tea -rooms mentioned above was that the kids there needed to be licensed to sing carols in front of the public and now , to add insult to injury , the PRS ‘ non - profit ’ copyright cop is going after a kid ’s non-profit community center in Glasgow , Scotland .
The Yoker Resource Center is faced with a £ 3,000 bill , it if wants to carry on using its TV , radio or CD player , that is .
Elizabeth Busby , the after - school supervisor at the center said : “ We ca n’t afford to pay this money .
Although we have a TV license for the center , under these rules we can not let all the kids watch it . ”
Wondering ( like the rest of us in the sane world ) why people have to pay twice or more for using the same product , Ms Busby added : “ If the children are watching a DVD then I have gone out and paid for it , so whether it is one person or twenty - five I still paid for it .
It ’s not as if I ’m buying pirate copies or downloading them illegally .
Soon it will be the Halloween party and what do we do for music ? ”
Asked to comment , the PRS declined .
I ’d like to think that the silence is down to shame , but I doubt it .
I ’ll leave you with some comments from Steve Pendlebury , writing in The Bolton News :
“ Radio stations pay large amounts of money to licensing organizations PRS and PPL for the music they play , and music has been on the radio for many years .
During the war , there were programmes like Workers Playtime and Music While You Work .
Now , many radio stations have features about workplaces .
If the PRS force people to switch their radios off then how are these stations going to survive ?
Music has to be heard before people go out and buy it . ”
The Rescue Plan .
Is my money safe at the Bank ?
Well to be honest , I would like to say yes .
If you asked me the same question some months months ago , I would have undoubtedly said yes .
Now however I actually have a sliver of doubt .
It ’s true that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) pledges to insure your money .

This insurance comes fortunately or unfortunately comes from the US government , and the government itself is largely in debt .
As we ’ve seen with the $ 700 billion dollar bailout , the government is willing to take on more debt .
The problem is what happens if a lot of the bigger banks start having still more problems .
How many billions or trillions or extra money does the government have to give people ?

We 're not quite sure why anyone would want to do this , but a Norwegian programmer claims to have created an application that allows you to run the Windows Mobile operating system on your iPhone .
The programmer , Erik Kristiansen , showed off his app in action at the recent myPhone2008 convention in Las Vegas .
Kristiansen 's application operates similar to Apple 's Bootcamp in that it allows you to load either the iPhone OS or the Windows Mobile OS when the iPhone boots up .
Running Windows Mobile , the iPhone appears to have full functionality as a Windows smartphone , including ( of course ) making phone calls .
Kristiansen 's program is currently in beta , but he says it should be available as an open source application in January .
A number of comments have popped in various forums claiming that this is a fake .
The claims are based on speculation and not necessarily on fact .
It would be fairly simple to fake running Windows Mobile on the iPhone by first creating a video offline that goes through all the motions of loading the Windows Mobile OS and such , copying the video over to the iPhone , and then faking carefully - timed " button " presses .
The ( rhetorical ) question , of course , is why would someone fake this ?
If someone was going to fake suck a hack , would n't running Google 's Android be more exciting ?
Assuming that this application is real ( and our Spidey sense tells us that this is on the up - and - up ) , it will be interesting to see what Apple 's response will be .
Apple might embrace it or at least ignore it , as it should have no negative impact on iPhone sales .
On the other hand , it could have a negative impact on iPhone app sales , as users might spend more time on the Windows Mobile OS side and with less available storage for the iPhone OS side , people will likely be purchasing and installing fewer iPhone apps .
Also , if Apple does think this is a good idea , it could shut Kristiansen down , claiming that it already has such an app in development .
We 'll just have to wait and see when and if the app surfaces , and what Apple will do about it .
In the meantime , with winter coming , Kristiansen should have plenty of time to perfect the app - - he says that there is little else to do in Norway 's long winters and unfortunately the girls are all busy programming too .
Brain Scans Of People Full Of Hate Show Unique Hate Signature
Coming from Professor Semir Zeki and John Romaya of the Wellcome Laboratory of Neurobiology at the University College London , a new research paper in Plos One on how hatred activates and deactivates areas of the brain shows hate creates a unique pattern of brain activates which includes some overlap with brain areas activated by love .
In this work , we address an important but unexplored topic , namely the neural correlates of hate .
In a block - design fMRI study , we scanned 17 normal human subjects while they viewed the face of a person they hated and also faces of acquaintances for whom they had neutral feelings .
A hate score was obtained for the object of hate for each subject and this was used as a covariate in a between - subject random effects analysis .
Viewing a hated face resulted in increased activity in the medial frontal gyrus , right putamen , bilaterally in premotor cortex , in the frontal pole and bilaterally in the medial insula .
We also found three areas where activation correlated linearly with the declared level of hatred , the right insula , right premotor cortex and the right fronto - medial gyrus .
One area of deactivation was found in the right superior frontal gyrus .
The study thus shows that there is a unique pattern of activity in the brain in the context of hate .
Though distinct from the pattern of activity that correlates with romantic love , this pattern nevertheless shares two areas with the latter , namely the putamen and the insula .
Hatred does not activate the amygdala which is activated by fear .
It is important to note that the pattern revealed is distinct from that of other , closely related , emotions such as fear , anger , aggression and danger , even though it shares common areas with these other sentiments .
Thus , the amygdala which is strongly activated by fear ( Noesselt et al. 2005 [ 9 ] , Morris et al. 2002 [ 10 ] , Hadjikhani et al. 2008 [ 11 ] ) and by aggression ( Beaver et al. , 2008 [ 12 ] ) was not activated in our study .
Nor were the anterior cingulate , hippocampus , medial temporal regions , and orbitofrontal cortex , apparently conspicuous in anger and threat ( Denson et al. 2008 [ 13 ] ; Bufkin and Luttrell 2007 [ 14 ] ; McClure et al. 2004 [ 15 ] ) , evident in our study .
It would thus seem that , though these sentiments may constitute part of the behaviour that results from hatred , the neural pathways for hate are distinct .
Parts of the brain involved in motor function get activated - perhaps so one can move in and attack the object of one 's hate ?
The ' hate circuit ' includes structures in the cortex and in the sub-cortex and has components that are important in generating aggressive behaviour , and translating this into action through motor planning , as if the brain becomes mobilised to take some action .
It also involves a part of the frontal cortex that has been considered critical in predicting the actions of others , probably an important feature when one is confronted by a hated person .
The subcortical activity involves two distinct structures , the putamen and insula .
The former , which has been implicated in the perception of contempt and disgust , may also be part of the motor system that is mobilised to take action , since it is known to contain nerve cells that are active in phases preparatory to making a move .
Professor Zeki added : " Significantly , the putamen and insula are also both activated by romantic love .
This is not surprising .
The putamen could also be involved in the preparation of aggressive acts in a romantic context , as in situations when a rival presents a danger .
Previous studies have suggested that the insula may be involved in responses to distressing stimuli , and the viewing of both a loved and a hated face may constitute such a distressing signal .
While love shuts down areas of the brain associated with judgment and reasoning by contrast those consumed with hate have very active reasoning facilities .
It takes logic to figure out how to attack your enemy .
So that makes sense .
Only those in love think they can afford to let their guard down , become zombies , and feel bliss around the object of their affection .
" A marked difference in the cortical pattern produced by these two sentiments of love and hate is that , whereas with love large parts of the cerebral cortex associated with judgment and reasoning become de-activated , with hate only a small zone , located in the frontal cortex , becomes de-activated .
This may seem surprising since hate can also be an all - consuming passion , just like love .
But whereas in romantic love , the lover is often less critical and judgmental regarding the loved person , it is more likely that in the context of hate the hater may want to exercise judgment in calculating moves to harm , injure or otherwise extract revenge .
In countries where suspected criminals have no right to privacy or right to keep silent brain scans could be used to determine whether a suspected killer hated his victim and by how much .
" Interestingly , the activity in some of these structures in response to viewing a hated face is proportional in strength to the declared intensity of hate , thus allowing the subjective state of hate to be objectively quantified .
This finding may have legal implications in criminal cases , for example . "
One could imagine a police state in which opponents of the regime get tested with brain scans and pictures of dictators to identify enemies of the state .
With more time it will become possible for governments to turn hatred into love .
Then all enemies of the state will get turned into supporters of it .
Of course , individuals will try to do this on a smaller scale as well .
Contrast these results with the research into love .
See my previous posts Love Deactivates Brain Areas For Fear , Planning , Critical Social Assessment , Love Like Addiction In Brain Scans , What Brain Scans Of People Falling In Love Tell Us , Romantic Love Seen As Motivation Or Drive Rather Than Emotional State , and Love Is Blind : Couples In Love Can't Identify Who Else Is In Love .
Nature 's front and back covers .
Really now .
Coincidence ?
Or RACISM and ELITISM and possibly SPECIESISM at work ?
It does , however , raise a good point about dogs ' noses and the candidates ' positions on them , and how that relates to science .

OSLO ( Reuters ) -
The number of polluted “ dead zones ” in the world ’s oceans is rising fast and coastal fish stocks are more vulnerable to collapse than previously feared , scientists said on Monday .
The spread of “ dead zones ” -- areas of oxygen - starved water -- “ is emerging as a major threat to coastal ecosystems globally , ” the scientists wrote in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Such zones are found from the Gulf of Mexico to the Baltic Sea in areas where algae bloom and suck oxygen from the water , feeding on fertilizers washed from fields , sewage , animal wastes and pollutants from the burning of fossil fuels .
“ Marine organisms are more vulnerable to low oxygen content than currently recognized , with fish and crustaceans being the most vulnerable , ” said Raquel Vaquer Suner of the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies in Spain .
“ The number of reported hypoxic ( low oxygen ) zones is growing globally at a rate of 5 percent a year , ” she told Reuters .
Her study with a colleague showed that the number of “ dead zones ” had risen to more than 140 in 2004 from almost none until the late 1970s .
Hundreds of millions of people depend on coastal fisheries for food .
Crustaceans such as crabs , lobsters and shrimps are less able to escape from low - oxygen waters than fish .
WARMING
Higher temperatures tied to global warming , blamed by the U.N. Climate Panel on human use of fossil fuels , may aggravate the problem of “ dead zones , ” partly because oxygen dissolves less readily in warmer water , the study said .
The first “ dead zones ” were found in northern latitudes such as Chesapeake Bay on the U.S. east coast and Scandinavian fjords .
Others have been appearing off South America , Ghana , China , Japan , Australia , New Zealand , Portugal and Britain .
The study said that most scientists had until now reckoned that oxygen levels could fall to 2 milligrams per liter of sea water before the water was considered starved of oxygen .
But many creatures were far more sensitive .
Larvae of one type of crab found off eastern Canada and the United States started suffering at oxygen levels of 8.6 mg per liter , just below normal levels .
“ Currently used thresholds ... are not conservative enough to avoid widespread mortality losses , ” the scientists wrote .
They urged a revised minimum of 4.6 mg of oxygen per liter as the lowest before water was considered hostile to life .

Jack Osbourne Nabs Thief
Singing legendand his wife America 's Got Talent judgemust be very proud of their son , who is being hailed as a hero .
While strolling the streets of London on Saturday , Jack witnessed a man trying to steal a woman 's purse .
Hell bent to stop the robber , Osbourne chased him down with the help of other bystanders .
Jack wrestled the ' perp ' to the ground and kept him immobile until authorities arrived to make the arrest .
Jack spoke of the ordeal and said :
" I could see the girl was in trouble , it just felt like the natural thing to do .
I 'm glad it turned out okay . "
Witnesses are touting him as a " real hero " and they compared him to a man possessed - we 're pretty sure they meant that as a compliment .
Good job Jack !

Millennium Park 's Cloud Gate is irresistible to the hand and eye .
We crouch beneath it and play in front of it .
We stroke it .
We take photos of our warped , stretched bodies reflected in its curved chrome surface .
Or we simply stand and watch the sky change in it .
This past July , however , the focus of passersby was temporarily shifted toward a new curiosity sharing the plaza with the Bean .
Mounted atop a tripod was a curved metal grid , which held a large piece of drawing paper , also curved .
Projecting from a rectangular metal frame around the grid was a white plaster skullcap .
Trevor Oakes , 26 , spent hours standing at this tripod with his head in the cap , while his identical twin , Ryan , walked around Cloud Gate with a closed umbrella strapped to his foot .
The typical reaction to this sight was confusion — you could practically see questions being formulated behind the furrowed brows and open mouths .
Some people figured they were seeing a performance ; others concluded that the two were surveying the plaza using some strange new tool .
When someone would finally ask , " What are you doing ? "
Ryan answered , " We 're making a perspective drawing . "
If you got right behind Trevor , you could see he was slowly making tiny pen scratches on the paper .
Though he faced Cloud Gate , the scratches looked nothing like a drawing of it , as they were all contained within a vertical strip on the paper 's righthand edge .
If you kept watching , you 'd see Trevor slice off that strip with an X - Acto knife and store it in a plastic folder .
Then he'd begin making scratches along the new right - hand edge of the paper .
Once in a while he'd take out the strips and reassemble them on the grid , and to quiet gasps of excitement and surprise Cloud Gate would appear .
As Trevor drew , Ryan explained .
Their tripod apparatus , which they call " the easel , " in a sense allowed Trevor to see through the paper he drew on to the object beyond it being drawn .
Normally , our two eyes unite what each sees individually into one picture ; but the easel is designed to separate what they see .
In this case , Trevor 's left eye saw the paper , his right eye Cloud Gate and the plaza around it .
Splitting focus this way does n't come naturally .
The brothers liken the effort required to the effort most of us must make to see the three - dimensional picture in a Magic Eye puzzle .
" There are no similarities with the way the image is generated , " they explained in a recent e-mail from " R + T , " " but in terms of focus splitting , it is the same action by the eyes of separating one 's sight lines at that paper plane ( such that they would be converging at a point behind the paper ) . "
The effect of this technique at Cloud Gate was that the two images seemed to overlap , as if the paper were transparent and the sculpture could be seen behind it .
But this overlap occurred in a narrow band — roughly the distance between Trevor 's eyes — which was why he was drawing in two - inch vertical strips .
When the paper was whole , Trevor looked past the concave grid that held it , but as it was sliced and narrowed , his right eye looked through the grid .
The easel is the product of months of rigorous calculation and physical labor — its bars are precisely designed to all but disappear as Trevor looks beyond them .
Trevor drew only lines .
There was no shading , just the lines of buildings , of windows in buildings , of concrete on the sidewalks , of leaves on trees .
Far - off lines can become difficult to make out , which is why Ryan attached the umbrella to his foot .
It helped guide Trevor 's right eye to lines in the pavement that disappeared as they receded in the distance .
One other contemporary artist , Robert Irwin , has explored the splitting of focus .
Writing about Irwin in his book Seeing Is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees , Lawrence Weschler quotes him explaining that he trained himself by " placing a dot on a window and gazing both at and beyond it , thus allowing two planes of focus , one for each eye . "
Irwin played with perception in a famous series of paintings of dots and discs , but the Oakes twins are alone in using split focus to draw perspective .
They did n't know this until after they 'd done it .
The easel the Oakeses invented to impose image on paper has forerunners that go back centuries .
Their device is the first , however , that requires neither mirrors nor lenses .
About 25 years into the 15th century , Dutch painting took a dramatic turn toward realism that can be seen in the works of Robert Campin and Jan Van Eyck .
At the same time mirrors began showing up in Dutch paintings — they 'd apparently become a part of everyday Dutch life .
These were convex mirrors , but a convex mirror turned over is a concave mirror , which could be used by artists to render detail and perspective with vastly greater precision .
( Painters belonged to the same guild as mirror makers then , so they would have known what mirrors could do . )
According to Charles Falco , professor of optical sciences at the University of Arizona , a concave mirror has the same optical properties as a lens , in that it can concentrate and focus light rays .
To demonstrate , Falco has suggested aiming a shaving mirror to reflect the morning sunlight onto a bathroom wall still in shadows : " Move the mirror in and out till things cast there onto the wall come into focus , and what you 'll get is a technicolor perfect image of the world outside . "
Next came the camera obscura , frequently mentioned in Leonardo da Vinci 's notebooks .
The artist sits in a darkened chamber viewing his subject , who is outside the chamber in bright light , through a small open window .
Light enters the chamber , is collected on a lens mounted near the artist , and projected upside down onto the opposite wall , where paper or canvas has been set up .
This process allows the artist to fix essential details , such as the corners of the eyes , the edges of the nose , and the mouth and ears of a face being painted .
Once these parameters are sketched , the artist works from eye , fleshing out a more complete portrait .
The concept of the camera obscura was written about by Aristotle in Problemata , as early as 350 BC .
Then there 's the camera lucida , patented in 1806 by William Hyde Wollaston , an optician , chemist , and physicist .
The primary component of the camera lucida is a prism , placed above the paper or canvas , in which an image of the scene to be rendered is captured .
The artist looks through the image in the prism to the paper and draws — or traces , in a sense — what he sees .
The device , still in use , is difficult to use , but some master it .
Oxford art historian Martin Kemp wrote in The Science of Art ( 1992 ) that Sir John Herschel , a skilled draftsman , " achieved splendid results over a number of years with his camera lucida . "
In the 1830s , Herschel and his wife , Margaret , used a camera lucida to create a series of celebrated botanical illustrations that in 1998 were published in the volume Flora Herscheliana .
The Herschels ' use of the camera lucida is certain .
David Hockney , in his 2002 book Secret Knowledge : Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters , set off a tempest by arguing that work by painters as exalted as Caravaggio , Velazquez , and Ingres also exhibits what " the optical look . "
This step toward realism crossed Europe so quickly in the 15th century that Hockney believes technological innovation must have been involved .
Grounding his theory in the science of Charles Falco , he observed how repeating patterns in certain paintings , such as the intricate carpet in Lorenzo Lotto 's Husband and Wife , go in and out of focus .
He and Falco identified varying vanishing points in these paintings , and attributed them to the shifting of a lens to refocus on different elements of the subject .
Art historians who think the use of optics is cheating have resisted the Hockney - Falco thesis .
But as Hockney notes , " optics do not make marks , only the artist 's hand can do that , and it requires great skill .
And optics do n't make drawing any easier either , far from it .
. . .
But to an artist six hundred years ago optical projections would have demonstrated a new vivid way of looking at and representing the material world . "
Before Hockney , Martin Kemp had reasoned that painters of the time were drawn to science and would have considered it a point of pride to be proficient with optical devices .
The camera lucida eliminated the camera obscura 's projection of an image onto the picture plane , but it placed a prism between the artists ' eyes and their subjects .
In the Oakeses ' method , nothing but the paper comes between their eyes and what they see ; it is the paper itself that is bent into a concave surface , rather than a mirror or lens .
" David Hockney talks about the need for really bright lighting if you 're going to use optics , " says Ryan , " and that even when the camera obscura became portable , if there was n't bright enough light you would n't see an image at all .
But with your human eye looking at the world , we adjust . "
" We read Hockney 's book in 2006 , " says Trevor , " and it was immediately very inspiring and fascinating that there had been three other techniques used over the course of history since the 1400s on , and we recognized that this was another optical technique that allowed you to trace the world .
If you compare them directly , there are several formal differences , and some of the differences do make it more in common with your eye and with the way that humans see the world .
Because it 's spherically concave and because light rays approaching your eye are traveling perpendicular to a sphere , it is more in harmony with our eye than using a flat picture plane .
A flat plane is not at all related to the shapes you see and the physics of light . "
Before reading Hockney , Ryan says , " We were n't focused .
We were aware of perspective as a mathematical rule , and that was it .
Even how a camera lens worked was n't something that we put a lot of thought into . "
The slow steps the brothers have taken toward their understanding of vision and light began with a series of collaborative projects at Cooper Union in New York , the art school the Colorado natives both graduated from in 2004 .
They began by building a dome of matchsticks , glued together layer by layer , with the red tips forming the shell .
" Building that sculpture was the first time we started to think about other entities in nature that shared that spatial structure , the structure of a bunch of rays perpendicular to a sphere , " says Trevor .
" And the first things that came to mind were light rays being emitted from a point source , like a lightbulb , which has a spherical burst of rays .
And then also , light rays coming into your pupil , condensing back to a point .
It was building that structure that really got us to wrap our minds around the science involved , and to start considering the physics of it more specifically . "
That same semester in 2002 they also discovered map tacks — specifically some round , reflective ones that were being used to pin drawings to the wall of a Chelsea gallery .
" The drawings themselves were n't that interesting , " says Ryan , " but the tacks holding the drawings to the wall were fascinating . "
Trevor adds , " Because they were so small they 're kind of like a mathematical point .
A point , of course , has no dimensions and can't really manifest , but if you lean very close to the map tacks you could see the profile of yourself and the bright spots of the lights in the room , and you could theoretically see that the entire room was reflected on that surface .
You could then infer that the light rays were traveling from every point in the interior of the room to every other point on the surface of the room , that the light was behaving in a much more complex way than what we were actually seeing , that the air was hyperfilled with rays just going in every single direction , and that our eyes were only pinching out a thin slice . "
Trevor presented a map tack as a sculpture for class .
" It did n't go over very well , " he says .
" Some said uninteresting , others said incredibly uninteresting .
The professor said it was worth a D . "
The twins ' next project together was a curved sculpture several feet long made of corrugated cardboard .
" The corrugation of the cardboard makes it more like a three - inch - thick wall that 's curved like the crust of a sphere , " Trevor says .
" Because all of the corrugation faces forward , toward the viewer , the corrugation is perpendicular to the crust of that sphere , or the eye viewing it . "
From a distance of about six feet " the entire sculpture becomes transparent , like an open window .
You can look straight through it . "
This sculpture acknowledged that the world is seen through a sphere , the eye , and that light rays are oriented to the crust of that sphere .
The easel the brothers now use was built on the same principle .
The cardboard sculpture got a B .
Two months later an insight hit them , so to speak , right between the eyes .
" A pretty key moment was noticing the profile of your nose , " says Trevor .
" As you 're looking forward , you can see a profile of your nose on either the left or right side of your vision .
If you close either eye it becomes more apparent .
. . .
Too far past the left profile is this area where only the left eye can see , and too far past the right profile is where only the right eye can see .
You have these two monocular zones on either side and then one binocular zone in the middle . "
With a laser pointer and paper tacked to a far wall , the brothers took turns mapping each other 's monocular zones .
Finally came the discovery of the ghost image .
Holding his sketchbook waist high and standing directly above a leaf on the ground , Trevor found that when he focused on the sketchbook to draw , a double image of the leaf appeared beyond it , and when he focused on the leaf , a double image of the sketchbook appeared .
As he looked down and placed the sketchbook in front of his left eye while looking at the leaf with his right , Trevor 's visual cortex attempted to merge paper and leaf into one image , creating an overlap that allowed him to essentially see through the paper and trace the leaf in detail .
" The ghost image was the pivotal realization for what then turned into the method to capture the world in its proportions , scale , and diminishing perspective , exactly as your eyes see , " he says .
" This is a way of rendering realism that takes proportion , location , and perspective as a given and automatically gets them right .
" We noticed the double image a few years before we ever realized its potential for tracing .
At first we just noticed that the phenomenon occurred , and that it meant that within the three - dimensional space your eyes are looking into , there is only one point at which you can perfectly line up , and that everything else moving away from that point becomes shifted into a double image more and more .
Even from that point we did n't see how far it was going to go or that we would be focusing on doing these panoramic drawings . "
Once the brothers realized they could exploit the double image to render perspective on paper , the easel was n't far behind .
" You need to hold your head and the paper very still , " Trevor continues , " because if I move my sketchbook just a little bit , lines will start landing in the wrong spot .
And when I move my head , things become skewed out .
Then we realized that we could n't use a regular flat sheet of paper because after you stabilize your head , the distance from your eye to the very center of the paper will be shorter than the distance from your eye to the corner of the paper , and that would cause objects in the corner to enlarge in scale and you would get a kind of ballooning distortion and bubbling effect , " similar to the distortion caused by lenses .
" So instead , the paper needed to be spherically concave so that the length from your eye to the paper was equidistant for all points on the surface of the paper .
We had all these grand ideas of what we could do with it , and the natural course of things led to building our first easel , in May of 2004 . "
The original easel was made of malleable armature wire and survived only two drawings before it got bent out of shape .
Early versions involved a chin rest , which helped keep the head stationary but was uncomfortable .
The frame and headpiece came later .
It was Ryan 's idea to build it out of rigid sheet metal and attach it to a tripod .
They enlisted the help of their cousin Willis Bowman , a machinist in Ohio with a barn full of metalworking tools .
" It was a pretty labor - intensive process , " says Ryan .
" We had conceptualized it but we had n't seen it in action , or seen what it would really look like . "
They wound up having to carve a dome from a tree stump on a lathe , learn spherical trigonometry , and create a template for cutting sheet metal .
" We assembled it on the final day and welded it together , and then all of a sudden this thing was there .
We had been planning it in our heads and we had some sketches , but to have it there was kind of surprising .
" As soon as we got it back to New York it took over our lives , " Ryan continues .
" All of a sudden this thing had shown up and it required us putting a lot of attention into it . "
The twins ' upstairs neighbor , Tiffany Schauer , immediately commissioned an easel drawing .
An environmental lawyer who founded the nonprofit firm Our Children 's Earth , Schauer had recently become interested in arts patronage .
" Tiffany just got the ball rolling , " says Ryan .
" We had three of these concave drawings in our apartment in a flat file [ the drawings are exhibited concave but can be stored flat ] , but we had n't been getting much mileage out of them and we had n't had them scanned .
The scans are about $ 200 apiece . "
Schauer picked up the tab for the scans .
" As soon as we had digital files it opened up a whole new world .
We were able to start printing them and making reproductions .
It allowed us to really distribute those images in a way that we would n't have .
. . .
You know , $ 600 is not a ton of money , but we would n't have taken on that expenditure with our bare - bones income . "
Aside from the easel drawings , Ryan and Trevor have individual bodies of work .
With a homemade brush , Ryan has created a series of paintings consisting of calligraphic glyphs .
Individually , the glyphs suggest the shadows of tiny dancers ; collectively they suggest abstract landscapes .
Ryan describes them as explorations of what his mind perceives the interior of his head to look like — the feeling of his tongue in his mouth and the space it occupies , the view of the backs of his eyes — intuitive diagrams of his internal self .
Trevor 's works are pipe cleaner weavings that , although he did n't realize it when he was making them , follow the principles of hyperbolic geometry — a non-Euclidean geometry of curved , diverging lines .
The elaborate weavings resemble beds of coral .
It was these structures that led the brothers to Margaret and Christine Wertheim , also twins and founders of the Institute for Figuring in Los Angeles , an organization ( and place ) " dedicated to the poetic and aesthetic dimensions of science , mathematics and the technical arts . "
In 2005 the Wertheims , who 're responsible for the Crocheted Coral Reef Project that visited Chicago a year ago and continues to tour the U.S. , were giving a lecture on hyperbolic geometry at the Kitchen in New York City .
With them was Daina Taimina , a Cornell mathematician who 'd invented an algorithmic process for hyperbolic crocheting .
" The dean of the art school at Cooper Union purchased one of the pipe cleaner sculptures from our senior show , a very big deal at the time , and a few months later he forwarded us an invitation to a lecture by the Wertheim sisters , " says Trevor .
" The dean had recognized the similarity in form between my pipe cleaner weaving and their crochetings on the invitation .
I also immediately recognized the connection and decided to attend the lecture with one of my weavings , and to introduce it kind of quietly afterward .
. . .
But toward the end of the lecture Margaret announced that the Kitchen was going to close promptly when the event was over , so no one was going to be able to hang around .
A friend that was with us said , ' Just raise your hand during the question - and - answer session . ' "
" I was really on edge , " Ryan interjects , " because Trevor 's thinking about presenting this sculpture to the whole audience and I 'm like , ' That is so obnoxious , ' you know .
These people are here with their own work , their own hyperbolic stuff , and that 's totally uncalled - for if you do that .
But our friend was there saying , ' Just do it , just go ahead ! '
They said , ' OK , we 'll take one more question , ' and he raises his hand and luckily gets called on and stands up and says , ' I 'm a Cooper Union student and I have a similar project with a similar form , ' and they say , ' Do you have it with you ? '
' As a matter of fact I do . '
So he sort of hoists this thing up and it's all glinting orange and green , and oohs and ahhs go through the audience . "
Ryan laughs .
" It was very well received , and they called him down to the stage .
They were all intrigued , and people were taking photos .
Immediately following , Christine Wertheim invited us to dinner , and on the spot said that they would like to commission a pipe cleaner weaving . "
Trevor adds , " Christine also later told us that when I was speaking , she was thinking to herself , ' Oh God , another art student who wants his 15 minutes of fame . '
But then after we showed her the project she was inviting us out to dinner with mathematicians . "
The Wertheims also invited them to lecture at the Institute for Figuring in June 2007 .
The trip was funded by Tiffany Schauer .
The Oakes twins , the Wertheims also decided , needed to meet Lawrence Weschler .
The Wertheims knew Weschler through David Wilson 's Museum of Jurassic Technology in LA , where they 'd curated shows .
Weschler wrote about the museum in his 1995 best seller Mr. Wilson 's Cabinet of Wonder .
They introduced Weschler to Ryan and Trevor in New York last November .
He was charmed .
" I want to see what you 're doing , " said Weschler , " but more importantly , Hockney needs to see what you 're doing . "
Hockney is another of Weschler 's friends — they met in the early 80s when Hockney read Weschler 's book on Robert Irwin and invited the author to his studio to discuss it .
The discussion never ended , and next month Knopf will publish his True to Life : Twenty - Five Years of Conversation With David Hockney .
It 's being packaged with a reprint of the book on Irwin .
" After Thanksgiving , " Trevor continues , " Ren [ Weschler ] came over for a studio visit and we gave him a description of our observations and developments .
We were having conversations about perception and our sculptures , about the physics of light and all that was orchestrated and merged together into the perspective system , and he became enthusiastic about it . "
Weschler invited them to his Christmas party at New York University , where he heads the New York Institute for the Humanities .
" He said to bring a box of goodies to show everybody , " says Trevor , " so we did .
We brought a few miniaturized panoramic easel drawings and the matchstick sculpture and a bunch of photos , and he kind of just pushed people into our corner all night and had us explain what we were doing . "
Shortly after that Weschler set up a meeting for the Oakeses in LA , including the Wertheims , Hockney , Hockney 's aide David Graves , LA Museum of Contemporary Art director Jeremy Strick , and actor / author / sleight - of - hand master Ricky Jay .
" It was a little forum on perspective , " says Ryan .
Again , Schauer paid their way .
" Amazingly , " Trevor adds , " all of the pieces fell into place at the right time . "
Weschler is also artistic director of the Chicago Humanities Festival , and in that capacity he commissioned the twins to spend July in Chicago creating several panoramic drawings .
They 'll be exhibited October 29 through November 30 at the Spertus Institute , where the twins will lecture on November 9 as part of the Humanities Festival .
( Irwin will lecture a few hours earlier at the Art Institute . )
The Spertus show , organized by Weschler and Spertus director Rhoda Rosen , will also feature a drawing of the facade of the new Spertus building on South Michigan , the easel and its imperfect predecessors , and their early projects from Cooper Union .
And a six - foot enlargement of their Cloud Gate drawing will be exhibited on the plaza just east of the sculpture itself .
Since the easel came to be , many things have " fallen into place " for the twins .
Alice Gallen , an IT consultant for Accenture was walking past Cloud Gate in July , while the Oakeses were on the plaza .
She stopped , thinking the easel was a public viewfinder and wondering why Trevor was hogging it .
Upon clearing things up with the twins , she discovered they knew some people she was interested in — Weschler and Irwin .
Gallen invited the twins to dinner at her place in Marina Towers , and Ryan and Trevor found themselves looking down at the Chicago River as it bends at Wacker Drive — the exact scene they had been considering for their next drawing .
Gallen invited them to set up shop in her condo .
" She has a deck that overlooks the river , " said Ryan .
" It worked out really well . "
The easel has become an ambitious member of the Oakes family , urging them out to see the sights and insisting that they reconsider what they see .
" It 's shepherding us through the world , " say Ryan .
" It sort of prescribed in a quick sweeping arc many things that were possible . "
Trevor agrees .
" Once we had it and stepped out to do a drawing we found ourselves placed in one location for the entire length of the day .
Over the course of the day we watched the flow of people on the sidewalk change .
We watched bursts during rush hour happen .
The same person would leave their office , run an errand , walk back past , and you would see them on both segments of their journey .
You just get to observe the world from a single vantage point and pay attention to what goes on in a way that you otherwise would n't because you yourself would be in flux .
You yourself would be moving .
I think in that way it was saying , ' Here 's your reason , your motivation , to stand still for five days and watch everything that happens from this point in space . '
It fills you in about all sorts of aspects of humanity that you otherwise do n't get to see . "
" The easel also became a key , " Ryan says .
" All of a sudden we were able to get access to some remote roof terrace , or all these places in New York that you 'd never see .
It helps us see in a different way — or it has n't helped us , it 's allowed us .
After we 'd done the first few cityscape drawings I could feel the volume of that space much more wholly than previously . "
That feeling translates to the finished product .
Concave easel drawings the twins have done from on high in New York have an almost vertiginous quality , particularly the one from atop the Chrysler Building .
Their Marina Tower drawing , the only Chicago scene rendered from a high vantage point , likewise captures the feeling of looking over the edge in a moment of lost balance .
Both twins can use the easel , but Trevor 's more comfortable with it than Ryan .
" It 's given us pause to look at the world , " Trevor says , " and just the act of looking really keenly , looking at details , tuning in on what 's happening in the distance , sharpens your vision . "
" Before , " says Ryan , " you sort of perceive the idea that you see flat — you 're used to looking at flat pictures and photographs .
But having seen the world imaged accurately on a spherical surface allows you , when viewing the world , to think of it in a bigger way , more true to perception , more volumized . "
To look through the grid of the easel and feel your eyes fight against their nature is to be reminded of the physicality of seeing .
But simply looking at the Oakses ' work can do something similar .
" It 's always really nice , " says Trevor , " to hear people respond to it by saying ' I see the world differently because of it , ' or ' I feel like I have different eyes because of it . '
It 's great .
Our whole thing was just trying to crack the mysteries of the universe , or something .
When we found the double image we were like ' Oh , cool , something we 're not supposed to see , yet it 's something that happens .
Let 's draw this . '
And then you realize that it 's the perfect tool to ultimately capture reality in a way that is so simple it 's almost cheating . "

Computational Statistics and Data Analysis Volume 52 , Issue 10 ( 2008 ) に Excel 2007 特集がある 。
まず最初の論文 ( B.D. McCullough and David A. Heiser ,
On the accuracy of statistical procedures in Microsoft Excel 2007 , pp.4570-4578 ) のアブストラクト ：
Excel 2007 , like its predecessors , fails a standard set of intermediate - level accuracy tests in three areas : statistical distributions , random number generation , and estimation .
Additional errors in specific Excel procedures are discussed .
Microsoft 's continuing inability to correctly fix errors is discussed .
No statistical procedure in Excel should be used until Microsoft documents that the procedure is correct ; it is not safe to assume that Microsoft Excel 's statistical procedures give the correct answer .
Persons who wish to conduct statistical analyses should use some other package .
要約：どうしょーもないから使うな。
次の A. Talha Yalta ,
The accuracy of statistical distributions in Microsoft ® Excel 2007 , pp.4579-4586 のアブストラクト：
We provide an assessment of the statistical distributions in Microsoft ® Excel versions 97 through 2007 along with two competing spreadsheet programs , namely Gnumeric 1.7.11 and OpenOffice.org Calc 2.3.0 .
We find that the accuracy of various statistical functions in Excel 2007 range from unacceptably bad to acceptable but significantly inferior in comparison to alternative implementations .
In particular , for the binomial , Poisson , inverse standard normal , inverse beta , inverse student ’s t , and inverse F distributions , it is possible to obtain results with zero accurate digits as shown with numerical examples .
要約：どうしょーもないから使うな。
次の B.D. McCullough , Microsoft Excel's ` Not The Wichmann - Hill ' random number generators , pp.4587-4593 のアブストラクト：
Microsoft attempted to implement the Wichmann - Hill RNG in Excel 2003 and failed ; it did not just produce numbers between zero and unity , it would also produce negative numbers .
Microsoft issued a patch that allegedly fixed the problem so that the patched Excel 2003 and Excel 2007 now implement the Wichmann - Hill RNG , as least according to Microsoft .
We show that whatever RNG it is that Microsoft has implemented in these versions of Excel , it is not the Wichmann - Hill RNG .
Microsoft has now failed twice to implement the dozen lines of code that define the Wichmann - Hill RNG .
昔のExcelの乱数は無茶苦茶だった 。Excel 2003 でMicrosoftはやっ とWichmann-Hillの乱数生成アルゴリズム（私のアルゴリズム事典にも載っている十数行で書ける簡単だがまともなアルゴリズム）に切り替えた（Microsoftの
Excel 2007 と Excel 2003 の RAND 関数について 参照。ただ しMicrosoft はWichmannの綴りを間違えている）。最初はバグっていて負の値を返したりしたため，パッチが出た。めでたしめでたし。じゃない。調べてみると，何かおかしい。Excel 2007になってもまだおかしい。Microsoftはたった十数行のアルゴリズムもまともにインプリメントできないんだ。
ほかにもチャートジャンクの話などがあるが，略。
追記 ：MicrosoftのExcelの統計関数の解説ページはみんな「統計関数を超えます」

Daniel Cowart of Bells , Tenn. , was one of two men charged in what officials called a white supremacist assassination plot .
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
In the summer of 2002 , the Pentagon ’s Office of Net Assessment ( ONA ) published an 85 - page monograph called “ Military Advantage in History ” .
Unusual for an office that is headed by Andrew Marshall , the Pentagon ’s “ futurist in chief , ” the study looks back to the past — way back .
It examines four empires , or “ pivotal hegemonic powers in history , ” to draw lessons about how the United States “ should think about maintaining military advantage in the 21st century . ”
Though unclassified , the study was held close to the vest ; a stamp on the cover limits its dissemination without permission .
Mother Jones obtained it only through a Freedom of Information Act request .
Though the report is far from revelatory , it provides a window into a mindset that unselfconsciously envisions the United States as the successor to some of history ’s most powerful empires .
The study looks a little like a high school text book , devoting chapters to Alexander the Great , Imperial Rome , Genghis Khan , and Napoleonic France and citing texts by Sun Tzu , Livy , and Jared Diamond .
It attempts to break down exactly how historic empires sustained their military might across continents and even centuries .
The study posits that the historical examples offer “ insights into what drives U.S. military advantage , ” as well as “ where U.S. vulnerabilities may lie , and how the United States should think about maintaining its military advantage in the future . ”
There is no one secret to world domination , however .
The Mongols ’ military advantage was rooted in their “ tactical and operational superiority ” ; the Macedonians ’ in the “ exceptional leadership ” of and “ cult of personality ” surrounding Alexander the Great ; Napoleon ’s in “ innovative operational concepts ” and “ information superiority ” ; and the Romans ’ in “ robust tactical doctrine ” and “ strong domestic institutions ” which were “ designed to incorporate conquered peoples as the empire grew . ”
In an extraordinary passage , the study cites the Roman experience — from over a millennium ago — as a precedent for America ’s long - term dominance : “ The Roman model suggests that it is possible for the United States to maintain its military advantage for centuries if it remains capable of transforming its forces before an opponent can develop counter - capabilities .
Transformation coupled with strong strategic institutions is a powerful combination for an adversary to overcome . ”
The report ’s language is jargon laden and opaque — a lance used by Macedonian horsemen is referred to as a “ primary weapon system . ”
That may be due to the methodology of “ net assessment , ” a fancy term for the ONA ’s approach to analyzing complicated real - world situations that is rooted in systems analysis and game theory .
Military author James Dunnigan compares it to engineering .
“ You take apart historical events , reassemble them as a simulation , and then tinker with the simulation until you can recreate the historical event accurately , ” he explains .
“ What that allows you to do is play out ‘ what if ? ’ situations :
What if Napoleon did this ?
What if Ghengis Khan did that ? ”
While the study was produced under the auspices of the ONA , its five authors work for government intelligence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton , and they wrote the study as part of a contract for the Defense Department ’s Information Assurance Technology Analysis Center .
Booz Allen won a 10 - year , $ 200 million cost - plus contract to establish and “ host ” that center in 1998 .
( In May , the Carlyle Group announced it will be taking over Booz Allen ’s government services arm . )
The original idea for the study predates the Bush administration .
Mark Herman , the Booz Allen vice president and war - game designer who is the study ’s lead author , recalls being asked to give a presentation on historical empires at one of Andrew Marshall ’s famous “ summer studies ” at the Naval War College in Newport , Rhode Island , in 1999 .
At that annual retreat , experts from government , academia , and beyond are invited to contemplate a big - picture question .
Newt Gingrich , for example , participated in the 1999 program , according to Herman .
He says that the ONA “ liked the presentation so much they felt it should be written down ” and expanded .
A earlier version of the report , titled “ Sustaining Military Dominance : Examples From Ancient History , ” was presented at the 2001 summer study and was later cited in a Maureen Dowd column .
The current version was published a year later .
Coming out of the Office of Net Assessment , the study ’s theme of military transformation is not surprising .
Described by the Washington Post as “ an obscure but highly influential unit , ” the ONA was established as an in - house think tank in 1973 .
Its founding director was Marshall , a strategist who achieved demigod status in the press after years of colorful profiles portraying him as a visionary .
( A 2002 article in the New York Times Magazine named Marshall the “ Yoda of the Rumsfeld Defense Department ” ; William Safire dubbed him “ the freshest mind in the Puzzle Palace . ” )
ONA specializes in trend spotting and forecasting military threats .
The office spent the 1980s exhaustively studying the US - Soviet balance ; recently , it has turned to topics as diverse as neuropharmacology , Islamic warfare , and the national security implications of climate change .
Now in his 80s , Marshall has been a chief proponent of the so - called Revolution in Military Affairs , a cause also championed by Donald Rumsfeld that emphasizes speed and increased use of precision weapons and advanced communications technology .
In 2001 , Marshall was given a high - profile assignment by Rumsfeld to conduct an extensive review of the military and the possibilities of military transformation .
Most striking is how the study conceives of the United States in imperial terms .
“ You ’ll see some neoconservatives at the beginning of the Bush administration crowing that ‘ we do have an empire , let ’s just come out of the closet and say we do , ' ” said Ivan Eland , the author of a book on America ’s “ informal empire ” and the director of the Center on Peace & Liberty at the Independent Institute , on hearing a description of the study .
“ But the administration never did that because empire does n’t sell well with the public . ”
After reviewing the study at Mother Jones ‘ request , William Hartung , director of the Arms and Security Initiative at the New America Foundation , said he was struck by its “ arrogance and immorality . ”
“ The presumption that the United States should rule the world , sword at the ready , for the foreseeable future is an unacceptable basis for a just , even - handed foreign policy . ”
Even coming from an office vaunted for its intellectual seriousness , “ Military Advantage in History ” often reads like it was meant as window dressing for the Revolution in Military Affairs agenda — sometimes at the expense of historical fact .
( Herman says that the theme of transformation emerged naturally from his research . )
After reviewing a section that identifies five discrete “ transformations ” of the Roman military over a period of 1,000 years , Lee Brice of Western Illinois University , president of the Society of Ancient Military Historians , described it as “ so completely incorrect as to be useless . ”
In general , Brice noted , “ it is inappropriate to apply modern concepts of systems theory , doctrine , and strategy to ancient armies .
That required a level of planning and centralization that simply did not exist . ”
Eland speculates that a study like this would “ get warped by the military - industrial - congressional complex into more money for weapons . ”
Furthermore , he says , it ignores the economic implications of military expansion .
“ The Office of Net Assessment is doing this to show , ‘ Well , gee , these other empires transformed themselves , they were successful , we need to do the same thing , ' ” Eland says .
“ Well that ’s going to cost big bucks , and that will cause economic overstretch .
People say it ca n’t happen to us since we have such a big economy , but every empire has said that . ”
It is unclear how the study has been used ; the Office of Net Assessment declined a request for an interview .
Herman says only that “ a whole bunch of [ copies ] went out to the government . ”
The idea that contemporary society can or should try to find direct guidance in the past has been assailed by some historians .
The American historian Bernard Bailyn wrote of “ an obvious kind of presentism , which at its worst becomes indoctrination by historical example . ”
But the ONA study charges ahead , plumbing the past for contemporary lessons .
An extraordinary color - coded table in the study ’s conclusion attempts to literally “ map ” the historical findings to the United States with an eye toward “ enduring dominance . ”
( See image above . )
Several historians who reviewed the study differed on its quality and meaning .
Walter Scheidel , a Stanford professor of classics and the coauthor of a forthcoming survey of ancient empires , called it “ a successful distillation of relevant information and scholarship complemented by very interesting systematic analysis . ”
Others found the scholarship to be shoddy and superficial .
Pamela Crossley , a Dartmouth historian who teaches on the Mongols , described the chapter on Genghis Khan as mostly “ an accumulation of popularly transmitted misconceptions . ”
She also noted the study ’s “ amazingly strange spelling ‘ Chengis . ' ”
Brice , the ancient military historian , said the text suffered from “ an intense , myopic habit of wanting to make the ancient world fit into modern stereotypes . ”
He compares it with “ much lower - undergraduate - level work . ”

At VentureBeat ’s Downturn Roundtable event this morning , Kleiner Perkins ’ John Doerr came prepared with a list of the top things that start - up CEOs should do .
He surveyed 18 of Kleiner ’s companies , and here ’s what they suggest [ update : Doerr has since added an eleventh point ] :
Act now .
Act with speed .
Raise money .
Get a loan , secure financing .
Focus , cut or sell .
Protect the vital core of the business .
But use a scalpel not an ax .
Be surgical .
Protect the vital core of the company .
Cut once , deeper than you think .
Make sure you have at least 18 months of cash .
Or more — on a conservative revenue forecast .
Defer facility expansions .
Do n’t spend money on tech infrastructure , such as new software or computers .
Doerr noted that Andy Bechtolsheim ’s new startup , Arista uses Google Docs ( free web office software ) .
Reevaluate your R&D priorities .
Renegotiate any contracts that you can .
Everything is negotiable .
Remember , everyone in the organization should be selling , from the receptionist to the engineers .
Offer people equity instead of cash e.g. in place of bonuses .
( You can do this with outside vendors as well ) .
Secure your cash .
Treasuries , or treasury backed securities , are more secure than money market funds .
For your revenue plan , develop and obsess on leading indicators — e.g. bookings , unique visitors , conversions .
Over - communicate with everyone — employees , investors , partners and particularly customers .
Do n’t sugar coat things , communicate your resolve .
Angel investor Ron Conway added a key twelfth point :
Be open - minded to mergers and acquisitions .
Always a good tip .

What a raving loud mouth beoch who COULD NOT back up 1 of her points except trying to " blame the other guy " otherwise known as the Washington General Democrappers .
She definitely deserves credit for going to the O'Reilly school of pig headed interviewing that repeatedly interupts the guest if they do not support their narrow - minded neo-con Republican bushit opinionated views .
What lying loser who REFUSES TO INVESTIGATE THE FACTS AND IS INCAPABLE OF TELLING THE TRUTH .

Fox news " interviews " are characterized by shouting down anyone who offers facts and opinions contrary to the fascist propaganda and lies that Fox espouses .
Everyone knows this .
Her statement that the media would be all over this if Republicans were behind this so - called voter fraud --- in actuality " registration fraud " is NOT the same --- is an outright lie .
The media , like obedient attack dogs have been all over this bogus and souped ACORN issue .
Everybody knows this , even the citizens of Russia , yet it is somehow absent from mainstream media discussion
Yet the mainstream media , with its right - bent , has been irresponsibly negligent in reporting the problems of electronic voting machines ( and , defying statistically impossible results that mysteriously always favor Republican candidates ) .
I find myself regretting how Barack Obama response to John McCain 's ACORN statement and reenacting what he should have said , as if it was my mistake .
I wish his response was something like this : " You were the keynote speaker for ACORN in 2006 .
You were for it , and now four weeks before the election , you are against it .
To address this question , yes , I believe in election transparency , as most Americans do , I 'm sure , including ACORN .
A greater threat to our democracy are unreliable electronic voting machines that can invisibly alter election results .
If you support the integrity of American elections , I suggest you visit bradblog.com and blackboxvoting.org "

I think Ms. Ingraham 's law degree needs to be revoked .
Apparently she has n't been following along too closely .
Had she been , she would have known about the Dannahey Report , citing the DOJ for violating their own internal procedures in the firing of those 9 attorneys under AG Gonzales .
Attorneys who were fired for not prosecuting politically motivated , wholly bogus " voter fraud " cases .

Laura Ingraham is gonna bust a gasket when Obama reinstates truth into these shows .
She 's a vacuous mouth piece , that like other conservative pundits parrots the GOP talking points .
She 's a bitter , angry , defeated educated liar , she knows better .
She knows Acorn is a functioning political force in registration that benefits the Democrats and as such , her goal is to dismantle its effectiveness .
Her veil attempts at genuine concern of voter fraud is transparently and blatantly a partisan act and it is part and parcel of the GOP 's playbook attempt to suppress voters .
Her persona is a Lying Palin idiot clone regurgitating the same false accusations that the Rovianian campaign instructs her on .
What is it with GOP females , that they go along with these MANdated tactics that are n't working any longer on the American public .

To the trained eye , Flannery was on top of her the entire time .
But O'Reilly 's audience is not ' the trained eye ' .
I imagine she came off to the Factor viewers as entirely credible , and she probably sealed it with them at the end when she was demanding to know why they should n't have to produce a driver 's license , why that would be voter suppression , something which he did n't answer - it was a diversion , and he pointed that out , but that 's not going to make a difference to the pinheads .
She did the classic Republican tactic of muddying the water .
Personally , just because of the audience , I think Ingraham wins this one .

KIRA wonderful to know you 're still fighting the good fight .
It 's such a tonic to know that so many wonderful people ( like yourself ) are still giving of their time and effort to fight for true and transparent democracy in America .
From afar I have watched for eight years the downward spiral of your once great country .
Hoping that the next outrage would be the one that stirred the American people into action but alas ...
And now a moment in history has arrived for good men and women to stand up and to fight for change .
To support a leader who displays intelligence not ignorance , compassion not contempt , consideration not confusion .
Lets hope that history shows that November 4th 2008 was the turning point at which that downward spiral reversed .
mick in nz P.S. Brad has shown a stamina for uncovering the truth that is truly amazing , if anybody deserves a " Freedom Medal " its that man , an American you should all be proud of .

Where are the pictures of McFailin 's rallies ?
Too embarrassing ?
Too telling ?

I agree 100 % with your PS .
Brad 's the man and does deserve a Medal .

Yeah , but Ingraham spoke more loudly than Flannery , interrupted him continuously , and basically succeeded at making him have to stop mid-sentence and smile , while waiting for her to finish interrupting his thought processes .
So she " wins . "
Right ?
Besides , how can we trust someone who smiles during a " discussion " of such a weighty matter as massive voter fraud ?!
On a more serious note , I 'd like to ask Ingraham how she , an attorney , can state , without faltering , that it simply could n't be the case that there are " all these reports " if they are n't all true .
Did she have to practice that in front of a mirror ?
In front of other Fox " news " " professionals ? "
Or is she able to temporarily disconnect her intellect from her mouth ?
I 'm wondering about this possibility , as a mother of a teen - aged girl who is also able to do this .
Has Ingraham simply held onto this ability since her teen - aged years ?
Or did she have to regress back to those days when we 're all hellbent on fooling our parents into thinking we think one thing , when we really know better .

People who truly wish to debate an issue and are convinced that the facts support their stance do not feel the need to prevent their counterpart on the issue from completing a thought .
I have noticed Bill O'Reilly , Rush Limbaugh , Laura Ingraham and almost every other neo-con mouthpiece seldom allow guests who disagree with their point of view to complete a sentence .
I will say this , it is much easier to watch O'Rieilly because he seldom even allows the opposition to even make an appearance .

You liberals are right about Fox News being biased , but is n't CNN , MSNBC , ABC , CBS and NBC ?
Palin is NOT qualified by Charlie Gibson 's and Katie Couric 's standards - nor by mine .
But if the same standards are applied to Obama he is n't qualified either .
Why can't liberals admit that ?
The truth is who cares about being qualified ?
Liberals do n't want Obama because he 's qualified , they want him because they like what he stands for .
Why was n't the liberal press talking about being qualified in 1992 when an incumbent president with 4 years exp , who had been the head of the CIA , an ambassador to the U.N. , a congressman , a V.P and who 18 months before losing the race for re-election had had a 93 % approval rating - with all of that experience lost to the governor of a smaller state with very little qualifications and a history of being accused as a womanizer ?
Vote for whoever you want , but please stop this b.s. about being qualified .

“ More than two centuries ago , the Founders of this country set forth a procedure for Congress to follow in the event of grave abuse of power by the Chief Executive .
That process is impeachment .
In the face of the monumental deceit and disregard for the Constitution that we have witnessed on the part of the President over the past seven years , Congressman Kucinich ’s initiation of this process is neither fanciful nor futile , neither vengeful nor vindictive ; it is the sober fulfillment of his sworn duty as a Congressman to follow the law without regard to personal consequence and misguided political stratagem .
It is , quite simply , an act of patriotism . ”
“ ” Elizabeth de la Vega , Former Federal Prosecutor
and author of United States v. George W. Bush et. al .
“ This collection of impeachable offenses should be viewed as a sampling of the crimes and abuses of President George W. Bush and his subordinates .
Bush has had many accomplices — first and foremost Vice President Cheney .
But our Founders created a single executive precisely so that we could hold that one person accountable for the actions of the executive branch .
It is high time we did so , and millions of Americans will be urging their representatives to support the effort being led by Congressman Kucinich .
“ These articles establish , and hearings would establish further , that President Bush was “ ˜the decider ’ behind countless abuses of power .
And , of course , his public comments have time and again advertised his indifference to the laws he is violating .
Not only does overwhelming evidence show us that Bush knew his claims about WMDs to be false , but the president has shown us that he considers the question of truth or falsehood to be laughably irrelevant .
When Diane Sawyer asked Bush why he had claimed with such certainty that there were so many weapons in Iraq , he replied : ‘ What ’s the difference ?
The possibility that [ Saddam ] could acquire weapons ,
If he were to acquire weapons , he would be the danger . ’
“ What ’s the difference ?
Hundreds of thousands of corpses and a fatal blow to the rule of law among nations .
That ’s the difference .
Unless we remove impeachment from the Constitution by failing to exercise it , in which case truth will no longer matter any more than justice or peace . ”
“ ” David Swanson , creator of ImpeachCheney.org , Washington Director of Democrats.com and co-founder of the AfterDowningStreet.org
“ Overload is the main problem ” ” I call it outrage fatigue .
The sheer multitude , not to mention magnitude , of impeachable offenses tends to dull the senses .
The opportunity to dig into just one or two provided some space and focused the mind .
“ At the same time , the deeper one digs , the more unimaginable the dirt that comes up .
Earlier , I had not taken the time to sift through the abundant evidence of the unconscionable ways in which George Bush and George Tenet teamed up ” ” including , in Tenet ’s case , lying under oath ” ” to stave off charges of misfeasance / malfeasance before the attacks on 9/11 .
“ The Founders pledged their lives , their fortunes , and their sacred honor to create a system in which we could protect ourselves from unbridled power .
Today , we cannot let a 21st Century string of abuses and usurpations stand without challenge .
“ But the experience of the past several years shows that there is a very high hurdle in our way : no Common Sense .
I refer , of course , to the courageous independent journalism of the likes of Tom Paine who stirred the innate dignity of Americans toward sacrifice for independence and freedom .

“ In my view , impeachment proceedings are essential to :
* Reestablish the separation of powers in our Constitution as a check on the so - called unitary executive
* Prevent a budding ” ” and catastrophic ” ” US attack on Iran by exposing it as yet another war of aggression against a country posing no threat to the US ;
* Call attention to the blood already drained from our civil liberties and staunch the bleeding .

“ President Bush , Cheney and other US officials have violated numerous domestic and international laws governing crime of aggression , war crime , torture , etc. , and they should be not only impeached by the US Congress but also be prosecuted by a special prosecutor , to the full extent of the law before or after impeachment .

“ The breadth of impeachable offenses committed by the Bush / Cheney administration is likely unparalleled in our nation ’s history .
Equally unparalleled , and in many cases even more alarming and outrageous , is the lack of accountability brought to the perpetrators of these High Crimes and Misdemeanors .
It is the Constitutional duty of members of Congress ” ” members from any political party ” ” to bring such accountability , particularly when the list of crimes began with the very acts that brought this administration into office during their elections , and right up through today when the same sort of crimes continue , and are in place to try and affect our next Presidential Election .
“ This is not about politics , it ’s about the Constitutional duty of Congress .
If a line in the sand is not drawn immediately and clearly in the face of such corruption and disdain for our American values , such as the Rule of Law , the historical bar for criminality in our Executive Branch will have been forever lowered , no matter who happens to serve in the White House in the future . ”

December 02 , 2012 | Dead Malls , Wisconsin | Posted by Prange Way
Well , hey .
Remember me ?
It ’s been a while , I know .
But I ’m back , with a new story .
Stevens Point , Wisconsin , is a city of 26,000 located in the center of the state .
Its major exports are college graduates from the University of Wisconsin - Stevens Point , one of 13 public four - year Universities in the state , and beer from Point Brewery , which I ’m partial to .
A decent - sized paper mill and a few Insurance companies round out the economy here , among other businesses and services .
And , of course , the Stevens Point area once had a mall .
Heck , there were even two in the area .
Now they have none .
Zero. Zilch .
Nada .
The big goose egg .
The Stevens Point area ’s first mall was located in suburban Plover , a smaller city located just south of Stevens Point , and it opened in 1984 .
I missed seeing this one , but the interweb seems to indicate it was very small and later became part of Rainbow Falls Water Park , which itself ultimately closed in the early 2000s .
The mall was apparently demolished in 2003 .
It also seemed to have two names : Manufacturers Outlet Mall and Plover Mall .
Anyone know anything about it ?
Any photos ?
All I could find were some back issues of a local paper with a few advertisements mentioning stores in the mall .
Even before Plover Mall ( or whatever it was called ) appeared on the scene , a national mall developer ( sources indicate Melvin Simon and Associates ) had been interested in building a large - scale mall on the edge of Stevens Point , located near the interchange of US 10 and US 51 ( later I - 39 ) .
This proposal , introduced several years earlier in the late 1970s , was continually blocked by locals and ultimately lost steam as the years progressed .
A few years later , a different developer came up with a different proposal – to build a regional mall in the middle of downtown Stevens Point .
Several blocks of downtown Stevens Point would need to be razed for this development , but the developer marketed this under the careful guise of “ urban renewal ” because downtown Stevens Point was flagging , as were many cities ’ downtowns nationwide .
This proposal won the backing of locals because it meant their downtown , which had lost its luster in recent years , would once again be the vibrant , retail - dominant center they had known in the early and mid 20th century .
Groundbreaking for this downtown mall , named CenterPoint Mall , took place in September 1984 , and the mall ’s grand opening took place in October 1985 .
Anchored by two department stores , JCPenney and Green Bay - based ShopKo , with space for a third anchor , CenterPoint Mall opened with space for 60 smaller stores under one enclosed roof .
The 220,000 square foot mall was never very successful , despite ample parking in the middle of downtown and only a few blocks from the University of Wisconsin – Stevens Point , a campus with over 10,000 students .
The mall never filled to capacity , nor attracted the quality of stores present in larger regional malls such as Wausau Center , located just 30 minutes north of Stevens Point in Wausau .
Its decor was pretty standard for the mid-80s , with terrazzo - tiled floors , wood and brick layered storefronts , lengthy skylights , and many plants and trees poking out from sidewalk - style grates as well as from blocky wooden planters .
At night , the mall really lit up with marquee - style rows of lighting along the skylights , giving its interior a dramatic , lively appearance .
I sort of liked it , even though it was more than half dead for most of its existence .
The layout of the mall was a simple dumbbell with a somewhat narrow main walkway .
Pretty standard stuff for a city this size .
CenterPoint Mall was part of a larger trend and planning convention for urban renewal in cities across the country .
The logic for the convention came from the fact that suburban - style malls had been enjoying incredible success in suburbs and the peripheries of cities , at the expense of downtowns , which had been the vibrant focal point of cities since their inception .
Stores were rapidly leaving downtowns for these malls nationwide , and downtowns across the country were becoming outmoded derelict ghost towns .
Beginning in the 1960s , and through at least the mid-1980s , developers had success convincing cities to tear up their aging , decrepit downtowns to put in typical regional malls .
Many of these , especially in smaller cities , even had the same large , free parking lots shoppers enjoyed in the suburbs .
Cities were quick to give up space to these developments , unfortunately tearing down many historic landmarks in the process .
Ah , the prospect of progress , to make something old new again .
Examples of developments like these took place in Rochester , NY ( Midtown Plaza ) , Salem , OR ( Salem Center ) , White Plains , NY ( several malls ) , Santa Maria , CA ( Town Center ) , Milwaukee , WI ( Grand Avenue Mall ) , Columbus , OH ( City Center ) , and some even closer to Stevens Point in Oshkosh ( Park Plaza Mall ) , Appleton ( Avenue Mall ) , Wisconsin Rapids ( Rapids Mall ) , and Wausau ( Wausau Center ) .
The list obviously goes on , and there are many more examples nationwide .
The majority of these developments have struggled through the 1990s into the present , and many have been repurposed , are struggling , or have scaled back considerably .
Interestingly , Wausau Center is an exception , having enjoyed success and helping to create a more vibrant downtown in the process .
The dire implications of many of these developments result from improper positioning , pitting suburban interests against downtown constraints .
The suburban model of retail cannot easily be superimposed on its predecessor ( and arguably , its replacement as of late ) , the downtown .
First , by the time many downtowns were repurposed to house traditional enclosed malls , there was already a sort of competition on the periphery of these cities .
In Stevens Point ’s case , several suburban - style retail clusters had already popped up on the north , east , and south sides of the city .
The synergy of collective business , strip malls , and big box stores in these clusters helped them thrive , whereas there was no extra room downtown for these types of stores .
While the mall had free parking , the rest of downtown was still constrained by on - street parking , and by tearing up several blocks of downtown to put in the mall there was even less of a reason to shop at the more traditional streetfront downtown stores .
This leads to the next point – ripping up a downtown grid to put in a huge mall is simply poor planning style .
Several through - streets were truncated at the mall , creating a loss of flow through downtown .
Areas directly north of the mall were suddenly completely cut off from downtown by the several block long development .
As the years went on , Pointers chose to shop at the businesses in the peripheral retail districts , or in nearby Wausau or Appleton rather than their own mall .
As such , the mall was never fully occupied .
More importantly , it was thus never able to attract the kind of destination stores to get people in the doors .
There was never an American Eagle , Victoria ’s Secret , Pottery Barn , or the like .
In the late 1990s , a small apparel - oriented department store , Stage , opened as CenterPoint Mall ’s third anchor , on the north - facing side in the center .
Unfortunately , Stage was short - lived , and closed after only two years , in 2000 .
In 2003 , Dunham ’s Sports opened in this space , but they too only lasted a few years , moving to the US 10 strip on the east side for a bigger store .
Not long after , the mall began its long , slow spiral into oblivion .
A visit in 2010 yielded a total of five stores open .
In May of that year , JCPenney decided to call it quits and close their store , putting 39 folks out of work .
That same year , the Central Wisconsin Children ’s Museum departed as well .
You know your mall is dead when a museum leaves …
Meanwhile , the mall had been in foreclosure , and the remaining handful of tenants began to trickle out .
In May 2011 , the city of Stevens Point declared the mall blighted and condemned it .
This outraged Valley Bank of Iowa , who owned the mall in receivership , and they unsuccessfully sued the city to win back the mall .
The city then scored a $ 750,000 federal block grant to redevelop the mall , and in March 2012 , the doors to the mall were permanently closed to the public .
ShopKo is the only store to remain , as its building is technically owned and operated as a separate entity .
I happened to stop by CenterPoint Mall one hot day in June 2012 , and took the second set of photos that day .
I was actually unaware the mall was closed to the public , as ShopKo was open and the entrance next to ShopKo was propped open with some activity .
A maintenance man was doing something near the entrance , and a couple girls walked into the mall ahead of me , so I thought nothing of the fact that I should n’t have been there .
This changed , however , when I saw that the many fig trees planted in the mall ’s main walkway had lost most of their leaves onto the floor , creating a crunchy carpet of green and brown .
I was able to walk the entire length of the mall unquestioned , as the two girls who walked in ahead of me went into a dead store that appeared to be some makeshift community center or charity or something .
They hung out in the store talking and giggling , and I walked the length of the mall full of dead trees .
It was a strange , eerie moment .
I actually only discovered the mall was supposed to be shut when I got to the other end and saw notices on another set of entry doors that said the mall was permanently closed that March .
Whoops .
In all , it was a satisfying but bittersweet visit .
I got a chance to say goodbye to a mall I ’d visited several times , and one I was always perplexed by .
Demolition of CenterPoint Marketplace began in August 2012 , and today most of the mall is history .
Mid-State Technical College will move into a former portion of the mall in 2013 , and ShopKo is open for business as usual .
Third Street was extended through part of the former mall as it had been before the mall opened , almost exactly 27 years ago .
What ’s old is now new again , and as downtowns across the nation are experiencing a resurgence , Americans want denser , more urban developments and the organic well - designed community gathering space of a traditional downtown .

Easy Nofemela remembers the evening Amy Biehl died .
Coal stoves from township shacks had painted the twilight a sooty gray , signaling a cold winter ’s night .
Guguletu ’s main road throbbed with cars .
And a mob of angry young men was looking for symbols of white rule to destroy .
Then the men spotted Biehl , blond and blue - eyed , as she drove through the township in her yellow Mazda .
“ Rocks were being thrown at Amy ’s car .
She got out and ran , and she was stabbed right over there , ” Nofemela says , pointing to a patch of grass next to a service station , now planted with a small cross .
Nofemela remembers , 15 years later , because he was part of the mob that killed Amy Biehl .
What he did n’t know then was that Biehl was hardly a symbol of apartheid .
She was a Fulbright scholar studying the lives of women in South Africa , a 26 - year - old Stanford graduate with a plane ticket for home the next day , from an airport 10 minutes away .
Nofemela was one of four men convicted of murder for their actions that day .
They spent nearly five years in prison before being granted amnesty in 1998 by the country ’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission .
Today , Nofemela , a compact 37 - year - old with a shaved head and a quick wit , is the father of a young girl .
And , in an improbable tale of forgiveness and redemption , he and Ntobeko Peni , another of the men convicted of the murder , now work for the charity Biehl ’s parents founded here after she was killed .
It ’s a paradox that Linda Biehl , Amy ’s mother , prefers not to examine too closely .
“ I do n’t know how it happened , ” she says , sipping coffee at a cafe near her home in Newport Beach .
“ I ’m not going to begin to try to analyze it . ”
An engaging woman of 65 with a blond bob and a warm smile , she has grown exceptionally close to her daughter ’s killers .
“ Easy and Ntobeko are fascinating and I really do love them , ” she says .
“ They have given me so much . ”
Linda Biehl and her late husband , Peter , launched the Amy Biehl Foundation in 1994 with donations that arrived , unsolicited , from strangers moved by the news of their daughter ’s death .
Today , it runs after - school programs for youngsters in Guguletu and other townships and squatter camps that took root during the apartheid era on the Cape flats , about 10 miles east of Cape Town .
“ Our mission is to develop hope for children in the township and give them a future , ” says Kevin Chaplin , the foundation ’s managing director .
“ Our focus is to keep them away from violence and give them healthy activities that tap into the creative side of the brain . ”
The foundation operates out of donated office space in downtown Cape Town at the foot of Table Mountain , the picture - postcard city ’s most recognizable landmark .
Tributes to Amy Biehl and the foundation ’s work paint the walls .
A small television set loudly plays old news show clips of the Amy Biehl story -- her brutal death , her killers ’ convictions and amnesty , and the foundation ’s work -- for newly arrived volunteers .
Chaplin , 45 , left a successful career with a South African bank two years ago to oversee the charity , which runs township classes in music , dance , drama , crafts and sports .
“ It ’s been the most satisfying time in my life , ” he says .
But it is the Biehl family ’s story , he says , that resonates here and abroad .
“ A lot of people ca n’t even forgive the little things , ” he says .
“ If the Biehls can forgive four young men for the death of their daughter , then there ’s no excuse for the rest of us .
So we try to teach Amy Biehl ’s story -- that good can come out of tragedy .
We ’re really teaching people about the power of forgiveness . ”
Amy Biehl had been in South Africa for nearly a year on that August evening in 1993 , and she had amassed a wide circle of friends that included some of the nation ’s leading human rights lawyers and politicians , as well as township dwellers .
The country was nearing a historic moment .
Nelson Mandela was free after 27 years in prison and his African National Congress was poised to take control in the first free elections , scheduled for April 1994 .
Blacks , who outnumbered whites 5 to 1 , would be allowed to vote , ending four decades of white minority rule .
Biehl had been researching constitutions and bills of rights around the world for ANC leaders writing a new constitution , and she also was involved in voter education efforts .
She had just completed her Fulbright paper , “ Women in a Democratic South Africa : from Transition to Transformation . ”
But it was a bloody , restive period .
Right - wing whites were engaged in a desperate effort to retain power .
Four months before Biehl ’s death , a white supremacist had killed Chris Hani , the leader of the ANC ’s armed wing , in the driveway of his home .
Radical black groups , such as the Pan Africanist Congress , or PAC , were waging their own violent war against symbols of white rule , unconvinced that the government truly intended to give up power and suspicious of the ANC ’s plan for a multiracial democracy .
Biehl was driving friends home in Guguletu that day , when a mob of about 80 spilled out of a rally chanting the PAC ’s battle cry : “ One settler , one bullet . ”
In the group ’s argot , settlers were whites , specifically the white Afrikaners who had settled in South Africa 350 years earlier and , in 1948 , had imposed the system of racial separation known as apartheid .
Witnesses later identified three members of the mob , including Nofemela , 22 at the time , and they were charged and convicted of murder .
The prosecution asked for the death penalty , but the judge sentenced them to 18 years in prison , saying he thought they had a chance to become useful citizens “ despite the fact that they have shown no remorse . ”
A few months later , Peni , 20 at the time of the attack , was arrested , convicted and also sentenced to 18 years .
The Biehls thought the matter had been put to rest .
But in 1997 , four years after their daughter ’s death , the killers applied for a pardon before the nation ’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission .
The Biehls asked Archbishop Desmond Tutu , head of the commission , what they should do .
“ Just come and speak from your heart and talk about Amy , ” he said .
At the hearing , the men admitted their role in the killing and said they believed they had to kill whites to make South Africa “ ungovernable ” and force the government to relinquish power .
The Biehls read from their daughter ’s high school valedictory address and spoke of her commitment to helping South Africa .
But they extended an olive branch too .
“ We come to South Africa as Amy came , in a spirit of committed friendship , ” Peter Biehl said .
“ And make no mistake about it , extending a hand of friendship in a society which has been systematically polarized for decades is hard work at times . ”
Outside the hearing , the four men approached the Biehls and shook their hands .
“ They asked our forgiveness , ” Linda Biehl recalls .
“ Ntobeko told us that when we forgave him , he did n’t care if he got amnesty because he had just been freed . ”
All four men won pardons in 1998 , and a year later the Biehls went to see Nofemela and Peni in Guguletu .
“ It was like an adoption , ” Linda Biehl recalls .
“ That kind of broke the barrier .
These were just children who did n’t have a chance to have a childhood . ”
She ’s never asked them what role they played in Amy ’s death ; she assumes they did little more than throw rocks , as they acknowledged during their amnesty hearings .
( Another of the four men had confessed to stabbing Amy .
He wound up back in prison on an unrelated charge . )
After prison , Peni had started an organization to help former anti-apartheid activists acquire skills such as bricklaying and plumbing .
He persuaded the Biehl Foundation to help support his organization and , three years ago , he went to work there .
He was recently promoted to program director and supervises a core staff of 16 , including Nofemela .
Nofemela emerged from prison to become a community leader in Guguletu , where he battled for government money to replace shacks and bring plumbing and electricity to the township .
A onetime soccer star , he now coordinates the foundation ’s instruction in soccer , cricket , field hockey and other sports -- some at his old school , a few dozen yards from where Biehl died .
Surrounded daily by tributes to Biehl , the two men wrestle with conflicting feelings about their role in her death .
There is remorse over the loss of an innocent life , but there also is an abiding sense that their motives were pure .
“ Deep down , it was very difficult for me to accept my own actions , ” Peni recalls in his office at the foundation .
A baby - faced man of 35 , Peni now has two daughters , ages 1 and 5 .
“ I felt I had contributed to a new South Africa and that what I did was done for a political reason , ” Peni says .
“ But when I thought of Amy . . . . "
He pauses .
“ One has to find peace within in order to live .
It ’s odd , but sometimes people who offer forgiveness are so disappointed when the people they forgive cannot forgive themselves .
This foundation helped me forgive myself . ”
Nofemela is a charismatic quipster who is hugely popular with the youngsters .
He does n’t see his role in Biehl ’s death and now her legacy as a contradiction .
She was , like him , a victim of a political war .
“ I will never run away from the fact that the oppression in South Africa was done by white people , ” he says .
“ The white man was prepared to kill .
I also was prepared to kill .
“ But now , I ’m working to spread the spirit of Amy . ”
The irony of his words hang in the air .
He closes his eyes before continuing .
“ Sometimes , ” he says , “ things happen in an unexpected way . ”

Historically speaking , conservatism is a movement organized and funded by society 's most powerful members ; politically speaking , it lusts for tax cuts and government rollbacks that will benefit those same fortunate folks at the top .
But what it really is , in its own mind , is a crusade on behalf of society 's most abject members : the true Americans who are victimized , sneered at and persecuted for their faithfulness .
Who ...
Key exporting countries have seen their share price fall Asian share prices tumbled for a third day in a row as investors feared a global recession would badly hit company earnings .
Japan 's Nikkei closed at a five - and - a - half year low , down 9.6 % after the electronics giant Sony halved its full - year profit forecasts .
India 's Sensex fell more than 10 % to its lowest level in nearly three years .
South Korea 's market plunged 10.6 % as chip maker Samsung announced a 44 % fall in its third - quarter profits .
Seoul 's Kospi benchmark share index ended at 938.75 points , the first tim it has closed below 1,000 points since May 2005 .
It has lost more than half its value so far this year .
It is the Seoul market 's worst weekly fall - 20.5 % - since records began in 1987 .
' Exports hurting '
More records were set in Tokyo , where the Nikkei dropped below the 8,000 - mark for the first time in more than five years .
Investors remain worried over growing uncertainty about the state of the global economy
Yutaka Miura
East Asia set to start $ 80 bn fund Yutaka Miura , of Shinko Securities in Tokyo , said a profits warning from Sony was " yet another indicator that the global economy is really slowing " .
" Investors remain worried over growing uncertainty about the state of the global economy , " he said .
A strong yen is causing concerns about Japanese export earnings , as the US dollar fell below 96 yen , its lowest level for 13 years .
" The stronger yen is hurting Japanese exports , which is a big part of that country 's economy , " said Linus Yip , of First Shanghai Securities in Hong Kong .
Meanwhile Asian countries have re-committed themselves to establishing an US $ 80 bn emergency fund , as leaders from across Asia and Europe gathered in Beijing to discuss the global financial meltdown .
The deal would enable countries to borrow from the fund when facing a liquidity crunch .
Emergency fund Elsewhere in Asia , India 's central bank cut its economic growth forecasts for the year to 7.5 % but warned that a deep and protracted global downturn was likely .

What are these ?
Oh , it 's not that politics are n't in the shitter .
It 's that they were already there .
With one month left , the current candidates might have to kick it into overdrive if they hope to out - crazy some of pioneers of absurd campaigning .
" Politics sure have gone down the shitter this election , " is what you 've probably been saying to yourself for the last 15 months .
But you know what ?
You 're wrong .
5 Misleading Attacks

Where You See it Today :
Have you seen the McCain ad about Obama wanting to teach sex education to kindergarteners ?
Who Made it Cool :
The very first few elections in American history were fairly tame ( who 's going to run an attack ad against George freaking Washington ? ) and even the election of 1796 , the first between Adams and Jefferson , was pretty straightforward .
Complex issues were at stake , sure , but there were a lot of well - thought - out and articulate pamphlets circulating to try to inform the voters about the various candidates .
Issues were discussed .
When the election of 1800 rolled around , again between Adams ( now president ) and Jefferson ( his vice ) , someone stood up and said " How about we just make up shit about the other guy ? "
A revolutionary idea was born , and it changed American politics forever .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
So President Adams ' team sent out pamphlets saying if Jefferson was elected he would destroy Christianity , and that , " prostitutes ... will preside in the sanctuaries now devoted to the worship of the Most High . "
" Guys , I want you to meet our new Pope .
She 's a Virgo .
Loves anal .
When the threat of an all - hooker church was n't effective enough to destroy Jefferson 's career , Adams '
Federalists stepped up their game , explaining that Jefferson 's America would involve the " teaching of murder robbery , rape , adultery and incest " .
Thomas Jefferson wants " murder robbery " taught in our elementary schools , people !
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Jefferson knew that the Federalists were hurling bullshit and , not to be outdone , he actually went out and hired a professional bullshit - hurler , James Callendar .
Armed with nothing but an incredible imagination and a total lack of morals , Callendar effectively convinced a good portion of America that Adams " desperately wanted to attack France " and would if reelected ( Americans still liked the French back then , for helping us with the Revolutionary War and all ) .
James Callendar Man .
This election set the standard for filthy , misleading campaigning .
The technique of taking a real quote ( Jefferson saying he believes the current religious institutions lead to corruption ) and exaggerating it to the point of absurdity ( Jefferson wants to blow up Christianity and eat the baby Jesus ) was born , and used in every single election since .

HD49933 was one of the stars observed using the Corot telescope Scientists have recorded the sound of three stars similar to our Sun using France 's Corot space telescope .
A team writing in Science journal says the sounds have enabled them to get information about processes deep within stars for the first time .
If you listen closely to the sounds of each star - by clicking on the media in this page - you 'll hear a regular repeating pattern .
These indicate that the entire star is pulsating .
You 'll also note that the sound of one star is very slightly different to the other .
That 's because the sound they make depends on their age , size and chemical composition .
Please turn on JavaScript .

The technique , called " stellar seismology " , is becoming increasingly popular among astronomers because the sounds give an indication of what is going on in the stars ' interior .
Just as seismic waves moving through Earth provide information about our planet 's insides , so sound waves travelling through a star carry information about its inner workings .
The Corot spacecraft detects the oscillations as subtle variations in the light emitted by the star as the surface wobbles .
This light signal can then be converted back to sounds we understand .
According to Professor Eric Michel , of the Paris Observatory , the technique is already giving researchers remarkable new insights .

He commented : " This is a completely new way to look at the stars compared with what has been available for the past 50 years .
It is very exciting . "
Professor Michel has found that the star pulsations are close to what was predicted for stars of this kind .
But there is a slight variation from what was expected .
The variation suggests that astronomers might need to refine their theories of stellar evolution .
Professor Ian Roxburgh of Queen Mary College London is among those trying to work out what the sounds from the stars tell us about processes occurring inside stars .

" It 's not easy , " he says .
" It 's like listening to the sound of a musical instrument and then trying to reconstruct the shape of the instrument " .
Astronomers are increasingly listening into stars and other space sounds , according to Dr Tim O'Brien , of Manchester University 's Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics .
" It 's interesting in itself , " he said .
" It 's also scientifically useful . "
Dr O'Brien has collected his favourite space sounds in the Jodrell Bank podcast , known as the Jodcast .

" All you are really doing when you 're collecting stuff from space is that you 've got to get that information into your brain so you can think about it , " he explained in his podcast .
" And what we 're used to doing is putting visual information into our brain - well there 's no real reason why we should n't listen to signals . "

The tip of a spiral shell has broken off and become a grain of sand .
It is opalescent from the repeated tumbling action of the surf .
Surrounding the shell fragment are five other sand grains , from top middle clockwise , ( 1 ) a pink shell fragment , ( 2 ) a foram , ( 3 ) a microscopic shell , ( 4 ) a volcanic melt , and ( 5 ) a bit of coral .

Dr. Greenberg was an Assistant Professor at the University of Southern California during the 1980’s , and in 1990 , he began inventing and manufacturing high - definition three - dimensional light microscopes .
For the past six years , Greenberg has focused his microscopes on common objects , such as grains of sand , flowers , and food .
These everyday objects take on a new reality when magnified hundreds of times .
His images of sand make us realize that as we walk along a beach we are strolling on millions of years of biological and geological history .
He believes that art is a window through which we can appreciate the miracles of nature .
With so many different kinds of insanity flying around at once , it helps to take a step back and appreciate the holistic implosion that is happening right now .
We ’re in the middle of a collapse so epic that it makes the Steelers - Cowboys superbowl look dignified .
There is n’t a ray of light to be found for these guys .
It ’s like a race to the bottom where the GOP Congress , President thimblewit , Sarah “ proof that Jesus loves Tina Fey ” Palin and John McCain are all desperately vying to see who can become a living punchline first .
Let me count the ways .
About why Secretary Paulson asked for seven hundred billion dollars :
“ It ’s not based on any particular data point , ” a Treasury spokeswoman told Forbes.com Tuesday .
“ We just wanted to choose a really large number . ”
Across the country , satire writers sadly capped their pens and bookmarked monster.com .
Katie Couric asked Sarah Palin to name a time when John McCain gave more than rhetorical support to financial regulation ( he did , once ) .
Palin came up short .
In fact the entire encounter was just as much of a disaster as her last real interview with Charlie Gibson .
At least Couric got verbal response , even if it did n’t techically count as an answer to a question .
Other reporters would be so lucky
McCain then looked around the room and gestured as if to welcome questions .
The AP reporter shouted a question at Gov. Palin ( “ Governor , what have you learned from your meetings ? ” ) but McCain aide Brooke Buchanan intervened and shepherded everybody out of the room .
Palin looked surprised , leaned over to McCain and asked him a question , to which your pooler thinks he shook his head as if to say “ No . ”
Sarah Palin , living the feminist dream .
In related news , several pundits noted McCain ’s polar swing from dissing economic concerns last Monday to hair - on - fire panic today .
That sort of bipolar , crisis - to - crisis reactivity is normally taken as a sign that a person ( or campaign ) has no idea what is going on .
The Republican Study Committee , where the ideological stalwarts of the Congressional GOP call home , has a Very Serious Proposal ( TM ) : cut the capital gains tax .
I wish that I was kidding .
The rest of their fringe wish list makes even less sense .
… And then John McCain proposed his weird deal to stop campaigning and put off the debates .
Then he put off Sarah Palin ’s debate .
They ’re all flailing .
For a party that has trended towards irrelevance since America hit the practical limit of tax cuts and belligerent war during the first Bush term , history will remember this as the week when the GOP finally got there .
*** Update ***
An observation from the comments :
I ’m still in shock over how terrible the Palin / Couric interview was .
“ Train wreck ” is being charitable – it was more like a train derailing on a bridge , tumbling a thousand feet into a canyon and landing on a pile of old dynamite and gas drums .
And then a jumbo jet crashed into the flaming wreckage .
Followed by an earthquake that caused the whole mess to slide off a cliff into the sea , where the few miraculous survivors were eaten by sharks .
Conservatives sometimes remark that Sarah Palin must worry liberals since we can’t stop talking about her .
Worry has nothing to do with it .
You can not look away .
If there ’s one halfway healthy thing that most people do , it ’s take a multivitamin pill .
My word , taking a little pill with decent amounts of the essential micronutrients and minerals keeps you from getting scurvy , right ?
Right .
Most people do n’t eat sufficient fruits and vegetables .
Most people do n’t get enough vitamin C over the course of a week to keep them from getting low - grade scurvy , unless you ’re one of the smart few who toss back an orange juice shot in the morning .
( Just for the record , I imbibe espresso shooters in the morning .
I ’m not getting up on my high elliptical strider and being healthier - than - thou .
We ’re all on the same dusty rowing machine , here . )
However , you should consider your special circumstances before you even decide whether or not to swallow that vitamin pill .
There are also some very interesting studies relating the regular use of vitamin pills with an increased risk of cancer .
Contrary to the expectations of the researchers , one study linked Vitamin A supplementation with an increased risk of lung cancers in male smokers .
In addition , taking a multivitamin increased the possibility of deaths from prostate cancer in men .
Why would that be ?
The multivitamin - cancer correlation suggests an interesting hypothesis .
In the past , our ancestors , probably even our relatively recent ancestors in the 1900 ’s , likely experienced transient malnutrition .
In the winters , especially , they had less access to fresh , nutritious produce and almost certainly experienced cyclical vitamin deficiencies .
Thus in the winter , a budding cancer cell with its blazing metabolic furnaces would probably starve to death for the lack of vitamin C and vitamin K , which would manifest itself as only a very mild case of scurvy or a few nosebleeds in an adult and would be rectified when tender spring greens appeared .
Now , with our year - round produce and megavitamin pills , we do not experience these cyclical , transient vitamin deficiencies .
We are super - nourished , and thus our cancer cells grow robustly in this rich stew of essential nutrients .
Before you give up your daily multi , however , there are some very important things to consider .
People with the highest levels of vitamin D ( available in supplemented milk , pill form , and sunshine , ) had lower levels of cancer and osteoporosis .
If you ’re a woman of childbearing age , taking a daily multivitamin during any trimester of pregnancy or in the month before pregnancy decreases the risk of neuroblastoma in the infant by 30 % to 40 % .
Neuroblastoma is the most common cancer seen in infants and accounts for about 10 % of all pediatric cancers .
Not to mention that whole folic acid — neural tube defect thing .
Taking a big preggers prenatal multi during pregnancy is very , very likely the best course of action .
Also , non-smokers who do not have heart disease who use multivitamins that include A , C , or E reduced risk of dying from heart disease by 15 to 18 % , and heart disease kills far more people than cancer does .
So , for a general rule of a healthy thumb , if you ’re a smoker , avoid vitamin A , even if you have to take a handful of single - vitamin pills instead of a general multi .
If you have prostate cancer , stop taking your multi .
If you do n’t smoke and you do n’t have prostate cancer , a multivitamin is probably the best course of action .
If you want hedge your chances , however , here ’s an idea : there ’s some very good research that supports the hypothesis that eating 300 - 500 fewer calories per day extends lifetime and , more importantly , extends robust lifetime .
That ’s right .
Eat less .
Some good research came up lately that showed that mice that ate normally every other day and semi-fasted ( eating 15 % of normal calories ) on the off days had essentially the same life extension and reductions in heart disease , cancer , and inflammation .
If you try alternate - day semi- fasting , do n’t take a vitamin on those days .
Taking a megavitamin on feasting days will nourish your body well .
Fasting is associated with life extension and with reducing the debilitating side effects of chemotherapy .
Coulter complains :
Only ' the most boring questions ' at debate David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday October 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Tuesday night 's debate between presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain was notable for the absence of the kind of personal attacks recently unleashed by McCain 's running - mate , Alaska Governor Sarah Palin .
However , Gretchen Carlson of Fox and Friends appeared disappointed on Wednesday that " McCain failed to spotlight one of the latest criticisms of his opponent , his association with Bill Ayers , the domestic terrorist out of Chicago . "
" That did not slip by Ann Coulter , " noted Carlson 's co-host Brian Kilmeade .
He proceeded to introduce Coulter and ask , " Why was n't that brought up last night ?
" Because Tom Brokaw carefully chose the most boring questions , " Coulter replied .
" Could we bring back the Saddleback Forum ?
That was a good debate . "
Carlson , however , appeared unwilling to accept Coulter 's dismissal of Brokaw as merely boring , insisting , " The minute that I heard that Brokaw and company ... "
" Who 's a Democrat , " Kilmeade broke in .
" Who 's admitted that he 's a Democrat , " Carlson continued , " had the ability to select the questions , then it sort of dawned on me that we were n't going to get a character question . "
Contrary to Kilmeade 's and Carlson 's allegation , Brokaw , who diligently attempts to appear non-partisan , does not appear to have ever acknowledged a party affiliation .
He has been accused by both liberals and conservatives of bias towards the other side and has stated that " bias -- like beauty -- is in the eye of the beholder . "
There have recently been rumors of conflict between Brokaw and Keith Olbermann at NBC , with Brokaw allegedly " disagree[ing ] with MSNBC 's decision to position itself as the channel for George W. Bush - haters . "
However , Coulter appeared less interested in the possibility of moderator bias than in the debate 's inability to meet her standards of excitement .
" There were no interesting questons , " she complained again .
" Maybe it was better for McCain that it was such a boring debate .
...
It definitely helped me get to sleep last night . "
Host Steve Doocy raised the issue again towards the end of the interview , saying , " A lot of people were expecting more last night -- you obviously were -- in the way of some fireworks .
People were expecting John McCain to take off the gloves and bring up William Ayers , bring up ACORN , bring up that stuff .
Why did n't he ? "
" I can't say that I was really expecting that from John McCain , " Coulter replied .
" Sarah Palin turned questions around , " Carlson pointed out .
" I think he should let Sarah Palin pinch - hit for him at the next debate , " Coulter agreed .
" She brought it up , which is why they all got testy .
' You 're not answering our question .
You 're not sticking to this really boring issue that we just asked you about . '
She talks about interesting things , so they get upset , ' You 're not answering our boring questions . ' "

Remember the date .
Monday 13
October will go down in history as one of the blackest days in the annals of British banking .
it was the day that some of our largest and proudest private financial institutions were forced to sell large chunks of themselves to the state in order to avert total collapse .
And the dreadful prospect of the collapse of these financial institutions was not the unforeseeable consequence of some lost war , a natural disaster or the assaults of a socialist government , but was brought about by their own runaway greed and staggering stupidity .
This sweeping recapitalisation of the banks by the state marks the definitive and sorry end to a two - decade long era of light regulation for Britain 's capital markets .
it also challenges the assumptions and prejudices of an entire generation of politicians , steeped in the dogma that markets always work better unfettered .
That much , the historians can already begin to draft .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But there is much still more to be written about the great crash of 2008 and , indeed , this particular rescue package .
The most terrifying unanswered question is whether it will work in stemming the panic .
We must hope so , since there is nothing left in the locker of our politicians , short of total nationalisation of the financial sector , if it does not .
Yet there would seem to be room for cautious optimism .
The Government appears to have learned from the markets ' disappointing reaction to the passing of the $ 700bn plan of the US Treasury Secretary , Hank Paulson , by the American Congress earlier this month .
Removing toxic securities from the balance sheets of stricken banks is plainly insufficient to restore confidence .
Rather they need to be directly recapitalised by public funds .
And this aid needs to be accompanied by public guarantees of inter - bank lending .
The Government is addressing these principles .
The US administration and governments across Europe have indicated that they too are in the process of doing so .
it would be folly to predict the end of the panic , after so many false dawns , but this British plan represents the most comprehensive attempt to stop the carnage yet .
Another , as yet , unanswered question is what the Government will do with these banks in which it now has acquired a controlling , or highly influential , share .
At least one thing already seems certain .
The £ 37bn in taxpayers ' money is to be accompanied by some new restrictions on the behaviour of the bankers themselves .
The Financial Services Authority sent out a very clear warning yesterday that large bonuses for traders , managers and executives will not be tolerated while these banks are using public money to survive .
This is morally and politically essential .
Lavish junkets for managers should also end forthwith .
Using public money to support failed managements is one thing if done for the broader national good .
Watching them live high on the hog at the same time is quite another .
There is much talk in the City of banks and their managements being " humbled " by what has happened .
But that is not how it looks to the outside world .
Remember that it is only now , more than a year after our banks first began announcing unprecedented write - downs of bad investments , that some executive heads are beginning to roll .
Why has it taken so long ?
And why has there been so little contrition from the sector as a whole ?
No politician with serious ambitions for power should be in any doubt that the public mood demands more effective curbs on the behaviour of financiers in future .
Better regulation is a must .
All that said , we should not be under any illusions about the scope of the package itself to return our economy to health in short order .
There is no possibility of using the lending power of these banks to provide a large economic stimulus to our economy and propel Britain out of this downturn .
The public sums being invested in the banks , though staggering , are simply not large enough .
Most of them will be swallowed up simply repairing the banks ' balance sheets .
The purpose of this public investment is , first and foremost , to stop the rot in the banking sector .
The goal is to prevent these institutions collapsing , sucking still more liquidity from the global financial system and draining confidence further .
The best we can hope for is that the banks will now be compelled to be less assiduous in repossessing homes and foreclosing on businesses .
But it is still in our interests for the banks to lend responsibly .
After all , if they make more bad loans , it will only make it less likely that we , as taxpayers , will eventually get our investment back .
It is important to retain some perspective as we enter these new and confusing economic times .
First , we should ignore those who excitedly proclaim the end of the capitalism system .
What we are witnessing is the death knell of a particular kind of irresponsible capitalism , which has turned markets into an object of veneration , rather than a tool .
Second , we must not forget that lax lending was one of the root causes of this conflagration .
Even if it were possible to resurrect that world of easy money ( which it is not ) , there would be nothing to be gained from bringing it back .
Finally we would do well to recognise that a recession is coming in Britain , no matter what interventions our political leaders make in the markets .
The boom was allowed to continue for too long .
All manner of assets became overvalued .
Households and businesses borrowed imprudent amounts .
Recession is the economic medicine we must stomach as part of the process of returning to health .
The best that yesterday 's plan can accomplish is to enable us to experience a softer landing than we would otherwise be in for .
But we must not get ahead of ourselves .
First the plan has to restore some small measure of confidence to markets in which , for too long , blind panic has been the ruling emotion .
It ’s been just about a month since Joe Klein ’s column accusing " Jewish neoconservatives " of having " divided loyalties " appeared in Time magazine , and already the controversy surrounding it is taking on the grand scale of an opera  perhaps a stage adaptation of Shirley Jackson ’s " The Lottery . "
His original sin was writing this :
" The notion that we could just waltz in and inject democracy into an extremely complicated , devout and ancient culture smacked  still smacks  of neocolonialist legerdemain .
The fact that a great many Jewish neoconservatives  people like Joe Lieberman and the crowd over at Commentary  plumped for this war , and now for an even more foolish assault on Iran , raised the question of divided loyalties : using U.S. military power , U.S. lives and money , to make the world safe for Israel .
And then there is the question  made manifest by the no-bid contracts offered U.S. oil companies by the Iraqis  of two oil executives , Bush and Cheney , securing a new source of business for their Texas buddies .
" The surge has reduced violence .
We should all be thrilled about that  and honored by the brilliance of those who have served in Iraq .
But what we ’re talking about here is whipped cream on a pile of fertilizer  a regional policy unprecedented in its stupidity and squalor . "
I cite this passage in its full context , rather than lift out the controversial phrases , because the offending column was , after all , about the surge , and the utter irrelevance of its alleged success  a view I expressed here , just the other day .
At any rate , Klein stuck the knife in the neocons ’ back at the tail end of a long peroration on the complete futility of this war , and he concludes by pointing the finger of blame  not only at " Jewish neoconservatives , " but also at Bush ’s oilmen buddies back home on the range .
However , it ’s difficult to believe Bush launched his " global democratic revolution , " first implanting the revolutionary flag in the arid soil of the Middle East , to enrich his cowboy buddies  whose said Iraqi riches , I might add , have yet to materialize .
Insofar as these cowboy oilmen were involved , it was as the financial patrons of the neoconservatives : Paul Gottfried and others have documented how the neocons , a relatively small group , grabbed the lion ’s share of big - time donors among the major conservative foundations .
Sure , lots of people made money out of the war , and are continuing to do so , and yet they did n’t launch this crusade to transform the Middle East into Kansas with lots of sand .
Its original authors , the real intellectual and political sparkplugs who energized Bush ’s bout of Napoleonic adventurism , were the neocons , who began calling for the " liberation " of Iraq the moment Papa Bush ordered US troops to stop short of taking Baghdad at the close of the first Iraq war .
The neocons chafed and griped at this " betrayal " for all the years they spent in the political wilderness , out of power albeit ensconced in lower - level jobs , tucked safely away at the National Endowment for Democracy , where they could n’t do much harm .
That changed when Bush II entered the White House : they descended on Washington like a plague of locusts , and settled at the top of the tree .
The neocon network , headquartered in the office of the Vice President , extended its tentacles into virtually every major power - center in Washington , with the Department of State and the ranks of the CIA , to some degree , the only holdouts .
On September 11 , 2001 , the neocons were in place , ready to take advantage of the worst terrorist attack in our history .
Willing and able to implement their preconceived war plans , deciding to attack Iraq rather than al - Qaeda ’s Afghan stronghold " because it was doable , " as Paul Wolfowitz , the intellectual eminence grise of the administration ’s Israel - firsters , bluntly put it .
For a long time there has been a reaction building among Jewish progressives  a phrase that seems oddly redundant  against the domination of pro-Israel and Jewish organizations by right - wing extremists who represent nothing but their own prejudices , and certainly do not represent the American Jewish community .
As I have pointed out before , without American Jews the organized antiwar movement would be significantly smaller as well as a lot less organized .
That is certainly the case around Antiwar.com ’s virtual office .
In any case , Klein ’s outspokenness  which , I think , underestimates the power of Christian neoconservatives , and not only evangelicals  is part of this new frankness about the ethnic factor in American politics , which is coming to the fore in this era of Obamamania , and that ’s all to the good .
Now that he has gotten his letter from Abe Foxman  been there , done that  Klein ought to wear it as a badge of honor .
Foxman , for his part , has been discredited as an embarrassment and a bit of a buffoon , with his brazen attempts to shut down all criticism of the " correct line " on Israel and its American amen corner .
In his interview with Jeffrey Goldberg , Klein goes on at length about this thesis that a group of individuals with key ties to the far right wing of Israeli politics achieved prominent positions within the administration ’s foreign policy circles and deliberately plotted a course that was detrimental to the United States in order to further Israel ’s interests .
This is n’t disloyalty , as such , but a case , as Klein puts it , of " divided loyalties , " one in which too many allowed their sympathies for the Jewish state to override common sense , simple logic , and the lessons of history .
Klein really has the neocons in a lather , and it ’s a wonderful sight to behold : they hate stuff like this , and they ’re baring their teeth fangs first , like Jennifer Rubin of Commentary :
" Try as I might to formulate a further response to Joe Klein ’s rant , I cannot .
One can argue facts , one can differ on interpretation of events , or one can discuss policy .
But one cannot debate raging venom . "
Rubin ’s invective amounts , in effect , to the position taken by radical leftists who regularly disrupt far right - wing meetings and other events they consider beyond the pale , which is : you ca n’t debate fascists .
You fight them in the streets , and enact anti-hate laws to shut them up : you jail them and beat them up .
But you do n’t sit down to tea with them and have a serious discussion .
Rubin’s is a neocon version of this " no platform for fascists " stance : she purports to be shocked that such views as Klein ’s are allowed to be expressed at all : " More disconcerting than Klein ’s raving , " she moans , " is that the canard of Jewish disloyalty has now apparently found a home at a major MSM publication . "
Why , the poor dear has a case of the vapors : wo n’t someone shut that man up ?
Writing in National Review , Peter Wehner urges Klein to give up interviews as well as blogging : .
After characterizing the Time columnist as motivated by " anger and even hatred , " and his arguments as expressions of " unfiltered rage , " Wehner avers :
" Joe Klein is free to say what he wants .
And the rest of us are free to point out the foolish and ad hominem nature of his pronouncements , as well as his past words . "
I have to say that Wehner certainly does a bang - up job of debunking Klein ’s claim , in the Atlantic interview , that he opposed the Iraq war :
Wehner cites chapter and verse , with links , showing that Klein drank the neocon Kool - Aid , too , albeit not as deeply as others .
Klein , at least , was able to recover :
Wehner is too far gone for that .
Ad hominem is the only way to go for the neocons , at this point , and it ’s always been their weapon of choice : look what they tried to do to Pat Buchanan .
Not to mention John Mearsheimer , Stephen Walt , and a long list of others too numerous to mention : in his Atlantic interview , Klein mentions one poor guy who served for a time on Barack Obama ’s advisory group :
" They seem to have the power to hurt people ’s careers .
I was really angry about what happened with Rob Malley .
You know , it ’s amazing to be attacked as an antisemite by extremists who I think are very dangerous .
And they seem to think , when you look at what Pete Wehner said , or what Jennifer Rubin said on their blog a couple of days ago ,  I ca n’t imagine why Time has n’t shut this guy down and fired him and blah blah blah blah blah . ’
That ’s what they want to do .
They want to stifle opinions that are different from theirs .
I ’m certainly not going to back down . "
Good for Joe !  and good for " J Street , " and good for Philip Weiss , who has done yeoman ’s work in this area : people are finally beginning to stand up in the Jewish community , and say : Enough with the extremism .
Enough is enough .
Let them join with the overwhelming majority of the American people who want to take back our foreign policy from a small but influential minority of Israeli - centric ideologues , and start putting American interests first , in the Middle East and everywhere .
The U.S. military has been using killer drones to take out enemies for years .
But those strikes have ordinarily targeted small groups , or lone individuals .
Last night , an American pilotless plane reportedly killed 20 people during an attack on a militant compound in Pakistan .
It could well be the deadliest drone strike ever .
Pakistan - based guerrillas have emerged as the top threat to American operations in Afghanistan .
U.S. Predator and Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles , or UAVs , have become American commanders ' weapons of choice to strike back against those militants .
The drones can circle above an guerrilla encampment for hours without risking a pilot .
But they appear to be less of a political hazard , as well .
Ground missions and manned flights by American commandos have enraged the Pakistani leadership , and sparked skirmishes with local soldiers .
The drone strikes seem to provoke a more measured reaction – at least , for now .
And they provide a bit of plausible deniability to the attacks .
Recently a Predator drone went down over Pakistan ; the U.S. military swore they had nothing to do with the UAV .
This is at least the 19th UAV attack in Pakistan 's tribal areas " since the beginning of August , " the * New York Times * notes .
" In the first seven months of 2008 , there were five strikes . "
Some of the " strikes are taking place as deep as 25 miles into Pakistani territory . "
And they are growing increasingly deadly .
During one week in September , U.S. drones killed more than 50 people in four attacks .
The Times and other news outlets credit " Predator " drones with strikes .
But it 's more likely that bigger , brawnier Reaper UAVs are being used , instead .
With a payload of 3,750 pounds – compared to the Predator 's 450 pounds – the Reaper can carry an assortment of satellite - guided , quarter - ton bombs , as well as Hellfire missiles .
They can carry out extraordinarily lethal attacks .
UPDATE : A well - informed source says there have been deadlier drone attacks .
" 20 is n't close , " the source says .
" It 's just the most for a * reported * strike . "
Hmmm ....

Maybe there really is n't anything that you can't buy online .
Endangered animals , including chimps , marmosets and leopard cubs , are being bought and sold online , according to a new report .
Over six one - week observation periods earlier this year , the International Fund for Animal Welfare found more than 1,400 live , exotic animals being traded online .
IFAW data released to Wired.com revealed that most of the advertisements were for birds , but in the United States alone , 13 primates , five big cats and two rhinos were offered .
Barbara Cartwright , who heads up the IFAW 's efforts to restrict wildlife trade on the internet , said her organization believes that many online advertisements lead to offline transactions beyond the reach of their tracking .
" If I put up an ad for a chimpanzee , you call me , and then we can talk about what I really have , " Cartwright said , describing a possible offline networking scenario between illegal animal traders .
While many animals are legal to trade , endangered species are not .
The IFAW 's Killing with Keystrokes report found that the internet 's global reach has enabled buyers and sellers of rare species — and the products derived from them — to find each other more easily .
As is often the case , regulators have been a step behind the marketplace in their efforts to stop illegal activities .
Last night , ahead of the release of the report , eBay instituted a complete ban on the sale of elephant ivory through the auction service .
EBay did not cite the report in announcing the ban and did not return solicitations for comment .
Nonetheless , the IFAW hailed the action as a victory .
Stamping out the live animal trade could prove more difficult , however , as the number and nature of websites involved in the trade is different .
Whereas most of the ivory trade could be directly traced to eBay , live animal trafficking takes place across dozens of American , British and Russian websites , largely forums and classified ad sites .
While the United States had the largest number ( 1,034 ) of live animal advertisements , Russia had the most varied list of species including two types of tigers , a crocodile , an ocelot and a bonobo .
Cartwright said that extensive efforts were undertaken to ensure the animals advertised in the IFAW were not hoaxes or scams , but represented an actual animal being sold .

So how does the US prepare for a presidential election here at the beginning of this already exhausted , near bankrupt , blood - soaked new century ?
Why , the same way it 's done in Zimbabwe , Burma , Egypt , and Cameroon .
Not to mention scores of other countries that receive billions in lethal military aid from the US taxpayer :
By placing elements of the military on alert ; by militarizing the local police departments ; by placing the State Police on active stand - by ; by declaring a preemptive state of emergency ; by suspending whatever pretend civil rights might still be in play -- assembly , speech , habeas corpus , due process , probable cause -- and by notifying the general public there is the distinct possibility of massive civil disorder if the wrong candidate wins , the wrong candidate being either one of the two running .
Alexandra Bolton , writing at TheHill , describes how the various authorities are preparing for the possibility of what is being called " Post - Election Unrest . "
This would all be so funny , so slapstick ridiculous -- like the Marx Brothers in Freedonia -- except it is n't .
It 's deadly serious .
Already the right - wing psychopaths are clogging the Web with cowardly , half - assed threats of their beer - bellied violence should the black guy " steal " the election .
Christianist fundamentalist radio hosts and whacked - out preachers are telling their arm - waving , eye - rolling congregations that this could be it !
This could be that moment !
when Jeebus returns !
when the righteous shall rise in the air like duck feathers !
when the streets are awash in the blood of the unrighteous !
and the Lamb of God descends to enjoy the mess !
And all because it says so in , what ?
Jeremiah ?
Ezekiel ?
Daniel ?
Mad Magazine ?
The Onion ?
Where are we ?
Philosopher / astronomer Carl Sagan framed it best not long before he died .
We live , he said , in a demon haunted world .
While his reference may have been focused primarily on the anti-scientific religious bullshit in which the planet now finds itself neck - deep , he also may have been warning his readers about the sick , twisted , political leaders scattered across the planet as well , leaders who are in no danger of losing their power since the inability of those they control to think , to resist , to rebel , has been excised , burned away , by -- among other forms of control -- the now almost global fear of " terrorism . "
Has ever a meme been as successful in rendering impotent entire populations as " the war on terror ? "
Has there ever been a more effective agent used to immobilize , to stupefy , than this one ?
Perhaps only the admonition to vote , early or otherwise , at the polls or through the mail , in person or using an absentee ballot , has had a more universal effect ( a more effective meme ) in fooling the public , the citizenry , into believing something truly momentous is about to happen when , in fact , nothing really is .
When have the citizens of this -- or any other -- society truly had the power promised by casting a ballot ?
And yet , troop to the Diebold machines we must .
Not to do so would bring the scorn of our neighbors and a certain self - loathing made more painful by the ever present media directive : Vote !
Or shut up !
Or consider yourself a terrible citizen , worthy of banishment !

According to the classic theory that appears in our civics textbooks , modern democracy is a political system in which the people decide how they wish to be governed by electing representatives who carry out their will .
The ultimate source of authority in the democratic system is thus the individual voter , whose solemn and heroic responsibility we celebrate at every national , state , and local election .
The basic premise of the classic view is that " the people rule , " and so we are told ad nauseam from the time we enter kindergarten -- and that , we tell one another at every opportunity , is what makes America the greatest nation in the history of the world .
In our democratic system , the best and most wonderful system that ever was , the light of nations , the shining city on the hill , the people deliberate over policies and weigh alternatives and come to a rational decision about the public good .
In this way they produce what political scientists and philosophers call the " general will , " which they communicate ( as if by magic or at least by poll ) to their elected representatives , who are obliged to carry it out .
Even in the face of daily proof that this state of affairs does not exist , the idea that " the people " rule somehow persists as the first article of our civic creed .
But , the mythology is just that , and , on touching the Diebold screen , it shatters into a million mocking pieces :
Modern democracy . . . is a method of political decision in which individuals acquire the power to rule by means of a competitive struggle for the people 's vote .
Far from being a system in which the people rule , it is best characterized as " the rule of the politician . "
The role of the people is simply to accept the leadership of the most successful politicians .
Political parties , and the multitude of pressure groups they comprise , engage in a constant struggle for power , which at certain intervals becomes institutionalized and legitimated by the people 's vote .
" Actually existing " democracy has little in common with the ideal of Enlightenment philosophers or the ancient variety practiced by Athenian slaveholders .
All of which is not to discourage a repeat of the last time we trooped to the voting precinct .
We 're off !
Let 's go !
Onward !
Because if we do n't . . .
John McCain and Sarah Palin may be our new leaders .
And that may result in the possible scenario sent to me by Scott in Somerville , MA :
Quantum computing is the Holy Grail of processing .
The analogy is apt because , like that relic of legend , no one is sure exactly what it looks like but we all know it has awesome power .
Another step towards quantum computing was achieved when an international team of scientists were able to successfully store and retrieve information - using the nucleus of an atom .
The immediate lure of quantum computing is blinding speed : a quantum computer would be able to perform certain mathematical tasks , such as factoring , many billions of times faster than the most powerful supercomputers of today .
Beyond that , quantum computing should make it possible to engage calculations that cannot be considered with current " classical " computing technology .
The secret behind quantum computing is the weird , counterintuitive but demonstrably real properties of quantum mechanics .
In a Nature paper ( 1 ) , the team described an experiment in which exceptionally pure and isotopically controlled crystals of silicon were precisely doped with phosphorus atoms .
Quantum information was processed in phosphorus electrons , transferred to phosphorus nuclei , then subsequently transferred back to the electrons .
This is the first demonstration that a single atomic nucleus can serve as quantum computational memory .
Another step towards quantum computing was taken when an international team of scientists processed information in the electron spin ( blue ) and stored it in the nuclear spin ( yellow ) of phosphorus atoms through a combination of microwave and radio - frequency pulses .

In classical computing , information is processed and stored based on the charge of an electron , and represented in a binary digit or " bit . "
Each bit carries a value of 0 ( no charge ) or 1 ( charge ) .
Quantum computing utilizes an intrinsic quantum property called " spin , " in which certain particles can act as if they were tiny bar magnets .
Spin is assigned a directional state of either " up " or " down , " which can be used to encode data in 0s and 1s .
However , unlike charge in classical computing , which is either present or not , spin can be up , down or both , thanks to a quantum effect called " superposition .
" Superpositioning exponentially expands the storage capabilities of a quantum data bit or " qubit . "
Whereas a byte of classical data , made up of three bits , can represent only one of the eight possible combinations of 0s and 1s , a quantum equivalent ( sometimes called a qubyte ) can represent all eight combinations at once .
Furthermore , thanks to another quantum property called " entanglement , " operations on all eight combinations can be performed simultaneously .
Of the many challenges facing quantum computing , one of the biggest has been finding a way to preserve the integrity of data while it is stored .
Although the spin of electrons has proven well - suited for data processing , it is too fragile to be used as memory – the data quickly becomes corrupted by the influence of other electrons .
To overcome this obstacle , the co-authors of this experiment turned to the more protected environs of the atomic nucleus .
"
In this exciting collaboration with colleagues from Oxford and Princeton , we have reported on a very important demonstration of coherent information transfer between the electron spin ( processing qubit ) and the nuclear spin ( memory qubit ) of phosphorus atoms in isotopically enriched silicon crystals , " said co-author Schenkel , a physicist in Berkeley Lab's Accelerator and Fusion Research Division , who has been a leader in the use of ion beams for the development of quantum computer test structures .
( See A Toolkit for Quantum Computing at http://newscenter.lbl.gov/feature-stories/2008/10/22/a-toolkit-for-silic...
" The electron spin information was faithfully stored in the nuclear spin for nearly two seconds ( thousands of times longer than ever reported for similar studies ) , then transferred back to the electron spin with about 90 - percent fidelity , " Schenkel said .
In this study , the co-authors created a superposition state in electron spin and transferred it to nuclear spin using a combination of microwave and radio - frequency pulses , which they applied to phosphorus - 31 .
This stable isotope of phosphorus is the ideal electron donor for silicon - 28 , the stable isotope of silicon that is the basis for today 's computer technology .
Said lead author Morton in a statement , " The electron acts as a middle - man between the nucleus and the outside world .
It gives us a way to have our cake and eat it - fast processing speeds from the electron , and long memory times from the nucleus .
" Crucial to the success of this study were the exceptionally pure silicon - 28 crystals created by co-authors Haller and Ager .
Haller is a world authority on crystal growth and purification and is credited with launching the modern era of isotopically enriched semiconductor research .
Ager designed and built a one - of - its - kind reactor for creating isotopically enriched and chemically pure silicon , featuring a high conversion efficiency .
Said Haller , " Crystals of natural silicon contain 4.7 - percent of the isotope silicon - 29 , in addition to silicon - 28 and silicon - 30 .
For this study we needed silicon crystals that were not only chemically pure , but isotopically pure as well because silicon - 29 has a nuclear spin that would interfere with the readout of the electron and nuclear spins of the phosphorus .
" Since the silicon crystals to be doped would consist of billions of atoms , creating isotopically pure crystals of silicon - 28 was a painstaking process .
Once these exceptionally pure crystals were created , they then had to be doped with phosphorus - 31 in specific areas of the crystal and to just the right amount – an undertaking that Ager compared to adding one extra person to Earth 's population at one particular address .
Now that it has been demonstrated that electron spin data can be stored and retrieved via nuclear spin , future steps will require improving spin control and readout mechanisms .
Also , while the quantum memory time observed in this study is exceptionally long by previous standards , it should still be possible to significantly extend this time .
"
The good news is that there are no know physical limits that would prevent quantum memory time in nuclear spin from being longer , " said Ager .
" With even greater isotopic and chemical purity of our silicon crystals , we should be able to store data in the nucleus for an arbitrarily long period of time , maybe even in terms of years .
" Article : " Solid - state quantum memory using the 31P nuclear spin . "

The scans effectively strip passengers and highlight anything they may carry EU lawmakers have delayed the introduction at airports of full body scanners , machines that generate images of passengers - minus their clothes .
MEPs voted for a further study on the implications for privacy and health .
Computer pictures generated by the scanners give an outline of passengers ' bodies beneath their clothes .
Supporters say they detect hidden objects not picked up by traditional metal detectors .
But critics say they amount to a virtual strip search .
The new scanners have already been introduced in several US airports and have been tested around the world .
Efficient measure The European Commission - which supports their implementation - has given assurances that the scanners will not be used routinely on all passengers .
And it would be a faster and less intrusive alternative to frisking or strip - searching people .
Where scanners are in use , security staff can pick out individuals to stand in a booth while three pictures are taken of the person in slightly different positions .
This is an offence against human dignity
Martin Schulz European MP
Within seconds , a scanner produces an image of the body .
What shows up is the naked human form and anything that may be concealed , such as a gun or drugs .
" The Commission believes that body scanning methods can complement in a very effective and efficient way the existing security measures at airports , " said spokesman Jens Mester at EU headquarters in Brussels , Belgium .
European officials believe the X - ray scans could ease airport queues
But others are unconvinced .
" It is unacceptable , if scanners are used , these are machines that see you completely naked , " said Martin Schulz , leader of the socialist grouping in the EU assembly .
" This is an offence against human dignity , " he added .

" They agreed to take quickly appropriate initiatives in this respect , in consultation with all stakeholders and the relevant international financial institutions . "
China 's Premier Wen Jiabao called for more regulation of the world 's financial system , saying after the summit : " We need to draw lessons from this crisis .
" We need financial innovation to serve the economy better .
However , we need even more financial regulation to ensure financial safety . "
Wen confirmed China 's participation in a crucial summit in the United States on November 15 aimed at tackling the financial meltdown , without specifying which Chinese leader would attend the meeting of 20 industrialised and emerging powers .
The economic turmoil has led to growing criticism of US - style free market capitalism , with French President Nicolas Sarkozy earlier this week saying " the ideology of the dictatorship of the market ... is dead " .
But Bush , moving to set an agenda for the upcoming international economic summit , said today its participants must " recommit " to the principles of free enterprise and free trade .
" As we focus on responses to our short - term challenges , our nations must also recommit to the fundamentals of long - term economic growth -- free markets , free enterprise and free trade , " Bush said in his weekly radio address .
The US president , who leaves office in January , added that " open market policies have lifted standards of living and helped millions of people around the world escape the grip of poverty " .
Ban said the Washington meeting must address the need for change , and joined chief executives of key UN institutions in calling for considered but large - scale reforms .
" The market and regulatory failures that have led to this crisis must be addressed as a matter of urgency , " a joint statement said .
" We reaffirm the need for meaningful , comprehensive and well - coordinated reform of the international financial system and pledge our support to this end . "
Stock markets provided a grim backdrop to the Beijing meeting , plummeting yesterday after a raft of pessimistic corporate and economic news .
Tokyo's dizzying 9.6 per cent slump spilt over into Europe , where London 's FTSE plunged 5.0 per cent .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 312.30 points ( 3.59 per cent ) to close at 8,378.95 , capping a week when the US blue - chip index dropped more than five per cent .
The Saudi stock market , the largest in the Arab world , began its trading week today with a nine per cent plunge to sink to its lowest point in four years .
Giants of the automobile , airline and technology industries took emergency action yesterday .
France 's PSA Peugeot - Citroen and Renault ordered huge production cuts , while Japan 's electronics giant Sony Corp and Europe 's biggest airline Air France - KLM issued profits warnings .
Chrysler LLC , the number three US automobile maker , said it would cut up to 5,000 white - collar jobs by the end of the year as prospects in the sector grow dimmer .
New figures showed industrial confidence in both France and Italy had fallen to the lowest level since 1993 .
In Spain , the unemployment rate jumped to 11.33 per cent - the highest in more than four years .
Britain 's economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the three months to September compared with the previous quarter , official figures showed , marking the first contraction since 1992 .
German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck predicted the financial crisis would last until late 2009 in an interview to be published tomorrow .
" The risk of collapse is far from over , " he told the Bild am Sonntag weekly .

Is Jennifer Lopez losing the curvaceous derriere which made her famous ?
After a series of fashion disasters in recent months , Jennifer Lopez made a triumphant return to form in a stunning figure - hugging dress at an event in New York last night .
Eight months after giving birth to twins , the Latina sensation showed she had regained her figure in a baby pink one - shouldered Versace dress .
Despite looking in fantastic form - there was something noticeably different about the star - her famous derriere appeared to be smaller .
Bottom or bust : Jennifer Lopez 's famous derriere looked noticeably smaller last night in New York ( L ) than it did in London five years ago ( R )
When Lopez first leaped to fame in the late Nineties , much ado was made about her curvy figure , with a lot of the focus directed on her behind .
She 's previously said of her curves : ' I could n’t ever be a size zero .
I have a butt , I have boobs and I have a woman ’s curves - there is no way I ’d see them go to zero . '
Exuding old Hollywood glamour last night , the 39 - year - old scrapped her hair back into a high chignon , adding extra height with metallic high - heels .
The tight dressed showed of Lopez 's amazing post - baby figure after she lost weight through a combination of swimming and training for a triathlon she competed in last month .

Hair - raising : Lopez 's dramatic hairstyle was a work of art in itself
The singer / actress arrived at the Fashion Group 's 25th annual Night of Stars at Cipriani Wall Street with husband Marc Anthony .
Special guest at the ceremony was Lopez 's close friend Donatella Versace , who was honoured with the Superstar Award last night .
She paid tribute to her late brother Gianni Versace , who was murdered on the steps of his Florida mansion 11 years ago .
Also representing the fashion world was Karl Lagerfield , who was spotted deep in conversation with the Anthonys .
Other stars in attendance included Debra Messing , Kerry Washington , Kate Bosworth Blake Lively , Ashley Olsen , Julianna Marguilies and Lindsay Price .
Lopez 's appearance at the bash comes just two weeks after she renewed her wedding vows with Marc Anthony in Las Vegas .
The couple , who have been married for four years , decided to renew their vows on the ' spur of the moment ' at 3.15 am in the penthouse suite of Caesar 's Palace .

Lopez and Anthony 's first marriage was a low - key , secret ceremony in the back garden of her Beverly Hills home .
The ceremony came just four months after J.Lo announced she had ended her engagement to Ben Affleck .
Lopez , who has two failed marriage behind her , admitted this week it took her a long time to find the right man .
She said : ' I have been in a few challenging ( relationships ) .
' I have been in relationships that can make you doubt who you are and what you are capable of , and doubt what you deserve .
It took me a bit little longer to get it right . '
Lopez gave birth to twins Max and Emme on February 22nd .

Oct. 14 ( Bloomberg ) — Nouriel Roubini , the professor who predicted the financial crisis in 2006 , said the U.S. will suffer its worst recession in 40 years , driving the stock market lower after it rallied the most in seven decades yesterday .
“ There are significant downside risks still to the market and the economy , ” Roubini , 50 , a New York University professor of economics , said in an interview with Bloomberg Television .
“ We ’re going to be surprised by the severity of the recession and the severity of the financial losses . ”
The economist said the recession will last 18 to 24 months , pushing unemployment to 9 percent , and already depressed home prices will fall another 15 percent .
The U.S. government will need to double its purchase of bank stakes and force lenders to eliminate dividends to save them from bankruptcy , Roubini added .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said today he plans to use $ 250 billion of taxpayer funds to purchase equity in thousands of financial firms to halt a credit freeze that threatened to drive companies into bankruptcy and eliminate jobs .
`` This will be the first round of recapitalization of the banks , ” Roubini said .
“ The government has to decide to intervene much more directly in the provision of credit and the management of these companies . ”
The Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index rallied the most since 1933 yesterday , rising 12 percent , on the government plan to buy stakes in banks and a Federal Reserve - led push to flood the global financial system with dollars .
The S&P 500 , which has fallen 36 percent since its October 2007 record , dropped 0.5 percent today .
` Really Tanking ’
“ The stock market is going to stop rallying soon enough when they see the economy is really tanking , ” Roubini added .
The U.S. unemployment rate stood at a five - year high of 6.1 percent last month .
Home prices in 20 U.S. metropolitan areas fell 16 percent in July from a year earlier , the most since records began in 2001 , according to the S&P / Case - Shiller home - price index .
Bank seizures may push home prices down further , scaring away buyers in coming months , after U.S. foreclosures rose at the fastest rate in almost three decades in the second quarter , according to the Mortgage Bankers Association .
Roubini said total credit losses resulting from the meltdown of the subprime mortgage market will be “ closer to $ 3 trillion , ” up from his previous estimate of $ 1 trillion to $ 2 trillion .
The International Monetary Fund estimated $ 1.4 trillion on Oct. 7 . Financial firms have so far reported $ 637 billion in losses , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .

Precise information about Kim Jong-il is difficult to obtain in secretive N Korea North Korean leader Kim Jong -il is probably still in hospital , but capable of making decisions , according to Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso .
Mr Aso said intelligence reports showed Mr Kim 's condition was not good and he was being treated by a French surgeon .
Mr Kim 's health has been the subject of intense speculation since he failed to appear at a key parade in September .
US and South Korean officials say he may have suffered a stroke , but the North says this is a lie .
European surgeon ?
Mr Aso did not reveal where the intelligence reports came from , saying : " In this era , we get information from many sectors . "
But he told the foreign policy committee that Japan had " information that Mr Kim is probably in hospital " .
" His condition is n't good .
But we do n't think that he's in a state where he 's incapable of making any decisions at all , " Mr Aso said .
There has been intense speculation about Kim 's health in recent weeks
The Japanese leader also appeared to confirm Japanese television reports that Mr Kim was receiving treatment from a French brain surgeon .
Earlier this week , Fuji TV broadcast footage of what it claimed was Mr Kim 's eldest son , Kim Jong -nam , entering a Paris clinic for a discussion about his father 's health .
South Korean intelligence officials have also said they believe Kim Jong - nam recently travelled to France .
Rumours about Kim Jong - il 's state of health began when he missed several important anniversary celebrations .
North Korean officials have consistently denied that their leader is ill , and earlier this month official media released pictures of Mr Kim inspecting a military unit .
But several experts say the pictures may have been shot months earlier , fuelling yet more speculation .
The rumours come amid ongoing international efforts to end North Korea 's nuclear programme .
Progress had stalled because Pyongyang was angry that the US had not taken it off a list of state sponsors of terrorism .
But the US has now removed it from the list , so North Korea has restarted work to dismantle its nuclear facilities .

The other day we reported findings from the Open Source Census - - a global effort to track the number of installations of open source packages on computers .
Among the top - level findings were that open source is seeing broad adoption in Europe and in finance .
The census has also made available a list of the top 20 open source packages found in its scans of thousands of computers .
Here are the packages that made the top 20 list .
Not surprisingly , Mozilla 's Firefox browser is more prevalent on scanned machines -- found on 83 percent of them -- than anything else .
Some of the other packages on the list are obviously there because they arrive automatically under the hood of operating systems .
It is interesting to see Lucene , the open source search engine with a truly remarkable indexer make the list .
Here are the top 20 packages , ranked by prevalence on machines around the globe , and you can find more at the Open Source Census site :

LOS ANGELES 
There is little suspense over the presidential race here , but a ballot initiative to overturn gay marriage is garnering the attention of politicians , activists and big spenders .
Proposition 8 , which would amend California 's constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman , was put on the ballot after a state Supreme Court ruling in May said a ban on gay marriage was unconstitutional .
50 STATES/50 DAYS : Read the full series
The ruling triggered a rush to the altar by gay and lesbian couples , including many from other states seeking legal recognition of their unions .
That prompted what has become a pricey and exuberant battle .
" This is the most expensive cultural war in America , ever , " says John Duran , a West Hollywood City Council member and fundraiser for opponents of Prop 8 .
" It 's a cultural war over the role of gay and lesbian Americans in California . "
Opponents of same - sex marriages are determined to trump the court at the ballot box and have unleashed a massive campaign of organizing , television ads and fundraising .
Their early success at fundraising forced gay - marriage advocates to step up their own campaign efforts , and now the two sides are on track to spend more than $ 60 million , about evenly divided .
The issue has made impromptu demonstrations a common sight across Southern California , as people from both sides wave signs at motorists from suburban street corners .
California 's record as a trend - setter for the rest of the nation means the implications go beyond the borders of a state that is home to roughly 12 % of the nation .
While similar issues face voters in Florida and Arizona , both sides believe victory here is of paramount importance to shape public attitudes about same - sex marriage nationally under the next administration .
" This is the second - biggest race in the country , " says Sonja Eddings Brown , spokeswoman for the Yes on 8 campaign .
" And the impact of Proposition 8 is going to set a precedent for the United States of America . "
Despite a tendency to elect Republican movie stars as governor , California has become reliably Democratic in presidential races .
President Bush lost here twice , by 11 percentage points in 2000 and 10 in 2004 .
This year , Republican John McCain has campaigned little in the state even though it offers the largest prize of all the states , 55 electoral votes .
An Oct. 25 Rasmussen Reports poll showed Obama leading 61% - 34 % .
California TV viewers have seen a deluge of ads on Prop 8 .
Ads supporting the amendment warn that schoolchildren " will be taught about gay marriage unless we vote yes on Prop 8 . "
The other side responds with commercials featuring the state 's top educator , Superintendent Jack O'Connell , saying the issue has nothing to do with schools or kids .
" Our schools are n't required to teach anything about marriage , and using kids to lie about that is shameful , " he says .
The Yes on 8 campaign points to education officials who feel it should be taught .
And it cites the example of Massachusetts , where the state Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2004 .
A federal appeals court ruled in February that the state can deny parents the right to remove their second - graders from classes that required reading books such as King and King , which is about two princes marrying .
The charges have stirred grass - roots campaigning by people who are n't normally involved in campaigns .
William Adams , 51 , of Irvine has festooned his Chevy pickup with hand - drawn wooden signs urging a vote for Prop 8 and declaring it a matter of parents ' rights to control what kids are exposed to .
Adams says he fears his church , the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , could be sued for discrimination for not recognizing gay couples .
" We 're not afraid of the homosexual movement ;
We are afraid of the government , " Adams says .
He has planted more than 50 yard signs and led groups of others in knocking on doors for votes for Prop 8 .
The door - to - door canvassing , as well as telephone voter - turnout efforts , are organized by his Mormon ward , or local church , Adams says .
Brown , the spokeswoman for Yes on 8 , estimates 40 % or more of the $ 28 million the group reported raising by Oct. 18 had come from Mormon donors .
But she says the coalition to overturn gay marriage is broad and even includes groups that tend to vote Democratic .
" We expect turnout in the African - American community to be an asset to us , " she says .
Geoff Kors , a member of the executive committee of the No on 8 campaign , says , " Every poll suggests this is a dead heat . "
Brown hopes that after Tuesday , gay marriage will be history in California .
" We really are at a cultural crossroads in America where we are going to be forced one way or another to decide whether the rights of children or the rights of gay adults are going to come first , " Brown says .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The nine largest U.S. banks receiving $ 125 billion from the government were asked on Tuesday to hand over information about their compensation and bonus plans to a Congressional panel .
Rep. Henry Waxman , chairman of the U.S.
House oversight committee , sent letters on Tuesday to the banks ’ chief executives asking them to provide information about the total compensation paid or projected to be paid to the 10 highest paid employees for the last three years .
Waxman , who has publicly blasted other executives for their lavish pay packages , wants the information broken down by salaries , bonuses and benefits and a description of the reasons for the year - to - year changes in the amounts .
Nine major banks , including Citigroup C.N , Goldman Sachs GS.N and Bank of America BAC.N , soon will be receiving cash from the Treasury Department 's $ 700 billion financial services rescue package .
“ While I understand the need to pay the salaries of employees , I question the appropriateness of depleting the capital that taxpayers just injected into the banks through the payment of billions of dollars in bonuses ... , ” Waxman , a Democrat from California , said in the letter .
Waxman ’s committee also wants information on the number of employees who were paid , or projected to be paid , more than $ 500,000 in total compensation for each year from 2006 to 2008 .
The deadline to hand over information is November 10 .
Banks participating in the federal cash infusion plan are subjected to rules that limit executive payouts .
However critics say those rules may not rein in hefty compensation packages because the language is vague and subject to government interpretation .
Alaska Personnel Board picks up new Palin - related complaints Nick Cargo
Published : Tuesday October 14 , 2008
Print This Email This
The board that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin called upon to handle the " Troopergate " investigation is handling new complaints against her , the Anchorage Daily News reported .
Gov. Palin filed the complaint on herself with the state Personnel Board , saying she hoped to " clear the air " over her actions in the dismissal of Walt Monegan , Alaska 's Public Safety Commissioner , separate from the state legislature 's probe , which she charged was politically biased .
The legislature 's recently released report found that Palin acted within her power to dismiss Monegan , but broke state ethics law by joining her husband Todd in efforts to fire state trooper Mike Wooten , who was going through a divorce with the Governor 's sister .
Monegan believed that he was fired for his refusal to dismiss Wooten .
Tim Petumenos , the Personnel Board 's investigator , did not say who else was targeted in the complaints , but did say that he refused to make the Board 's probe of Gov. Palin more public because other officials were involved .
Two known ethics complaints involving the Governor are known .
Activist Andree McLeod says that preferential treatment in hiring for a state position was given to a supporter of Palin , and the second , filed by the Public Safety Employees Association , says that Wooten 's personnel file was illegally breached by state officials .
PSEA executive director John Cyr said on Monday that the union will amend the complaint so the Personnel Board also probes " harassment " of Wooten .

Facebook LONDON  Motorists around the world have been paying more for their gasoline over the past month as falling U.S. stocks of the motor fuel have helped to drive up global oil prices .
Although prices have eased this week , worries persist over tight fuel supply ahead of the U.S. summer driving season starting in late May after government data issued on Wednesday showed gasoline stocks there down for the 10th week running .
" The simple cause every year really is just this inability in the U.S. refining system to produce sufficient gasoline for the summer months , " said Ray Holloway , director of the Petrol Retailers Association .
" It started a little earlier this year in the European market because of the problem with fuel quality in the U.K .
That just brought forward the expected price increase , " Holloway said .
Silicon contamination in gasoline damaged thousands of vehicles in the U.K in late February and early March .
According to figures released by Britain 's Automobile Association ( AA ) on Wednesday , the cost of unleaded gasoline generally rose in March and this week the price hit $ 8.37 a gallon in the U.K , where a gallon is equivalent to 1.2 U.S. gallons .
" Price pressure will continue to build until the middle of August , because this year we have started from a higher threshold and crude oil is under pressure because of instability , " said Holloway .
Drivers in the United States may wince over their seemingly high gasoline prices , but American retail fuel costs are positively inexpensive in light of what motorists elsewhere have to pay .
In the United States last month the average price of a gallon of unleaded gasoline was $ 2.87 , according to worldwide March fuel price data published Wednesday by the U.K. 's Automobile Association .
Contrast that to the adjusted $ 7.35 it costs Norwegians for a gallon of unleaded , or the $ 8.37 Britons pay for their petrol , and the American costs are tame .
In the Netherlands drivers pay the equivalent of $ 7.52 per gallon , more than twice the American average .
Of the 26 European countries quoted in the AA data , none paid less per gallon on average than the United States .
According to Reuters data , gasoline prices were lower than in the United States only in countries where government subsidies play a significant part in cutting prices at the pump .
In Russia , where the government still occasionally tries to cap prices and control consumer gasoline costs , a gallon of gasoline costs a Muscovite the equivalent of $ 2.78 .
To put this in perspective , the average monthly salary in Russia is 11,000 rubles , or $ 426 .
To fill up the 32 - gallon tank of a 2006 Hummer H2 in Moscow would cost $ 88 — more than 20 % of a Russian 's monthly take - home pay .

The chief participants in this debate — all Iraq War veterans — fixate on two large questions .
First , why , after its promising start , did Operation Iraqi Freedom go so badly wrong ?
Second , how should the hard - earned lessons of Iraq inform future policy ?
Hovering in the background of this Iraq - centered debate is another war that none of the debaters experienced personally — namely , Vietnam .
The protagonists fall into two camps : Crusaders and Conservatives .
The Crusaders consist of officers who see the Army ’s problems in Iraq as self - inflicted .
According to members of this camp , things went awry because rigidly conventional senior commanders , determined “ never again ” to see the Army sucked into a Vietnam - like quagmire , had largely ignored unconventional warfare and were therefore prepared poorly for it .
Typical of this generation is Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez , once the top U.S. commander in Baghdad , who in late 2003 was still describing the brewing insurgency as “ strategically and operationally insignificant , ” when the lowliest buck sergeant knew otherwise .
Younger officers critical of Sanchez are also committed to the slogan “ Never again , ” but with a different twist : never again should the officer corps fall prey to the willful amnesia to which the Army succumbed after Vietnam , when it turned its back on that war .
Among the Crusaders ’ most influential members is Lieutenant Colonel John Nagl , a West Pointer and Rhodes Scholar with a doctorate from Oxford University .
In 2002 , he published a book , impeccably timed , titled Learning to Eat Soup With a Knife : Counterinsurgency Lessons From Malaya and Vietnam .
After serving in Iraq as a battalion operations officer , Nagl helped rewrite the Army ’s counterinsurgency manual and commanded the unit that prepares U.S. soldiers to train Iraqi security forces .
( Earlier this year , he left the Army to accept a position with a Washington think tank . )
To Nagl , the lessons of the recent past are self - evident .
The events of 9/11 , he writes , “ conclusively demonstrated that instability anywhere can be a real threat to the American people here at home . ”
For the foreseeable future , political conditions abroad rather than specific military threats will pose the greatest danger to the United States .
Instability creates ungoverned spaces in which violent anti-American radicals thrive .
Yet if instability anywhere poses a threat , then ensuring the existence of stability everywhere — denying terrorists sanctuary in rogue or failed states — becomes a national - security imperative .
Define the problem in these terms , and winning battles becomes less urgent than pacifying populations and establishing effective governance .
War in this context implies not only coercion but also social engineering .
As Nagl puts it , the security challenges of the 21st century will require the U.S. military “ not just to dominate land operations , but to change entire societies . ”
If there ’s one thing I ’ve learned since joining the Candy Addict staff it ’s … well … it ’s that any man , regardless of age , build , or boxer short selection is sexy in a tub full of jelly beans .
But also that candy , despite its sweet nature , can be a very divisive subject .
Sure , it ’s hard to quibble over a Milky Way or gummi bear , but there are definitely a subset of treats capable of launching many an impassioned … shall we say … discussion .
A discussion I bravely had with our esteemed writing staff and also a few well - respected friends in order to bring you ( that ’s right – you ) our Top 10 Love ‘em or Hate ‘em Candies .
10 . SALT WATER TAFFY
Love : Itâ€™s sooooo summer in America .
You canâ€™t go to a beach town or amusement park and NOT eat it .
Plus , itâ€™s so darn pretty , with its myriad colors , dots , and swirls .
Hate :
It ’s always so tempting with its endless flavors , but inevitably disappoints â€ “ they all taste the same !
And then it adds the extra gut - punch of pulling out your teeth .
9. CANDY HEARTS
Love : Distinct flavors , plus you have to love a candy that encourages kids to read .
Hate :
Too chalky .
One too many and you ’re throwing up rainbows for the rest of the day .
8. BLACK LICORICE
Love :
It can be sweet , and it ’s an interesting flavor that brings more to your experience than just sugar .
Plus , it ’s good for your … ummm … digestion , we ’re told .
Hate : “ It ’s not really sweet or salty or sour or anything describable by human beings .
It just makes my tongue go all numb and then I can’t taste anything else for awhile . ”
7. DARK CHOCOLATE
Love :
It ’s rich with lovely overtones and complexities , though it might be an acquired taste .
Hate : Overprocessed dark chocolate is usually too waxy or bitter .
“ Blech .
I like my chocolate creamy and sweet , not bitter and strong . ”
6. CINNAMON CANDY ( RED HOTS , HOT TAMALES , ATOMIC FIREBALLS , ETC . )
Love :
What can I say , some people just love cinnamon flavored candy .
Cinnamon Flavored Fire Twizzlers have even been named Awesomely Addictive by our very own candy cult leader .
Hate : “ I never taste spice when I enjoy real cinnamon and never understood why cinnamon candy does n’t taste like a snickerdoodle . ”
“ The overwhelmingly fake cinnamon flavor does n’t do much for me – and why are hot candies always cinnamon ?
Real cinnamon is not hot at all . ”
5. CADBURY CREME EGGS
Love : “ I love to bite a small hole into it and suck all the sugary goodness out .
Mmmmm . ”
Hate :
Why would you want to eat a candy that replicates a chicken fetus when you can eat a fully - formed marshmallow version ?
“ Way waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too sweet .
They actually make my teeth hurt . ”
4. CIRCUS PEANUTS
Love : “ I ’ve always loved the texture , from chewy to melty within a few seconds . ”
Hate : “ First , the texture and shape are reminiscent of styrofoam package filler .
And are they supposed to have an orange flavor ?
Because they just taste like chemicals to me . ”
“ These things are just wrong on every level and were invented by parents to try to get their kids to stop eating candy . ”
3. MARSHMALLOW PEEPS
Love : “ I love the versatility – if you do n’t want to eat them , stage scenes with them !
Or , if you do n’t like them fresh , eat them stale .
Microwave them , freeze them , behead them , there are so many different ways to experience their sugary goodness . ”
“ They are so cute and lovable and squishy .
I mean , what ’s not to love ?
I love the crunchy exterior sugar coating and the soft , pillowy center . ”
Hate :
These have been bastardized by Just Born – whored out to every candy - worthy holiday and almost - holiday in America – thus obliterating their once - a - year appeal .
2. BUTTERED POPCORN JELLY BELLY JELLY BEANS
Love :
They ’re kind of a nice blend of salty and sweet and , despite an overwhelming majority of haters amongst the Candy Addict staff , they ’re Jelly Bellyâ€™s number one selling flavor , if you can believe that .
Hate : “ I hate these .
HATE .
They should be thrown in with Bertie Botts , with the rest of the disgusting flavors . ”
“ The flavor makes me want to be sick . ”
1. CANDY CORN
Love : “ Good memories of Halloween of yore ; I like biting them into the three separate colors and eating them separately – the white is a little bit crumbly , the others are softer . ”
Hate : “ Candy corn is the bane of my existence .
The best way I can describe candy corn is to have Lewis Black describe it for me : ”
“ The worst thing about Halloween is , of course , candy corn .
It ’s unbelievable to me .
Candy corn is the only candy in the history of America that ’s never been advertised .
And there ’s a reason .
All of the candy corn that was ever made was made in 1911 .
And so , since nobody eats that stuff , every year there ’s a ton of it left over .
And the candy corn company sends the guys to the villages and they collect out of the dumpsters all the candy corn we ’ve thrown away .
They wash it !!
They wash it !
I ’ll never forget the first time my mother gave me candy corn .
She said , “ Here – Lewis , this is candy corn .
It ’s corn that tastes like candy ” .
[ high pitched sound ]
This tastes like crap !
And every year since then , Halloween has returned and I , like an Alzhiemer ’s patient , find myself in the room , and the room has a big table in it , and on the table is a bowl of candy corn .
And I look at it as if I ’ve never seen it before .
“ Candy corn ” , I think .
“ Corn that tastes like candy .
I ca n’t wait . ”
Son of a b****! ”
So I guess that about says it all .
Thanks for all the great insight , Addicts !
What do you think , readers ?
Which side do you fall on ?
What did we miss ?
The Clinton administration says it wants to use the budget surplus to pay off the entire $ 3,700bn national debt by 2015 .
And it plans to boost spending on Medicare and Social Security , the programmes that provide income for the elderly .
Under the new proposals , $ 794bn would be set aside to strengthen Medicare , which provides health care for the elderly , an increase of $ 108bn on the previous budget proposal announced in January .
Some of the money would go to pay for prescription drugs , which are now exempted from the government health insurance system .
Social security
Additional funds would also go to boost the Social Security Trust Fund , which otherwise will run out of funds to pay retirement pensions in 2034 .
The allocation of an additional $ 543bn would keep the system solvent until 2053 .
The new proposals are a slight broadening of Mr Clinton 's earlier stance - " to save social security first " .
At that time , he proposed spending up to 38 % of the trust fund balance while it was still in surplus in earlier years .
Republicans want tax cuts
The growing budget surplus has complicated the political arithmetic in Congress .
The good economic news continues for Bill Clinton
With Republican efforts to pass spending bills in danger because of the tight spending caps - and with Mr Clinton likely to veto the $ 775 bn,10 - year tax cut they have in mind - Republican leaders have increasingly been banking on a budget windfall to help avoid gridlock .
Republican House of Representatives Speaker J Dennis Hastert said last week that he expected to promptly use any non-Social Security surpluses that become available .
But Gene Sperling , head of the White House 's National Economic Council , said he hoped the new plans would appeal to both Republicans and Democrats .
" We are very hopeful that the new Presidential proposal , that new Social Security lock box , will be a way of bringing together both Democrats an Republicans , " he said .
One way to make sure that there is no evidence of a breath machine ’s inaccuracy and unreliability is to simply make sure there is no record of its false results and failures … even if it means innocent people are convicted .
The main thing is to maintain faith in these devices , right ?
Fudged Breathalyzer Tests Questions DUI Arrests
Inspector Turned Machines Off When They Appeared About To Fail Throwing Into Doubt Thousands Of Drunk Driving Citations
Miami , FL . Oct. 16 – Defense attorneys were in a Miami courtroom on Thursday seeking a judge ’s order to inspect the hard drives of every breathalyzer machine used in Miami - Dade county .
Before Judge Jose L. Fernandez , attorney Michael Catalano said , " We ’re interested to find why she was unplugging breath machines so that she could cover up mistakes and not tell anybody . "
This comes after the Florida Department of Law Enforcement fired the examiner who was responsible for testing all the DUI machines , alleging she failed to follow protocol with the inspections .
Defense attorneys contend it is a scandal that puts suspicion over thousands of DUI cases in Monroe , Broward and Miami Dade .
" The number of cases involved could be as many as 10,000 here in Miami - Dade County , " attorney Richard Hersch explained to CBS4 reporter Gary Nelson .
" The inspector who has been discharged here was on duty for about 18 months before she was discharged . "
In a " notice of dismissal " , the FDLE accuses analyst Sandra Veiga of having encouraged police agencies to abort tests on Intoxilyzer 8000 machines that were giving questionable results .
" What the inspector was doing , " Hersch said , " was unplugging the machine if the inspection was failing , then plugging it back in ; that prevented the machines from reporting the malfunctions to Tallahassee . "
Do you really think this only happens in Miami ?

The Other National Election
The current financial melt down ( faster than the polar ice caps ) has commandeered the headlines , while Obama and McCain contest for the scraps of the Bush regime .
As the presidential contenders wrestle for elbow space on the front page , the other national race has gone largely unreported .
The Speaker of the House , leader of the Democratic majority party , Nancy Pelosi is campaigning for re-election in California ’s 8th District , in San Francisco .
Despite record low approval of Congress ( even lower than the record low approval rating of GWB ) Pelosi has been a popular Congresswoman in her district , and a source of pride as the first woman to hold the Speaker ’s gavel .
With typical 90 + % re-election rates for unindicted Congressional incumbents , the phrase “ throw the bums out , EXCEPT OUR PORK BARREL BUM ”  comes to mind .
But the loyalty of 8th district voters to Speaker Pelosi is being tested , and warrants our attention .
Why does California ’s 8th District Congressional race rank in significance with the presidential contest ?
Because Nancy Pelosi has shielded the Bush administration from investigation for a host of alleged crimes including war crimes , crimes against the peace , crimes against humanity , torture and treason .
These are not wild allegations .
They are well researched and well documented
By taking impeachment “ off the table , ”  Pelosi has implicated herself in all of the crimes alleged to the Bush / Cheney administration , and she has made a mockery of her assertions that she has the power to block impeachment hearings but somehow lacks the power to block war funding .
Pelosi speaks with forked tongue .
She has acted as the enabler to continue the crimes of Bush & co. , and to avoid any accountability for high crimes and misdemeanors , that cry out for impeachment , indictment and prosecution .
The 2006 midterm election brought forth a new Congress in a historic repudiation of the administration of Bush and Cheney .
The electorate demanded an end to the war in Iraq .
Nancy Pelosi was elected Speaker of the House by the new Democratic majority , and moved to overturn the 2006 election mandate by continuing the war policies of Bush / Cheney and blocking every effort to assign accountability for launching a war of choice , a war that failed every test of humanity , honesty , or necessity .
Before the invasion of Iraq , tens of millions of citizens in hundreds of cities all over the world took to the streets to say no to war .
San Francisco voters have an opportunity to put a stamp of NO CONFIDENCE in Speaker Pelosi .
She has betrayed the mandate of 2006 , and may find herself subject to indictment for endorsing the war policies of George W. Bush , and shielding his administration from charges of war crimes .
Since this is an election of national significance , I urge all Americans to oppose Pelosi ’s reelection and endorse Cindy Sheehan for Congress in California ’s 8th District .
Cindy is for single - payer healthcare , education for all , ending our addiction to oil , a sustainable environment , fair trade , workers and union rights , and ending war as an instrument of foreign policy .

Pittsboro , NC
( CNN ) -- Some aides to Sen .
John McCain say they were n't happy that running mate Sarah Palin went off script Sunday and turned attention back to the controversy over her wardrobe .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin deviated from her prepared remarks to talk about her wardrobe controversy Sunday .
The Alaska governor on Sunday brought up the recent reports regarding the Republican National Committee 's $ 150,000 spending spree on clothing and accessories for the Palin family .
Palin denounced talks of her wardrobe as " ridiculous " and declared emphatically : " Those clothes , they are not my property . "
" Just like the lighting and the staging and everything else that the RNC purchased , I 'm not taking them with me , " she said at a rally in Tampa , Florida .
A senior McCain adviser told CNN that those comments " were not the remarks we sent to her plane . "
Palin did not discuss the wardrobe story at her rally in Kissimmee , Florida , later in the day .
A Palin aide , however , told CNN that the governor clearly felt like she had to say something to defend herself , because " that 's really not who she is . "
Over the weekend , sources told CNN that long - brewing tensions between Palin and key aides to McCain were on the rise .
Several McCain advisers suggested that they have become increasingly frustrated with what one aide described as Palin " going rogue . "
A Palin associate , however , said the candidate is simply trying to " bust free " of what she believes was a damaging and mismanaged roll - out .
McCain sources say Palin has gone off - message several times , and they privately wonder whether the incidents were deliberate .
They cited an instance in which she labeled robocalls -- recorded messages often used to attack a candidate 's opponent -- " irritating " even as the campaign defended their use .
Also , they pointed to her telling reporters she disagreed with the campaign 's decision to pull out of Michigan .
A second McCain source says she appears to be looking out for herself more than the McCain campaign .
" She is a diva .
She takes no advice from anyone , " this McCain adviser said .
" She does not have any relationships of trust with any of us , her family or anyone else .
" Also , she is playing for her own future and sees herself as the next leader of the party .
Remember : Divas trust only unto themselves , as they see themselves as the beginning and end of all wisdom . "
Watch more on the ' diva ' criticism »
A Palin associate defended her , saying that she is " not good at process questions " and that her comments on Michigan and the robocalls were answers to process questions .
But this Palin source acknowledged that Palin is trying to take more control of her message , pointing to an impromptu news conference on a Colorado tarmac last week .
CNN contributor and Republican strategist Ed Rollins said Palin was " mishandled " during the earlier part of the campaign , and as a result , " she 's become a target of a lot of ridicule . "
But , he said , " She definitely is going to be the most popular Republican in this country when this thing is over . "
The Politico reported Saturday on Palin 's frustration , specifically with McCain advisers Nicolle Wallace and Steve Schmidt .
They helped decide to limit Palin 's initial media contact to high - profile interviews with Charlie Gibson of ABC and Katie Couric of CBS , which all McCain sources admit were highly damaging .
In response , Wallace e-mailed CNN the same quote she gave the Politico : " If people want to throw me under the bus , my personal belief is that the most honorable thing to do is to lie there . "
But two sources , one Palin associate and one McCain adviser , defended the decision to keep her media interaction limited after she was picked , both saying flatly that she was not ready and that the missteps could have been a lot worse .
They insisted that she needed time to be briefed on national and international issues and on McCain 's record .
" Her lack of fundamental understanding of some key issues was dramatic , " said another McCain source with direct knowledge of the process to prepare Palin after she was picked .
The source said it was probably the " hardest " to get her " up to speed than any candidate in history . "
Yet another senior McCain adviser lamented the public recriminations .
" This is what happens with a campaign that 's behind ; it brings out the worst in people , finger - pointing and scapegoating , " this senior adviser said .
This adviser also decried the double standard , noting that Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama 's running mate , Sen .
Joe Biden , has gone off the reservation as well , most recently by telling donors at a fundraiser that America 's enemies will try to " test " Obama .
Tensions like those within the McCain - Palin campaign are not unusual ; vice presidential candidates also have a history of butting heads with the top of the ticket .
John Edwards and his inner circle repeatedly questioned Sen .
John Kerry 's strategy in 2004 , and Kerry loyalists repeatedly aired in public their view that Edwards would not play the traditional attack dog role with relish because he wanted to protect his future political interests .
Even in a winning campaign like Bill Clinton 's , some of Al Gore 's aides in 1992 and again in 1996 questioned how Gore was being scheduled for campaign events .
Jack Kemp 's aides distrusted the Bob Dole camp and vice versa , and Dan Quayle loyalists had a list of gripes remarkably similar to those now being aired by Palin aides .
CNN 's John King and Peter Hamby contributed to this report .

â€ œAs fossil fuel prices rise , as oil insecurity deepens , and as concerns about climate change cast a shadow over the future of coal , a new energy economy is emerging in the United States , â€ says Lester R. Brown , President of the Earth Policy Institute , in a recent release , Â â€ œNew Energy Economy Emerging in the United Statesâ€ .
â€
œThe old energy economy , fueled by oil , coal , and natural gas , is being replaced by one powered by wind , solar , and geothermal energy .
The transition is moving at a pace and on a scale that we could not have imagined even a year ago .â€ 
Long the leading oil - producing state , Texas is also the leading generator of electricity from wind , having overtaken California .
Texas has nearly 6,000 megawatts of wind - generating capacity online and a staggering 39,000 megawatts in the construction and planning stages .
When all this is completed , Texas will more than satisfy the residential needs of the stateâ€™s 24 million people , enabling Texas to feed electricity to nearby states .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Â Â
Other states are emerging as wind superpowers .
Clipper Windpower and BP are teaming up to build the 5,050 - megawatt Titan wind farm , the worldâ€™s largest , in eastern South Dakota .
Titan will generate five times as much electricity as the stateâ€™s 780,000 residents currently use .
This project includes building a transmission line along an abandoned rail line across Iowa , feeding electricity into Illinois and the countryâ€™s industrial heartland .
See more examples .
In the east , Maine is planning to develop 3,000 megawatts of wind - generating capacity , far more than the stateâ€™s 1.3 million residents need .
Further south , Delaware is planning an offshore wind farm of up to 600 megawatts , which could satisfy half of the stateâ€™s residential electricity needs .
New York State , which has 700 megawatts of wind - generating capacity , plans to add another 8,000 megawatts .
Soon Oregon will nearly double its wind generating capacity with a 900 - megawatt wind farm in the wind - rich Columbia River Gorge .
Solar power is also expanding at a breakneck pace .
The nationâ€™s wealth of solar energy is being harnessed by using both photovoltaic cells and solar thermal power plants to convert sunlight into electricity .
The largest U.S. solar cell installation today is a 14 - megawatt array at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada , but photovoltaic electricity at the commercial level is about to go big time .
PG&E has entered into two solar cell power contracts with a combined capacity of 800 megawatts .
Together , these plants will have a peak output comparable to that of a large coal - fired power plant .
Solar thermal plants that use mirrors to concentrate sunlight on a vessel containing a fluid have suddenly become an enormously attractive technology .
There are now 10 large solar thermal power plants under construction or in development in the United States , ranging in size from 180 megawatts to 550 megawatts .
Within the next three years , the United States will likely go from 420 megawatts of solar thermal generating capacity to close to 3,500 megawatts .
Geothermal energy is also developing at an explosive rate .
As of 2008 the United States has nearly 3,000 megawatts of geothermal generating capacity .
Suddenly this too is changing .
Some 96 geothermal power plants now under development are expected to double U.S. geothermal generating capacity .
With California , Nevada , Oregon , Idaho , and Utah leading the way , the stage is set for the massive future development of geothermal energy .
( SeeÂ additional data . )
To ensure that this shift continues at a rapid rate , national leadership is needed in one key areaâ € ” building a strong national grid .
Although private investors are investing in long - distance high - voltage transmission lines , these need to be incorporated into a carefully planned national grid in order to unleash the full potential of renewable energy wealth .

Leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee have finally released their highly - anticipated draft legislation to cap greenhouse gas emissions .
The proposal ( pdf ) is modeled after the Senate bill that was introduced , debated , but not voted on earlier this year .
However , the draft legislation also contains some some substantial differences between the Senate version .
The draft would require 6 percent emission reductions by 2020 , compared to 19 percent in the Senate bill .
But the caps would accelerate in later years to require 80 percent reductions by 2050 , which is actually faster than the total proposed reductions in the Senate version .
The eighty percent reduction by 2050 would also matched the proposed targets released by Democratic candidate for President , Barack Obama .
>> More on cap and trade policies at RG&B
Representatives John Dingell ( D - MI ) and Rick Boucher ( D - VA ) said the slow start - up time would allow for the deployment of clean energy technology , particularly carbon capture and sequestration from coal - fired power plants .
But the slow start - up of the proposed legislation has some environmental groups hoping to make some changes in the bill .
Director of Climate Policy , David H. Moulton of the Wilderness Society said :
“ Unfortunately , it includes only a six percent reduction from 2005 levels by the year 2020 .
That goal is far short of the 20 - 25 percent reduction most scientists suggest we need in order to head off dangerous global warming later in the century .
“ By proposing weaker 2020 targets , the bill makes it even more difficult to bridge the gap , exposing our communities , ecosystems , public lands , national parks and wildlife refuges to unacceptable adverse impacts for even longer periods of time .
We look forward to working with Chairmen Dingell and Boucher to ensure the 2020 targets are strengthened to lessen the impacts global warming will cause on our natural resources this century . ”
The bill also proposes controversial limits on the ability of states to implement their own emissions caps .
Some states , including California , have begun to create their own emissions - reduction programs .
According to reports , lawmakers have been under increasing pressure to release legislative text .
Dingell and Boucher said that they did not want to rush the draft legislation because of the technical complexity of the issue .

A leukemia drug was about 70 % more effective than a standard therapy in treating early multiple sclerosis , according to clinical trial results in today's
In multiple sclerosis , or MS , the immune system attacks myelin , the sheath that enables nerve cells to conduct impulses between the brain and other parts of the body .
BETTER LIFE :
More news for healthy living
The drug , alemtuzumab , is a monoclonal antibody that depletes the body of the white blood cells that attack myelin , which are eventually replaced by new white blood cells that do n't .
For reasons not yet clear , though , alemtuzumab raised patients ' risk of autoimmune diseases of the thyroid or platelets , and one study participant died as a result .
Closer monitoring of patients in larger trials of the drug needed before it 's approved for MS should head off such problems , co-author Susan Moran , medical director at Genzyme , said Wednesday in a news conference .
Genzyme co-funded the study with Bayer Schering Pharma .
In the MS trial , researchers randomly assigned 334 patients to get either alemtuzumab or Rebif , a brand of interferon beta , for three years .
The alemtuzumab group received an intravenous infusion once a year , while the Rebif group injected themselves three times a week .
Participants all had relapsing - remitting MS that had been diagnosed within three years of entering the study .
Relapsing - remitting MS , the initial diagnosis for 85 % of people with MS , is characterized by attacks of worsening neurologic function followed by partial or complete remissions .
The researchers did n't know who was getting what treatment , but the patients did .
Lead author Alasdair Coles of the University of Cambridge in England said it 's impossible to prevent patients from figuring out whether they 're getting alemtuzumab , because the drug has predictable , mild symptoms when infused .
Although he calls the alemtuzumab trial 's results " remarkable , " Stephen Hauser , a University of California - San Francisco neurologist , writes in an editorial that alemtuzumab's " toxic effects … considerably dampen any enthusiasm for its routine use in patients with multiple sclerosis until more is known about its long - term safety and sustained efficacy . "
In an interview , John Richert , executive vice president for research and clinical programs at the National MS Society , noted that alemtuzumab " is many years away from being generally available as a treatment for MS . "
The autoimmunity side effects " can be monitored pretty carefully , " Richert said , but a larger and longer trial is needed to see whether alemtuzumab " is as strongly efficacious " as the newly published results suggest .

They gaze in awe at Jefferson 's little chess set , where he sat , 200 years ago , with his friend and apostle James Madison .
Between them , these two men in effect dreamed a new nation into existence .
Jefferson designed Monticello himself .
JEFFERSON AND HIS SLAVES

It is true to the man - the elegant proportions , the white domed roof above pillared porticoes , the bricks so brown they are almost ebony - the colour of the Virginia soil from which they were hewn and baked .
Huge sash windows bring light flooding in .
This is the aesthetic of the rational eighteenth century mind - the Enlightenment in architectural form .
But slave hands baked those bricks and stacked them , and throughout his life time more than two hundred slaves - Jefferson 's personal property - worked the fields of his estate .
Slavery and equality " We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal . "
The words of the American Declaration of Independence are Jefferson 's own .
In the US the natural ruling coalition since Jefferson 's election in 1800 has been a coalition of Southern Whites and Catholics in the North East and Mid West against their common enemy : white New England Protestants

All men , he goes on , " are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights " and among these are " life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness " .
How did the author of that ringing declaration of universal human rights reconcile himself to the ownership of slaves ?
It is one of the great contradictions of Jefferson 's life , of his age , and of the America that he and the founding generations conjured into being .
Jefferson 's wife , Martha , died in the 10th year of their marriage .
Present in the room at the moment of her death , with Jefferson himself , was Martha 's half - sister , a young slave girl called Sally Hemings .
She was the daughter of Martha 's own father and a slave called Elizabeth .
Slave Mistress Years later , in Paris , Jefferson began a relationship with Sally .
Together , they had six children .
Jefferson 's enemies accused him of misconduct and tried to use the scandal against him when he ran for president .
It did n't work .
Jefferson said nothing , neither confirming nor denying it .
For 200 years , Jefferson scholars for the most part dismissed what came to be known as the " Sally Question " as implausible .
The Jefferson that Americans had written into their national mythology - the Jefferson who is carved into Mount Rushmore - could not have had such a relationship .
It could not be allowed to stand .
New evidence Recently , Professor Annette Gordon - Reed rescued Sally and the entire slave population of Monticello from the shadows and gave them flesh and blood , names , characters , personalities and life stories .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
DNA evidence establishes beyond doubt that Jefferson fathered Sally 's children .
Her remarkable research challenges a certain conception of America , an idea of the Republic that has prevailed for 200 years .
Why , I asked her , do so many Americans continue to resist the idea that Sally was so intimately involved in the life of the greatest of all the founding fathers ?
" I think it points to contemporary racial attitudes , " she told me .
" They are very much like past racial attitudes .
Jefferson is seen as the embodiment of the American spirit .
It is absolutely about ownership of the story of the Republic , of the Republic itself .
" If you founded something , you own it .
And the founding story is of a group of white men who come together with high ideals and found this new nation . "
Jeffersonian Democracy Jefferson is so identified with the founding ideals of the Republic that he gave his name to great American experiment itself .
Republicans or Democrats , northerners or southerners , black , white Hispanic , recent immigrant or settled for generations , Americans are all children of " Jeffersonian democracy " .
It is a democracy in which the citizen is free to live a life without interference or instruction from government ; a democracy of small , weak , unobtrusive government .
Jefferson 's great rival , his near contemporary Alexander Hamilton , dreamed a different America into being , an America that sat alongside Jefferson 's ideal in a relationship of dynamic tension .
Hamilton 's America needed a strong federal government , a standing army , a national currency and a central bank .
Jefferson thought all that smacked of the European - and specifically British - monarchism and imperialism he despised .
Jeffersonian America was conceived as the alternative to all that .
Jefferson 's United States is spoken in the plural - " the United States are " he thought of , and referred to , Virginia as his " country " .
Hamiltonian America is emphatically singular .
Defender of states ' rights Jefferson the Virginian , the Southerner , the defender of the rights of the slave - holding states , believed in an agrarian America of free and independent gentlemen farmers , living their lives unmolested by government .
He believed the likes of Hamilton , the New Yorker , and the Northern states in general had been lured away from that ideal by urbanisation , industry , commerce , banks , finance and the accumulation of money .
Michael Lind of the New America Foundation , believes the fault line that opened up between Jefferson and Hamilton two hundred years ago still operates in America 's two - party system : " You can make the case that in the US the natural ruling coalition since Jefferson 's election in 1800 has been a coalition of Southern Whites and Catholics in the North East and Mid West against their common enemy : white New England Protestants . "
Look at America today - its powerful federal government , its enormous army , its commitments overseas , the still - mighty US dollar .
America may be a Hamiltonian country .
But its heart , both nostalgic and aspiring , still belongs to Thomas Jefferson .
Allan Little 's programme on Thomas Jefferson , America 's First Principles , will be broadcast on BBC World Service radio from Sunday 26 October .

What are these ?
( CNN ) -- Sen .
Joe Biden gave a knowledgeable but restrained performance in Thursday night 's vice presidential debate , while Gov. Sarah Palin sought to show that her accomplishments as governor and mayor prove she is qualified for the job .
Biden , the Democratic vice presidential candidate , slammed John McCain , saying " he has been no maverick on the issues that matter to people lives , " but his only challenge to Palin was asking her to articulate a policy on the Iraq war .
Palin , the Republican vice presidential candidate , pushed her " track record of reform " and said she and McCain are a " team of mavericks . "
" We 're known for putting partisan politics aside to just get the job done , " she said .
Watch Biden slam McCain's " maverick " image »
The debate took place at Washington University in St. Louis , Missouri , and was moderated by PBS 's Gwen Ifill .
The candidates covered everything from the economy to energy policy to foreign policy in the first and only vice presidential debate of the election season .
iReport.com : Who won ?
You tell us
Paul Begala , a Democratic strategist and CNN contributor , said the candidates approached the questions in different ways .
" You had two different strategies .
Joe Biden 's strategy was to hammer McCain , link him to the status quo and Bush .
He succeeded , " Begala said .
" Sarah Palin 's strategy was to defend Sarah Palin and repair her damaged image , and I think she did a pretty good job of that , " he said .
Watch the candidates talk about their role as VP »
In the days leading up to the debate , Palin was heavily criticized for her television interviews with CBS ' Katie Couric .
Palin stumbled through answers to questions about foreign policy , Supreme Court rulings and which newspapers she reads , causing pundits to question how she would hold up against Biden .
Republican strategist Amy Holmes said Palin " more than held her own . "
" She was polished , direct , folksy and on message .
She stressed her personal experience both as a mom and as a governor , from the kitchen table to the executive branch , her record as a reformer and bipartisan deal maker .
She even got Biden to agree with her , " Holmes said .
See what the analysts thought »
Going into the debate , there was a lot of speculation about whether Biden would make any major gaffes .
Biden has had a lot of experience in the public eye , but has also earned a reputation for his impetuous and brutally honest remarks .
" Joe Biden gave the best debate performance of his life .
I thought he had superior knowledge , superiority on the debate overall .
On political point , it maybe be a bit of a draw , " said David Gergen , a senior political analyst for CNN .
" As a debate , I thought he was a superior debater . "
As Biden tried to tear down McCain 's " maverick " status , Palin worked to portray Barack Obama as a " downright dangerous " choice for president .
Calling out Obama 's remarks about being open to meeting with rogue leaders without preconditions , Palin said , " An issue like that taken up by a presidential candidate goes beyond naivete and goes beyond poor judgment . "
See scenes from the debate »
In a Democratic debate last summer , the candidates were asked whether they would be " willing to meet separately , without precondition , during the first year of your administration , in Washington or anywhere else , with the leaders of Iran , Syria , Venezuela , Cuba and North Korea , in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries ? "
" I would .
And the reason is this , that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them -- which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration -- is ridiculous , " Obama answered .
Palin also said Obama 's campaign does " too much finger - pointing " to be serious about its call for change .
" There have been huge blunders in the war .
There have been huge blunders throughout this administration , as there are with every administration .
" But for a ticket that wants to talk about change and looking into the future , there 's too much finger - pointing backwards to ever make us believe that 's where you 're going , " she said .
Biden responded with , " Past is prologue . "
He said it is relevant to call out problems with the Bush administration because so far , McCain 's policy " is the same as George Bush 's , and you know where that policy has taken us . "
" We will make significant change so once again we 're the most respected nation in the world , " Biden said .
Some of the more heated exchanges came when the vice presidential candidates discussed Iraq , climate change and tax policy .
Watch the candidates debate the economy »
Asked about an exit strategy for Iraq , Palin praised the surge and the work of Gen. David Petraeus .
" I know that the other ticket opposed this surge , in fact , even opposed funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Barack Obama voted against funding troops there after promising that he would not do so , " she said .
" And Sen .
Biden , I respected you when you called him out on that . "
Asked for his answer , Biden challenged Palin : " With all due respect , I did n't hear a plan . "
" Barack Obama offered a clear plan .
Shift responsibility to Iraqis over the next 16 months .
Draw down our combat troops , " he said .
" With regard to Barack Obama not , quote , funding the troops , John McCain voted the exact same way .
John McCain voted against funding the troops because of an amendment he voted against had a timeline in it to draw down American troops , " he said .
Fact Check : Did Obama vote to cut funds for troops ?
On climate change , Palin was quick to say that she is n't one to " attribute every activity of man to the changes in the climate . "
" There is something to be said also for man 's activities , but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet , " she said .
Biden disagreed , saying , " I think it is manmade .
It 's clearly manmade . "
" If you do n't understand what the cause is , you cannot come up with a solution , " Biden said .
On taxes , Biden spoke to the middle class as he touted Obama 's plan .
" When you do well , America does well , " Biden said , referring to tax breaks aimed at the middle class that Obama has proposed .
Palin attacked Obama 's plan as " the backwards way of defending our economy . "
Fact check : Obama and spending
Speaking about the current economic situation and the government 's proposed rescue plan , Biden blamed some of the crisis on deregulation policies that McCain believes in .
" He voted for deregulation and that is why we are in the crisis that we are in , " Biden said .
Biden said the economic bailout bill is evidence that the United States currently has the " worst economic policy we ever had . "
Palin said a barometer for how Americans are feeling about the economy can be felt at kids ' soccer games .
Watch Palin say she and McCain will fight for the middle class »
" The barometer there , I think , is going to be resounding that our economy is hurting and the federal government has not provided the sound oversight that we need and that we deserve , and we need reform to that end , " she said .
Palin praised McCain 's efforts to help get an economic bailout bill passed , and she said voters need to put the " maverick of the Senate " in the White House in order to reform Washington .

SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - Untouched natural forests store three times more carbon dioxide than previously estimated and 60 percent more than plantation forests , said a new Australian study of “ green carbon ” and its role in climate change .

Green carbon occurs in natural forests , brown carbon is found in industrialized forests or plantations , grey carbon in fossil fuels and blue carbon in oceans .
Australian National University ( ANU ) scientists said that the role of untouched forests , and their biomass of green carbon , had been underestimated in the fight against global warming .
The scientists said the U.N. ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and the Kyoto Protocol did not distinguish between the carbon capacity of plantation forests and untouched forests .
Yet untouched forests can carry three times the carbon presently estimated , if their biomass of carbon stock was included , said the ANU report released on Tuesday .
Currently , forest carbon storage capacity is based on plantation forest estimates .
The report “ Green Carbon , the role of natural forests in carbon storage ” said a difference in the definition of a forest was also underestimating the carbon stock in old - growth forests .
The IPCC defines a forest as trees taller than 2 meters ( six feet ) and a canopy cover greater than 10 percent , but in Australia a forest was defined as having trees taller than 10 meters ( 33 feet ) and a canopy cover greater than 30 percent .
The report said southeast Australia ’s unlogged forests could store about 640 tonnes per hectare ( 1,600 tonnes per acre ) , yet the IPCC estimate put it at only around 217 tonnes of carbon per hectare .
The scientists estimated that around 9.3 billion tonnes of carbon can be stored in the 14.5 million hectares of eucalypt forests in southeast Australia if they are left undisturbed .
The IPCC estimates only one third of this capacity and only 27 percent of the forests ’ biomass carbon stock .
“ MORE RESILIENT ”
Not only did natural forests store more carbon but because they remained untouched , they stored the carbon for longer than plantation forests which were cut down on a rotation basis .
The report found that “ natural forests are more resilient to climate change and disturbances than plantations ” .
Co-author of the report Brendan Mackey said protecting natural forests served two purposes : it maintained a large carbon sink and stopped the release of the forest ’s stored carbon .
“ Protecting the carbon in natural forests is preventing an additional emission of carbon from what we get from burning fossil fuel , ” Mackey told Reuters .
The carbon stored in the world ’s biomass and soil was approximately three times the amount in the atmosphere , said the report .
About 35 percent of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is a result of past deforestation and 18 percent of annual global emissions is from continued deforestation .
The report said logging resulted in more than a 40 percent reduction in long - term carbon compared with unlogged forests .
“ The majority of biomass carbon in natural forests resides in the woody biomass of large old trees .
Commercial logging changes the age structure of forests so that the average age of trees is much younger , ” it said .
“ The carbon stock of forests subject to commercial logging , and of monoculture plantations in particular , will therefore always be significantly less on average than the carbon stock of natural , undisturbed forests . ”
The scientists said preventing further deforestation of southeast Australia ’s eucalypt forests was the equivalent of preventing emissions of 460 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year for the next 100 years .
Allowing logged forests to regrow to their natural carbon storage capacity would avoid emissions of 136 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year for the next 100 years -- about 25 percent of Australia ’s total emissions in 2005 .
“ In Australia and probably globally the carbon carrying capacity of natural forests is underestimated and therefore misrepresented in economic valuations and in policy options , ” said the report .

“ It blows my mind . ”
Those are the words St. Bernard parish president Craig Taffaro used to watch videotape Eyewitness News showed him , of floodwalls built to protect his parish .
“ That should be criminal , ” Taffaro continues .
What he ’s talking about was witnessed by a St. Bernard Parish resident who did n’t want to be identified , but did have sharp criticism of the work done by a contractor hired by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers .
“ It ’s like putting a Band - Aid on the hole of a gas tank of an airplane , ” the resident said .
Instead of an airplane , it ’s a floodwall , and instead of a Band - Aid , the witness says two years ago , he saw the contractor filling the expansion joint or opening between the floodwalls with newspaper .
“ The whole length of the wall was stuffed with newspaper . ”
And when he confronted the contractor , the contractor blamed Washington for the substandard work .
“ He basically told me when Congress sent down the money , it would be repaired the proper way . ”
But during a recent trip to the area , two years later , it was apparent that did n’t happen .
Much of the newspaper had deteriorated or been eaten by bugs , but some still remained .
In fact WWL cameras even captured the date May 21 , 2006 , on a page of the Parade magazine from the Times - Picayune .
Eyewitness News asked local engineer Subhash Kulkarni to investigate the findings at the floodwall .
“ They should have done a better job than what you see here . ”
Kulkarni is a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers .
The ASCE named him outstanding civil engineer in Louisiana back in 2003 .
“ I cannot even comprehend that somebody would stuff some newspaper in there . ”
Engineers tell Eyewitness News an expansion joint has three lines of defense .
The first is an elastic strip that helps keep water out .
In the middle is the most important part , a waterstop , which is in fact included in the St. Bernard floodwall .
However what is missing is a rubber joint that goes in between and helps keep foreign objects out .
The witness who talked to Eyewitness News says the contractor used the newspaper in place of the rubber joint .
Kulkarni says it ’s not a short term risk , but over time that missing rubber joint could weaken that waterstop .
“ It could be very serious , ” Kulkarni said .
“ It does n’t take a lot of stress to cause the failure of these floodwalls .
We do n’t know after two or three years how the main joint will perform .
This is the first line of defense . ”
But the Army Corps of Engineers says it is confident the floodwall will sufficiently defend residents of St. Bernard and the Ninth Ward .
“ If you look at the repairs we made to the joints , there ’s not really a safety issue with the joints at all , ” said Kevin Wagner with the Army Corps of Engineers .
The Corps also says it ’s satisfied with the quality of work done by its contractor .
When asked by WWL if there was any shoddy work involved , Wagner said , “ I do n’t think so at all . ”
But days before that interview , after a request by Eyewitness News , another Corps employee e-mailed the Corps ’ standards for expansion joint construction and in that e-mail , the Corps employee describes the specific materials needed as “ sponge rubber ” that goes next to the waterstop .
That ’s the same spot where a witness saw a contractor stuffing newspaper back in 2006 .
When asked if the absence of material behind the waterstop was what was called for in the contract , Corps spokesman Kevin Wagner called the project an emergency repair .
“ If we would have built a new floodwall that would not have been the case .
We would have the waterstop , some joint filler material in between and then we would put an elastic sealer over the top of it , ” Wagner said .
“ In this case we tried to do the repairs as quick as possible to protect the water stop before the start of hurricane season . ”
But according to the contract obtained by Eyewitness News , that may not be the case .
The contract calls for Ercon Corporation , based in Lafayette , Louisiana , to do the almost $ 2 million of work to raise and repair the floodwall under the Paris Road bridge .
In the contract , WWL found at least four mentions of field molded sealants .
Kulkarni says that is the sponge rubber material to fill the cavity in the expansion joint .
And he says the contract shows the rubber material was contractually required to be installed .
“ I would say they have not met their obligation to install the joint correctly .
They have n’t installed it at all , ” Kulkarni said .
Eyewitness News contacted the president of Ercon Corporation by phone and e-mail .
He did n’t respond to our repeated requests for a comment on this story .
Further , our investigation revealed Ercon Corporation is not even licensed by the state ’s board for contractors .
The Corps of Engineers says as long as the federal government pays for the work , it does not prevent them from hiring an unlicensed Louisiana company .
“ If you ’re telling me this is an out of town contractor who drives back to wherever they ’re from and puts their head on the pillow at night , does it really matter to them that this particular part of the project fails ? ”
St. Bernard president Craig Taffaro asks .
Taffaro calls the response from the Corps and Contractor unacceptable .
“ Would they let a contractor put Play - Doh in the place of mortar when they put bricks on their house ?
No , I do n’t think so , ” Taffaro said .
He says while newspaper does n’t define the entire levee system , it does have him concerned about the oversight of all work being done in southeast Louisiana .
“ It ’s an indictment against the quality of work being done , ” Taffaro says .
“ Let ’s hope that same standard was n’t being used in constructing the floodwall in constructing the levees . ”

Re “ McCain ’s Canal Zone Birth Prompts Queries About Whether That Rules Him Out ” ( news article , Feb. 28 ) :
Surely “ natural - born citizen ” means a person who is born a citizen without a need to be “ naturalized . ”
The phrase “ native - born citizen ” could easily have been used if anything else was intended .
There are many deliberately inexact phrases in the Constitution , such as “ cruel and unusual ” and “ due process , ” in need of interpretation and reinterpretation based on changing circumstances and ideas .
This is not one of them .

I do not understand the controversy over Senator John McCain ’s citizenship .
The following from the United States Code could not be clearer :
“ [ 8 U.S.C. 1403 ] ( a) Any person born in the Canal Zone on or after February 26 , 1904 , and whether before or after the effective date of this chapter , whose father or mother or both at the time of the birth of such person was or is a citizen of the United States , is declared to be a citizen of the United States . ”

The tomatoes are full of a beneficial pigment Scientists have developed purple tomatoes which they hope may be able to keep cancer at bay .
The fruit are rich in an antioxidant pigment called anthocyanin which is thought to have anti-cancer properties .
A team from the John Innes Centre , Norwich , created the tomatoes by incorporating genes from the snapdragon flower , which is high in anthocyanin .
The study , published in Nature Biotechnology , found mice who ate the tomatoes lived longer .
This offers the potential to promote health through diet by reducing the impact of chronic disease
Professor Cathie Martin
John Innes Centre Anthocyanins , found in particularly high levels in berries such as blackberry , cranberry and chokeberry , have been shown to help significantly slow the growth of colon cancer cells .
They are also thought to offer protection against cardiovascular disease and age - related degenerative diseases .
There is also evidence that the pigments have anti-inflammatory properties , help boost eyesight , and may help stave off obesity and diabetes .
The John Innes team is investigating ways to increase the levels of health - promoting compounds in more commonly eaten fruits and vegetables .
Tomatoes already contain high levels of beneficial antioxidant compounds , such as lycopene and flavonoids .
More benefit Professor Cathie Martin , from the centre , said : " Most people do not eat five portions of fruits and vegetables a day , but they can get more benefit from those they do eat if common fruit and veg can be developed that are higher in bioactive compounds . "
It is too early to say whether anthocyanins obtained through diet could help to reduce the risk of cancer
Dr Lara Bennett
Cancer Research UK
The John Innes team took two genes from snapdragon that induce the production of anthocyanins in snapdragon flowers , and turned them on in tomato fruit .
Anthocyanins accumulated in tomatoes at higher levels than anything previously achieved in both the peel and flesh of the fruit , giving them an intense purple colour .
Tests on mice bred to be susceptible to cancer showed that animals whose diets were supplemented with the purple tomatoes had a significantly longer lifespan compared to those who received only normal red tomatoes .
Professor Martin said : " This is one of the first examples of metabolic engineering that offers the potential to promote health through diet by reducing the impact of chronic disease .
" And certainly the first example of a GMO [ genetically modified organism ] with a trait that really offers a potential benefit for all consumers . "
She said the the next step would be test the tomatoes on human volunteers .
Exciting Dr Lara Bennett , of the charity Cancer Research UK , said : " It is exciting to see new techniques that could potentially make healthy foods even better for us .
" But it is too early to say whether anthocyanins obtained through diet could help to reduce the risk of cancer .
" We do know that eating a healthy , balanced diet that is rich in fibre , fruit and vegetables - and low in red and processed meat - is an important way to reduce your cancer risk . "
Dr Paul Kroon , of the Food Research Institute in Norwich , said the research was an " important study " .
" The technology offers great scope for altering colours of fruits and vegetables , and their content of potentially health - protective compounds . "
However , he said it would be wrong to assume the effects seen in mice would necessarily occur in humans .
Anna Denny , a nutrition scientist for the British Nutrition Foundation , stressed there was no " magic bullet " against diseases such as cancer and heart disease .
" Fruit and veg with higher levels of health - promoting compounds should not been seen as a replacement for eating a healthy balanced diet . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The United Kingdom has MI - 5 , which roots out spies and terrorists in the British Isles .
The RAND Corporation said one option would be for domestic intelligence to operate under the FBI .
Canada has CSIS -- the Canadian Security Intelligence Service .
Now Congress is asking : Should the U.S. have its own domestic intelligence agency ?
On Monday , at the request of Congress , the RAND Corporation outlined the pros and cons of establishing a domestic intelligence agency .
It also discussed different ways to organize a new entity , either as part of an existing department or as a new agency .
But there 's one thing you wo n't find in the report -- a recommendation on what to do .
" We were not asked to make a recommendation , and this assessment does not do so , " the report says .
Instead , says RAND 's Gregory Treverton , the report provides a " framework " for policymakers to use when deciding whether and how to reorganize counter - intelligence efforts at home .
RAND is a nonprofit think tank seeking to help improve policy and decision making through objective research and analysis .
Collecting intelligence domestically always has been a sensitive issue , at least partially because of episodic abuses by the government , notably against civil rights leaders , unions , antiwar organizations or even communists and hate groups .
But the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks renewed calls for increased domestic intelligence to prevent future attacks .
Critics said that in the lead - up to the attacks , the FBI devalued counterterrorism agents and failed to heed signs that an attack was imminent .
" If you did n't carry a gun , you did n't count so much , " Treverton said .
After the attacks , the FBI moved to transform its primary mission from law enforcement to counterterrorism intelligence and prevention .
It now focuses on terrorism through its National Security Branch and the National Counterterrorism Center .
The RAND report focuses on two options to the current system .
In one , a new agency would be created using intelligence agencies from the FBI , Department of Homeland Security and intelligence community .
A second option is to create an " agency within an agency " in the FBI or DHS .
Do n't Miss What J. Edgar Hoover once said about columnist
The first option would result in an organization with a clear , unambiguous mission , and might be able to draw on a more diverse recruitment pool , such as linguists and historians who are not normally attracted to law enforcement .
On the flip side , such massive reorganizations typically involve political compromises that could affect its performance .
The second option -- an " agency within an agency " -- could involve less short - term disruption , but could be hindered by a " lack of clarity of a single mission , " the report says .
RAND also suggests a range of actions short of reorganization that could improve domestic intelligence gathering , such as increasing resources , improving leadership and changing bureaucratic cultures .
The report does not assess the FBI 's performance since 9/11 , Treverton said , but he believes Congress should seek an independent assessment .
A panel of experts that RAND convened guessed that the probability of a terrorist attack had decreased about one - third since the September 11 , 2001 .
But " they were not enthusiastic about alternatives " to current counterterrorism organizations .
In a cautionary note , the report says that while public acceptance of domestic intelligence activities is imperative , public attitudes about what is considered acceptable " can both be fragile and shift significantly over time . "
" Public demand for domestic intelligence is driven by the perceived threat , and those perceptions can change much more rapidly than the threat itself , " the report says .
For instance , immediately after the 9/11 attacks , 49 percent of people surveyed were worried " a great deal " about more attacks .
Two years later , that had dropped to 25 percent .

told by Tapen Sinha , PhD
I heard this from one of my professors .
To protect him , no names will be revealed .
This professor was about to get married .
He went to the jewelers to get a wedding ring for his fiancee .
The jeweler told him that he can have the inside of the ring engraved with the name of his fiancee for an additional $ 20 ( remember , this was a LONG time ago ) .
He said , “ But that will reduce the resale value ! ”
The jeweler was aghast .
He said , “ How can you say such a thing .
You are a butcher ! ”
“ No , ” replied the professor , “ I am an economist ” .

God reviews the billions of people assembled , and says , “ Welcome to Heaven .
Women , go with Saint Peter .
Men , form two lines .
One line shall be men who dominated their women on Earth .
The other line shall be men who were dominated by their women . ”
After much movement and shuffling , all the women are gone , and there remain two lines of men .
The line of men that were dominated by their women is hundreds , perhaps thousands of miles long .
The line of men that dominated women has but one man standing .
God reviews the two lines , points to the long line , and in a voice that echoes angrily throughout Heaven says , “ You men should be ashamed .
I created you in MY image , and you all were dominated by your mates .
Behold !
Only one of my sons stood up and made me proud .
You shall learn from him ! ”
God turns to the one man standing , smiles , and says , “ Tell them , my son .
How did you manage to be the only one in that line ? ”
And the man says , “ I do n’t know , Lord .
My wife told me to stand here . ”

Can I time these articles or what ?
The day after I put up my article on Ethiopia ’s troubles in Somalia , 5 car bombs go off in two Somali cities targeting the Ethiopian consulate in Hargeisa , the Presidential Palace ( such as it is ) , a UN HQ , and the Puntland Intelligence Service .
That ’s the first time I even knew there was a Puntland Intel Service , by the way .
Puntland is the horniest part of Somalia , the coastline up there where it pokes up into the Indian Ocean and then heads west toward Djibouti .
Puntland has been in the news a lot because it ’s the home beach of the world ’s coolest pirates .
Maybe the Intel Service was getting in the way of the local business .
I would ’ve thought their main job was identifying promising ships , casing the joint as it were , and passing on the info to the local Long John Silvers for a cut .
Well , if there were any Puntland crimefighters , they ’re shredded meat now .
That ’ll teach those do - gooders to mess with the Horn .
I have to stop a sec to give some credit to those beautiful Somali pirates .
Everybody these days TALKS piracy but nobody does anything .
Except the Somalis .
All these noisy pampered brats want to be Jack Sparrow , I hear them badgering their moms while I ’m trying to eat my lunch at Wendy ’s–only these Somali kids do n’t just whine at their parents to buy them expensive toys .
No , they go out there and get what they want by boarding freighters trying to sneak past Puntland ’s coast .
God , that ’s got to be one of the scariest sights in the world , a speedboat full of Somali skeletons armed to the teeth coming aboard .
These crews are mostly from hardworking South Asian places , Tamil or Bengali , and they did n’t sign on to play straight man to the Pirates of Puntland .
Once in a while you get a little more poetic justice , like when they boarded a French yacht and took the crew hostage a while back .
Unfortunately , the champagne - poppers were rescued .
You can bet money changed hands , too .
The shipping companies do n’t like to talk about ransom , but they pay up .
So there are a lot of Somalis flashin ’ the bling and soupin ’ up the cigar boats along the Puntland coast , yo ho ho and a bottle of money .
I saw one of these tsk-tsk articles the other day with the headline , “ What drives Somalis to piracy ? ”
Dumbest question ever ; even the subhead answered it for them : “ Women , Money , Drugs . ”
Does that answer your question ?
Not to mention the fact , which I go into in the article below here , that Somalis are raiders , plunderers from way back .
They like it .
Even your fat little video - game nephew likes the idea , he just does n’t have the guts to do it .
What do you think he ’s doing on his console up there in his room except blowing people away and taking their stuff ?
Somalis can go out and just coldbloodedly do it .
Anyway , Puntland is the bad boy of the broken - up Somalia we have now .
The northwest part is the good little Mama ’s boy Somalia , where the nice Somalis are .
Hargeisa , where most of these bombs went off , is the capital of goody - two - shoes Somalia .
What just happened up there is the old , traditional Somalia ’s way of saying no to all that Western innovation .
Just think of it as a vote for tradition : the good old tradition of stealing people ’s stuff and slitting their throats .
You know , the one your little darling ’s practicing on his X - Box .
The bombers probably were n’t pirates , because piracy ’s more a career move , and no guidance counselor this side of Chechnya ’s ever been able to talk your ambitious senior into suicide bomb - ery as a top - ten “ Grow Your Resume ! ” option .
Even Johnny
Depp could n’t get much team spirit into a speech with , “ Arrr , me hardies , go blow yourselves up ! ” for a finish .
The bombers were probably Islamists , because your serious Islamic groupie seriously thinks that getting vaporized in a junker full of fertilizer is the best way to wealth and riches , via Paradise .
The bombings were probably linked up to the Islamic Courts that ruled Somalia before the Ethiopians ( with Cheney ’s help ) pushed them out of Mogadishu .
For more on that , “ see below , ” like us journalists say .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Stocks tumbled at the open Monday , tracking a trend in global markets , as the government 's $ 700 bailout in the U.S. last week and interventions in Europe over the weekend failed to soothe nervous markets .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % was down 214 points , or 2 % , at 10,112 , with 29 of its 30 components opening lower .
The Dow 's financial stocks led the decline , with Citigroup Inc. [ s ; c ] , Bank of America BAC , - 1.32 % and JP Morgan Chase JPM , - 0.84 % all falling more than 4 % .
The S&P 500 index was down 24 points , or 2.3 % , at 1,074 , while the Nasdaq Composite COMP , - 0.29 % dipped 44 points , or 2.4 % , at 1,901 .

For believers in liberty and sound economics , it has been a series of devastating weeks .
The crisis of fiat money , long foretold by the Austrian School , finally came , but there turns out to be no great satisfaction in saying , “ I told you so . ”
If it would do any good , it would be worth it .
But treasury officials and central bankers are proceeding as if they had nothing to do with actually causing the bubble and the bursting of the bubble , and that the old tale about the need to lift prices to fix the recession is true .
It is the perfect storm : the big banks loot us through government , while the academic economists approve it as applied science .
Moreover , there seems to be no test of whether or not what they are doing is a good thing .
When the market responds negatively to a new infusion of cash , they say that it is n’t enough .
When the market responds positively , they take credit for fixing the problem .
The state acts as if it is the one infallible institution .
To top it off , the unreconstructed Keynesian Paul Krugman has won the Swedish central bank ’s Nobel Prize in economics , not for his reflationist views but for his trade theory .
Nonetheless , his overall oeuvre will receive new attention , and his views on the crisis are identical to the kind of fallacy - ridden central planning that caused the downturn of 1929 to turn into the Great Depression .
Put his ideas in charge , and we are doomed .
Instead , of course , they should turn to those who both predicted this crisis and who offer a coherent explanation of it .
The most important priority right now is dramatic monetary reform .
In an ideal world , officials would follow the Mises / Rothbard strategy of defining the dollar as a weight of gold and permit all - round convertibility at all levels .
The immediate criticism is that this step would curb the power of central bankers and government to create money out of thin air to fix the crisis .
But the criticism alone makes the point .
It would indeed restrict their power and that is precisely why it needs to be done .
Good liquidity needs to be based on savings and capital , and it can not be created by decree .
Decrees end up creating money out of thin air , which ends up overriding market preferences and generating inflation .
Everything officials do to fix the crisis ends up prolonging it .
Here ’s the core problem of the gold standard idea .
It is indeed the best path .
But the people charged with implementing it will invariably be the very people who have caused the current problem , and have the least incentive to change the system .
We ’ve seen in the last several weeks how these people are willing to blow up the world rather than face liquidation .
So the question becomes : how can we take steps toward sound money and banking without depending on the goodwill of the officials in charge ?
The answer is provided in some of the writings of Jrg Guido Hlsmann and , before him , Hans Sennholz .
Guido is a student of Rothbard ’s while Hans was a student of Mises’s .
Both agree on an alternative path forward , which embraces radical decontrol of money and banking in the hope of a currency competition that will at least allow gold currency as an option .
Guido ’s book on the topic will be appearing soon , and Hans Sennholz ’s relevant work here is Money and Freedom , which is newly available from Mises.org .
This is also the approach that Ron Paul , a longtime advocate of the gold standard , took during his campaign .
Currently the government has in place severe restrictions on what currency you can use as legal tender .
The courts do not enforce other kinds of monetary contracts .
Anyone who comes up with alternative currency is going to face possible prosecution .
For this reason , the dollar is mandatory .
We will be stuck with it even if the feds are destroying it .
There is no way out .
All these restrictions need to be repealed as a step toward monetary reform .
People should be free to use any money they want .
More than that , people should be free to introduce new monies based on gold or silver or any other commodity , and develop payment systems based on this , whether that means paper signifiers or digital goods .
The market is capable of policing this system the same way it does retail trade .
Money originated in a market competition long before the age of the nation state .
It is a product of the market , not of state edict or some mythical “ social compact . ”
Nor is there a reason to put a stop to the competitive process once it has decided upon a single money .
Money can and does fail , especially once it is nationalized and given over to a central bank to manage .
Permitting freedom in money production and use amounts to permitting market forces to continue to select among a variety of choices .
In many ways , this proposal finds support in the work of F.A. Hayek , who also advocated competitive currencies .
But this one goes further in allowing a full free market in minting money by private firms .
There is historical precedent for this in George Selgin ’s Good Money .
In England , early in the Industrial Revolution , the state also maintained a monopoly on money production but it failed to make enough small - denomination coins to meet the demand .
Private button makers swung into action to make coins that were circulated widely .
Their quality was controlled by market means , and they became far more desirable and widely circulated than government money .
What ’s interesting here is how the market subverted what is called Gresham ’s Law , which asserts that “ bad money ” drives good money underground .
But that is only true if the “ bad money ” is artificially overvalued .
In settings in which the official currency is failing and alternatives are available , the process can work in the reverse , with good money replacing bad as the primary means of exchange .
Not only is the soundness of the world economy at stake .
There is a matter of human rights : the right to invent , trade , make contracts , and associate .
The major strategic advantage of this program is that it is not asking the state to do anything positive with its monetary powers .
A demand for monetary freedom — a repeal of legal tender and the opening up of the banking system to private enterprise — is nothing more than extension of the right to freedom generally .

The Best of Llewellyn H. Rockwell , Jr.
Between the growing number of American jobs being lost to the ailing economy and the fervid campaigning of presidential candidates , the issue of immigration — specifically from Mexico — has fired up this year .
Recent raids by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) at five locations of Pilgrim Pride ’s Chicken , as well as Agriprocessors in Postville , Iowa have resulted in hundreds of arrests and major disruptions in the meat industry .
Since economists predict no relief to the nation ’s economic slump for a year or more , the presence of our southern neighbors within U.S. borders will be one of many major challenges facing our next president and an intensely controversial issue for years to come .
But while it seems politicians and bureaucrats publicly clash over the legal and illegal immigration of Mexicans constantly , we seldom hear about the opposite — American emigration to Mexico .
Not only is Mexico host to the colossal mass of American college kids flocking to Cancun , Acapulco and other spring break hot spots every March , but the country is also home to the largest number of American expatriates , with an estimated one million former U.S. citizens taking up permanent residency south of the border .
In San Miguel de Allende , a picturesque cosmopolitan town about three hours northeast of Mexico City , approximately 5000 expatriates live for all or part of the year .
The historic area , known for its exquisite colonial architecture , cobblestone streets and countless year - round fiestas , began experiencing a large influx of Americans post - WWII .
With the passage of the G.I. Bill , veterans flocked to study art and Spanish at the U.S. - accredited Instituto Allende , increasing the town ’s population exponentially .
San Miguel became an important location for the 60s counterculture movement when its reputation as a center for art and beatniks attracted many Americans who were looking to escape mainstream America .
Among them was Ken Kesey , who fled the U.S. to escape drug charges and brought his infamous band of Day - Glo-loving Merry Pranksters with him .
The town was actually the final resting place of Neal Cassady , who died in 1968 of a suspected overdose near railroad tracks that crossed through San Miguel .
Today , the town of San Miguel and its Instituo de Allende draw new residents from around the world , the majority of which are from the U.S and Europe .
" San Miguel is very international , " said Ricardo Vidargas , a photography professor at the Instituto , " Many writers , artists and sculptors from the Americas and Europe have homes here or come here to retire . "
Vidargas , who grew up in San Miguel and lived in New York for 20 years , said the town experienced tremendous commercial development during his absence , largely due to American influence and investment .
These developments have not been warmly welcomed by long - time residents of San Miguel .
Earlier this year , the opening of a Starbucks and Home Depot nearby led residents valuing the singular ambience and antiquity of San Miguel to protest , explained Vidargas ' wife Joan , a jewelry sculptor and former native of New Jersey .
" Protesting was our way of taking a stand , " she said , " We wanted to show that we were protecting San Miguel as a unique cultural and untouched place . "
Mrs. Vidargas , who has lived in San Miguel since 1997 , said the most difficult part of adapting to life in Mexico was the language change .
" It took months to become fluent in Spanish but most amenities available in the U.S. are available here except for a few things . ”
Among the things she misses most from America are " the variety of food and good make - up . "
Vidargas said she feels it ’s important for Americans living in Mexico or other countries to remember they ’re guests and make an effort to learn and adapt to the traditions of their new home .
" Sometimes it ’s easy for Americans living here to stick to a community of Americans since there are so many , " she said .
" It ’s important to break out of that comfort zone and become immersed in San Miguel ’s culture and way of life .
Above all , I think it ’s important to always maintain a level of respect for the people and traditions of San Miguel — or any other foreign place you live in . ”
The UK economy had been the envy of Europe for years but those high times seem to be an an end .
One third of the British economy is related to banking / finance so problems in that sector along with even more personal debt than the US ( shocking as that may be ) spells serious trouble in the months to come .
On that news , European markets are dropping hard in early trading , following negative days across Asia .
The British economy shrank more than expected and for the first time in 16 years in the third quarter of 2008 , as fears grow the country could be in for a painful and prolonged recession .
The Office for National Statistics said on Friday gross domestic product fell 0.5 percent in the three months to September , the biggest drop since Q4 1990 and the first contraction since Q2 1992 .
Analysts had forecast a fall of 0.2 percent .
On the year , GDP was 0.3 percent higher , the weakest rate of growth since Q2 1992 .
Florida 's last minute and selective enforcement of Florida 's " No Match No Vote " law § 97.053 (6 ) F.S violates the Equal Protection clause of the 14th amendment .
The law is only being applied to a certain class of voters - the newest voters - only those registering after Sept 8 .
The 10.7 million voters who registered before September 8 will not have to leap the arbitrary hurdles and barriers to voting .
More than 7000 would - be voters have now been snared by Florida 's decision to start enforcement of the controversial " no- match " voter ID law last month .
Florida is throwing up every barrier they can for the newly engaged voters .
Unlike 45 other states , Florida wo n't let you clear up the matching problem ON election day , by simply showing your ID .
Voter ID is required in order to vote , yet Florida wo n't let you use it to prove your identity on election day !
Florida says you have to either miss work or make a special trip before the election , or get stuck with a crappy provisional ballot and clear up the problem AFTER the election .
A recent report by the Advancement Project outlines how states like Florida and Ohio had disenfranchised voters by over using provisional ballots , ballots which often do n't count !
Provisional ballots are not counted on election night , but for many , the election is considered over .
Further , at least 30 % of provisional ballots end up being rejected .
The problem - The " No Match No Vote " law orders that a registrant provide either a drivers license or the last four digits of their social security number , and then the Elections dept tries to match that against the DMV or the Social Security databases .
Often as high as 20 % fail to match using their social security number .
45 other states wisely either never adopted the " no match no vote " law , or abandoned it .
In his Oped Even the unverified can vote Florida SOS Kurt Browning misleads the public into thinking that enforcing Florida 's " No Match No Vote " law will not disenfranchise any voters .
Many through no fault of their own will fail to match .
Florida must do the right thing and allow voters who meet Florida 's voter ID requirements to obtain a regular ballot regardless of whether they manage to match the governments ' faulty databases .
WHAT YOU CAN DO :
URGENT : Tell Gov. Crist to Let the People Vote !
The Florida Voters Coalition says - Stand up for democracy now .
Tell the Governor and Secretary Browning to do the right thing immediately , and issue a directive that allows supervisors to let voters vote .
Just copy and paste the letter below into your own e-mail and address it to Governor Charlie Crist at charlie .
Crist@MyFlorida.com and Secretary of State Kurt Browning at secretaryofstate@dos.state.fl.us
Subject Line : Let the People Vote !
Dear Governor Crist and Secretary Browning ,
We understand you want to deter voter fraud and ensure uniformity in Florida 's election code .
So do we .
We trust that you want to allow all eligible voters an equal opportunity to cast their ballot .
So do we .
We trust that you would not support Florida using a law that purports to deter voter fraud but really institutionalizes voter suppression .
We believe that is what is happening with Florida 's No Match No Vote law , § 97.053 (6 ) F.S. .
We need you to be The People 's Governor ; The New Secretary In Town , as you 've described yourselves , and step in on behalf of all eligible voters .
1. Suspend implementation of this law until after the November 4th general election .
Your offices as well as county elections offices are much too busy to do a good job with this last - minute burden .
Eligible voters are sure to be disenfranchised .
Voter fraud is unlikely to be deterred .

PC World Finds Apple Laptops Cheaper Than PC Laptops

If you want to compare apples to PCs , do n't buy into the old hype that MacBooks and MacBook Pros cost more than a PC laptop , according to the Windows - oriented PC World magazine .
The magazine compared Apple 's MacBook , MacBook Pro , and MacBook Air to similarly configured laptops from Dell , HP , and Lenovo , and found that Apple 's offerings were the cheaper , with a caveat or two .
The first caveat is in the MacBook Air and Lenovo X300 comparison , which found that the Chinese laptop was cheaper if you bought it with a 20 % discount that was being offered when the systems were configured on 6/20/2008 ( that discount is still available as of this writing on 7/9/2008 ) .
PC
World found that the discounted price of the X300 was US $ 2711 with 3rd party photo and video editing software , compared $ 3,098 for the MacBook Air .
The second caveat is that PC World included software in its pricing comparisons .
The magazine included copies of Adobe 's Photoshop Elements and Premiere Elements for $ 99 in order to make the PC laptops from all three vendors include ( some of ) the same functionality as Apple 's iLife suite , which is included in Apple 's MacBook line for free .
PC apologists often discount the inclusion of iLife as a point of comparison , while PC World felt it an issue that needed to be addressed .
In our own comparisons -- as well as Charles Gaba 's more recent shootouts -- we have tended to include 3rd party software on the PCs we 're looking at , as well .
PC World priced a Dell XPS M1330 at $ 1,308 , compared to a stock MacBook at $ 1,299 .
On the pro side , the magazine priced an HP Compaq 8710w Mobile Workstation at $ 3,561 , compared to a MacBook Pro at $ 3,049 .
Author James A. Martin concluded , " Do n't buy into the old argument that Mac laptops are categorically more expensive than Windows machines .
Sometimes that 's true -- but they 're often on par with , or cost less than , their closest Windows laptop equivalents . "

At a campaign stop in California on Saturday , Sarah Palin told one of her cutesy folksy hockey mom stories about reading the quote of the day on her Starbucks mocha cup .
The quote was from former Secretary of State , Madeleine Albright .
“ Now she said it , I did n’t , ” quipped Palin with her finger in the air . ” She said , ‘ There ’s a place in Hell reserved for women who do n’t support other women . ' ”
In a bit of irony , the crowd was actually booing Madeleine Albright , the first female Secretary of State , and had to stop so they could laugh and cheer at Palin ’s “ gotcha ” about not supporting women .
It turns out the actual quote was , “ There ’s a place in Hell reserved for women who do n’t help other women . ”
Albright responded , saying she was “ flattered ” Palin chose “ to cite me as a source of wisdom ” but said the quote “ had nothing to do with politics . ”
“ This is yet another example of McCain and Palin distorting the truth , and all the more reason to remember that this campaign is not about gender , it is about which candidate has an agenda that will improve the lives of all Americans , including women . ”
Palin told her cheering audience to watch and see how her comment is “ turned into whatever it ’ll be turned into tomorrow with the newspaper . ”
Well , this is n’t a newspaper , but I ’m going to turn it into this :
Hmmm ….
Governor Palin , you were saying something about a place in Hell ?

Well another week slipped by where I forgot to update one of the weeks , but that just makes room for a major update this week .
It has been a good week around the web as well right here as you can tell I ’ve been fairly active in posting .
The way it has been going out there I feel the opportunities to get one way links is going to keep rising and rising .
I ’m going to be starting to consult out more to you fine folks who do n’t have the time to do a lot of link building as well perhaps start a job board to find other link builders for work .
Virb has been growing steadily and in the past couple of months , it has shown significant traffic growth mainly due to its quality of content .
This social network site lets you showcase off every little piece of media you have to throw at it such as videos , blogs and photos .
I never looked into the site earlier until this week when I noticed a nice juicy link one of my clients was getting from their profile that they had setup .
So getting to the good stuff … Virb of course has do follow within your personal blog , as well within your profile under website .
Since the quality of content is high on Virb you best be expected to utilize this amazing site not for SPAM , but for what it is intended for .
This new website is called Clutter Me .
The web interface is a overly easy to use system that allows you to build social media rich websites in no time , and if you like , embed do follow links to anything you ’re writing about .
Since Clutter
Me is quite new the link juice is n’t that powerful , but the folks behind it are pushing the site very hard and within a few months your links should be worth the effort .
I highly recommend building a few good webpages within Clutter Me and if you want to make a little money they ’ve just opened up an affiliate program .
Elgg is one of the most popular open source social networking platforms , and for good reason .
Elgg has seen a lot of development and the most recent 1.0 version is nothing to snicker at !
I ’ve been using it for a project and I really like what they have done with the platform in regards to features , and what I think is most important , speed due to the efficiency of code .
Now I ’m aware blackhats are actively exploiting the Elgg platform mainly due to one reason , everything is pretty much do follow .
I ’ll be straight forward and mention , as I always do , that I do not condone spamming but adding relevant comments or content to the social platform .
If you do a Google search for powered by Elgg you will find well over 50,000 sites that are powered by the social networking sofware .
BlognList is a great service for getting some buzz and backlinks generated for your company or product .
BlognList is like other review services such as Blogsvertise , but they go above and beyond when it comes to quality .
They have an army of top notch bloggers backed with authorative blogs in almost every niche you could think of .
If you ’re looking to build an effective link building campaign then I highly recommend it so long as you make it worth your while .
They have many packages to suite anyone ’s budget , and I recommend trying out the smallest first to see the results before continueing on with your campaign .
I was browsing around the web tonight and I came across YouBundle which left me asking myself how did I ever miss it ?
I ’ve even been planning to launch a service just like it which kind of discouraged me , but I ’m still going to blog about this amazing site anyway .
YouBundle is somewhat like Squidoo except it ’s put together completely different , is much more social and provides a fresh look at social media .
I ’ve been playing around with Social Median tonight and I REALLY like what I ’m seeing .
Social Median is a new way of getting customized news from around the web as well getting your news out in the world with the click of the mouse .
The interface took me a little while to get used to , but once I got the hang of It I was creating custom news feeds from the great sources already within the system , and then I made my own custom news feed for link building .
After a few hours I ’ve realized that Social Median ’s suggestive topics for news it thought I would like was spot on .
I ’ve now got this happily feeding me news all day on my new Blackberry Storm which makes my day a whole lot more less productive .. but in a good way .
I highly recommend everyone to try it out , make some news feeds and get some links plus traffic from this social networking site .
Flowgram.com is a revolutionary social media platform that allows you to combine media from many sites into one neat “ Flowgram ” .
This allows you to create a mini presention on a subject and include all the information you need from many sites such as Youtube , Flickr and even Power Point docs !
Google has really been showing some love for this site and you can get a do follow backlink to your webpage within your user profile .
But with a site like this , you have to think beyond just getting that link and create some very cool and unique content pieces to promote your product , web page or just about anything you like .
I was scanning a few top rated sites lately for new places to get backlinks and came across a cool little website called Launch Feed .
This new service is great for two reasons , one it ’s absolutely free , as well it provides a do follow link !
It ’s pretty straight forward so all you have to do is submit your url , write a description and let the good times roll .
If you want you can write a review or promote your page to get your readers to submit reviews for you .
I ’d like to thank Mubashar Iqbal for programming this out of his labour of love and making this tool for free .
So if anyone needs some programming done , you can contact him over at his software companies website , Suffolk Software .
So enough of my blabbing …. go ahead and get yourself signed up .
Collin Lahay managed to get a great post out called Link Building With iList this week and it ’s another great example of what I missed !
iList is a recently new classified site with a very nice web 2.0 feel to it that allows you to get some do follow links as well promote products .
I ’ll take a snippet from Collin ’s post here to let him explain it better ….oh and if you have n’t bookmarked his site yet do it .
i List.com is a free classified ads website much like the more popular Craigslist or Gumtree .
i List has a more “ web2.0 ″ feel with their fancy buttons and simple publishing menu’s , and it kind of reminds me of Squidoo ’s interface .
Unlike iList ’s more popular competitors , iList provides dofollow anchor text links in their classified ads .
You can easily visit iList.com and create your account in seconds , and then make a classifieds listing with a link back to your site .
You would then want to submit your classifieds page to the SocialMarker sites to help Google find the page quickly .
Linkers Blog made up the Top 10 Link Building Blogs Of 2008 and I was luckily and graciously approved to the list .
But besides that , they have included a great list of sites that you should probably be reading on a weekly basis …. that is if you want to stay ahead in this game .
Hopefully with your support and my continued writing I ’ll be able to make it higher up on the list for next year !
Ann Smarty , one of my favorite bloggers , has of course written another amazing post with some really solid information regarding link building for e-commerce sites .
I ’ve been doing a lot of this lately and was even thinking of writing a post until she beat me to the punch .. but it ’s for the best because she ’s a much better writer !
The good folks over at SEOptimise posted a really good article entitled 30 Ways to Get Links Naturally & Stop Link Building .
You may have seen this one already on Sphinn because it ’s a wicked article and everyone should read it .
They fuel the fire and provide some very unique ways of building links that most people are not doing these days …even me !
Top executives at Lehman Brothers ’ New York office , who were at the helm during history ’s largest corporate bankruptcy , have been guaranteed the lion ’s share of a $ 2.5 billion bonus pot .
Lehman had “ walled off ” the fund , telling buyer Barclays Capital that it could n’t use the money for anything but severance payments or bonuses .
In bankruptcy court , British - based Barclays said it will use the cash to retain Lehman ’s most valued employees – particularly eight key directors .
Those “ elite eight ” also have been guaranteed $ 10 million to $ 25 million salaries for two years .
The most wanted include longtime execs Michael Gelband , the bank ’s global head of Capital Markets since June , and Eric Felder and Hyung Soon Lee , global co-heads of Fixed Income , positions both men were promoted to this month , the Sunday Times of London reported .
Gelband lives in tony Short Hills , NJ .
Felder lives in a plush West Village pad and owns two Ferraris and a Land Rover , Department of Motor Vehicles records show .
The platinum payout will go to executives who rode the collapse of the nation ’s fourth - largest investment bank .
In the past year , the company ’s stock price dropped from $ 68 a share to as low as 21 cents , and since June 2007 , the bank has laid off 6,000 workers .
A Lehman spokeswoman denied that all the bonus cash would go to a few execs .
“ It ’s absolutely untrue that the bonus pool is being reserved for a small number of people , ” said Monique Wise .
Some defended the bonuses , saying Barclays could n’t run Lehman without keeping top executives .
“ It ’s unimaginable to me that they can run the business without people , ” said Lehman ’s financial adviser , Barry Ridings , of Lazard Ltd .
Barclays President Bob Diamond told The Times that the bonuses will be dispensed carefully .
“ You can expect us to manage this with the same discipline and performance terms that we have at BarCap [ Barclays Capital ] , ” he said .
He asked all 10,000 Lehman staffers to show up for work tomorrow , although over the next three months , Barclays could ax thousands of them .
Felder , who spoke to The Post last night , declined to discuss any cushy payouts , but said that he would try to keep Lehman employees working .
“ This is a tragic event for 26,000 people .
The firm wants to make sure the people get jobs , ” he said .
“ We spent a tremendous amount of time trying to make sure as many people get jobs as possible . ”
The deal , which was worth $ 1.7 billion at the beginning of the week , may now be worth closer to $ 1.35 billion , which includes Lehman ’s Midtown office building .

Republicans once more charged the media with sexism for reporting on Palin ’s Imelda Marcos closet .
“ No one would blink if this was a male candidate buying Brooks Brothers suits , ” said William F. B. O’Reilly , a G.O.P. consultant .

It does n’t wash to cry sexism now any more than it did at the beginning , when the campaign tried to use that dodge to divert attention from Palin ’s lacunae in the sort of knowledge you need to run the world .
The press has written plenty about the vanities and extravagances of male candidates .
( See : Haircuts , John Edwards and Bill Clinton . )
Sexism would be to treat Palin differently , or more delicately , than one of the guys .
The governor who spent all her time talking about how she had cleaned up excesses in Alaska , and would do the same in Washington , also went over the top on hair and makeup .
As a former beauty pageant contestant and sports anchor on TV , Palin already seemed on top of her grooming before the McCain campaign made her traveling makeup artist , Amy Strozzi , the highest - paid individual on the campaign for the first two weeks of October .
Ms. Strozzi , who earned an Emmy nomination for her war paint skills on the TV show “ So You Think You Can Dance , ” made $ 22,800 for the first half of this month .
Governor Palin , who used to get her hair done at the Beehive in Wasilla and shop at an Anchorage consignment shop called Out of the Closet , paid her traveling hairstylist  recommended by Cindy McCain  $ 10,000 for the first half of October .
In The New York Times Magazine today , Robert Draper reveals that the campaign also hired a former New York stage and screen actress , Priscilla Shanks , to be her voice coach for the convention .
The expense was listed in finance reports as Operating Expenditures and Get - Out - The - Vote consulting .
Apparently getting out the vote includes teaching a potential vice president the correct way to pronounce “ nuclear . ”
The conservative big shots who have not deserted Palin and still think she can be Reagan in a Valentino skirt are furious at those who have mishandled the governor and dimmed her star power .
They mourn that she may have to wait now until 2016 to get rid of the phony stench of designer populism .
Makeovers are every woman ’s dream .
But this makeover has simply pushed back Palin ’s dream of being president .
1. $ 1936.01 - General fund donations
$ 5,159.71 for a new furnace .
$ 1000 for house paint .
4. $ 1286.01 for children 's bedroom furniture .
This was for bunkbeds so that more children could fit into the bedrooms with their mothers .
2. This was a really important project !
We did the fundraiser in honor of Joe Biden 's mother - in - law , Bonny Jean Jacobs .
The shelter has installed the new furnace , and I also received a thank you card from the Biden family .
3 . The paint was peeling terribly on the house , so a youth group volunteered to paint it in July .
It now looks great .
If you search this site , you 'll find some pictures I posted of the house being painted .
Police can call on troops in an emergency Scientists from Porton Down have been deployed in the UK a " number of times this year " , the government 's head of counter - terrorism has told MPs .
The lab mainly specialises in nuclear and biological warfare but the reason for the deployments is not known .
Brigadier Chip Chapman told a committee of MPs he could not go into details for national security reasons .
The Commons defence committee is probing the UK 's level of readiness for a terrorist or other emergency .
Lord
West said ministers did not know the location and capability of all deployable troops in the UK at any one time but he was confident they could find out " straight away " in the event of an emergency .
The security minister said government agencies were now better informed about the counter - terrorism forces and scientific capabilities available to them - and a compendium had been made available to officials .
Major emergency Brigadier Chapman told MPs " immediate response " teams from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory ( DSTL ) had been deployed on a number of occasions in the past year .
" The number of occasions they have been used and the circumstances I can not go into in this forum , " said Brig Chapman , director of counter - terrorism and UK operations at the ministry of defence .
To stop this radicalisation and extremism is going to take - and I get into trouble for saying this - about 30 years
Lord West
The DSTL , which is based in Wiltshire , is the UK's leading biological and chemical defence research centre .
It also develops a range of other technologies for military and civilian use , including X - ray scanning equipment and armour .
On the broader question of whether the UK was prepared for a major incident , Lord West confessed he did not know how many hospital beds could be made available in the event of an emergency of the order of 10,000 deaths .
But he said the Department of Health " would know " the figures and plans would be coordinated by the government 's emergency planning committee Cobra .
Radicalisation
The security minister also said progress was being made on preventing young people becoming " radicalised " but he said it was going to be a long process .
He said he accepted Britain 's foreign policy was a " problem " for some young Muslims but the government was now " engaging " with them .
" This is n't going to change just like that .
To stop this radicalisation and extremism is going to take - and I get into trouble for saying this - about 30 years , I think .
" But it will become a virtuous circle , it will start getting better and better and we have to embark on it and the recognition of that I think is one of the big things that has happened over the last 15 months . "
He said Britain could not " arrest and protect ourselves out of this problem " and the government was " putting work into prisons , into places of worship , into sports clubs " to tackle extremism .
But he added : " I do n't pretend for a moment that we are nearly there .
I regularly go out and talk to youngsters and some of the reactions I find just amazing , because you think ' how on earth can you believe that ' but you need to have a dialogue . "
Maritime security Lord West was also quizzed on whether the government was actively studying ways in which terrorists could launch an attack on the UK .
He said " red teaming , " as such scenario planning was known , did take place to a limited degree and various " what if " scenarios were constantly being worked through , including how terrorists might target the UK 's financial system .
He also raised concern about maritime security , saying that there was still no way of tracking all shipping movements in British waters .
" In the skies , we pretty well know what is moving , but we do n't know that in the waters around our country , " he said .
Lord
West also stressed that the government 's counter - terrorism strategy had saved " hundreds if not thousands of lives " .
The peer said he could not go into details about specific plots but measures such as doubling the size of the security services and increasing surveillance were working .
The government is due to publish a new national security strategy next spring , Lord West told the MPs , and it was preparing to unveil plans to make intelligence chiefs give evidence in public , something first flagged up in March .
Explaining the delay , Lord West said the prime minister had been " busy with other things " .
He said the government was still considering appointing a minister to act as a " national security adviser , " similar to the role played by Condoleezza Rice in the US .
Armed Forces Minister Bob Ainsworth was quizzed about plans to shoot down passenger jets judged to be a threat .
He assured the committee that the final decision would rest with " an elected minister " and that steps had been taken to protect RAF pilots from the psychological impact of shooting down a civilian aircraft .

Cindy McCain introduces her husband during a rally in Blue Bell , Pa. , yesterday .
( Matt Rourke / AP )
BY JAMES V. GRIMALDI
Washington Post Staff Writer
Early in 2007 , just as her husband launched his presidential bid , Cindy McCain sought to resolve an old problem - the lack of cellphone coverage on her remote 15 - acre ranch near Sedona , Ariz . , nestled deep in a tree - lined canyon called Hidden Valley .
Over the past year , she offered land for a permanent cell tower , and Verizon Wireless embarked on an expensive public process to meet her needs , hiring contractors and seeking county land - use permits .
Verizon ultimately abandoned its effort to install a permanent tower in August .
Company spokesman Jeffrey Nelson said the project would be " an inappropriate way " to build its network .
" It does n't make business sense for us to do that , " he added .
Instead , Verizon delivered a portable tower known as a " cell site on wheels " - free of charge - to the McCain property in June , after the Secret Service began inquiring about improving coverage in the area .
Such devices are used for providing temporary capacity where coverage is lacking or has been knocked out , in circumstances ranging from the Super Bowl to hurricanes .
GRAPHIC : After a request from Cindy McCain , Verizon Wireless proposed installing a cell tower close to the couple 's home near Sedona , Ariz .
In July , AT&T followed suit , wheeling in a portable tower for free to match Verizon 's offer .
" This is an unusual situation , " AT&T spokeswoman Claudia B. Jones said .
" You can't have a presidential nominee in an area where there is not cell coverage . "
Ethics lawyers said Cindy McCain 's dealings with the wireless companies stand out because her husband is a senior member of the Senate commerce committee , which oversees the Federal Communications Commission and the telecommunications industry .
He has been a leading advocate for industry - backed legislation , fighting regulations and taxes on telecommunication services .
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) and his campaign have close ties to Verizon and AT&T .
Five campaign officials , including manager Rick Davis , have worked as lobbyists for Verizon .
Former McCain staff member Robert Fisher is an in - house lobbyist for Verizon and is volunteering for the campaign .
Fisher , Verizon chief executive Ivan G. Seidenberg and company lobbyists have raised more than $ 1.3 million for McCain 's presidential effort , and Verizon employees are among the top 20 corporate donors over McCain 's political career , giving his campaigns more than $ 155,000 .
McCain's Senate chief of staff Mark Buse , senior strategist Charles R. Black Jr. and several other campaign staff members have registered as AT&T lobbyists in the past .
AT&T Executive Vice President Timothy McKone and AT&T lobbyists have raised more than $ 2.3 million for McCain .
AT&T employees have donated more than $ 325,000 to the Republican 's campaigns , putting the company in the No. 3 spot for career donations to McCain , according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics .
" It raises the aura of special consideration for somebody because he is a member of the Senate , " said Stanley Brand , a former House counsel for Democrats and an ethics lawyer who represents politicians in both parties .
McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers said that the senator is not a regulator and that Cindy McCain received no favors from Verizon or AT&T .
" Mrs. McCain 's staff went through the Web site as any member of the general public would - no string - pulling , no phone calls , no involvement of Senate staff , " Rogers said .
" Just because she is married to a senator does n't mean she forfeits her right to ask for cell service as any other Verizon customer can . "
Verizon spokesman Nelson said .
" I am not going to talk about individual customers and their requests . "
Verizon navigated a lengthy county regulatory process that hit a snag on environmental concerns ( see document ) .
The request ultimately prevailed when a contractor for the company invoked the Secret Service after John McCain secured the Republican nomination .
After checking with Verizon and the McCain campaign , Secret Service spokesman Eric Zahren said an e-mail sent in May by the service 's technology manager could be perceived as a request for temporary coverage under the service 's contract with Verizon .
" This was something that was being addressed before we were out there , " Zahren said .
The agency could have made do with existing cell coverage in the area , he said , because it uses multiple layers of communication , including a secure land radio network .
Zahren said the contractor was not authorized to invoke the Secret Service in dealings with the county .
Documents that The Washington Post obtained from Arizona 's Yavapai County under state public records law show how Verizon hired contractors to put a tower on the property ( see letter ) .
At that point , many counted McCain out of the race .
On Sept. 18 , 2007 , a Mesa , Ariz. , contractor working for Verizon surveyed the McCain property .
Another contractor drafted blueprints ( see document - note large file size ) calling for moving a utility shed and installing a 40 - foot tower with two antennas and a microwave dish , surrounded by a six - foot wooden fence .
Construction costs would be $ 22,000 , records show .
Industry specialists said the figure probably only covers the tower and fence because the antennas , the dish and power source would run the cost into the six figures .
On Dec. 4 , Cindy McCain signed a letter ( see document ) authorizing Verizon Wireless to act on her behalf to seek county land - use permits .
Coverage maps submitted by Verizon to the county show that the tower would fill gaps in unpopulated parts of Coconino National Forest and on about 20 parcels of land , including a handful of residences , and two small businesses open only by appointment .
" We are not big cell phone users , " said neighbor Linda Kappel , who runs a small gift shop .
" It is a fairly sparsely populated in that pocket along Oak Creek , " said Kathy Houchin , the Yavapai County permitting manager .
Three telecommunications specialists consulted by The Post said the proposed site covers so few users that it is unlikely to generate enough traffic to justify the investment .
Robb Alarcon , an industry specialist who helps plan tower placement , said the proposed location appeared to be a " strategic build , " free - of - charge coverage to high - priority customers .
A former Verizon executive vice president , who asked not to be named because he worked for the company , agreed with Alarcon , saying , " It was a VIP kind of thing . "
Verizon spokesman Nelson declined to comment when asked if this had been considered to be a " strategic build . "
Cindy McCain signed a contract with Verizon on May 6 ( see document ) , granting free use of her property for a year in exchange for " the benefits of enhanced wireless communications arising from operation of the Facility . "
Over Memorial Day , McCain hosted potential vice presidential running mates at the ranch , but the area still lacked coverage .
Richard Klenner , then the wireless communications chief of the Secret Service , which had recently started providing protection , sent an e-mail to Verizon .
" Is there any way of speeding up the process ? " he asked , adding that he wanted Verizon to " explore every possible means of providing an alternative cellular or data communications source in the referenced area and provide any short - term implementation of any type as a solution in the interim . "

Researchers in Iran are publishing what they describe as the first study on a fungus that can remove sulfur , a major source of air pollution , from crude oil more effectively than conventional refining methods .
The finding could help reduce air pollution and acid rain caused by the release of sulfur components in gasoline and may help oil companies meet tougher emission standards for fuel , the scientists say .
Their study is scheduled for the Oct. 1 issue of Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research .
Jalal Shayegan and colleagues point out that existing processes for refining so - called " heavy , " or high - sulfur , crude oil convert sulfur to hydrogen sulfide gas at high temperatures and pressures .
However , they leave behind some kinds of sulfur - based compounds , which wind up in gasoline and other fuels .
Scientists long have known that certain microbes can remove sulfur from oil .
But nobody had tried using these microbes in so - called biodesulfurization of heavy crude oil until now , they indicate .
In the new study , the scientists describe isolation and testing of the first fungus capable of removing sulfur from heavy crude oil .
The fungus , called Stachybotrys , removed 65 - 76 percent of the sulfur present in certain heavy crude oil from two different oil fields .
The process does not need high temperatures and high - energy consumption because it occurs slightly above room temperature , they scientists note .

Taking up the cause of military families could define Michelle Obama 's agenda as first lady .
Michelle 's focus group : Military families
FAYETTEVILLE , N.C. –
Once portrayed as unpatriotic , Michelle Obama has quietly carved a niche on the campaign trail as a sounding board for military families , taking up a cause that could define her agenda as first lady .
Every few weeks , Obama meets with military spouses in swing states , where she presents herself as a kindred spirit and Barack Obama as the best choice for their families .
She attended the two debates with military family members .
And at the Democratic National Convention , she led a day of service on behalf of Blue Star Families for Obama , a two - month old group with the tagline : “ Pro-Military , Pro-Obama . ”

Obama aides say her work with military families has nothing to do with the controversy created by her February comment suggesting that the presidential campaign made her proud of the United States for the first time .
But the effort could be viewed as an exercise in counterprogramming , serving as a rebuttal to criticism from Cindy McCain and others for a comment that Michelle Obama insists was misinterpreted – and the notion that her husband , a Democrat with no military service , cannot peel off voters from John McCain , an ex-Navy pilot and war hero .
“ Barack and I know that too often it feels like you are alone , on your own , ” Obama told military spouses last month in Santa Fe , N.M. “ I know you become everything .
In a small way , I have experienced that over the course of this campaign , but in no way does it compare to what you are going through . ”
Michelle Obama 's focus on military families puts her at the leading edge of the Democratic nominee 's campaign to reclaim some of the military vote from Republicans – an effort that brought Barack Obama here Sunday for a rally near Fort Bragg , where a military wife introduced him and he touted his endorsement from Colin Powell , the retired four - star general and President George W. Bush 's first Secretary of State .
Since the start of the campaign , Michelle Obama says she has focused on three things : keeping life normal for her young daughters , electing her husband , and discussing the work - life balance with women around the country .
The spouses of service members captured her attention during a roundtable with working mothers , and she later hosted her first military - focused event in Fayetteville in May , a day before the North Carolina primary .
She will hold her seventh military spouses meeting Tuesday in Pensacola , Fla. , following similar events in recent months in states heavily impacted by deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan , including Virginia , New Mexico and Pennsylvania .
At each roundtable , she sits on stage with several spouses , delivers prepared remarks and opens a discussion .
The roundtables draws local media coverage , and she answers questions about her involvement when asked by national reporters , as she did during an interview with CNN at the Democratic convention .
“ Mostly I am here to listen and to do a lot of learning and then to transfer that information into the heart and mind of my husband as he moves forth , ” Michelle Obama said in Norfolk , Va. , in August .
“ The commander in chief does n’t just need to know how to lead the military , he needs to understand what war does to military families . ”
Her work in this area offers a hint at what could dominate her time in the White House .
“ If she becomes first lady , this will be her cause , ” said Amanda McBreen , 47 , a Marine wife who participated in the Norfolk roundtable and helps coordinate 24 state chapters of Blue Star Families for Obama .
Michelle Obama pledged to do so in the Oct. 27 issue of U.S. News and World Report , when she explained what she would do if her husband became president : “ I would work daily on the issues closest to my heart : helping working women and families , particularly military families .
…
I 'd continue these conversations with working women and military spouses , and I 'd take their stories back to Washington to make sure that the people who run our country know how their policies touch their constituents ' lives . ”
But Kathy Roth - Douquet , a founder of Blue Star Families and a Marine spouse who supported Hillary Rodham Clinton in the primary , said she wishes more voters knew about Michelle Obama ’s work .
“ She is probably the most motivating figure in the military family community , ” Roth - Douquet , 44 , said .
“ We like Obama , but we love her .
She gets what we are getting . ”
Campaign aides are “ very sensitive , ” Roth - Douquet said .
“ They are trying not to exploit the issue .
I appreciate their lack of exploitation .
I just wish more people knew about it .
I wish that when people thought about which candidates were looking out for military families , they did n’t automatically think about John McCain . ”
It can be frustrating , she added , because she has never seen a potential first couple pay “ this kind of attention to military families . ”
But she conceded that the job falls to Blue Star Families – the product of poolside kibitzing this spring among a circle of Marine wives in Parris Island , S.C. – to promote the Obamas .
The women reached out to the Obama campaign in April , and learned that their interests were coverging with Michelle Obama , who had begun to tune into the burdens facing military spouses .
Obama helped launch the project formally in August .
The storyline is a counterweight to the portrayal of Michelle Obama as unpatriotic on some blogs and by Republican critics , an image cemented when she told an audience during the primary that “ for the first time in my adult lifetime I am really proud of my country . ”
She later qualified the remark , insisting she meant that she has never been as proud as she is now .
But it has n't completely gone away .
Cindy McCain recently reprised a line she used months ago , telling an audience last week , “ I have always been proud of my country . ”
Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn. ) , appearing Friday on MSNBC ’s Hardball , said Michelle Obama held “ very anti-American views . ”
Although her foes continue to hammer her with it , Michelle Obama has n’t stumbled in a significant way since then .
As part of attempts to soften her image , Obama took well - received turns on ABC ’s “ The View ” and at Democratic National Convention , where she delivered a primetime speech to 17 million viewers that cast her , in the campaign ’s parlance , as “ one of us . ”
Each night , cameras featured her tearing up at some speeches and cheering on others .
“ Things changed instantly when she had the platform really to introduce herself , ” Obama chief strategist David Axelrod said , citing public and internal campaign polls that showed an improvement in her approval ratings after her speech .
Michelle Obama has spent recent months traveling to almost two dozen states , headlining more than 50 events and quietly charting out a potential post - Election Day roadmap .
“ She has had a great education into what we do on a regular basis that most people do n’t really know , ” McBreen said .
“ I have friends and family members who do n’t have any clue what my life is like .
My own family and closest friends do n’t understand my life like she does now . ”
Over the weekend , Congress in a shameful act of service to the campaign contributions of the entertainment industry passed " PRO - IP " legislation that requires our government to work directly on the industry 's behalf against the public interest .
Under the deceptive banner of " intellectual property " , the bill as passed has several unacceptable provisions .
Besides over $ 23 million in congressional campaign contributions , the industry used scare tactics to get it passed , trying to draw a connection between copyright infringement and ... terrorism .
The bill expresses the " Sense of Congress " as agreeing that " terrorists and organized crime utilize piracy , counterfeiting , and infringement to fund some of their activities ; " and that stopping copyright infringement should be among the highest priorities of government .
This attitude sets us up for a future world of Digital Restrictions Management ( DRM ) and large - scale seizure of computer equipment the industry accuses of being involved in filesharing .
We have one more chance to stop this bill from becoming law .
Bush has yet to sign it .
Given the fact that his Department of Justice publicly objected to it earlier , Bush may veto it .
But we can't count on that -- your calls and e-mails to the White House could make the difference .

Everyone is taking note this morning of the fact that GM 's market cap is now below where it was in 1929 .
Yep , nearly 80 years of progress down the drain .
What 's GM doing to reverse this sad state of affairs ?
CNBC lets us know that he 's been going on YouTube .
Specifically , Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner has cut a clip for the site , talking up all the bold steps being taken to turn things around ( Short version : we have a lot of legacy issues , but .. alternative energy , and international ! ) .
Unfortunately , it 's a little bit -- how shall we say it ? -- dry .
We like substantive talk , but this 2:50 minute clip has no hope of going viral .
Therere are n't even any comments , last time we checked .
GM clearly needs to spice things up a bit .
It 'd be a terrible example to set to our youth , but how about a clip of Wagoner " Ghostridin ' the whip " .
Perhaps he could be the first person to ghostride the electricity - powered Chevy Volt .
The clip below is intended for inspiration only and you should not try this at home .
Nobody was doing that in 1929

If they refused , they could expect little government help and possibly much harm down the road .
They signed .
The U.S. officials speciously argued “ the plan represented a good deal for the banks :
The government would be buying preferred shares , and thus would n’t dilute their common shareholders . ”
What utter nonsense .
The preferred cut comes off the top .
It has priority over the common , which is why it ’s called preferred stock .
That is why Buffett took preferred stock from GE and GS .

MRO revealed rocks containing a mineral similar to opal A Nasa space probe has discovered a new category of minerals spread across large regions of Mars .
The find suggests liquid water remained on Mars ' surface a billion years later than scientists had previously thought .
The US Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) spacecraft found evidence of hydrated silica , better known as opal .
The discovery adds to the growing body of evidence that water played a crucial role in shaping the Martian landscape and - possibly - in sustaining life .
Hydrated , or water - containing , minerals are telltale signs of when and where water was present on ancient Mars .
Researchers made the discovery using the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer ( CRISM ) instrument on MRO .
The $ 720 m ( £ 449 m ; 565 m euro ) MRO robotic probe reached the Red Planet in 2006 ; its objectives are to study Mars ' geology , climate and atmosphere from orbit , as well as to search for signs of water .
Details of the latest findings appear in the November issue of the academic journal Geology .
The minerals were recently found at Gusev Crater on Mars by the Spirit rover .
This study reveals that they are widespread and occur in relatively young terrains .
Gem of a find " This is an exciting discovery because it extends the time range for liquid water on Mars , and the places where it might have supported life , " said Scott Murchie , from Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland .
Dr Murchie , who is chief scientist on the CRISM team , added : " The identification of opaline silica tells us that water may have existed as recently as two billion years ago . "
MRO has been orbiting the Red Planet since 2006 CRISM works by " reading " over 500 colours in reflected sunlight to detect particular minerals on the Martian surface - including those that formed in the presence of water .
Until now , only two major groups of hydrated minerals , phyllosilicates and hydrated sulfates , had been observed by spacecraft orbiting Mars .
Clay - like phyllosilicates formed more than three - and - a - half billion years ago where igneous rock came into long - term contact with water .
During the next several hundred million years , until about three billion years ago , hydrated sulfates formed from the evaporation of salty and sometimes acidic water .
The newly discovered " opaline silicates " are the youngest of the three types of hydrated minerals .
They formed where liquid water altered materials created by volcanic activity or meteorite impacts on Mars ' surface .
One such location is the large Martian canyon system known as Valles Marineris .
Acidic water " We see numerous outcrops of opal - like minerals , commonly in thin layers extending for very long distances around the rim of Valles Marineris and sometimes within the canyon system itself , " said Ralph Milliken of Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , California .
In some locations , CRISM observed opaline silica with iron sulfate minerals , either in or around dry river channels .
This suggests the acidic water remained on the Martian surface for an extended period of time .
Dr Milliken and his colleagues think that in these areas , low - temperature acidic water was involved in forming the opal .
However , in areas where there is no clear evidence that the water was acidic , deposits may have formed under a wide range of conditions .
" What 's important is that the longer liquid water existed on Mars , the longer the window during which Mars may have supported life , " said Ralph Milliken .
" The opaline silica deposits would be good places to explore to assess the potential for habitability on Mars , especially in these younger terrains . "
Nasa is due to send a robotic rover , Mars Science Laboratory ( MSL ) , to the planet in 2009 to look for signs of past or present life .
The European Space Agency ( Esa ) also plans to send a rover to investigate Mars ' habitability .
This mission , called ExoMars , is now scheduled to launch in 2016 .

The U.S. Treasury , Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. quietly nationalized much of the U.S. banking system Tuesday .
If the banking system sold its soul , we hoped it had at least gained pretty decent terms .
So we went digging and found good explanations , particularly from Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Meredith Whitney .

I have to confess , I have n’t paid much attention to Opera Software until recently .
The Norwegian company has been an also - ran in the browser market for 13 years .
On Friday , I had a chance to sit down with its co-founder and chief executive , Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner .
I ca n’t say that I ’m convinced that Opera is now poised to take the Web by storm , but his take on the browser world makes good sense and paints a picture of a future with browsers everywhere .
As a company , Opera focuses on areas where Internet Explorer and Firefox are hardly to be found .
Some 80 percent of its business is browsers for mobile phones and other devices that are n’t computers .
It has relatively few users in the United States .
Its PC browser is particularly popular in central and eastern Europe .
One reason is that the browser is optimized to run on old computers with slow connections .
Mr. von Tetzchner said the main reason that Opera has not done better in the United States is that it had to compete first with Microsoft and then Firefox , both of which gave browsers away free .
Opera struggled for a business model , trying shareware , paid downloads , and display advertising , none of which proved to be popular .
Since 2005 , it has been giving an ad - free browser away free .
Now it earns money from search engines , which pay for traffic from its search box .
Mr. von Tetzchner would n’t go into detail , but he said these add up to more than $ 1 a user each year .
The future of browsers on computers is going down two paths , he said .
There are more features to help users organize their information , like a new service that helps synchronize bookmarks among several computers and phones .
On the other hand , Mr. von Tetzchner echoes the view of Google and many others , that the browser is becoming the platform for applications .
Some Web standards that are emerging will permit more functions for standalone applications , including storing information on local computers , displaying more sophisticated graphics and receiving notifications from remote servers .
Mr. von Tetzchner is particularly keen on applications in the form of widgets — tiny , single - purpose programs that display information like weather or stock quotes outside of a browser window .
Widgets , of course , are everywhere , including Microsoft Vista , Google Desktop , Apple OS X and many social networks .
Opera supports the widget standard published by the World Wide Web Consortium , which defines the basic format of Web pages .
Mr. von Tetzchner argues that this standard will allow widgets to be published that will work on many sorts of devices , but so far , the standard has few followers .
( I downloaded Opera after I met with Mr. von Tetzchner .
I did n’t see anything that will make me switch browsers , but I found the widget structure to be the most intriguing .
It seemed more flexible and attractive than other widget software I ’ve seen . )
Opera has a somewhat stronger position on mobile phones than it does on computers , in part because it gets some distribution from handset makers and wireless carriers .
For smartphones , Opera Mobile is a full - featured browser that can display most Web sites .
Handset makers pay Opera about 50 cents to $ 1 a copy for each phone made with the browser on it .
For less sophisticated phones and slower networks , it offers Opera Mini , which takes advantage of a server computer , run by Opera , to handle the processing of Web pages .
The server then sends a simplified version of each page to the phone in a compressed form .
Because that makes for much faster browsing no matter what the phone and network , Mr. von Tetzchner said , Opera Mini is increasingly popular on smartphones , even those that use the latest third - generation , or 3G , wireless data networks .
“ 3G is n’t really that fast , ” he said .
“ We try to deal with the real world . ”
Mr. von Tetzchner said that Opera ’s engineers have developed a version of Opera Mini that can run on an Apple iPhone , but Apple wo n’t let the company release it because it competes with Apple ’s own Safari browser .
[ Update : Read more details about Opera and the iPhone . ]
Opera Mini is free , and can be downloaded onto many phones .
The company earns money , as it does for its computer service , from search engines .
In addition , some carriers pay Opera to develop custom versions of Opera Mini for their systems .
Not surprisingly , Mr. von Tetzchner endorsed my view that the way to get video to the television is through a browser .
Opera has deals to put browsers into some sets made by Sony and Philips .
Right now Sony ’s system , built into the Bravia Internet Link that you can add to some of its sets , only displays content from Sony ’s partners .
But technically , it could browse any Web site and play any Web video , he said .
So far , TV makers do n’t believe that that people want access to the full Web on their sets .
Mr. von Tetzchner , however , says there is some evidence that people do want browsers on their televisions .
Witness the growing popularity of the Opera browser for the Nintendo Wii game machine , on which the wireless remote offers a replacement for a mouse you can use from your couch .
It includes Adobe ’s Flash software and can play some Web video .
Just as the Opera browser reformats
Web pages for small cellphone screens , it has ways to zoom in and make pages more useful on televisions as well , he said .
The next big thing , he said , is browsers in cars .
GPS navigation systems , built - in or add - on , will likely have wireless data connections that allow them to check traffic conditions and look for nearby Thai restaurants .
Opera has developed a version of its browser to go into VeriFone credit card terminals to bring Web content like manufacturer ’s promotions , consumer reviews and even competitors ’ prices into stores .
Opera ’s vision reflects a reality I do n’t always see from the makers of various devices–pretty much every electronic thing we ’re building is an a computer connected to the Internet .
And just as the plumbing of these devices is all moving to Internet Protocol , the user interfaces for all of them will be far more powerful if they are versions of Web standards .
If a supermarket wants to show me a YouTube video when I check out , or my Facebook friend wants to send me something to watch on my television , why should the narrow vision of a hardware company stop me ?
I do n’t know if Opera as a company will succeed , since it is competing with Microsoft , Google and the open - source Firefox .
But if it helps move this vision of browsers everywhere forward , I ’ll be glad .
Senior US officials , commenting on Sunday ’s attack into Syria , said the strike was designed to send a warning to the Syrian government .
“ You have to clean up the global threat that is in your back yard , and if you wo n’t do that , we are left with no choice but to take these matters into our hands , ” the Washington Post quotes one anonymous official as saying .
The official also likened the strike to the long series of unilateral US strikes into Pakistan ’s tribal regions , saying that “ there will be steps taken to deal with ” the targets .
The strike , which killed at least eight people , has drawn harsh condemnations from the Syrian government , much as the strikes in Pakistan have from their government .
Syria promised to tighten its border with Iraq in 2004 , but has struggled to do so .
Still , despite complaints about the border violence in the province on the Iraqi side has fallen to “ almost meaningless ” low levels , according to the US commander in western Iraq .
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al - Moualem , speaking in London , said the US was following “ the policy of cowboys ” and noted that America has been no more successful in sealing its own border with Mexico than Syria has its border with Iraq .
John McCain is pulling out of Michigan , according to two Republicans , a stunning move a month away from Election Day that indicates the difficulty Republicans are having in finding blue states to put in play .
McCain will go off TV in Michigan , stop dropping mail there and send most of his staff to more competitive states , including Wisconsin , Ohio and Florida .
Wisconsin went for Kerry in 2004 , Ohio and Florida for Bush .
A McCain aide confirmed the move and chalked it up to the state 's Democratic tilt and the resources Obama had put in place there .
" It was always a long shot for us to win , " said the aide .
McCain will now turn his attention to bolstering his defenses in Ohio and Florida while putting more resources into Wisconsin , Minnesota , Pennsylvania and the second congressional district of Maine , where there is a sole electoral vote available .
Obama 's campaign offered a muted response to McCain 's decision to abandon Michigan , only promising to keep it in the Democratic column .
" We will continue to fight for every vote in Michigan because middle class families there just cannot afford more of the same , " said Obama spokesman Bill Burton .
The Illionis Democrat was in Michigan today but did n't mention McCain 's move .
Republicans had been bullish on Michigan , hopeful that McCain 's past success in the state in the 2000 primary combined with voter dissatisfaction with Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm and skepticism among blue - collar voters about Barack Obama could make it competitive .
McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin spent the first night after the GOP convention at a large rally in Macomb County , just outside Detroit .
The two returned later last month for another sizable event in Grand Rapids .
But recent polls there have shown Obama extending what had been a small lead , with the economic crisis damaging an already sagging GOP brand in a state whose economy is in tatters .
A McCain event planned for next week in Plymouth , Mich . , has been canceled .

The truth is out .
Sarah Palin may have posed as an opponent of congressionally mandated earmarks , but when the slop was in the bucket , she was one of the first at Senator Ted Stevens ’ ( R - AK ) trough .
The Seattle Times reported yesterday that she submitted 31 earmark requests totaling $ 197 million in the current ( FY2009 ) budget cycle .
According to that paper , it was “ more , per person , than any other state . ”
The Washington Post reports that in 2000 , Palin took an extraordinary step as the mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , a town that had fewer than 5,500 residents — she hired a Washington lobbyist to seek congressional earmarks .
According to the Post , she won a total of $ 6.1 million in earmarks for the city of Wasilla in 2002 .
A review of the Taxpayers for Common Sense database from which the Post derived that number indicates that 2002 was actually a subpar year for Palin .
Over the course of her four years she sought earmarks as city mayor and won an average of $ 6.7 million a year .
Both numbers need to be placed in some perspective .
Fiscal year 2008 was the first year for which there was a complete listing of all earmarks contained in all appropriation bills .
That information was loaded into several databases , including the one developed by Taxpayers for Common Sense .
According to that data , the average state got about $ 50 per person in earmarked funds in 2008 .
Alaska , represented by Ted Stevens , the Senate ’s earmarker - in - chief , got $ 506 per person — about 10 times the national average .
Wasilla between 2000 and 2003 was getting well over $ 1,000 per person — twice the Alaska state average in 2008 .
There is nothing particularly wrong with any of these actions .
Yet Palin has advertised herself as a reformer and a skeptic of earmarking while maneuvering to become the earmark queen of the earmark state .
The energy she has put into finding resources to help solve problems in her hometown and her state is admirable .
She did n’t create the rules about how federal money is distributed — by competitive grants , formulas , or congressional earmarks — but once the rules were in place , she used them to the maximum advantage of those she was elected to represent .
That creates an odd juxtaposition between her and the man with whom she shares the ticket .
Unlike most of his colleagues in Congress , Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) has not only tried to change the rules governing the use of earmarks — he has refused to pursue them on behalf of needy constituencies he was elected to defend even when it was clear that the rules would not be changed and millions of dollars that might go to Arizona would be headed to other parts of the country .
While Sara Palin ’s constituents in Wasilla were getting about 20 times the national average in earmarked federal funding , McCain ’s constituents in Arizona were getting less than half the national average .
The data indicates that if Arizona had matched the national average , the state would have , in the current fiscal year , received more than $ 133 million dollars in additional federal investments in schools , hospitals , roads , and so forth .
In fact , the database indicates that Arizona rates dead last among the 50 states in per capita earmarked funds at $ 18.70 per person .
This is despite the best efforts of Senator Jon Kyl ( R - AZ ) , who is also an opponent of the earmarking process , but unwilling to give up earmarked funds to other states just to protect rhetorical high ground .
A review of the earmarks that Kyl and others in the delegation brought home to Arizona in 2008 tells an interesting story .
Kyl reached across the aisle to help Congressman Raul Grijalva ( D - AZ ) with a project for the community of Nogales , Arizona — a project intended to resolve a long festering safety and public health issue .
Nogales is a town of about 20,000 , or roughly three times the size of Wasilla , but a third of the residents live in poverty compared to 12 percent nationally and 10 percent in Wasilla .
Overall , per capita income in Nogales is about a third of the national average .
But perhaps the biggest problem facing Nogales is its geography .
It is one of the few places on the U.S. - Mexican border where the watershed flows north , and when tropical storms from the Pacific Ocean come raging across the Sonoran dessert as they do every couple of years .
Nogales , Arizona , is inundated not only in water but animal waste , raw sewage , and debris from Mexico .
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has worked with the U.S. Geological Survey and the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a flood control plan for Nogales , but no money has been included in recent presidential budgets for such an effort .
Kyl and Grijalva ’s efforts added $ 4.6 million to the FY2008 budget to begin to address this critical need .
Kyl also worked with fellow Republican Rick Renzi ( R - AZ ) to add $ 750,000 to the Transportation and Housing Appropriation bill to repair a road on the Navajo Reservation running from Hardrock to Pinon .
The current quality of the road is so poor that it is often impassible in winter months , residents are cut off from the outside world , and food and medical supplies must be airlifted to avert starvation .
This is not to say that everything that Kyl or others in the Arizona delegation do with respect to earmarking is perfect or even laudable .
I am certain they directed funds at less urgent needs .
But it does demonstrate that Arizona , like many states , has communities that desperately need help , and that McCain , unlike his running mate , has had the power to help those communities and has refused to do so .
That is a rather remarkable decision , even if it makes one ’s campaign message a little crisper .
Perhaps there are things that John McCain can learn from Sara Palin during the course of the coming campaign .
Oktoberfest is our kind of festival .
It combines some of our favorite things in life : beer , food , and cleavage .
In honor of the later , we have put together a gallery of the hottest girls of Oktoberfest , sporting their “ Dirndl ” – traditional dress .
For those of you who want to know about the festival and the beer , we provide the following from Wikipedia .
The rest of you can scroll down and get to the reason you came here .
Oktoberfest is a sixteen - day festival held each year in Munich , Bavaria , Germany during late September ( and running to early October ) .
It is one of the most famous events in the city and the world ’s largest fair , with some six million people attending every year , and is an enjoyable event with an important part of Bavarian culture .
Other cities across the world also hold Oktoberfest celebrations , modeled after the Munich event .
Oktoberfestbiers are the beers that have been served at the event in Munich since 1818 , and are supplied by 6 breweries known as the Big Six : Spaten , Löwenbräu , Augustiner , Hofbräu , Paulaner and Hacker - Pschorr .
Traditionally Oktoberfestbiers were the lagers of around 5.5 to 6 % abv called Märzen – brewed in March and allowed to ferment slowly during the summer months .
Originally these would have been dark lagers , but from 1872 a strong March brewed version of an amber-red Vienna lager made by Josef Sedlmayr became the favourite Oktoberfestbier .
Since the 1970s the type of beer served at the festival has been a pale lager between 5 and 6 % abv , and the terms Oktoberfest and Märzen are used by non-Oktoberfest brewers in Germany and the USA to market pale lagers of this strength .
The color of these lagers may range from pale gold to deep amber , with the darker colours more common in the USA .
Hop levels tend not to be distinctive , though some American examples may be firmly hopped .
Modern beers sold as Oktoberfest and Märzen in Europe tend not to be too differentiated from other pale lagers of this strength , while older German and American influenced examples will be fairly malty in flavour and inclined to use a range of malts , especially dark malts such as Vienna or Munich .
BORING !
On with the show !

The Christian Science Monitor plans major changes in April 2009 that are expected to make it the first newspaper with a national audience to shift from a daily print format to an online publication that is updated continuously each day .
The changes at the Monitor will include enhancing the content on CSMonitor.com , starting weekly print and daily e-mail editions , and discontinuing the current daily print format .
This new , multiplatform strategy for the Monitor will " secure and enlarge the Monitor 's role in its second century , " said Mary Trammell , editor in chief of The Christian Science Publishing Society and a member of the Christian Science Board of Directors .
Mrs. Trammell said that " journalism that seeks to bless humanity , not injure , and that shines light on the world 's challenges in an effort to seek solutions , is at the center of Mary Baker Eddy 's vision for the Monitor .
The method of delivery and format are secondary " and need to be adjusted , given Mrs. Eddy 's call to keep the Monitor " abreast of the times . "
While the Monitor 's print circulation , which is primarily delivered by US mail , has trended downward for nearly 40 years , " looking forward , the Monitor 's Web readership clearly shows promise , " said Judy Wolff , chairman of the Board of Trustees of The Christian Science Publishing Society .
" We plan to take advantage of the Internet in order to deliver the Monitor 's journalism more quickly , to improve the Monitor 's timeliness and relevance , and to increase revenue and reduce costs .
We can do this by changing the way the Monitor reaches its readers . "
The coming changes , over two years in the planning stage , occur at a time of fundamental transition in news publishing and turn the page on a remarkable chapter in American journalism .
The Monitor , which celebrates its 100th anniversary on Nov. 25 , was launched at the direction of church founder Eddy , who had been the subject of a searing legal and journalistic attack by Joseph Pulitzer 's New York World .
Officials of her church had a professional news organization up and running in just over 100 days .
In the Monitor 's first edition , Mrs. Eddy defined the scope and tone of the newspaper 's journalistic mission , writing that it should " injure no man , but bless all mankind . "
Since that time , generations of editorial and publishing workers have devoted themselves to the Monitor .
While Mrs. Eddy 's paper was initially greeted with skepticism , the Monitor won respect from its journalistic peers ; it has been awarded seven Pulitzer Prizes and numerous other journalistic accolades .
Three Monitor editors have been elected president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors .
Monitor editor John Yemma said that while the methods of publishing Monitor journalism have evolved over 100 years , the underlying motives and approach remain constant .
" In the Monitor 's next century , as with its first century , it is committed to finding answers to the world 's most important problems , asking the questions that matter and getting the story behind the news - all of which is staying true to Mrs. Eddy 's unselfish , original vision , " he said .
" The Monitor 's role is right there in its name .
It 's to monitor the world , to keep an eye on the world from a perspective of hope . "
Mrs. Wolff cited three goals that drove what she called " our evolving strategy " for the Monitor :
• Producing a website that can be updated 24/7 and delivered instantaneously " better fulfills Mrs. Eddy 's original vision " for the Monitor to be daily than does a five - day - a - week paper delivered by mail with frequent delays .
• Focusing resources on the fast - growing Web audience for news rather than on the economically troubled daily newspaper industry " increases the Monitor 's reach and impact . "
The Monitor 's website currently attracts about 1.5 million visitors a month .
• Eliminating the major production and distribution costs of a daily newspaper will allow the Monitor to " make progress toward achieving financial sustainability " while supporting its global news resources .
Attaining these goals over the next five years would provide stability and continuity for Monitor journalism over the long run , said Mr. Yemma , who took office as the Monitor 's editor in July after holding a number of editorial positions at the Boston Globe .
Throughout the news industry , he added , publications are struggling with the profound disruption brought on by the Internet and the rising costs of newsprint and transportation .
The Monitor has required a subsidy from the Christian Science church for most of its history .
In the current budget year ending April 30 , the Monitor in all forms is forecast to lose $ 18.9 million .
The church will provide a subsidy of $ 12.1 million from its general fund , with earnings from the Monitor Endowment Fund and donor contributions to the Monitor 's operating fund covering the balance .
The changes in strategy are projected gradually to decrease the Monitor 's net operating loss to $ 10.5 million in 2013 , so the church general fund subsidy will be $ 3.7 million , said managing publisher Jonathan Wells .
" Changes in the industry - changes in the concept of news and the economics underlying the industry - hit the Monitor first , " given its relatively small size and the complex logistics required for national distribution , Mr. Wells said .
" We are sometimes forced to be an early change agent . "
All three Monitor publications – website , weekly print edition , and daily e-mail edition – will be produced by the same editorial staff .
The Monitor will continue to operate at its current level of international and domestic coverage , with bureaus throughout the globe , and a strong presence in Washington .
Yemma and Wells said these bureaus represent a distinct competitive advantage for the Monitor at a time when other news organizations are cutting back on staff coverage from outside their circulation regions .
" A modest reduction " in the Monitor 's 95 - person editorial staff is likely , once the transition to the new product line - up is completed , Yemma said .
A new design for the Monitor 's website is being phased in .
It is the first step in what Yemma said would be " a much more robust Web presence . "
In addition to frequent updating with the latest news seven days a week , the plan is for the site to become a portal where editors will point visitors to other areas on the Web that are attempting journalism in the same spirit as the Monitor .
Yemma said he wants to encourage much more two - way conversation between readers and Monitor staffers to " build a community of people who care about the values the Monitor stands for . "
The Monitor 's new weekly print edition will launch in April and be priced at $ 3.50 per copy or $ 89 for a year 's subscription .
A full - price subscription to the current daily print edition is $ 219 .
" We hope the people who subscribe to the daily will shift to the weekly and that many more who may not have had time to read the daily will find the weekly appeals to them , " Yemma said .
Produced on high grade paper in a 10 " by 12 " size , the weekly will feature an in - depth cover story on a major global issue or trend ; brief dispatches from Monitor correspondents around the globe ; the best photographs of the week ; special sections on innovation , the environment , and personal finance ; as well as Home Forum essays and a single religious article , as has been the Monitor 's practice since 1908 .
Like the new print weekly , the new daily electronic edition will be offered by subscription .
It will be a multipage PDF file sent by e-mail to subscribers Monday through Friday .
The format makes it convenient for subscribers to print out the daily e-news edition at home .
This publication will contain an original column by Monitor editors , the top Monitor stories of the day , links to other reports on the Monitor 's website , and the daily religious article .
Pricing has not been announced .
Reaching the improved financial targets in the Monitor 's new business plan will depend on significant growth in Web traffic and on current subscribers to the daily paper transferring their subscriptions to the weekly edition and the daily e-mail edition , Wolff said .
" If you are a current subscriber , we ask you to stay with us .
If you do not subscribe , we hope you will subscribe to the Monitor now as it embarks on its second century . "
This is a period of extreme financial difficulty for all news organizations .
New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. , for instance , was asked at a conference in California on Oct. 22 whether the Times would be a print product in 10 years .
" The heart of the answer must be ( that ) we can't care , " Sulzberger said .
He added that he expects print to be around for a long time but " we must be where people want us for our information . "
The cost , delay , and waste generated by daily print are huge hindrances , said Yemma .
The Monitor can lead the way in providing news primarily online .
" The Christian Science Monitor finds itself uniquely positioned to take advantage of developing technologies , market conditions , and news consumption habits that can dramatically increase its relevance , reach , and utility ; place it on a sound financial footing ; and allow it to pursue its unique mission of providing global perspective and illuminating the human dimension behind international news , " Yemma noted .
Way too excited to sleep on that frigid April morning , I snuggled my bloated belly up to my husband , Dave .
Eighteen weeks pregnant , today we would finally have our full - fetal ultrasound and find out whether our baby was a boy or a girl .
I had no reason to be nervous , I thought .

Voter Fraud Gets a Thumbs Up
in Morgan County by Brunner
For Immediate Release :
By Paddy Shaffer
Director , The Ohio Election Justice Campaign
October 28 , 2008
In one of the “ rare documented cases of voter fraud , ” committed by Richard Welch the Republican Morgan County Prosecutor , Ohio Secretary of State ( SOS ) Jennifer Brunner voted against the members of her own party , board members Mary Anna Wallace and Azcal Wilson , and for the Republican .
The issue here is whether the attorney who is the Morgan County Prosecutor , who has lived outside of Morgan County for the past six years , can continue to vote in that county .
Welch has lived south of Morgan County , down along the Ohio River in the town of Belpre .
Welch is in the military , and has had not personally been physically in the prosecutors office much in the last six year .
He has maintained the prosecutor title , and continued to have himself and his wife vote in Morgan County , he has continued to run for office , and hold office .
All while actually having his wife and himself live in Washington County .
Welch did claim to spend one night , on September 1 , 2008 in the house .
He also at his September 2 , 2008 hearing claimed that he was unable to live in the house because of the large amount of pigeon poop all over it .
His attorney assisted Welch providing pictures of the numerous white poop spots , and they had a vivid description .
Brunner wrote that Welch ’s wife is splitting her time between the two homes , but the locals disagree .
The McConnellesville home in Morgan County has not even had running water in the past six years , and is zoned as an office , not a residence .
Both Democratic Board Members of the Morgan County Board of Elections ruled in January 2008 , and then again on September 29 , 2008 that Welch is not a resident of their community .
Legal counsel for the Secretary of State in Morgan County is Brian Shinn .
In her ruling issued today , http://electiondefensealliance.org/files/Welch_Morgan_County_102808.pdf

Best Entry - level CPUs :
Best Entry - Level APU ( CPU + GPU in one ) :
Get the AMD Athlon 3000G Processor with Radeon Vega 3 Graphics from Amazon
– Architecture : Zen
– Frequency ( Turbo ) : 3.5 ( N/A ) GHz
– Cores ( Threads ) : 2 cores / 4 threads
– Integrated GPU : AMD Radeon Vega 3 192 GPU Cores , 1100MHz
– TDP : 35 W
– Socket : AMD AM4
Lowest cost recommended APU , ideal for entry - level PCs and HTPCs
While this is no powerhouse , it ’s still a very decent budget CPU .
It ’s a good choice for low - cost builds , for a family member , students or for a home theater PC .
Its integrated graphics are n’t as powerful as the ones on the Ryzen 3 3200G , so do n’t expect to run 1080 p games on it .
But 720 p should be playable .
Note that the AMD Athlon 3000G is completely unlocked , so you may overclock it if you wish to boost performance a bit .
Note that you want to pair it up with dual - channel ( two or four sticks ) of DDR4 RAM , preferably high frequencies , such as 3200 MHz , for the best performance possible in video games .
Avoid using a single stick of RAM :
It can halve gaming performance .
Get the AMD Ryzen 3 3200G Processor with Radeon Vega 8 Graphics from Amazon
– Architecture : Ryzen 2nd generation
– Frequency ( Turbo ) : 3.6 ( 4.0 ) GHz
– Cores ( Threads ) : 4 cores / 4 threads
– Integrated GPU : AMD Radeon Vega 8 512 GPU Cores , 1250MHz
– TDP : 65 W
– Socket : AMD AM4
Excellent integrated graphic performance , for a gaming PC on a small budget .
Manufactured on a 12nm process as opposed to 14nm for the Athlon 3 3000G , the Ryzen 3 3200G offers significantly higher performance , thanks to having twice as many cores , a more modern architecture , way more GPU cores ( 512 versus 192 ) as well as higher base , Turbo and GPU frequencies .
You now get 3.6/4.0GHz CPU base / Turbo and 1250MHz for the GPU , compared to 3.5/3.5/1100MHz for the Athlon 3000G .
The AMD Ryzen 3 3200G feature the AMD Radeon Vega 8 integrated graphics , which offer gaming performance that is far better than Intel integrated graphics , 2 - 3 x the performance at 1920 x 1080 .
Note that you can overclock the AMD Ryzen 3 3200G , unlike the Intel Core i3-10100 .
Note that you want to pair it up with dual - channel ( two or four sticks ) of DDR4 RAM , preferably high frequencies , such as 3600 MHz , for the best performance possible in video games .
Avoid using a single stick of RAM :
It can halve gaming performance .
Gamers with a dedicated graphic card :
Skip AMD ’s APUs and go with one of the three CPU options below , which feature better CPU performance .
Best Entry - Level CPUs :
Intel Core i3-9100 F
( No integrated graphics )
– Architecture : Coffee Lake – Frequency / Turbo : 3.6/4.2GHz
– Cores ( Threads ) : 4 ( 4 ) – Integrated GPU : None
– RAM Support : Dual Channel DDR4 – TDP : 65W – Socket : LGA1151 ( 300 series chipset )
AMD Ryzen 3 3100
– Architecture : Zen 3rd gen – Frequency / Turbo : 3.6/3.9GHz
– Cores ( Threads ) : 4 ( 8 ) – Integrated GPU : None
– RAM Support : Dual Channel DDR4 – TDP : 65W – Socket : AM4
AMD Ryzen 3 3300X
– Architecture : Zen 3rd gen – Frequency / Turbo : 3.8/4.3GHz
– Cores ( Threads ) : 4 ( 8 ) – Integrated GPU : None
– RAM Support : Dual Channel DDR4 – TDP : 65W – Socket : AM4
Intel Core i3-10100
– Architecture : Comet Lake – Frequency / Turbo : 3.6/4.3GHz
– Cores ( Threads ) : 4 ( 8 ) – Integrated GPU : Intel UHD 630
– RAM Support : Dual Channel DDR4 – TDP : 65W – Socket : LGA1200
Intel Core i3-9100 F :
The Core i3-9100 F , which has no integrated graphics , is the second least expensive CPU that I recommend , being an option for a rock - bottom budget Gaming PC with a dedicated graphic card .
That said , its limited to 4 threads , greatly limiting its performance compared to the AMD Ryzen 3 3100 and Ryzen 3 3300X
Ryzen 3 3100 and 3300X :
Recently launched , the Ryzen 3 3100 and 3300X are 4 cores / 8 threads CPUs based on AMD latest Zen 2 architecture .
The main differences between the two is frequency :
The Ryzen 3 3100 runs at 3.6-3.9GHz , while the the Ryzen 3 3300X runs at 3.8- 4.3GHz .
The lower priced Ryzen 3 3100 offers similar or better performance than the 6 cores Ryzen 5 1600 or Ryzen 5 2600 , at a lower price , while offering better gaming performance .
It completely outclasses the Core i3-9100 F .
The higher - end Ryzen 3 3300X takes performance up a notch or two , outperforming the Intel Core i3-10100 all around , slightly edging it in gaming and greatly outperforming it in heavy multithreaded workloads .
Intel Core i3-10100 :
The Core i3-10100 brings a welcome change compared to the previous generation Core i3-9100 , that is the addition of Hyper - Threading .
So instead of being limited to 4 cores and 4 threads like the Core i3-9100 , the Core i3-10100 can handle up to 8 threads at once , doubling the number of threads compared to the previous generation .
That said , it faces tough competition this time around , from the AMD Ryzen 3 3300X .
Thanks to its higher single threaded and multithreaded performance , the AMD Ryzen 3 3300X comes out ahead of the Core i3-10100 in the vast majority of scenarios , including gaming .
The only reason that I ’d recommend the Core i3-10100 would be for office PCs , where the integrated graphics offer sufficient performance and help lower the total cost of the PC .
Do n’t waste your money on the Core i3-10300 or i3-10320
These offer the same quad - core / 8 threads design , simply with slightly higher Turbo frequencies .
Which is a good thing .
What ’s bad is their price , which is too close to the much better 6 cores / 12 threads AMD Ryzen 5 3600 , If you want a CPU that offers both great gaming and overall performance , see the Ryzen 5 3600 below .
Best Lower Mid-range CPUs :
AMD Ryzen 5 3600
– AMD Ryzen 5 3600 for the best gaming performance , all - around performance and PCIe 4.0
Get the AMD Ryzen 5 3600 from Amazon – $ 174.99 at B &H ( Worldwide Shipping ) – Architecture : Ryzen 3rd generation – Frequency / Turbo : 3.6/4.2 GHz

– Cores ( Threads ) : 6 ( 12 ) – Integrated GPU : None
– RAM Support : Dual Channel – TDP : 65W – Socket : LGA1200 AMD Ryzen 5 3600/3600X V.S. Intel Core i5 -10400 F ?
For gaming performance only :
The main competition to the $ 167 AMD Ryzen 5 3600 is the $ 180 - 190 Intel Core i5 - 10400 .
The $ 205 Ryzen 5 3600X is another option at a slightly higher price .
When it comes to strictly 1080 p gaming performance , all CPUs trade blows , the Core i5 - 10400 holds a very slight performance advantage , offering overall a few % more performance than the Ryzen 5 3600 and 3600X .
Note that if you game at 1440 p or 4 K , then all CPUs offer similar performance , as the GPU becomes the bottleneck .
Multithreaded performance : Under heavier , multithreaded , workloads , the Ryzen 5 3600 and 3600X hold a significant advantage against the Core i5 - 10400 .
Worth noting :
The Ryzen 5 3600 /3600X also offers ECC RAM support , unlike the Core i5 - 10400 .
The Ryzen 5 3600 /3600X supports PCIe 4.0 , unlike the Core i5 - 10400 .
The Ryzen 5 3600/3600X is unlocked , allowing you to overclock it , unlike the Core i5 - 10400 .
Which one would I pick ?
Unless all you do is game at 1080 p , I ’d get the AMD Ryzen 5 3600 , seeing as it offers great overall performance at a lower price .
The AMD Ryzen 5 3600 platform is also significantly less expensive , helping it being a better value overall .
That said , you ca n’t go wrong with either CPU .
Best Upper Mid-range CPUs :
Intel Core i5-10600K / KF
V.S. AMD Ryzen 7 3700X
– Intel Core i5-10600K / KF for gaming performance
– AMD Ryzen 7 3700X for multithreaded performance
Get the Intel Core i5 - 10600 K from Amazon – $ 299.99 at B &H ( Worldwide Shipping ) Intel Core i5-10600 KF
( No integrated graphics ) Get the Intel Core i5 - 10600 KF from Amazon
– $ 277.50 at B &H ( Worldwide Shipping ) – Architecture : Comet Lake – Frequency / Turbo : 4.1/4.8 GHz
– Cores ( Threads ) : 6 ( 12 ) – Integrated GPU : Intel UHD Graphics 630 for K version , None for KF version
– RAM Support : Dual Channel DDR4 – TDP : 125W – Socket : LGA1200
Get the AMD Ryzen 7 3700X from Amazon – $ 283.55 at B &H ( Worldwide Shipping ) – Architecture : Ryzen 3rd generation – Frequency / Turbo : 3.6/4.4 GHz
– Cores ( Threads ) : 8 ( 16 ) – Integrated GPU : None
– RAM Support : Dual Channel DDR4 – TDP : 65W – Socket : AM4 Gaming performance :
The Intel Core i5 -10600K / KF holds an advantage when it comes to gaming performance , being a notch faster than the Ryzen 7 3700X overall .
Multithreaded performance : Under heavier , multithreaded , workloads , the Ryzen 7 3700X holds a significant advantage against the Core i5 - 10600K / KF , thanks to having 2 more cores and supporting 4 more threads ..
Worth noting :
The Ryzen 7 3700X also offers ECC RAM support , unlike the Core i5 - 10600K / KF .
The Ryzen 7 3700X supports PCIe 4.0 , unlike the Core i5 - 10600K / KF .
Both CPUS are unlocked , allowing you to overclock them .
The Intel Core i5 -10600K / KF does not included a CPU Cooler , so you must get an aftermarket one .
Which one would I pick ?
It depends on what you plan to do :
If all you do is game at 1080 p , then get the Intel Core i5 - 10600 KF , seeing as it offers better gaming performance .
However , if you want better multi threaded performance for heavy workloads with plenty good gaming performance , then the 8 cores / 16 threads Ryzen 7 3700X makes more sense .
The AMD Ryzen 7 3700X platform is also significantly less expensive , helping it being a better value overall .
Best Lower High - End CPU :
Intel Core i7-10700K / KF
V.S. AMD Ryzen 7 3800X
– The AMD Ryzen 7 3800X offers excellent value , offering roughly 8 % lower gaming frame rates and trading blows on overall multithreaded performance at a much lower price
– The Intel Core i7-10700K / KF offers slightly higher gaming and single threaded performance , but at a price
I just found out via an article by Dan Farber that Yahoo ! has rolled out a new " universal profile " and decided to give it a quick look .
As I was creating my profile at http://profiles.yahoo.com/kpako
I saw an interesting option that I thought was worth commenting on which is captured in the screenshot below
The circled text says
Allow my connections to share my information labeled “ My Connections ” with third - party applications they install and developers who made the applications .
Learn More
The reason for this feature harkens back to the Robert Scoble vs. Facebook saga where Robert Scoble was temporarily banned from Facebook for extracting personal information about his Facebook friends from Facebook into Plaxo .
As I outlined in my post on the topic , Breaking the Social Contract : My Data is not Your Data , the problem was that Scoble 's friends on Facebook may have been OK with sharing their personal information with him on Facebook but not with him sharing that information with other services .
With this feature , Yahoo ! has allowed users to opt-in to allowing an application used by a member of their social network to access their personal information .
This is a very user - centric approach and avoids the draconian practice of services like Facebook that get around this issue by not providing any personally idenitifable user information via their APIs .
Instead a user can specify which pieces of their personal information they do n't mind being accessed by 3rd party applications being used by their friends using the option above .
Nicely done .
The only problem I can see is that this is a pretty nuanced option which users may not understand clearly and may overlook since it is just another checkbox in the profile creation flow .
Then again , it is hard to imagine how to introduce users to this concept after they have created their profile .
Kudos to the Yahoo ! folks on getting this feature and the rest of their universal profile out there .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel headed on Sunday toward an early election likely to kill any remaining chances for a peace deal with the Palestinians this year , after ruling party leader Tzipi Livni dropped efforts to form a government .
“ I notified the president that under the current circumstances , we should hold an election , without delay , ” Livni said after meeting Shimon Peres , Israel ’s head of state .
Livni , head of the centrist Kadima party , said prospective political partners had made “ impossible demands ” in weeks of bargaining , in which the ultra-Orthodox Shas faction had sought a steep boost in social welfare spending .
“ There are prices that can be paid .
There are prices others are ready to pay , but I ’m not willing to do so at the expense of the country and its people , just to be prime minister , ” Livni said in broadcast remarks .
Israeli media said Livni ’s centrist Kadima party would table a bill to dissolve Parliament on Monday , and set a new election date , when lawmakers convene after a long summer recess , but the motion would not necessarily come to an immediate vote .
Political commentators forecast a parliamentary election would be held on February 17 , more than a year ahead of schedule .
Last month , Peres asked Livni to form a government after Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , hit by a corruption scandal , resigned .
Olmert remains prime minister until a new government is formed .
Peres said that in accordance with legal procedures , he would consult over the next three days with political leaders parties , adding : “ Elections are no tragedy . ”
Once he has held those meetings , Peres can then set into motion a process leading to an election in three months ’ time .
Most opinion polls have predicted the right - wing party of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , an opponent of wide - ranging territorial compromise , would win the ballot .
PEACE NEGOTIATIONS
“ We hope the Israelis will choose to stay the course with the peace process , ” Palestinian peace negotiator Saeb Erekat said .
The United States had hoped for at least a framework deal on Palestinian statehood before President George W. Bush leaves office in January .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
Negotiations have so far shown few signs of progress -- Israeli settlement expansion and the future of Jerusalem are key stumbling blocks .
And with Israel ’s political scene in turmoil , there appeared to be little chance of an agreement .
Livni told Israel ’s Channel 10 television station she could not rule out future talks about dividing Jerusalem , a city Israel regards as its capital and which Palestinians want as capital of a possible state .
When asked about why she refused Shas ’s demands to rule out negotiations on Jerusalem , Livni said she could not make the guarantee because “ Israel is committed to a peace process about several issues . ”
Slideshow ( 5 images )
Livni also said she favored a “ united ” Jerusalem as Israel ’s capital , using a noncommittal catch phrase that avoids saying whether the city could be shared .
Shas , a major force among Israeli Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent , bills itself as a party of Israel ’s poor and has long been a maker and breaker of coalition governments .
Livni ’s refusal to bend to budgetary demands suggests she intends to fight an election campaign that portrays her as a woman of principle to an electorate disillusioned with coalition haggling and suspicions of wrongdoing at the top .
“ We have reached the point where I think the public is truly fed up with politicking , ” Livni said at Peres ’ official residence .
Ubuntu unveils Intrepid Ibex , Fedora finalises feature list , Mandriva coordinates worldwide install fest , openSUSE explains beta release process , DesktopBSD moves to KDE 4
Welcome to the big Ubuntu release week !
The landing of any new version of the world 's most popular desktop Linux distribution is the biggest event on many user 's Linux calendars and if history repeats itself , we should brace ourselves for another week of unreachable Ubuntu web sites , frantic search for download servers , and generally clogged fibre - optics pipes around the world .
Yes , Ubuntu 8.10 " Intrepid Ibex " is about to arrive !
Of course , those users who have been through a few releases know better than waiting until Thursday -- firing up " update - manager - d " and performing an online update magic before the big day is always a smart thing to do .
For those who are relatively new to the Linux and Ubuntu worlds or those who consider dipping their toes in these uncharted territories for the first time , here is a nice overview of Intrepid , complete with an overview of Ubuntu 's history and a list of available editions .
But if you prefer to celebrate the event in a group of like - minded individuals , check out the Intrepid Release Parties page to see whether there is anything happening in your city .
Finally , for those users who do n't have fast Internet connection or who would like to convert a few friends to Ubuntu , do n't forget to order your free Ubuntu CDs from ShipIt .
Ubuntu 8.10 " Intrepid Ibex " is about to start hitting the download mirrors
( full image size : 2,085 kB , screen resolution : 1280x1024 pixels )
* * * * * Another big distribution preparing for a stable release is Fedora .
Although the project 's upcoming version 10 is n't due for another month , this detailed list of 13 prime features reveals a great deal about the release : " With the success of Fedora in Linux distributions , Fedora 10 is perhaps the most anticipated operating system from their library .
A faster and advanced distribution is what is proposed by them .
Fedora 10 , code - named ' Cambridge ' , is set for release on November 25 , 2008 .
So before you go on and download this new Fedora version , let me give you a detailed idea about what benefits and changes are going to be there in this new Fedora 10 . "
The list includes a variety of goodies , such as faster start - up , improved printing and audio , an automated recovery tool called First Aid Kit , and security audit features .
* * * * * Continuing its excellent tradition of coordinating worldwide install fests , Mandriva has announced that its next " party " , celebrating the recent release of Mandriva Linux 2009 , will take place on Saturday , 22 November .
Mandriva 's community manager Adam Williamson has sent this message to DistroWatch : " Mandriva is coordinating an international install fest for the new Mandriva Linux 2009 release , on November 22nd , 2008 .
If you are involved with a Linux User Group ( LUG ) or other community group and would be interested in running a local event as part of the install fest , Mandriva will provide professionally pressed One CDs and other material .
Please visit this Wiki page for details of how to organize an event in your area , and for a list of already confirmed events .

Last week 's delay of the third beta of openSUSE 11.1 has prompted Andreas Jaeger to write up a detailed account of the openSUSE release process .
Entitled
Why do we release openSUSE on Thursdays - or why do we slip ? , the post provides an interesting insight into the complexities of coordinating work of dozens of developers : " During the pre-release testing and the internal testing , many bugs are found .
We do not fix all of them directly - instead they are reported via Bugzilla and also noted as ' most annoying bugs ' so that other testers know about them .
Only if we hit real blockers or ship stoppers , we will fix them and then might not even fix the ' annoying ' ones to not introduce further bugs .
If we would fix every bug we find internally , we would never release ; ) .
We really concentrate on fixing bugs that block further development or testing on a majority of machines ( or for a majority of users ) . "
For many users , openSUSE is already a perfect distribution , but few would argue that it has one serious defect - its excellent YaST configuration utility lacks a mascot : " YaST ( Your awesome Setup Tool ) is a impressive and useful tool for administering a Linux system , but it 's missing one crucial feature -- a mascot !
The YaST team wants to close this bug , so they 're putting out a call to the community to help create a mascot that reflects the power of YaST . "
The YaST mascot competition is open to all ; please see the Marketing Team / YaST Contest page for more details and the first submissions .
Of course , the contest winners and runner - ups can expect rewards for their work : " There will be a prize for the winning mascot , the winning mascot name , and two runners - up , and of course all contestants will bask in the everlasting glow of accomplishment from having submitted an entry . "

Finally , here is an interesting piece of news from the developer 's blog at DesktopBSD , a user - friendly desktop operating system based on FreeBSD .
From the Making DesktopBSD ready for KDE 4 blog post : " KDE 4 has been around for some time now and , while many still feel it has not matured enough , it will undoubtedly be the future of the K Desktop Environment .
Therefore , it is important to adapt DesktopBSD , which currently uses KDE 3 as its desktop environment , to this new major release .
This is rather difficult because of some of the technological changes in KDE 4 , in particular that KDE 4 now uses the Qt 4 development framework instead of its predecessor Qt 3 used in KDE 3 and the DesktopBSD Tools .
Since Qt 4 is not backwards - compatible , the DesktopBSD Tools would have to be ported to Qt 4 first in order to be able to utilize KDE 4 functionality , a process involving a lot of effort and very few gains .
As an alternative , the decision was made to stick with Qt 3 as framework for now and replace all of the KDE functionality in DesktopBSD code so it still works fine under KDE 4 without requiring users to have KDE 3 installed . "
WASHINGTON -- Sen. Barack Obama has opened up a double - digit lead in the presidential race , with a growing number of voters saying they 're now comfortable with the Democratic nominee 's values , background and ability to serve as commander in chief , according to a new Wall Street Journal / NBC News poll .
For months , the race has rested largely on the question of whether voters could get comfortable with Sen.
Obama , the first African - American to run on a major party ticket , and one who has been on the national political scene for ...
McCain's American Idol Make - Up Artist Makes Big Bucks
American Idol make - up artist Tifanie White has found some high profile work while the show is on break .
( Altaffer / AP )
Remember last month when Republican presidential nominee John McCain got made up by the American Idol make - up artist ?
Well , it was n't a one - shot deal .
The make - up artist to the wannabe - stars is getting paid beaucoup bucks to make McCain , 72 , more telegenic .
Tifanie
White , who reportedly has done makeup for the shows " So You Think You Can Dance " and " American Idol , " was paid a total of $ 8,672.55 in September by the McCain - Palin campaign , according to the campaign 's latest monthly financial report filed this week with the Federal Election Commission .
She was paid $ 5,583.43 the previous month , records show .
We asked McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers whether McCain was happy with the American Idol make - up artist 's work , and whether Ms. White also does makeup for McCain 's naturally telegenic vice presidential running mate , Sarah Palin .
Rogers replied via email , " No comment . "
We refrained from asking whether McCain might have a future on " American Idol " if things do n't break his way two weeks from today on Election Day .
But at least he has an in if he so chooses .
John Murtha May Lose His Re-election Bid
It appears as thought John Murtha is slipping in the polls in his bid to win re-election .
His opponent is an Iraq war veteran who was so disgusted by Murtha ’s remarks about the Haditha marines being cold blooded murderers that he decided to run against him .
Calling his constituents racists surely can’t help his re-election bid , and it appears to be one of the issues that has caused the race to tighten .
he ’s upset with Murtha ’s comment that racism in the district could hurt Democrat Barack Obama ’s chances .
“ I did n’t like that at all .
He should n’t have said it , ” Shemanski said
But there is one more issue that seems to be affecting his poll numbers , an issue that I find a little surprising .
Many residents in the district are upset with Congress for passing a $ 700 billion economic recovery package in an effort to stabilize the nation ’s financial market , Russell said .
Murtha supported the legislation .
“ The bailout , the way it was produced , ended up a bad bill , ” Russell said .
“ The average person here who has been paying their mortgage or have paid off their house , are being asked to foot the bill for all these people — whether it is the bank or the speculator or the person who bought beyond their means — and people are very unhappy about that , ” Russell said .
The infamous bailout bill .
The general consensus is that the slowing economy favors Barack Obama and thus Democrats but there are many , many people who are extremely upset with the bailout bill , ( I am one of them ) , and it will be interesting to see what kind of affect that it has on not just this race but on races around the country .
If any .
The bailout bill could prove to have ramifications that no politician foresaw .
People are not happy about it and this could make more politicians vulnerable than we know .
We heat allot about how many Republicans are vulnerable in the upcoming election , but nothing about vulnerable Democrats .
Not all Democrats can be safe , and Murtha appears to be one who is n’t .
I hope he gets what he deserves .
An All New Rails Security Guide
Hot off the back of the Rails Guides hackfest came a lot of great new Rails documentation .
Now joining that documentation comes an all new Ruby on Rails Security Guide .

David Friedman On Evolution And Human Nature
David Friedman says that while Leftists generally accept that evolution occurred they reject all implications evolution has for human nature .
People who say they are against teaching the theory of evolution are very likely to be Christian fundamentalists .
But people who are against taking seriously the implications of evolution , strongly enough to want to attack those who disagree , including those who teach those implications , are quite likely to be on the left .
I think he is right on his basic points .
The bulk of the ( fairly unscientific ) attacks on the idea of genetic causes of differences in intellectual performance come from the Left .
The argument for the primacy of social environment as the biggest force determining our intelligence comes from the Left .
Yet some genetic theorists find evidence that local selective pressures exerted even over several hundred years can cause big changes in cognitive function .
Friedman starts out focusing on differences between the sexes in cognitive function .
Consider the most striking case , the question of whether there are differences between men and women with regard to the distribution of intellectual abilities or behavioral patterns .
That no such differences exist , or if that if they exist they are insignificant , is a matter of faith for many on the left .
The faith is so strongly held that when the president of Harvard , himself a prominent academic , merely raised the possibility that one reason why there were fewer women than men in certain fields might be such differences , he was ferociously attacked and eventually driven to resign .
Yet the claim that such differences must be insignificant is one that nobody who took the implications of evolution seriously could maintain .
We are , after all , the product of selection for reproductive success .
Males and females play quite different roles in reproduction .
It would be a striking coincidence if the distribution of abilities and behavioral patterns that was optimal for one sex turned out to also be optimal for the other , rather like two entirely different math problems just happening to have the same answer .
Human male and female brains differ in fundamental ways .
For example , women have a higher ratio of white matter to gray matter than men .
The scientific literature on male - female differences in cognition is now enormous .
Yet a president of Harvard ( Larry Summers ) can still get forced from office in part because he took that scientific literature seriously .
Speaking as someone who thinks the evidence for the theory of evolution is overwhelming I am very disappointed at how evolution has been walled off from most discussions of human nature in the political sphere .
Among most secularists ( who like to fancy themselves as more scientific than the Christians ) I see widespread embrace of a sort of modern Cartesian dualism where instead of placing the mind in a supernatural realm the genes that code for the mind are viewed as immune to evolutionary selective pressures .
We are supposed to believe that humans have evolved so far that they 've escaped the genes that code for their minds and that at birth the human mind is a Blank Slate ( tabula rasa ) almost totally molded by its environment .
I see the Left's Blank Slate as an even worse model for understand human nature than the fundamentalist Christian Original Sin view of human nature .
The Original Sin model maps closer to what evolution produced : selfish desires that got selected for in order to cause behaviors that boost reproductive fitness .
In the Original Sin model the idea that evil can be defeated in this world is laughable because the devil is whispering in everyone 's ear and the battle between good and evil is constant .
The temptations of sin are the desires and instincts placed in us by millions of years of natural selection .
So the idea of Original Sin hits a lot closer to the truth than the view that we can perfect humans with smarter social policies .
New Soviet Man is the antithesis of what a Darwinist ought to think is possible to achieve in human societies .
A June 2007 article from Plos Genetics , Localizing Recent Adaptive Evolution in the Human Genome , provides examples of localized evolution of cognitive function .
Several genes with functional roles in the development and function of the nervous system show very strong evidence ( CLR p < 10−5 ) for a recent selective sweep .
For example , SV2B , a gene encoding a synaptic vesicle protein with highest expression during brain development [ 36 ] , exhibits strong evidence for a selective sweep in the African - American sample .
Likewise , the protein encoded by DAB1 plays a developmental role in the layering of neurons in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum [ 37 ] , and exhibits strong evidence for a selective sweep in the Asian sample .
Other nervous system genes with strong evidence for a selective sweep include two candidate genes for Alzheimer disease ( APPBP2 and APBA2 ) that bind the amyloid - beta precursor protein , two genes ( SKP1A and PCDH15 ) with a role in sensory development , and several others with various roles in nervous system development and function ( PHACTR1 , ALG10 , PREP , GPM6A , and DGKI ) .
A March 2007 article from Plos Biology , A Map of Recent Positive Selection in the Human Genome , finds plenty of signs up local cognitive evolution .
Recent articles have proposed that genes involved in brain development and function may have been important targets of selection in recent human evolution [ 8,9 ] .
While we do not find evidence for selection in the two genes reported in those studies ( MCPH1 and ASPM ) , we do find signals in two other microcephaly genes , namely , CDK5RAP2 in Yoruba , and CENPJ in Europeans and East Asians [ 46 ] .
Though there is not an overall enrichment for neurological genes in our gene ontology analysis , several other important brain genes also have signals of selection , including the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter GABRA4 , an Alzheimer 's susceptibility gene PSEN1 , and SYT1 in Yoruba ; the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 in Europeans and East Asians ; and the dystrophin binding gene SNTG1 in all populations .
This all is unsurprising and I expect much more evidence to be uncovered of cognitive adaptations to local environments .
For example , fishermen had different cognitive demands placed on them than farmers .
With a boat one is in constant danger of death and one needs to be much more careful .
The ideal personality for a crew member of a fishing boat is probably different than the ideal personality for a sheep herder and the ideal personality for a sheep herder is probably different than that for a tiller of soil .
So an area with lots of coastlines and little farmable land probably have different average personality types than areas with lots of tillable soil .
While some will rush to dismiss these speculations evidence has already begun to emerge that genetic variations that affect cognitive function make people more adapted in some environments and less adapted in other environments .
For example , a genetic variation that contributes to hyperactivity boosts success of nomadic tribesmen but makes them less successful when they move into urban environments .
A lot of people with Attention Deficit Disorder ( ADD ) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) probably have what we consider a disability in industrial society because their ancestors did better by having the genes that cause these cognitive states .
Today ADHD causes people to be more violent and criminal .
While politically correct dogma would have us believe that humans are extremely similar excepting for appearances the latest genetic research shows that human groups are evolutionarily diverging from each other and in many ways .
But these insights from research are entirely missing from political discussions .
As my regular readers know , I think we are on the verge of an enormous explosion of discoveries about human genetics and the roles genes play in causing differences in cognitive function , athletic performance , health , and other aspects of human function .
People who anchor their political beliefs in either supernatural religious or secular religious belief systems are going to find the foundations of their beliefs blown away by this coming torrent of discoveries .
Today , I ’m going to talk about a feature that ’s not all new in Rails but it ’s still got the smell of a freshly unwrapped present : Memoization .
I ’d like to thank Josh Peek from the Rails Core team for giving feedback on the article before I published it – thanks , mate !
It Really Just Means Caching the Result
The concept behind it is actually fairly easy to grasp : Instead of calling the same ( possibly expensive to run ) method that will return the same result over and over again , why not just store the result of the first method call and re-use it afterwards ?
Ryan Bates often refers to this as caching the result in his Railscasts .
You can also read a more general description of the memoization pattern over at Reference.com .
Let ’s take a look at a simple example .
We have a City class that has a zipcode and a name .
We ’ll usually use both of these in our application , so we might write a method that looks like this :
def zipcode_and_name " #{ zipcode } #{ name } " end
Memoize Away !
This is perfectly valid , however , every time we call this method during one request it always re-constructs the resulting string .
So let ’s memoize the call in the classic way that you might have already stumbled across :
def zipcode_and_name @zipcode_and_name ||= " #{ zipcode } #{ name } " end
The ||= operator is a so - called conditional assignment that only assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left if the variable is not true .
Since pretty much everything in Ruby evaluates to true when coerced into a boolean ( except nil and , of course , false , as well as a couple of other things ) this is exactly what we want :
The first call returns the actual string and from the second time on , no matter how often the method is called on the same object , the “ cached ” result will be used .
A little note on naming here :
Some people seem to prefer prefixing the memoizing variable ’s name with an underscore to indicate that it ’s not meant to be used as an actual instance variable .
To be honest , I do n’t think this is really necessary unless you define a whole bunch of instance variables and memoized variables .
Memoizable – The Macro - Style Way of Doing Memoziation
On July 15 , 2008 Josh Peek added the Memoizable module to Rails core .
Originally , this was only meant to be used internally in Rails to prevent some annoying errors when manually memoizing methods in frozen objects .
Here ’s how Josh Peek explains the reasons for including the Memoizable module :
The initial motivation was to fix an issue with freezing memoizable methods .
If you do it the old way , and freeze the object before calling the method first , the method will complain that it ca n’t modify the instance var .
The fix was to call all the memoized methods on freeze .
I found this pattern really useful for creating a class that could be lazy loaded or eager loaded .
So you write your classes up in a lazy load stye , memoize the methods with the helper , and – if you need to eager load – use freeze to transition the object to a final fully cached state .
I ’m not sure if this is for everyone , but its been really useful internal in Rails .
Although it was meant for internal purposes , the inclusion of this module initially kick - started some discussion as to whether the responsibilities for memoization should be taken away from the programmer by putting it in a module .
However , Josh decided to take some of the proposals and include them in the Rails core , so now all it does is abstract the functionality in a – in my opinion – really clean way .
To cut a long story short , here ’s the example we used earlier , rewritten to use the Memoizable API :
# somewhere inside the class extend ActiveSupport :: Memoizable def zipcode_and_name " #{ zipcode } #{ name } " end memoize :zipcode_and_name
The memoize macro method then takes care of caching the method call result and retrieving it as necessary .
Part of the initial criticism also where that there was no way to force the cached result to be reloaded and that memoize would n’t work with methods that accepted parameters .
Both of these issues have been fixed later – so methods with parameters can now be memoized as well :
def some_method ( * args ) # some calculations end memoize :some_method
This roughly equals the following code ( and is actually pretty much how the Memoizable module handles it internally ) :
def some_method ( * args ) @some_method ||= {} @some_method [ args ] ||= ( # some calculation )
end
What happens here is that the cache is a hash instead of a mere scalar and the hash is indexed by the parameters that are passed to the method .
So if I call a method twice with the same parameters , I ’ll get the cached result on the second call .
Reloading a cached result is pretty easy , too :
object.some_memoized_method(:reload ) # or , less self - explanatory : object.some_memoized_method( true )
Beware of the Dynamics !
I can already feel people finishing reading this article and then going back to their code and doing something like this to their User class :
def age today = Date .
today today .
year - birth_date .
year + ( today . month - birth_date .
month + ( ( today . day - birth_date .
day ) < 0 ? - 1 : 0 ) < 0 ? - 1 : 0 ) end memoize : age
This may seem okay but imagine running this method one second before midnight on the day before a user ’s birthday :
The memoized value will be returned even if the process runs longer than midnight ( two seconds , say ) and it ’s already their birthday !
The point of this certainly simple example is as follows :
If a method uses data that is inherently dynamic , such as the current date / time , random numbers , lambdas / procs and the like , it ’s not really a good fit for memoization .
On the contrary – it might even lead to all kinds of weird behavior and bugs !
Tips and Tricks
Here are some tips and tricks that did n’t seem to fit anywhere else in the article .
Memoizing Class Methods
Since memoize is already a class method , if you want to memoize a class method , you have to put the memoize call in the class ’ metaclass :
def self .
a_class_method # some code end class << self ; extend ActiveSupport :: Memoizable ; self ; end .
memoize :a_class_method
As you can see , this is not really clean – so here ’s a better way :
class << self extend ActiveSupport :: Memoizable def a_class_method # some code end memoize :a_class_method
end
Way better !
A little hint if you want to use the “ old style ” for memoizing class methods :
You have to use instance variables ( with one \@ rather than two ) to cache the results !
This is because inside the context of a class method the instance is the class itself rather than the instance .
If you do n’t get what I ’m talking about , you might want to check out Dave Thomas ’ screencast series on Ruby Metaprogramming .
Enable Memoization For All Active Records
If you want to use memoize in a lot of your ActiveRecord models , you might think about extending the Memoizable module inside ActiveRecord : : Base :
# for memoizing instance methods : ActiveRecord :: Base .
extend ( ActiveSupport :: Memoizable ) # for memoizing class methods : ActiveRecord :: Base .
class_eval { class << self ; extend ActiveSupport :: Memoizable ; end }
This way , every descendant of ActiveRecord ( i.e. all of your models ) will be able to call memoize without having to extend the module first .
Return Values Are Frozen !
There ’s one more thing that tends to creates both , confusion and controversy : Return values of memoized methods are frozen – which basically means you can’t modify the return object itself but rather have to dup it first .
As Josh stated in the quote above , the freezing problems where the reason behind the Memoizable module – so I guess , frozen return values are a trade - off that we have to just accept .
When Should You Use memoize and When Should You Just Stick to the Classic Style ?
You might also ask yourself how to decide when you should use memoize and when to stick to the “ old way ” of storing the result in an instance variable yourself .
So here ’s my rule of thumb :
If you may need to reload the cached result during a request , you might want to use memoize because it offers a simple way for reloading – it ’s way harder to implement that yourself !
Otherwise , I tend to look at the complexity of the method :
If the method is a simple one - or two - liner , I use the classic style – if it involves more complex logic , I prefer memoize .
What Do You Think ?
I hope this article comes in handy for some of you who have n’t heard of memoization yet or who just did n’t really understand what ’s going on there .
As always , I ’m looking forward to reading your comments – also , feel free to ask questions if something remained unclear !
RERUM NOVARUM
ENCYCLICAL OF POPE LEO XIII
ON CAPITAL AND LABOR
To Our Venerable Brethren the Patriarchs ,
Primates , Archbishops , Bishops , and other ordinaries
of places having Peace andCommunion with the Apostolic See .
Rights and Duties of Capital and Labor
That the spirit ofrevolutionary change , which has long been disturbing the nations of the world , should have passed beyond the sphere of politics and made its influence felt inthe cognate sphere of practical economics is not surprising .
The elements of theconflict now raging are unmistakable , in the vast expansion of industrialpursuits and the marvellous discoveries of science ; in the changed relationsbetween masters and workmen ; in the enormous fortunes of some few individuals , and the utter poverty of the masses ; the increased self reliance and closermutual combination of the working classes ; as also , finally , in the prevailingmoral degeneracy .
Themomentous gravity of the state of things now obtaining fills every mind withpainful apprehension ; wise men are discussing it ; practical men are proposingschemes ; popular meetings , legislatures , and rulers of nations are all busiedwith it - actually there is no question which has taken deeper hold on thepublic mind .
2 . Therefore , venerable brethren , as on former occasions when it seemed opportune to refute false teaching , We have addressed you in the interests of the Church and of the common weal , and have issued letters bearing on political power , human liberty , the Christian constitution of the State , and like matters , so have We thought it expedient now to speak on the condition of the working classes .
(1) It is a subject on which We have already touched more than once , incidentally .
But in the present letter , the responsibility of the apostolic office urges
Us to treat the question of set purpose and in detail , in order that no misapprehension may exist as to the principles which truth and justice dictate for its settlement .
The discussion is not easy , nor is it void of danger .
It is no easy matter to define the relative rights and mutual duties of the rich and of the poor , of capital and of labor .
And the danger lies in this , that crafty agitators are intent on making use of these differences of opinion to pervert men's judgments and to stir up the people to revolt .
3 . In any case we clearly see , and on this there is general agreement , that some opportune remedy must be found quickly for the misery and wretchedness pressing so unjustly on the majority of the working class : for the ancient workingmen 's guilds were abolished in the last century , and no other protective organization took their place .
Public institutions and the laws set aside the ancient religion .
Hence , by degrees it has come to pass that working men have been surrendered , isolated and helpless , to the hardheartedness of employers and the greed of unchecked competition .
The mischief has been increased by rapacious usury , which , although more than once condemned by the Church , is nevertheless , under a different guise , but with like injustice , still practiced by covetous and grasping men .
To this must be added that the hiring of labor and the conduct of trade are concentrated in the hands of comparatively few ; so that a small number of very rich men have been able to lay upon the teeming masses of the laboring poor a yoke little better than that of slavery itself .
4 . To remedy these wrongs the socialists , working on the poor man 's envy of the rich , are striving to do away with private property , and contend that individual possessions should become the common property of all , to be administered by the State or by municipal bodies .
They hold that by thus transferring property from private individuals to the community , the present mischievous state of things will be set to rights , inasmuch as each citizen will then get his fair share of whatever there is to enjoy .
But their contentions are so clearly powerless to end the controversy that were they carried into effect the working man himself would be among the first to suffer .
They are , moreover , emphatically unjust , for they would rob the lawful possessor , distort the functions of the State , and create utter confusion in the community .
5 . It is surely undeniable that , when a man engages in remunerative labor , the impelling reason and motive of his work is to obtain property , and thereafter to hold it as his very own .
If one man hires out to another his strength or skill , he does so for the purpose of receiving in return what is necessary for the satisfaction of his needs ; he therefore expressly intends to acquire a right full and real , not only to the remuneration , but also to the disposal of such remuneration , just as he pleases .
Thus , if he lives sparingly , saves money , and , for greater security , invests his savings in land , the land , in such case , is only his wages under another form ; and , consequently , a working man 's little estate thus purchased should be as completely at his full disposal as are the wages he receives for his labor .
But it is precisely in such power of disposal that ownership obtains , whether the property consist of land or chattels .
Socialists , therefore , by endeavoring to transfer the possessions of individuals to the community at large , strike at the interests of every wage - earner , since they would deprive him of the liberty of disposing of his wages , and thereby of all hope and possibility of increasing his resources and of bettering his condition in life .
6 . What is of far greater moment , however , is the fact that the remedy they propose is manifestly against justice .
For , every man has by nature the right to possess property as his own .
This is one of the chief points of distinction between man and the animal creation , for the brute has no power of self direction , but is governed by two main instincts , which keep his powers on the alert , impel him to develop them in a fitting manner , and stimulate and determine him to action without any power of choice .
One of these instincts is self preservation , the other the propagation of the species .
Both can attain their purpose by means of things which lie within range ; beyond their verge the brute creation cannot go , for they are moved to action by their senses only , and in the special direction which these suggest .
But with man it is wholly different .
He possesses , on the one hand , the full perfection of the animal being , and hence enjoys at least as much as the rest of the animal kind , the fruition of things material .
But animal nature , however perfect , is far from representing the human being in its completeness , and is in truth but humanity 's humble handmaid , made to serve and to obey .
It is the mind , or reason , which is the predominant element in us who are human creatures ; it is this which renders a human being human , and distinguishes him essentially from the brute .
And on this very account - that man alone among the animal creation is endowed with reason - it must be within his right to possess things not merely for temporary and momentary use , as other living things do , but to have and to hold them in stable and permanent possession ; he must have not only things that perish in the use , but those also which , though they have been reduced into use , continue for further use in after time .
7 . This becomes still more clearly evident if man 's nature be considered a little more deeply .
For man , fathoming by his faculty of reason matters without number , linking the future with the present , and being master of his own acts , guides his ways under the eternal law and the power of God , whose providence governs all things .
Wherefore , it is in his power to exercise his choice not only as to matters that regard his present welfare , but also about those which he deems may be for his advantage in time yet to come .
Hence , man not only should possess the fruits of the earth , but also the very soil , inasmuch as from the produce of the earth he has to lay by provision for the future .
Man 's needs do not die out , but forever recur ; although satisfied today , they demand fresh supplies for tomorrow .
Nature accordingly must have given to man a source that is stable and remaining always with him , from which he might look to draw continual supplies .
And this stable condition of things he finds solely in the earth and its fruits .
There is no need to bring in the State .
Man precedes the State , and possesses , prior to the formation of any State , the right of providing for the substance of his body .
8 . The fact that God has given the earth for the use and enjoyment of the whole human race can in no way be a bar to the owning of private property .
For God has granted the earth to mankind in general , not in the sense that all without distinction can deal with it as they like , but rather that no part of it was assigned to any one in particular , and that the limits of private possession have been left to be fixed by man 's own industry , and by the laws of individual races .
Moreover , the earth , even though apportioned among private owners , ceases not thereby to minister to the needs of all , inasmuch as there is not one who does not sustain life from what the land produces .
Those who do not possess the soil contribute their labor ; hence , it may truly be said that all human subsistence is derived either from labor on one 's own land , or from some toil , some calling , which is paid for either in the produce of the land itself , or in that which is exchanged for what the land brings forth .
9 . Here , again , we have further proof that private ownership is in accordance with the law of nature .
Truly , that which is required for the preservation of life , and for life 's well - being , is produced in great abundance from the soil , but not until man has brought it into cultivation and expended upon it his solicitude and skill .
Now , when man thus turns the activity of his mind and the strength of his body toward procuring the fruits of nature , by such act he makes his own that portion of nature 's field which he cultivates - that portion on which he leaves , as it were , the impress of his personality ; and it cannot but be just that he should possess that portion as his very own , and have a right to hold it without any one being justified in violating that right .
10 .
So strong and convincing are these arguments that it seems amazing that some should now be setting up anew certain obsolete opinions in opposition to what is here laid down .
They assert that it is right for private persons to have the use of the soil and its various fruits , but that it is unjust for any one to possess outright either the land on which he has built or the estate which he has brought under cultivation .
But those who deny these rights do not perceive that they are defrauding man of what his own labor has produced .
For the soil which is tilled and cultivated with toil and skill utterly changes its condition ; it was wild before , now it is fruitful ; was barren , but now brings forth in abundance .
That which has thus altered and improved the land becomes so truly part of itself as to be in great measure indistinguishable and inseparable from it .
Is it just that the fruit of a man 's own sweat and labor should be possessed and enjoyed by any one else ?
As effects follow their cause , so is it just and right that the results of labor should belong to those who have bestowed their labor .
11 . With reason , then , the common opinion of mankind , little affected by the few dissentients who have contended for the opposite view , has found in the careful study of nature , and in the laws of nature , the foundations of the division of property , and the practice of all ages has consecrated the principle of private ownership , as being pre-eminently in conformity with human nature , and as conducing in the most unmistakable manner to the peace and tranquillity of human existence .
The same principle is confirmed and enforced by the civil laws - laws which , so long as they are just , derive from the law of nature their binding force .
The authority of the divine law adds its sanction , forbidding us in severest terms even to covet that which is another 's : " Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's wife ; nor his house , nor his field , nor his man-servant , nor his maid - servant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor anything that is his . "
( 2 )
12 . The rights here spoken of , belonging to each individual man , are seen in much stronger light when considered in relation to man 's social and domestic obligations .
In choosing a state of life , it is indisputable that all are at full liberty to follow the counsel of Jesus Christ as to observing virginity , or to bind themselves by the marriage tie .
No human law can abolish the natural and original right of marriage , nor in any way limit the chief and principal purpose of marriage ordained by God 's authority from the beginning : " Increase and multiply . "
( 3 ) Hence we have the family , the " society " of a man 's house - a society very small , one must admit , but none the less a true society , and one older than any State .
Consequently , it has rights and duties peculiar to itself which are quite independent of the State .
13 .
That right to property , therefore , which has been proved to belong naturally to individual persons , must in like wise belong to a man in his capacity of head of a family ; nay , that right is all the stronger in proportion as the human person receives a wider extension in the family group .
It is a most sacred law of nature that a father should provide food and all necessaries for those whom he has begotten ; and , similarly , it is natural that he should wish that his children , who carry on , so to speak , and continue his personality , should be by him provided with all that is needful to enable them to keep themselves decently from want and misery amid the uncertainties of this mortal life .
Now , in no other way can a father effect this except by the ownership of productive property , which he can transmit to his children by inheritance .
A family , no less than a State , is , as We have said , a true society , governed by an authority peculiar to itself , that is to say , by the authority of the father .
Provided , therefore , the limits which are prescribed by the very purposes for which it exists be not transgressed , the family has at least equal rights with the State in the choice and pursuit of the things needful to its preservation and its just liberty .
We say , " at least equal rights " ; for , inasmuch as the domestic household is antecedent , as well in idea as in fact , to the gathering of men into a community , the family must necessarily have rights and duties which are prior to those of the community , and founded more immediately in nature .
If the citizens , if the families on entering into association and fellowship , were to experience hindrance in a commonwealth instead of help , and were to find their rights attacked instead of being upheld , society would rightly be an object of detestation rather than of desire .
14 .
The contention , then , that the civil government should at its option intrude into and exercise intimate control over the family and the household is a great and pernicious error .
True , if a family finds itself in exceeding distress , utterly deprived of the counsel of friends , and without any prospect of extricating itself , it is right that extreme necessity be met by public aid , since each family is a part of the commonwealth .
In like manner , if within the precincts of the household there occur grave disturbance of mutual rights , public authority should intervene to force each party to yield to the other its proper due ; for this is not to deprive citizens of their rights , but justly and properly to safeguard and strengthen them .
But the rulers of the commonwealth must go no further ; here , nature bids them stop .
Paternal authority can be neither abolished nor absorbed by the State ; for it has the same source as human life itself .
" The child belongs to the father , " and is , as it were , the continuation of the father 's personality ; and speaking strictly , the child takes its place in civil society , not of its own right , but in its quality as member of the family in which it is born .
And for the very reason that " the child belongs to the father " it is , as St. Thomas Aquinas says , " before it attains the use of free will , under the power and the charge of its parents . "
( 4 ) The socialists , therefore , in setting aside the parent and setting up a State supervision , act against natural justice , and destroy the structure of the home .
15 .
And in addition to injustice , it is only too evident what an upset and disturbance there would be in all classes , and to how intolerable and hateful a slavery citizens would be subjected .
The door would be thrown open to envy , to mutual invective , and to discord ; the sources of wealth themselves would run dry , for no one would have any interest in exerting his talents or his industry ; and that ideal equality about which they entertain pleasant dreams would be in reality the levelling down of all to a like condition of misery and degradation .
Hence , it is clear that the main tenet of socialism , community of goods , must be utterly rejected , since it only injures those whom it would seem meant to benefit , is directly contrary to the natural rights of mankind , and would introduce confusion and disorder into the commonweal .
The first and most fundamental principle , therefore , if one would undertake to alleviate the condition of the masses , must be the inviolability of private property .
This being established , we proceed to show where the remedy sought for must be found .
16 .
We approach the subject with confidence , and in the exercise of the rights which manifestly appertain to Us , for no practical solution of this question will be found apart from the intervention of religion and of the Church .
It is We who are the chief guardian of religion and the chief dispenser of what pertains to the Church ; and by keeping silence we would seem to neglect the duty incumbent on us .
Doubtless , this most serious question demands the attention and the efforts of others besides ourselves - to wit , of the rulers of States , of employers of labor , of the wealthy , aye , of the working classes themselves , for whom We are pleading .
But
We affirm without hesitation that all the striving of men will be vain if they leave out the Church .
It is the Church that insists , on the authority of the Gospel , upon those teachings whereby the conflict can be brought to an end , or rendered , at least , far less bitter ; the Church uses her efforts not only to enlighten the mind , but to direct by her precepts the life and conduct of each and all ; the Church improves and betters the condition of the working man by means of numerous organizations ; does her best to enlist the services of all classes in discussing and endeavoring to further in the most practical way , the interests of the working classes ; and considers that for this purpose recourse should be had , in due measure and degree , to the intervention of the law and of State authority .
17 .
It must be first of all recognized that the condition of things inherent in human affairs must be borne with , for it is impossible to reduce civil society to one dead level .
Socialists may in that intent do their utmost , but all striving against nature is in vain .
There naturally exist among mankind manifold differences of the most important kind ; people differ in capacity , skill , health , strength ; and unequal fortune is a necessary result of unequal condition .
Such unequality is far from being disadvantageous either to individuals or to the community .
Social and public life can only be maintained by means of various kinds of capacity for business and the playing of many parts ; and each man , as a rule , chooses the part which suits his own peculiar domestic condition .
As regards bodily labor , even had man never fallen from the state of innocence , he would not have remained wholly idle ; but that which would then have been his free choice and his delight became afterwards compulsory , and the painful expiation for his disobedience .
" Cursed be the earth in thy work ; in thy labor thou shalt eat of it all the days of thy life . "
( 5 )
18 . In like manner , the other pains and hardships of life will have no end or cessation on earth ; for the consequences of sin are bitter and hard to bear , and they must accompany man so long as life lasts .
To suffer and to endure , therefore , is the lot of humanity ; let them strive as they may , no strength and no artifice will ever succeed in banishing from human life the ills and troubles which beset it .
If any there are who pretend differently - who hold out to a hard - pressed people the boon of freedom from pain and trouble , an undisturbed repose , and constant enjoyment - they delude the people and impose upon them , and their lying promises will only one day bring forth evils worse than the present .
Nothing is more useful than to look upon the world as it really is , and at the same time to seek elsewhere , as We have said , for the solace to its troubles .
19 .
The great mistake made in regard to the matter now under consideration is to take up with the notion that class is naturally hostile to class , and that the wealthy and the working men are intended by nature to live in mutual conflict .
So irrational and so false is this view that the direct contrary is the truth .
Just as the symmetry of the human frame is the result of the suitable arrangement of the different parts of the body , so in a State is it ordained by nature that these two classes should dwell in harmony and agreement , so as to maintain the balance of the body politic .
Each needs the other : capital cannot do without labor , nor labor without capital .
Mutual agreement results in the beauty of good order , while perpetual conflict necessarily produces confusion and savage barbarity .
Now , in preventing such strife as this , and in uprooting it , the efficacy of Christian institutions is marvellous and manifold .
First of all , there is no intermediary more powerful than religion ( whereof the Church is the interpreter and guardian ) in drawing the rich and the working class together , by reminding each of its duties to the other , and especially of the obligations of justice .
20 .
Of these duties , the following bind the proletarian and the worker : fully and faithfully to perform the work which has been freely and equitably agreed upon ; never to injure the property , nor to outrage the person , of an employer ; never to resort to violence in defending their own cause , nor to engage in riot or disorder ; and to have nothing to do with men of evil principles , who work upon the people with artful promises of great results , and excite foolish hopes which usually end in useless regrets and grievous loss .
The following duties bind the wealthy owner and the employer : not to look upon their work people as their bondsmen , but to respect in every man his dignity as a person ennobled by Christian character .
They are reminded that , according to natural reason and Christian philosophy , working for gain is creditable , not shameful , to a man , since it enables him to earn an honorable livelihood ; but to misuse men as though they were things in the pursuit of gain , or to value them solely for their physical powers - that is truly shameful and inhuman .
Again justice demands that , in dealing with the working man , religion and the good of his soul must be kept in mind .
Hence , the employer is bound to see that the worker has time for his religious duties ; that he be not exposed to corrupting influences and dangerous occasions ; and that he be not led away to neglect his home and family , or to squander his earnings .
Furthermore , the employer must never tax his work people beyond their strength , or employ them in work unsuited to their sex and age .
His great and principal duty is to give every one what is just .
Doubtless , before deciding whether wages axe fair , many things have to be considered ; but wealthy owners and all masters of labor should be mindful of this - that to exercise pressure upon the indigent and the destitute for the sake of gain , and to gather one 's profit out of the need of another , is condemned by all laws , human and divine .
To defraud any one of wages that are his due is a great crime which cries to the avenging anger of Heaven .
" Behold , the hire of the laborers ... which by fraud has been kept back by you , crieth ; and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth . "
( 6 ) Lastly , the rich must religiously refrain from cutting down the workmen 's earnings , whether by force , by fraud , or by usurious dealing ; and with all the greater reason because the laboring man is , as a rule , weak and unprotected , and because his slender means should in proportion to their scantiness be accounted sacred .
Were these precepts carefully obeyed and followed out , would they not be sufficient of themselves to keep under all strife and all its causes ?
21 . But the Church , with Jesus Christ as her Master and Guide , aims higher still .
She lays down precepts yet more perfect , and tries to bind class to class in friendliness and good feeling .
The things of earth cannot be understood or valued aright without taking into consideration the life to come , the life that will know no death .
Exclude the idea of futurity , and forthwith the very notion of what is good and right would perish ; nay , the whole scheme of the universe would become a dark and unfathomable mystery .
The great truth which we learn from nature herself is also the grand Christian dogma on which religion rests as on its foundation - that , when we have given up this present life , then shall we really begin to live .
God has not created us for the perishable and transitory things of earth , but for things heavenly and everlasting ;
He has given us this world as a place of exile , and not as our abiding place .
As for riches and the other things which men call good and desirable , whether we have them in abundance , or are lacking in them - so far as eternal happiness is concerned - it makes no difference ; the only important thing is to use them aright .
Jesus Christ , when
He redeemed us with plentiful redemption , took not away the pains and sorrows which in such large proportion are woven together in the web of our mortal life .
He transformed them into motives of virtue and occasions of merit ; and no man can hope for eternal reward unless he follow in the blood - stained footprints of his Saviour .
" If we suffer with Him , we shall also reign with Him . " ( 7 ) Christ 's labors and sufferings , accepted of His own free will , have marvellously sweetened all suffering and all labor .
And not only by His example , but by His grace and by the hope held forth of everlasting recompense , has He made pain and grief more easy to endure ; " for that which is at present momentary and light of our tribulation , worketh for us above measure exceedingly an eternal weight of glory . "
( 8 )
22 . Therefore , those whom fortune favors are warned that riches do not bring freedom from sorrow and are of no avail for eternal happiness , but rather are obstacles ; ( 9 ) that the rich should tremble at the threatenings of Jesus Christ - threatenings so unwonted in the mouth of our Lord ( 10 ) - and that a most strict account must be given to the Supreme Judge for all we possess .
The chief and most excellent rule for the right use of money is one the heathen philosophers hinted at , but which the Church has traced out clearly , and has not only made known to men's minds , but has impressed upon their lives .
It rests on the principle that it is one thing to have a right to the possession of money and another to have a right to use money as one wills .
Private ownership , as we have seen , is the natural right of man , and to exercise that right , especially as members of society , is not only lawful , but absolutely necessary .
" It is lawful , " says St. Thomas Aquinas , " for a man to hold private property ; and it is also necessary for the carrying on of human existence . " "
But if the question be asked :
How must one 's possessions be used ?
- the Church replies without hesitation in the words of the same holy Doctor : " Man should not consider his material possessions as his own , but as common to all , so as to share them without hesitation when others are in need .
Whence the Apostle with , ‘ Command the rich of this world ... to offer with no stint , to apportion largely . ’" ( 12 ) True , no one is commanded to distribute to others that which is required for his own needs and those of his household ; nor even to give away what is reasonably required to keep up becomingly his condition in life , " for no one ought to live other than becomingly . " ( 13 ) But , when what necessity demands has been supplied , and one 's standing fairly taken thought for , it becomes a duty to give to the indigent out of what remains over .
" Of that which remaineth , give alms . " ( 14 ) It is a duty , not of justice ( save in extreme cases ) , but of Christian charity - a duty not enforced by human law .
But the laws and judgments of men must yield place to the laws and judgments of Christ the true God , who in many ways urges on His followers the practice of almsgiving - ‘ It is more blessed to give than to receive " ; ( 15 ) and who will count a kindness done or refused to the poor as done or refused to Himself - " As long as you did it to one of My least brethren you did it to Me . " ( 16 )
To sum up , then , what has been said : Whoever has received from the divine bounty a large share of temporal blessings , whether they be external and material , or gifts of the mind , has received them for the purpose of using them for the perfecting of his own nature , and , at the same time , that he may employ them , as the steward of God 's providence , for the benefit of others .
" He that hath a talent , " said St. Gregory the Great , " let him see that he hide it not ; he that hath abundance , let him quicken himself to mercy and generosity ; he that hath art and skill , let him do his best to share the use and the utility hereof with his neighbor . " ( 17 )
23 .
As for those who possess not the gifts of fortune , they are taught by the Church that in God 's sight poverty is no disgrace , and that there is nothing to be ashamed of in earning their bread by labor .
This is enforced by what we see in Christ Himself , who , " whereas He was rich , for our sakes became poor " ; ( 18 ) and who , being the Son of God , and God Himself , chose to seem and to be considered the son of a carpenter - nay , did not disdain to spend a great part of His life as a carpenter Himself .
" Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary ? " ( 19 )
24 . From contemplation of this divine Model , it is more easy to understand that the true worth and nobility of man lie in his moral qualities , that is , in virtue ; that virtue is , moreover , the common inheritance of men , equally within the reach of high and low , rich and poor ; and that virtue , and virtue alone , wherever found , will be followed by the rewards of everlasting happiness .
Nay , God Himself seems to incline rather to those who suffer misfortune ; for Jesus Christ calls the poor " blessed " ; ( 20 )
He lovingly invites those in labor and grief to come to Him for solace ; ( 21 ) and He displays the tenderest charity toward the lowly and the oppressed .
These reflections cannot fail to keep down the pride of the well - to - do , and to give heart to the unfortunate ; to move the former to be generous and the latter to be moderate in their desires .
Thus , the separation which pride would set up tends to disappear , nor will it be difficult to make rich and poor join hands in friendly concord .
25 . But , if Christian precepts prevail , the respective classes will not only be united in the bonds of friendship , but also in those of brotherly love .
For they will understand and feel that all men are children of the same common Father , who is God ; that all have alike the same last end , which is God Himself , who alone can make either men or angels absolutely and perfectly happy ; that each and all are redeemed and made sons of God , by Jesus Christ , " the first - born among many brethren " ; that the blessings of nature and the gifts of grace belong to the whole human race in common , and that from none except the unworthy is withheld the inheritance of the kingdom of Heaven .
" If sons , heirs also ; heirs indeed of God , and co-heirs with Christ . " ( 22 ) Such is the scheme of duties and of rights which is shown forth to the world by the Gospel .
Would it not seem that , were society penetrated with ideas like these , strife must quickly cease ?
26 .
But the Church , not content with pointing out the remedy , also applies it .
For the Church does her utmost to teach and to train men , and to educate them and by the intermediary of her bishops and clergy diffuses her salutary teachings far and wide .
She strives to influence the mind and the heart so that all may willingly yield themselves to be formed and guided by the commandments of God .
It is precisely in this fundamental and momentous matter , on which everything depends that the Church possesses a power peculiarly her own .
The instruments which she employs are given to her by Jesus Christ Himself for the very purpose of reaching the hearts of men , and drive their efficiency from God .
They alone can reach the innermost heart and conscience , and bring men to act from a motive of duty , to control their passions and appetites , to love God and their fellow men with a love that is outstanding and of the highest degree and to break down courageously every barrier which blocks the way to virtue .
27 .
On this subject we need but recall for one moment the examples recorded in history .
Of these facts there cannot be any shadow of doubt : for instance , that civil society was renovated in every part by Christian institutions ; that in the strength of that renewal the human race was lifted up to better things - nay , that it was brought back from death to life , and to so excellent a life that nothing more perfect had been known before , or will come to be known in the ages that have yet to be .
Of this beneficent transformation Jesus Christ was at once the first cause and the final end ; as from Him all came , so to Him was all to be brought back .
For , when the human race , by the light of the Gospel message , came to know the grand mystery of the Incarnation of the Word and the redemption of man , at once the life of Jesus Christ , God and Man , pervaded every race and nation , and interpenetrated them with His faith , His precepts , and His laws .
And if human society is to be healed now , in no other way can it be healed save by a return to Christian life and Christian institutions .
When a society is perishing , the wholesome advice to give to those who would restore it is to call it to the principles from which it sprang ; for the purpose and perfection of an association is to aim at and to attain that for which it is formed , and its efforts should be put in motion and inspired by the end and object which originally gave it being .
Hence , to fall away from its primal constitution implies disease ; to go back to it , recovery .
And this may be asserted with utmost truth both of the whole body of the commonwealth and of that class of its citizens - by far the great majority - who get their living by their labor .
28 . Neither must it be supposed that the solicitude of the Church is so preoccupied with the spiritual concerns of her children as to neglect their temporal and earthly interests .
Her desire is that the poor , for example , should rise above poverty and wretchedness , and better their condition in life ; and for this she makes a strong endeavor .
By the fact that she calls men to virtue and forms them to its practice she promotes this in no slight degree .
Christian morality , when adequately and completely practiced , leads of itself to temporal prosperity , for it merits the blessing of that God who is the source of all blessings ; it powerfully restrains the greed of possession and the thirst for pleasure - twin plagues , which too often make a man who is void of self - restraint miserable in the midst of abundance ; ( 23 ) it makes men supply for the lack of means through economy , teaching them to be content with frugal living , and further , keeping them out of the reach of those vices which devour not small incomes merely , but large fortunes , and dissipate many a goodly inheritance .
29 .
The Church , moreover , intervenes directly in behalf of the poor , by setting on foot and maintaining many associations which she knows to be efficient for the relief of poverty .
Herein , again , she has always succeeded so well as to have even extorted the praise of her enemies .
Such was the ardor of brotherly love among the earliest Christians that numbers of those who were in better circumstances despoiled themselves of their possessions in order to relieve their brethren ; whence " neither was there any one needy among them . " ( 24 ) To the order of deacons , instituted in that very intent , was committed by the Apostles the charge of the daily doles ; and the Apostle Paul , though burdened with the solicitude of all the churches , hesitated not to undertake laborious journeys in order to carry the alms of the faithful to the poorer Christians .
Tertullian calls these contributions , given voluntarily by Christians in their assemblies , deposits of piety , because , to cite his own words , they were employed " in feeding the needy , in burying them , in support of youths and maidens destitute of means and deprived of their parents , in the care of the aged , and the relief of the shipwrecked . " ( 25 )
30 .
Thus , by degrees , came into existence the patrimony which the Church has guarded with religious care as the inheritance of the poor .
Nay , in order to spare them the shame of begging , the Church has provided aid for the needy .
The common Mother of rich and poor has aroused everywhere the heroism of charity , and has established congregations of religious and many other useful institutions for help and mercy , so that hardly any kind of suffering could exist which was not afforded relief .
At the present day many there are who , like the heathen of old , seek to blame and condemn the Church for such eminent charity .
They would substitute in its stead a system of relief organized by the State .
But no human expedients will ever make up for the devotedness and self sacrifice of Christian charity .
Charity , as a virtue , pertains to the Church ; for virtue it is not , unless it be drawn from the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ ; and whosoever turns his back on the Church can not be near to Christ .
31 . It cannot , however , be doubted that to attain the purpose we are treating of , not only the Church , but all human agencies , must concur .
All who are concerned in the matter should be of one mind and according to their ability act together .
It is with this , as with providence that governs the world ; the results of causes do not usually take place save where all the causes cooperate .
It is sufficient , therefore , to inquire what part the State should play in the work of remedy and relief .
32 . By the State we here understand , not the particular form of government prevailing in this or that nation , but the State as rightly apprehended ; that is to say , any government conformable in its institutions to right reason and natural law , and to those dictates of the divine wisdom which we have expounded in the encyclical On the Christian Constitution of the State . ( 26 ) The foremost duty , therefore , of the rulers of the State should be to make sure that the laws and institutions , the general character and administration of the commonwealth , shall be such as of themselves to realize public well - being and private prosperity .
This is the proper scope of wise statesmanship and is the work of the rulers .
Now a State chiefly prospers and thrives through moral rule , well - regulated family life , respect for religion and justice , the moderation and fair imposing of public taxes , the progress of the arts and of trade , the abundant yield of the land - through everything , in fact , which makes the citizens better and happier .
Hereby , then , it lies in the power of a ruler to benefit every class in the State , and amongst the rest to promote to the utmost the interests of the poor ; and this in virtue of his office , and without being open to suspicion of undue interference - since it is the province of the commonwealth to serve the common good .
And the more that is done for the benefit of the working classes by the general laws of the country , the less need will there be to seek for special means to relieve them .
33 .
There is another and deeper consideration which must not be lost sight of .
As regards the State , the interests of all , whether high or low , are equal .
The members of the working classes are citizens by nature and by the same right as the rich ; they are real parts , living the life which makes up , through the family , the body of the commonwealth ; and it need hardly be said that they are in every city very largely in the majority .
It would be irrational to neglect one portion of the citizens and favor another , and therefore the public administration must duly and solicitously provide for the welfare and the comfort of the working classes ; otherwise , that law of justice will be violated which ordains that each man shall have his due .
To cite the wise words of St. Thomas Aquinas : " As the part and the whole are in a certain sense identical , so that which belongs to the whole in a sense belongs to the part . " ( 27 ) Among the many and grave duties of rulers who would do their best for the people , the first and chief is to act with strict justice - with that justice which is called distributive - toward each and every class alike .
34 .
But although all citizens , without exception , can and ought to contribute to that common good in which individuals share so advantageously to themselves , yet it should not be supposed that all can contribute in the like way and to the same extent .
No matter what changes may occur in forms of government , there will ever be differences and inequalities of condition in the State .
Society cannot exist or be conceived of without them .
Some there must be who devote themselves to the work of the commonwealth , who make the laws or administer justice , or whose advice and authority govern the nation in times of peace , and defend it in war .
Such men clearly occupy the foremost place in the State , and should be held in highest estimation , for their work concerns most nearly and effectively the general interests of the community .
Those who labor at a trade or calling do not promote the general welfare in such measure as this , but they benefit the nation , if less directly , in a most important manner .
We have insisted , it is true , that , since the end of society is to make men better , the chief good that society can possess is virtue .
Nevertheless , it is the business of a well - constituted body politic to see to the provision of those material and external helps " the use of which is necessary to virtuous action . " ( 28 ) Now , for the provision of such commodities , the labor of the working class - the exercise of their skill , and the employment of their strength , in the cultivation of the land , and in the workshops of trade - is especially responsible and quite indispensable .
Indeed , their co-operation is in this respect so important that it may be truly said that it is only by the labor of working men that States grow rich .
Justice , therefore , demands that the interests of the working classes should be carefully watched over by the administration , so that they who contribute so largely to the advantage of the community may themselves share in the benefits which they create - that being housed , clothed , and bodily fit , they may find their life less hard and more endurable .
It follows that whatever shall appear to prove conducive to the well - being of those who work should obtain favorable consideration .
There is no fear that solicitude of this kind will be harmful to any interest ; on the contrary , it will be to the advantage of all , for it cannot but be good for the commonwealth to shield from misery those on whom it so largely depends for the things that it needs .
35 .
We have said that the State must not absorb the individual or the family ; both should be allowed free and untrammelled action so far as is consistent with the common good and the interest of others .
Rulers should , nevertheless , anxiously safeguard the community and all its members ; the community , because the conservation thereof is so emphatically the business of the supreme power , that the safety of the commonwealth is not only the first law , but it is a government 's whole reason of existence ; and the members , because both philosophy and the Gospel concur in laying down that the object of the government of the State should be , not the advantage of the ruler , but the benefit of those over whom he is placed .
As the power to rule comes from God , and is , as it were , a participation in His , the highest of all sovereignties , it should be exercised as the power of God is exercised - with a fatherly solicitude which not only guides the whole , but reaches also individuals .
36 .
Whenever the general interest or any particular class suffers , or is threatened with harm , which can in no other way be met or prevented , the public authority must step in to deal with it .
Now , it is to the interest of the community , as well as of the individual , that peace and good order should be maintained ; that all things should be carried on in accordance with God 's laws and those of nature ; that the discipline of family life should be observed and that religion should be obeyed ; that a high standard of morality should prevail , both in public and private life ; that justice should be held sacred and that no one should injure another with impunity ; that the members of the commonwealth should grow up to man 's estate strong and robust , and capable , if need be , of guarding and defending their country .
If by a strike of workers or concerted interruption of work there should be imminent danger of disturbance to the public peace ; or if circumstances were such as that among the working class the ties of family life were relaxed ; if religion were found to suffer through the workers not having time and opportunity afforded them to practice its duties ; if in workshops and factories there were danger to morals through the mixing of the sexes or from other harmful occasions of evil ; or if employers laid burdens upon their workmen which were unjust , or degraded them with conditions repugnant to their dignity as human beings ; finally , if health were endangered by excessive labor , or by work unsuited to sex or age - in such cases , there can be no question but that , within certain limits , it would be right to invoke the aid and authority of the law .
The limits must be determined by the nature of the occasion which calls for the law 's interference - the principle being that the law must not undertake more , nor proceed further , than is required for the remedy of the evil or the removal of the mischief .
37 . Rights must be religiously respected wherever they exist , and it is the duty of the public authority to prevent and to punish injury , and to protect every one in the possession of his own .
Still , when there is question of defending the rights of individuals , the poor and badly off have a claim to especial consideration .
The richer class have many ways of shielding themselves , and stand less in need of help from the State ; whereas the mass of the poor have no resources of their own to fall back upon , and must chiefly depend upon the assistance of the State .
And it is for this reason that wage - earners , since they mostly belong in the mass of the needy , should be specially cared for and protected by the government .
38 .
Here , however , it is expedient to bring under special notice certain matters of moment .
First of all , there is the duty of safeguarding private property by legal enactment and protection .
Most of all it is essential , where the passion of greed is so strong , to keep the populace within the line of duty ; for , if all may justly strive to better their condition , neither justice nor the common good allows any individual to seize upon that which belongs to another , or , under the futile and shallow pretext of equality , to lay violent hands on other people 's possessions .
Most true it is that by far the larger part of the workers prefer to better themselves by honest labor rather than by doing any wrong to others .
But there are not a few who are imbued with evil principles and eager for revolutionary change , whose main purpose is to stir up disorder and incite their fellows to acts of violence .
The authority of the law should intervene to put restraint upon such firebrands , to save the working classes from being led astray by their maneuvers , and to protect lawful owners from spoliation .
39 .
When work people have recourse to a strike and become voluntarily idle , it is frequently because the hours of labor are too long , or the work too hard , or because they consider their wages insufficient .
The grave inconvenience of this not uncommon occurrence should be obviated by public remedial measures ; for such paralysing of labor not only affects the masters and their work people alike , but is extremely injurious to trade and to the general interests of the public ; moreover , on such occasions , violence and disorder are generally not far distant , and thus it frequently happens that the public peace is imperiled .
The laws should forestall and prevent such troubles from arising ; they should lend their influence and authority to the removal in good time of the causes which lead to conflicts between employers and employed .
40 .
The working man , too , has interests in which he should be protected by the State ; and first of all , there are the interests of his soul .
Life on earth , however good and desirable in itself , is not the final purpose for which man is created ; it is only the way and the means to that attainment of truth and that love of goodness in which the full life of the soul consists .
It is the soul which is made after the image and likeness of God ; it is in the soul that the sovereignty resides in virtue whereof man is commanded to rule the creatures below him and to use all the earth and the ocean for his profit and advantage .
" Fill the earth and subdue it ; and rule over the fishes of the sea , and the fowls of the air , and all living creatures that move upon the earth . " ( 29 ) In this respect all men are equal ; there is here no difference between rich and poor , master and servant , ruler and ruled , " for the same is Lord over all . " ( 30 ) No man may with impunity outrage that human dignity which God Himself treats with great reverence , nor stand in the way of that higher life which is the preparation of the eternal life of heaven .
Nay , more ; no man has in this matter power over himself .
To consent to any treatment which is calculated to defeat the end and purpose of his being is beyond his right ; he cannot give up his soul to servitude , for it is not man 's own rights which are here in question , but the rights of God , the most sacred and inviolable of rights .
41 . From this follows the obligation of the cessation from work and labor on Sundays and certain holy days .
The rest from labor is not to be understood as mere giving way to idleness ; much less must it be an occasion for spending money and for vicious indulgence , as many would have it to be ; but it should be rest from labor , hallowed by religion .
Rest ( combined with religious observances ) disposes man to forget for a while the business of his everyday life , to turn his thoughts to things heavenly , and to the worship which he so strictly owes to the eternal Godhead .
It is this , above all , which is the reason arid motive of Sunday rest ; a rest sanctioned by God 's great law of the Ancient Covenant - " Remember thou keep holy the Sabbath day , " ( 31 ) and taught to the world by His own mysterious " rest " after the creation of man : " He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done . " ( 32 )
42 . If we turn not to things external and material , the first thing of all to secure is to save unfortunate working people from the cruelty of men of greed , who use human beings as mere instruments for money - making .
It is neither just nor human so to grind men down with excessive labor as to stupefy their minds and wear out their bodies .
Man 's powers , like his general nature , are limited , and beyond these limits he cannot go .
His strength is developed and increased by use and exercise , but only on condition of due intermission and proper rest .
Daily labor , therefore , should be so regulated as not to be protracted over longer hours than strength admits .
How many and how long the intervals of rest should be must depend on the nature of the work , on circumstances of time and place , and on the health and strength of the workman .
Those who work in mines and quarries , and extract coal , stone and metals from the bowels of the earth , should have shorter hours in proportion as their labor is more severe and trying to health .
Then , again , the season of the year should be taken into account ; for not unfrequently a kind of labor is easy at one time which at another is intolerable or exceedingly difficult .
Finally , work which is quite suitable for a strong man cannot rightly be required from a woman or a child .
And , in regard to children , great care should be taken not to place them in workshops and factories until their bodies and minds are sufficiently developed .
For , just as very rough weather destroys the buds of spring , so does too early an experience of life 's hard toil blight the young promise of a child 's faculties , and render any true education impossible .
Women , again , are not suited for certain occupations ; a woman is by nature fitted for home - work , and it is that which is best adapted at once to preserve her modesty and to promote the good bringing up of children and the well - being of the family .
As a general principle it may be laid down that a workman ought to have leisure and rest proportionate to the wear and tear of his strength , for waste of strength must be repaired by cessation from hard work .
In all agreements between masters and work people there is always the condition expressed or understood that there should be allowed proper rest for soul and body .
To agree in any other sense would be against what is right and just ; for it can never be just or right to require on the one side , or to promise on the other , the giving up of those duties which a man owes to his God and to himself .
43 .
We now approach a subject of great importance , and one in respect of which , if extremes are to be avoided , right notions are absolutely necessary .
Wages , as we are told , are regulated by free consent , and therefore the employer , when he pays what was agreed upon , has done his part and seemingly is not called upon to do anything beyond .
The only way , it is said , in which injustice might occur would be if the master refused to pay the whole of the wages , or if the workman should not complete the work undertaken ; in such cases the public authority should intervene , to see that each obtains his due , but not under any other circumstances .
44 .
To this kind of argument a fair - minded man will not easily or entirely assent ; it is not complete , for there are important considerations which it leaves out of account altogether .
To labor is to exert oneself for the sake of procuring what is necessary for the various purposes of life , and chief of all for self preservation .
" In the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat bread . " ( 33 ) Hence , a man 's labor necessarily bears two notes or characters .
First of all , it is personal , inasmuch as the force which acts is bound up with the personality and is the exclusive property of him who acts , and , further , was given to him for his advantage .
Secondly , man 's labor is necessary ; for without the result of labor a man cannot live , and self - preservation is a law of nature , which it is wrong to disobey .
Now , were we to consider labor merely in so far as it is personal , doubtless it would be within the workman 's right to accept any rate of wages whatsoever ; for in the same way as he is free to work or not , so is he free to accept a small wage or even none at all .
But our conclusion must be very different if , together with the personal element in a man 's work , we consider the fact that work is also necessary for him to live : these two aspects of his work are separable in thought , but not in reality .
The preservation of life is the bounden duty of one and all , and to be wanting therein is a crime .
It necessarily follows that each one has a natural right to procure what is required in order to live , and the poor can procure that in no other way than by what they can earn through their work .
45 .
Let the working man and the employer make free agreements , and in particular let them agree freely as to the wages ; nevertheless , there underlies a dictate of natural justice more imperious and ancient than any bargain between man and man , namely , that wages ought not to be insufficient to support a frugal and well - behaved wage - earner .
If through necessity or fear of a worse evil the workman accept harder conditions because an employer or contractor will afford him no better , he is made the victim of force and injustice .
In these and similar questions , however - such as , for example , the hours of labor in different trades , the sanitary precautions to be observed in factories and workshops , etc. - in order to supersede undue interference on the part of the State , especially as circumstances , times , and localities differ so widely , it is advisable that recourse be had to societies or boards such as We shall mention presently , or to some other mode of safeguarding the interests of the wage - earners ; the State being appealed to , should circumstances require , for its sanction and protection .
46 .
If a workman 's wages be sufficient to enable him comfortably to support himself , his wife , and his children , he will find it easy , if he be a sensible man , to practice thrift , and he will not fail , by cutting down expenses , to put by some little savings and thus secure a modest source of income .
Nature itself would urge him to this .
We have seen that this great labor question cannot be solved save by assuming as a principle that private ownership must be held sacred and inviolable .
The law , therefore , should favor ownership , and its policy should be to induce as many as possible of the people to become owners .
47 .
Many excellent results will follow from this ; and , first of all , property will certainly become more equitably divided .
For , the result of civil change and revolution has been to divide cities into two classes separated by a wide chasm .
On the one side there is the party which holds power because it holds wealth ; which has in its grasp the whole of labor and trade ; which manipulates for its own benefit and its own purposes all the sources of supply , and which is not without influence even in the administration of the commonwealth .
On the other side there is the needy and powerless multitude , sick and sore in spirit and ever ready for disturbance .
If working people can be encouraged to look forward to obtaining a share in the land , the consequence will be that the gulf between vast wealth and sheer poverty will be bridged over , and the respective classes will be brought nearer to one another .
A further consequence will result in the great abundance of the fruits of the earth .
Men always work harder and more readily when they work on that which belongs to them ; nay , they learn to love the very soil that yields in response to the labor of their hands , not only food to eat , but an abundance of good things for themselves and those that are dear to them .
That such a spirit of willing labor would add to the produce of the earth and to the wealth of the community is self evident .
And a third advantage would spring from this : men would cling to the country in which they were born , for no one would exchange his country for a foreign land if his own afforded him the means of living a decent and happy life .
These three important benefits , however , can be reckoned on only provided that a man 's means be not drained and exhausted by excessive taxation .
The right to possess private property is derived from nature , not from man ; and the State has the right to control its use in the interests of the public good alone , but by no means to absorb it altogether .
The State would therefore be unjust and cruel if under the name of taxation it were to deprive the private owner of more than is fair .
48 .
In the last place , employers and workmen may of themselves effect much , in the matter We are treating , by means of such associations and organizations as afford opportune aid to those who are in distress , and which draw the two classes more closely together .
Among these may be enumerated societies for mutual help ; various benevolent foundations established by private persons to provide for the workman , and for his widow or his orphans , in case of sudden calamity , in sickness , and in the event of death ; and institutions for the welfare of boys and girls , young people , and those more advanced in years .
49 .
The most important of all are workingmen 's unions , for these virtually include all the rest .
History attests what excellent results were brought about by the artificers ' guilds of olden times .
They were the means of affording not only many advantages to the workmen , but in no small degree of promoting the advancement of art , as numerous monuments remain to bear witness .
Such unions should be suited to the requirements of this our age - an age of wider education , of different habits , and of far more numerous requirements in daily life .
It is gratifying to know that there are actually in existence not a few associations of this nature , consisting either of workmen alone , or of workmen and employers together , but it were greatly to be desired that they should become more numerous and more efficient .
We have spoken of them more than once , yet it will be well to explain here how notably they are needed , to show that they exist of their own right , and what should be their organization and their mode of action .
50 .
The consciousness of his own weakness urges man to call in aid from without .
We read in the pages of holy Writ : " It is better that two should be together than one ; for they have the advantage of their society .
If one fall he shall be supported by the other .
Woe to him that is alone , for when he falleth he hath none to lift him up . " ( 34 ) And further : " A brother that is helped by his brother is like a strong city . " ( 35 ) It is this natural impulse which binds men together in civil society ; and it is likewise this which leads them to join together in associations which are , it is true , lesser and not independent societies , but , nevertheless , real societies .
51 .
These lesser societies and the larger society differ in many respects , because their immediate purpose and aim are different .
Civil society exists for the common good , and hence is concerned with the interests of all in general , albeit with individual interests also in their due place and degree .
It is therefore called a public society , because by its agency , as St. Thomas of Aquinas says , " Men establish relations in common with one another in the setting up of a commonwealth . " ( 36 ) But societies which are formed in the bosom of the commonwealth are styled private , and rightly so , since their immediate purpose is the private advantage of the associates .
" Now , a private society , " says St. Thomas again , " is one which is formed for the purpose of carrying out private objects ; as when two or three enter into partnership with the view of trading in common . " ( 37 ) Private societies , then , although they exist within the body politic , and are severally part of the commonwealth , cannot nevertheless be absolutely , and as such , prohibited by public authority .
For , to enter into a " society " of this kind is the natural right of man ; and the State has for its office to protect natural rights , not to destroy them ; and , if it forbid its citizens to form associations , it contradicts the very principle of its own existence , for both they and it exist in virtue of the like principle , namely , the natural tendency of man to dwell in society .
52 .
There are occasions , doubtless , when it is fitting that the law should intervene to prevent certain associations , as when men join together for purposes which are evidently bad , unlawful , or dangerous to the State .
In such cases , public authority may justly forbid the formation of such associations , and may dissolve them if they already exist .
But every precaution should be taken not to violate the rights of individuals and not to impose unreasonable regulations under pretense of public benefit .
For laws only bind when they are in accordance with right reason , and , hence , with the eternal law of God . ( 38 )
53 .
And here we are reminded of the confraternities , societies , and religious orders which have arisen by the Church 's authority and the piety of Christian men .
The annals of every nation down to our own days bear witness to what they have accomplished for the human race .
It is indisputable that on grounds of reason alone such associations , being perfectly blameless in their objects , possess the sanction of the law of nature .
In their religious aspect they claim rightly to be responsible to the Church alone .
The rulers of the State accordingly have no rights over them , nor can they claim any share in their control ; on the contrary , it is the duty of the State to respect and cherish them , and , if need be , to defend them from attack .
It is notorious that a very different course has been followed , more especially in our own times .
In many places the State authorities have laid violent hands on these communities , and committed manifold injustice against them ; it has placed them under control of the civil law , taken away their rights as corporate bodies , and despoiled them of their property , in such property the Church had her rights , each member of the body had his or her rights , and there were also the rights of those who had founded or endowed these communities for a definite purpose , and , furthermore , of those for whose benefit and assistance they had their being .
Therefore
We cannot refrain from complaining of such spoliation as unjust and fraught with evil results ; and with all the more reason do We complain because , at the very time when the law proclaims that association is free to all , We see that Catholic societies , however peaceful and useful , are hampered in every way , whereas the utmost liberty is conceded to individuals whose purposes are at once hurtful to religion and dangerous to the commonwealth .
54 . Associations of every kind , and especially those of working men , are now far more common than heretofore .
As regards many of these there is no need at present to inquire whence they spring , what are their objects , or what the means they imply .
Now , there is a good deal of evidence in favor of the opinion that many of these societies are in the hands of secret leaders , and are managed on principles ill - according with Christianity and the public well - being ; and that they do their utmost to get within their grasp the whole field of labor , and force working men either to join them or to starve .
Under these circumstances Christian working men must do one of two things : either join associations in which their religion will be exposed to peril , or form associations among themselves and unite their forces so as to shake off courageously the yoke of so unrighteous and intolerable an oppression .
No one who does not wish to expose man 's chief good to extreme risk will for a moment hesitate to say that the second alternative should by all means be adopted .
55 .
Those Catholics are worthy of all praise - and they are not a few - who , understanding what the times require , have striven , by various undertakings and endeavors , to better the condition of the working class by rightful means .
They have taken up the cause of the working man , and have spared no efforts to better the condition both of families and individuals ; to infuse a spirit of equity into the mutual relations of employers and employed ; to keep before the eyes of both classes the precepts of duty and the laws of the Gospel - that Gospel which , by inculcating self restraint , keeps men within the bounds of moderation , and tends to establish harmony among the divergent interests and the various classes which compose the body politic .
It is with such ends in view that we see men of eminence , meeting together for discussion , for the promotion of concerted action , and for practical work .
Others , again , strive to unite working men of various grades into associations , help them with their advice and means , and enable them to obtain fitting and profitable employment .
The bishops , on their part , bestow their ready good will and support ; and with their approval and guidance many members of the clergy , both secular and regular , labor assiduously in behalf of the spiritual interest of the members of such associations .
And there are not wanting Catholics blessed with affluence , who have , as it were , cast in their lot with the wage - earners , and who have spent large sums in founding and widely spreading benefit and insurance societies , by means of which the working man may without difficulty acquire through his labor not only many present advantages , but also the certainty of honorable support in days to come .
How greatly such manifold and earnest activity has benefited the community at large is too well known to require
Us to dwell upon it .
We find therein grounds for most cheering hope in the future , provided always that the associations
We have described continue to grow and spread , and are well and wisely administered .
The State should watch over these societies of citizens banded together in accordance with their rights , but it should not thrust itself into their peculiar concerns and their organization , for things move and live by the spirit inspiring them , and may be killed by the rough grasp of a hand from without .
56 .
In order that an association may be carried on with unity of purpose and harmony of action , its administration and government should be firm and wise .
All such societies , being free to exist , have the further right to adopt such rules and organization as may best conduce to the attainment of their respective objects .
We do not judge it possible to enter into minute particulars touching the subject of organization ; this must depend on national character , on practice and experience , on the nature and aim of the work to be done , on the scope of the various trades and employments , and on other circumstances of fact and of time - all of which should be carefully considered .
57 .
To sum up , then , We may lay it down as a general and lasting law that working men's associations should be so organized and governed as to furnish the best and most suitable means for attaining what is aimed at , that is to say , for helping each individual member to better his condition to the utmost in body , soul , and property .
It is clear that they must pay special and chief attention to the duties of religion and morality , and that social betterment should have this chiefly in view ; otherwise they would lose wholly their special character , and end by becoming little better than those societies which take no account whatever of religion .
What advantage can it be to a working man to obtain by means of a society material well - being , if he endangers his soul for lack of spiritual food ?
" What doth it profit a man , if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul ? " ( 39 ) This , as our Lord teaches , is the mark or character that distinguishes the Christian from the heathen .
" After all these things do the heathen seek . . .
Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His justice : and all these things shall be added unto you . " ( 40 ) Let our associations , then , look first and before all things to God ; let religious instruction have therein the foremost place , each one being carefully taught what is his duty to God , what he has to believe , what to hope for , and how he is to work out his salvation ; and let all be warned and strengthened with special care against wrong principles and false teaching .
Let the working man be urged and led to the worship of God , to the earnest practice of religion , and , among other things , to the keeping holy of Sundays and holy days .
Let him learn to reverence and love holy Church , the common Mother of us all ; and hence to obey the precepts of the Church , and to frequent the sacraments , since they are the means ordained by God for obtaining forgiveness of sin and fox leading a holy life .
58 .
The foundations of the organization being thus laid in religion , We next proceed to make clear the relations of the members one to another , in order that they may live together in concord and go forward prosperously and with good results .
The offices and charges of the society should be apportioned for the good of the society itself , and in such mode that difference in degree or standing should not interfere with unanimity and good - will .
It is most important that office bearers be appointed with due prudence and discretion , and each one 's charge carefully mapped out , in order that no members may suffer harm .
The common funds must be administered with strict honesty , in such a way that a member may receive assistance in proportion to his necessities .
The rights and duties of the employers , as compared with the rights and duties of the employed , ought to be the subject of careful consideration .
Should it happen that either a master or a workman believes himself injured , nothing would be more desirable than that a committee should be appointed , composed of reliable and capable members of the association , whose duty would be , conformably with the rules of the association , to settle the dispute .
Among the several purposes of a society , one should be to try to arrange for a continuous supply of work at all times and seasons ; as well as to create a fund out of which the members may be effectually helped in their needs , not only in the cases of accident , but also in sickness , old age , and distress .
59 .
Such rules and regulations , if willingly obeyed by all , will sufficiently ensure the well being of the less well - to - do ; whilst such mutual associations among Catholics are certain to be productive in no small degree of prosperity to the State .
Is it not rash to conjecture the future from the past .
Age gives way to age , but the events of one century are wonderfully like those of another , for they are directed by the providence of God , who overrules the course of history in accordance with His purposes in creating the race of man .
We are told that it was cast as a reproach on the Christians in the early ages of the Church that the greater number among them had to live by begging or by labor .
Yet , destitute though they were of wealth and influence , they ended by winning over to their side the favor of the rich and the good - will of the powerful .
They showed themselves industrious , hard - working , assiduous , and peaceful , ruled by justice , and , above all , bound together in brotherly love .
In presence of such mode of life and such example , prejudice gave way , the tongue of malevolence was silenced , and the lying legends of ancient superstition little by little yielded to Christian truth .
60 .
At the time being , the condition of the working classes is the pressing question of the hour , and nothing can be of higher interest to all classes of the State than that it should be rightly and reasonably settled .
But it will be easy for Christian working men to solve it aright if they will form associations , choose wise guides , and follow on the path which with so much advantage to themselves and the common weal was trodden by their fathers before them .
Prejudice , it is true , is mighty , and so is the greed of money ; but if the sense of what is just and rightful be not deliberately stifled , their fellow citizens are sure to be won over to a kindly feeling towards men whom they see to be in earnest as regards their work and who prefer so unmistakably right dealing to mere lucre , and the sacredness of duty to every other consideration .
61 .
And further great advantage would result from the state of things
We are describing ; there would exist so much more ground for hope , and likelihood , even , of recalling to a sense of their duty those working men who have either given up their faith altogether , or whose lives are at variance with its precepts .
Such men feel in most cases that they have been fooled by empty promises and deceived by false pretexts .
They cannot but perceive that their grasping employers too often treat them with great inhumanity and hardly care for them outside the profit their labor brings ; and if they belong to any union , it is probably one in which there exists , instead of charity and love , that intestine strife which ever accompanies poverty when unresigned and unsustained by religion .
Broken in spirit and worn down in body , how many of them would gladly free themselves from such galling bondage !
But human respect , or the dread of starvation , makes them tremble to take the step .
To such as these Catholic associations are of incalculable service , by helping them out of their difficulties , inviting them to companionship and receiving the returning wanderers to a haven where they may securely find repose .
62 . We have now laid before you , venerable brethren , both who are the persons and what are the means whereby this most arduous question must be solved .
Every one should put his hand to the work which falls to his share , and that at once and straightway , lest the evil which is already so great become through delay absolutely beyond remedy .
Those who rule the commonwealths should avail themselves of the laws and institutions of the country ; masters and wealthy owners must be mindful of their duty ; the working class , whose interests are at stake , should make every lawful and proper effort ; and since religion alone , as We said at the beginning , can avail to destroy the evil at its root , all men should rest persuaded that main thing needful is to re-establish Christian morals , apart from which all the plans and devices of the wisest will prove of little avail .
63 .
In regard to the Church , her cooperation will never be found lacking , be the time or the occasion what it may ; and she will intervene with all the greater effect in proportion as her liberty of action is the more unfettered .
Let this be carefully taken to heart by those whose office it is to safeguard the public welfare .
Every minister of holy religion must bring to the struggle the full energy of his mind and all his power of endurance .
Moved by your authority , venerable brethren , and quickened by your example , they should never cease to urge upon men of every class , upon the high - placed as well as the lowly , the Gospel doctrines of Christian life ; by every means in their power they must strive to secure the good of the people ; and above all must earnestly cherish in themselves , and try to arouse in others , charity , the mistress and the queen of virtues .
For , the happy results we all long for must be chiefly brought about by the plenteous outpouring of charity ; of that true Christian charity which is the fulfilling of the whole Gospel law , which is always ready to sacrifice itself for others ' sake , and is man 's surest antidote against worldly pride and immoderate love of self ; that charity whose office is described and whose Godlike features are outlined by the Apostle St. Paul in these words : " Charity is patient , is kind , . . . seeketh not her own , . . . suffereth all things , . . . endureth all things . " ( 41 )
64 .
On each of you , venerable brethren , and on your clergy and people , as an earnest of God 's mercy and a mark of Our affection , we lovingly in the Lord bestow the apostolic benediction .
Given at St. Peter 's in Rome , the fifteenth day of May , 1891 , the fourteenth year of Our pontificate .

Relevance is pleased to be able to introduce you to RunCodeRun – a hosted continuous integration service for Ruby and Rails projects .
We 've been working on it for a few months now , and have been in a private beta mode , but as of today we 've reached a major milestone .
Today , anybody can surf to RunCodeRun and browse all the open source projects that have been building there and view their build histories .
We are also happy to announce that we are going to be sponsoring Rails Rumble by providing hosted continuous integration for interested teams .
We 'll have several team members providing support over the weekend and helping to make sure any test - driven Rumble teams can keep their projects happy and green .
We 'll have more details on the Rumble partnership at the RunCodeRun blog .
h2 . Why a hosted continuous integration service ?
We , like just about everybody else on Planet Ruby , are ga - ga for GitHub .
Social source control has been a major factor in open source for a long time , but GitHub really elevated the game .
It makes setting up source control for your project dead simple , and eliminates the front - end IT pain of managing a project .
That still leaves continuous integration , the back - end IT pain , up to the team .
We want CI to be as automatic , and as easy , as source control , and the way to do that is a hosted solution .
If GitHub enables easy sharing and collaboration , RunCodeRun will enable easy builds and quality metrics to find out which projects to depend on and which to pass over .

Deflationary Economic Depression ?
Where to go from here ?
In September two significant events happened that will mark the month as the most financially significant in US history by far
1. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were nationalized ; this was no surprise as I predicted in November 2007 : http://www.goldmau.com..
If left to their own devices by the government , Fannie and Freddie are doomed .
At this juncture , the Fed has no choice but to redeem any and all mortgages at near face value directly , through GSEs , or offshore vehicles .
2. Lehman Brothers went under .
While I have said all major US banks ( including Citibank , and JPMorgan ) , brokerages ( including Goldman Sachs ) , and big finance companies ( AIG , GE , GM , etc ) are insolvent , I did n't expect that Lehman would be allowed to go under .
Paulson clearly did n't understand Lehman 's involvement .
Lehman is a leveraged brokerage shop that was the counterparty to trades sized in the $ hundreds of billions , including interest rate swaps , commodity futures , corporate bonds , international equities and real estate loans , currency swaps , and private equities .
The counterparty risk created fear and triggered domino selling .
Banks refused to lend to one another fearing the other end to be infested with Lehman 's positions .
Insiders claim that it could take over a decade to fully unwind Lehman 's positions .
What 's more , Lehman was one of the largest prime brokers to international hedge funds .
Lehman 's bankruptcy immediately caused wholesale panic within the hedge fund industry as funds tried to close / transfer / pull their money out of their Lehman custodian .
Today over $ 60 billion is still locked up in Lehman 's London brokerage unit .
Given the leveraging nature of hedge funds , the effect on global equity markets was catastrophic as trillions of dollars were wiped off global equity markets .
Global equity and commodity correction
With $ hundreds of billions - worth of positions that need to be closed fast , we witnessed the most dramatic equity downturn outside of 1930 and 1987 .
Russian markets went down 70 % and Nikkei , the world 's second - largest equity index , is down 30 % since September 1 .
Given that consumer spending accounts for 50 - 70 % of GDP across various countries , the equity downturn caused spending pullback and thus global recession talk abounds .
I believe this sudden downturn had more to do with Lehman 's derivative positions and hedge funds having locked up than it did with fundamentals .
For example , demand for Oil and Copper had never slacked yet Oil and Copper prices were cut by half in 4 months .
Inventory levels remained near historic lows and there was no projected slowdown in commodity demand from China , the world 's largest consumer .
In the financial arena , Chinese , Asian , Middle Eastern , and Latin American banks had minimal exposure to US subprime debt or to the collapse of US banks .
The debt level of the Asian consumer , the key driver to the next phase of global growth , remains low .
Commodity Sector
Charts speak more than words .
Coeur D'Alene , world 's largest silver producer , is down to 90 cents from $ 5 in 2008 .
Newmont , world 's best known gold producer , is down to $ 28 from $ 55 in 2008 .
Teck Cominco , Canada 's largest mining conglomerate , is down to $ 15 from a high of $ 53 in 2008 .
The S&P TSX Ventures Index , a proxy to the junior resource sector , is down 70 % to 900 , from a high of 3,000 in 2008 .
Junior sector and resource funds
In September and October , 2 prominent resource funds closed : Ospraie and RAB .
Both combined controlled over $ 3 billion in the resource junior sector .
They literally owned 10 - 20 % of the market and positions had to be sold .
We saw classic margin - call selling .
Prices of stocks were down 10 % on consecutive days with small breaks in between and no rebounds .
Many companies soon traded 10 % , then 20 % , then up to 50 % below their bank cash balances .
The situation clearly became irrational .
Premier gold and silver producers such as Coeur D'Alene and IAMGold were down 50 - 70 % in 2 months .
Where to go from here ?
As of October 20 , the junior market looks to have stabilized and I am convinced the correction for quality companies will not last long ( i.e. 6 months , less than one year for sure ) .
This is much like the Nasdaq in 2001 .
Bad companies will go under , while good companies will survive and flourish .
With central banks recently pledging over $ 2 trillion to solve the crisis , a $ 750 billion bailout , more consumer stimulus , a federal deficit set to blow over $ 1 trillion , a continued US trade imbalance , a gigantic $ 10 trillion foreign reserve that is mostly yet to be diversified , and the central banks ' inability to raise rates to combat inflationary pressure , I am more bullish on gold and gold equities than ever .
Severe shortages of gold and silver at the retail level across the globe validate my belief that the supply of precious metals is dwindling fast at current prices .
Reports from top
Swiss vaults state they have " topped up " their metal storage space with no more capacity to spare .
There is talk of a deflationary depression , but my view strongly differs .
Firstly , the money supply is exploding so prices will trend up after a brief scare .
Secondly , on a global scale , the modernization of Asia and the Middle East is far from over with US $ 4 trillion at their disposal .
Regardless of the long term picture on gold , when things are selling at 50 cents on the dollar as some stocks are , a brief rebound should see a recovery back to at least cash value .
Whenever there is a crisis there is an opportunity .

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the award recognised his analysis of trade patterns and where economic activity takes place .
It said Prof Krugman , 55 , who teaches at Princeton University , had formulated new theories that answered questions about free trade and globalisation .
Prof Krugman said he hoped the $ 1.4 m win would not change his life greatly .
" The prize will enhance visibility but I hope it does not lead me into going to a lot of purely celebratory events , aside from the Nobel presentation itself , " he said .

Prof Krugman lectures in economics and international affairs at Princeton University in New Jersey , and also writes a regular column for the New York Times .
He has long been a fierce critic of US President George W Bush 's administration , arguing that its economic policies have helped spark the current financial crisis .
The Nobel jury said Prof Krugman 's work had led to theories that could help explain the effects of free trade and globalisation and the driving force behind worldwide urbanisation .
' Terrified '
" He has thereby integrated the previously disparate research fields of international trade and economic geography , " the academy said in its citation .
Prof Krugman 's approach was based on the concept known as economies of scale - that many goods and services can be produced at less cost in long series , the citation said .
His research had showed the effects of that on trade patterns and on the location of economic activity , it added .
Speaking after the announcement of his win , Prof Krugman gave his verdict on current efforts to stem the global financial meltdown , saying : " I 'm slightly less terrified today than I was on Friday .
" We are now witnessing a crisis that is as severe as the crisis that hit Asia in the 90s .
This crisis bears some resemblance to the Great Depression , " he said .
Prof Krugman 's award is the last of six Nobel prizes announced this year .
It is not one of the original Nobels , having been created in 1968 by the Swedish central bank in memory of Alfred Nobel .

Prime Minister Stephen Harper waves to supporters in Calgary early Wednesday after his party was re-elected to form another minority government .
(( Chris Wattie / Canadian Press ) )
Canadians have entrusted the Conservatives with a strengthened mandate at a time of economic uncertainty and the party " will deliver , " Prime Minister Stephen Harper said early Wednesday following his party 's minority victory in the federal election .
The result of Tuesday 's national vote gives Canadians their third consecutive minority goverment , and is also likely to trigger further speculation over the future of Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion .

Throughout the campaign , Harper refused to speak of a potential majority , but repeatedly asked Canadians to give his party a " strong mandate " in the face of growing economic uncertainty .
" Canadians have voted to move our country forward and they have done so with confidence , " Harper told a rally of supporters in Calgary .
The prime minister also praised his Liberal rival for his many years of public service and appealed to all other parties in Parliament to join together with his government to protect the economy .
" Canadians are worried right now , and I understand those worries , but I want to assure Canadians that working together , we will weather this storm , " he said .
" We will position our economy to emerge stronger than before . "
As of early Wednesday with almost 60 per cent of votes counted , the Conservatives were elected or leading in 143 ridings , up from 127 in 2006 , while the Liberals were elected or leading in 77 , a drop of 18 seats since the last election .
The Bloc Québécois were leading or elected in 49 ridings , while the NDP were ahead or holding 37 seats , a gain of seven seats since the last election .
Two Independents also held on to their seats .
Dion vows to work with Tories on economy
Addressing supporters early Wednesday , Dion conceded defeat to Harper , while adding he had every intention of staying on as Opposition leader because Canadians have asked him " to carry the Liberal values . "
" The next few months will be crucial for our country , " he told supporters at his campaign headquarters in Montreal .
" It is clear that our economy , indeed the global economic crisis , is the most important issue facing our country at this time .…
We 'll work with the government to make sure Canadians are protected . "
' No party has a mandate ' : Layton

( ( Nathan Denette / Canadian Press ) )
Speaking in Toronto late Tuesday night , NDP Leader Jack Layton said the result of a second Conservative minority government means " no party has a mandate to implement an agenda without agreement from the other parties . "
While his party " did n't get the gold medal this time , " Layton said the NDP campaign was able to put the concerns of ordinary Canadians over the economy at the centre of political debate .
" That is what New Democrats do day in and day out and that is what we 're going to do in the next Parliament , " he told a crowd of cheering supporters .
" We 're going to put forward our agendas . "
The Tories ' fortunes were buoyed early in the evening by surprising gains in Atlantic Canada , especially in New Brunswick , despite the party being shut out in Newfoundland and Labrador .
Meanwhile in Ontario , returns suggested vote - splitting and a strong NDP showing were cutting into Liberal support in the party 's traditional heartland .
In British Columbia , Conservative candidates were elected in 22 ridings , a gain of five from 2006 , followed by the NDP with nine seats and the Liberals at five seats .
We blocked Harper majority : Duceppe

The Bloc jumped to an early lead in Quebec , but did not appear to shake the small gains the Tories made in the province in the 2006 election .
The Conservatives had been hoping for a breakthrough in the 75 - seat province , viewing it as a key component in their hopes to win a majority .
The Conservative government 's cuts to arts funding and Harper 's campaign pledge of tougher penalties for youths convicted of serious crimes were widely met with an outcry in Quebec and appeared to galvanize support for Bloc Leader Gilles Duceppe .
Speaking in Montreal , the Bloc leader told supporters the party achieved its objective .
" Without the Bloc Québécois tonight , Mr. Harper would have formed a majority government , " he said .
But the Tories ' only major casualty of the night in Quebec was Michael Fortier , who sparked controversy with his appointment to cabinet as an unelected senator in 2006 .
Fortier resigned from the Senate to run as an MP in the riding of Vaudreuil - Soulanges , but lost to Bloc incumbent Meili Faille .
Unlike Dion , who vowed he would not quit as leader after a Liberal loss , Harper said he would step down as leader if the Tories were defeated .
Harper 's Conservatives began the campaign with a huge financial advantage over the other parties and with polls suggesting they had the potential to win a majority in the House of Commons .
The Conservatives led the Liberals by as much as 17 points in early opinion polls .
But that lead shrank steadily , with the Liberals pulling within striking range of the Tories just over halfway through the 37 - day campaign amid a meltdown in the world 's financial markets sparked by the U.S. credit crisis .
May fails to gain seat for Greens
Voting results for the country 's 40th general election could not be publicized nationally until after the polls closed in British Columbia and the Yukon at 7 p.m. PT .
Green Leader Elizabeth May acknowledges supporters as she concedes defeat to Conservative incumbent Peter MacKay in the Nova Scotia riding of Central Nova . ( ( CBC ) ) Harper , Layton and Dion breezed to victories in their own ridings , but Green Leader Elizabeth May failed in her bid to unseat Conservative incumbent and Defence Minister Peter MacKay in the Nova Scotia riding of Central Nova .
In her concession speech , May said the Greens have run " the kind of campaign that other politicians could only dream of . "
" If the kids five years up could have voted , I would have won in a landslide , " she told a rowdy crowd of supporters at her campaign headquarters .
MacKay said the " highly unpopular " carbon tax proposal of the Liberals and the Greens was a factor in his victory because of the region 's heavy reliance on transportation .
" A lot of people were obviously concerned about the impact on their home heating oil and at their gas tanks and basically a hit on every single item that comes and leaves this province , " he told CBC News .
ABC spells shutout for Tories in N.L .
The first results came in from Newfoundland and Labrador , where voters appeared to heed Premier Danny Williams 's " Anything But Conservative " appeal by shutting out the Tories in the province .

( ( Sean Kilpatrick / Canadian Press ) )
Liberals were elected in six of the province 's seven ridings , while Jack Harris , a former MP and provincial NDP leader who was also Williams 's longtime law firm partner , was elected in a landslide for the New Democrats in St. John 's East .
Williams , a Progressive Conservative , began his " ABC " campaign in response to what he said was Harper 's broken promise to rearrange the equalization formula for his province to include offshore oil and gas revenues in the 2007 federal budget .
Fabian Manning , the Conservative incumbent in Avalon and the Tories ' last remaining hope in the province , lost his seat to the Liberals ' Scott Andrews .
Bill Casey , who was kicked out of the Conservative caucus for voting against the 2007 budget because of the changes , was re-elected as an Independent in Nova Scotia .
Google gaffes , galas and false starts
The often rancorous campaign was punctuated by several gaffes by party leaders , as well as the withdrawal of several candidates over past actions , writings and statements that emerged to haunt their political aspirations in the internet age .
Harper drew intense criticism for suggesting Canadians take advantage of " buying opportunities " in the stock market plunge , as well as saying " ordinary Canadians " could n't relate to artists complaining about a lack of funding while attending " rich galas " subsidized by taxpayers .
Dion , in turn , was embarrassed after a botched start of a television interview showed him struggling to understand a question on what the Liberal leader would have done to help Canada 's economy if he were prime minister .
The Conservatives had campaigned on a series of what Harper described as modest , affordable proposals of tax reductions to benefit Canadians at a time of financial uncertainty .
The party also portrayed the spending pledges and proposed tax measures of the Liberals and New Democrats as dangerous and unrealistic .
Dion appealed to progressive voters — including NDP and Green supporters — to " go green , vote red " and back his party to form a government and prevent what he said was Harper 's " right - wing agenda . "
The Liberal leader faced blistering criticism from the Tories for his $ 15 - billion carbon tax proposal known as the Green Shift , which called for personal income - tax cuts paid for by a $ 10 - per - tonne levy on carbon fuels .
Ultimately , growing financial fears among Canadians over the global effects of the U.S. credit market meltdown pushed the economy to the centre stage of the campaign .
The four opposition leaders accused the previous Conservative government of mismanaging Canada 's economy amid massive job losses in Central Canada 's manufacturing industry , and they asserted the Tories had no plan to deal with the current financial turmoil .
As Canadians watched the effects of the credit crisis spread globally and stock markets plummeted , Harper 's rivals portrayed the Conservative leader as callously indifferent to the concerns Canadians felt over their jobs and retirement savings .
Harper defended his government 's record of reducing the GST and paying down the national debt , while repeatedly saying the country 's overall economic stability could weather potential global difficulties .
Meanwhile Layton , portraying the New Democrats as the real alternative to the Tories , stepped up his criticism of Dion for the Liberals ' refusal to stand against the Harper government on dozens of confidence votes in the previous Parliament .
When the election was called in early September , the Conservatives held 127 seats , the Liberals had 95 , the Bloc Québécois held 48 , the NDP had 30 and the Greens had one ( B.C. Liberal - turned - Independent MP Blair Wilson joined the Greens days before the election call ) .
Independents held three seats and another four seats were vacant .
Canada 's first minority government was in 1921 under Liberal MacKenzie King .
Then in the 1950s and 1960s , Canadians were governed by four minority governmnts in a row .
John Diefenbaker failed to get majorities in 1957 and 1962 .
Lester Pearson won the election in 1963 , but with a minority , and did the same in 1965 .
Pearson was the only Prime Minister so far never to head a majority government .
OTTAWA – Finance Minister Jim Flaherty says he 's still confident the federal government will run a surplus for the current fiscal year .
But like his boss , Prime Minister Stephen Harper , Flaherty is shying away from any predictions about the longer term .
Speaking Sunday on CTV's Question Period , Flaherty repeatedly refused to speculate about whether the Conservative government will be forced to run a deficit in the years to come .
" We 're on track for a modest surplus in this fiscal year , " he said .
" Going forward , we have to continue evaluating the information .
There 's a world economic slowdown going on .
There 's lots going on that we need to address and evaluate as we look forward into future years . "
Harper and Flaherty have been insisting for months – and did so again in the just - concluded election campaign – that Ottawa is in no danger of slipping into the red .
But the prime minister injected a new note of caution last week , limiting his no -deficit promise to the fiscal year that concludes next March .
" Others are speculating about future years , " said Harper .
" I think it would be premature to speculate on that . "
Flaherty maintained Sunday that the Canadian economic outlook remains better than that of most major industrialized countries .
He also repeated assurances that Canadian banks , because of closer regulation and tighter rules governing their capitalization , are better placed to weather the present crisis than their counterparts elsewhere .
He conceded that " we 're not an island , we get buffeted by what 's going on in other places , and we 're in the midst of this now . "
Nevertheless , he said the Canadian economy still has a chance to escape full - blown recession .
" I think it 's quite possible that Canada can ( avoid recession ) , " he said , pointing to a recent report by the International Monetary Fund that predicted small but positive growth of 1.2 per cent , the best among the G7 countries .
In his comments Sunday , Flaherty did n't put a precise figure on the " modest " surplus he envisions for fiscal 2008 - 09 .
In his last budget in February , he projected $ 2.3 billion for the current year and $ 1.3 billion for 2009 - 10 .
Others have been less optimistic , with some private - sector analysts predicting Ottawa is headed for a deficit of up to $ 10 billion in 2009 - 10 .
Government sources said last week the Tories are looking at a range of possible belt - tightening measures , including a public service hiring freeze .
They could also consider delaying some moves promised in the recent election , such as cuts in diesel fuel taxes , until later in the government 's mandate .
The possibility of running a deficit would be the " dead last option " considered by Harper and Flaherty , said one source .
The finance minister is planning to deliver a formal economic update to the new Parliament before the end of November .

Now that I 've done it , I think I could 've reassembled it with a replacement part , but only if I had kept thorough track of what went where .
Also , I totally stripped at least 3 screws in the process .
Overall , the inner workings were a bit more complex than I expected , but it was a nice linear process taking it apart .
Yes , I 'm serious about that being the last photo before the aperture stuck .
It 's the Arab - Islamic museum in Paris .
The apertures open and close to regulate the light inside .
It 's mostly just a cool dynamic thing to keep people interested , I think :

NASA 's Juno probe is seen orbiting Jupiter in an artist 's impression .
Juno will carry several instruments , including the Jovian Infra-Red Auroral Mapper ( JIRAM ) , which will probe the planet 's atmosphere and the auroras generated by interaction between the atmosphere and intense radiation trapped by the giant planet 's magnetic field .
The detailed structure of Jupiter 's atmosphere is key to understanding the processes that formed both our solar system , and planets around other stars .
Forgenerations , astronomers have argued over how the planets in our solar systemwere formed .
Today , most theories assume that planets were formed in a nebulaof gas and dust that condensed around what eventually became our sun , but thereis still great disagreement over details , particularly for gas giant planetslike Jupiter :
Did a small core form first around which each planet condensed , or did instability in the nebula cause pockets to collapse directly intoplanets ?
Eight yearsfrom now , if all goes as planned , a spacecraft will enter orbit around Jupiter that should provide insightinto planet formation .
Juno , the first solar - powered mission to the outer planets ( it will carry no nuclearmaterials ) , will be inserted into a polar orbit that will approach the gasgiant world much more closely than any previous mission .
It will carry severalinstruments intended to determine the structure of Jupiter 's atmosphere .
Among theseis the Jovian Infra-Red Auroral Mapper ( JIRAM ) , which will provide both imagesand spectra in the near infra-red of hot spots that are believed to provide awindow into Jupiter 's lower atmosphere .
Working in conjunction with a microwavesounding instrument , JIRAM should help determine the quantity of water in thelower atmosphere .
Togetherwith accurate maps of Jupiter ' sgravity field , which will be developed by observing how Juno 's orbit changesover time , this should settle once and for all whether the giant planet has asolid core , and how large it is .
That will provide a direct test for one of twocurrently popular theories of planet formation , which predicts that Jupitershould have a substantial core of many times the mass of the Earth .
JIRAM alsowill provide images of Jupiter 's aurora , which is similar to , but much morepowerful than , Earth 's familiar Northern Lights .
The auroraforms when gas in the upper atmosphere is ionized by streams of chargedparticles trapped by a planetary magnetic field .
Jupiter has the most powerfulmagnetic field of any planet in our solar system , and its auroral displays areso bright they have been seen using the Hubble Space Telescope .
JIRAM willprovide a close - up look at Jupiter 's aurora , which according to a recent paperpublished in the journal Astrobiology , " ... provides a model systemfor potentially observable phenomena associated with Jupiter - mass andsuper - Jupiter - mass bodies around nearby stars . "
JonathanLunine , a professor at the University of Arizona 's Lunar and PlanetaryLaboratory , is a member of the JIRAM research team , and has high hopes for theresults it will offer in conjunction with Juno 's other instruments : " Wewill obtain a detailed map of the Jovian gravity field , establishing once andfor all whether there 's a core .
Also , the oxygen and nitrogen abundances , onceaccurately established , provide a good test for determining the composition ofthe icy bodies that created Jupiter 's supersolar abundance — not directly tiedto the issue of whether core formation occurred but it will help us determineconditions where Jupiter formed . "
Lunine alsobelieves JIRAM will help scientists understand Earth 's Northern Lights : " Looking at aurora formed in a hydrogen vs. nitrogen - oxygen atmosphere , and with different particle sources ( from the Jovian magnetosphere ) , we cantest theories of auroral formation under conditions very different from onEarth . "
To meetthese goals , a team of scientists and engineers , who developed instruments forNASA 's Cassini and Dawn missions and ESA 's Rosettaand Venus Express missions , built what amounts to two instruments in one : atwo - dimensional imaging detector that works like a digital camera , and aseparate grating spectrometer , which functions like a prism , breaking light upinto a spectrum .
Both the imager and spectrometer share a common focal plane , looking through a single telescope .
The designers faced a unique challengebecause Juno is designed to spin , which could smear images .
In JIRAM , acompensating mirror will be used that rotates in the opposite direction to thespacecraft , giving the imager a stable picture for at least part of eachrotation cycle .
DevelopingJIRAM was complicated by U.S. International Traffic in Arms ( ITAR ) regulations , which require an export license from the Department of State before foreignnationals can receive technical data about U.S. launch vehicles .
Dr. AlbertoAdriani of the Istituto di Fisica dello Spazio Interplanetario in Rome , Italy said : " Not being Americans , we JIRAMs had to work in quite difficultconditions where the flow of information necessary for the instrumentdevelopment was very slow and sometime limited ....
In particular the conditionsin which JIRAM has to work were not well known :
The spacecraft thermalenvironment , expected radiation environment around Jupiter , and vibrationsduring launch — key elements for proper structural design — were all unknownto us in the beginning . "
To make progress while waiting for information tocome from the U.S. , Adriani and his colleagues assumed these factors would besimilar to those on previous missions — then modified their design whenJuno - specific data became available .
Juno isscheduled for launch in August 2011 , and should arrive at Jupiter 61 monthslater .
The U.S. economy has sunk into a recession and government action is critical to stem the damage , according to economists in the latest Wall Street Journal forecasting survey .
" We 're in the middle of a very dark tunnel , " said Brian Fabbri of BNP Paribas , referring to the worsening credit crunch .
" Each day we see another crack in the system . "
Those ...
One thing is for certain , the global financial system is an extremely complex and tightly coupled system that is in the throes of non-linear feedback loops that threaten to rend it limb from limb .
Small and slow inputs , like the bailout bill ( $ 700 billion ) or the ad hoc actions of the Federal Reserve ( already $ 1.8 trillion and climbing ) , from the government control system are not even in the ballpark of what 's necessary to mitigate the system 's excesses and return it to normal operation .
One solution : Nuke entire parts of the system .
In short , destroy the system 's network connectivity .
For example , credit default swaps ensure that failure will spread through internetworked contracts .
Nuke CDS derivatives ( $ 60 trillion or so ) by making them illegal .
Destroy parts of the network in order to save the remainder -- firewalls and firebreaks .

He calls himself Robin Bank and acts as the self - appointed avenger of downtrodden loan defaulters and all poor victims of the global financial meltdown .
Like his hero Robin Hood , Spanish outlaw Enric Duran steals from the rich and gives , if not to the poor , at least to the activist groups who are sworn enemies of the banking system .
Yesterday Duran circulated 200,000 copies of a single - issue free newspaper called Crisis to show how he had spent the past two years fooling banks into lending him nearly half a million euros ( about £ 395,000 ) .
He said he had given it all away to social activists or spent it on the newspaper .
He is refusing to pay the money back and daring the banks to get him sent to jail .
" If we include interest on arrears the present amount of debt is over € 500,000 , which I will not pay , " he said .
As Duran , 32 , went into hiding , copies of the newspaper were being handed out by friends and relatives to commuters at dozens of metro and railway stations in his home city of Barcelona .
Friends said he had fled the country earlier this week .
News of his exploits caught Spain 's high street banks , consumer finance houses and building societies by surprise .
They were busy yesterday checking their loan portfolios to see whether Duran was on the list .
He has provided a list of all the 39 banks he took loans from .
They include one bank , Cetelem , that gave him five loans .
The police and the local attorney general 's office said they had not yet started looking for Duran as they were waiting for one of the banks to lodge a formal request for him to be found .
Duran said he had raised the loans partly by setting up a false television production company .
He paid back some of the early loans to ensure he had a good credit rating but stopped paying them all earlier this year .
He had started out by getting personal loans but eventually used a company name to avoid being placed on a list of bad debtors .
A small businesses office of the regional Catalan government unwittingly helped him raise at least one of the loans , according to reports yesterday .
Most of the money had been donated to social activism groups .
" What could be better than robbing the ones who rob us and distributing the money among the groups which are denouncing this situation and building alternatives ? " he asked .
Bankers reacted angrily .
" It is not permissible for someone to laugh [ at the system ] like this , " Jordi Mestre , director general of the Caixa Sabadell savings bank , told the Europa Press news agency .
Other banks said they would have no trouble writing off the lost money .
" Even if it is confirmed that he took € 31,000 , it wo n't mean anything to us , " said a spokesman for Bankinter .
Duran posted a video interview of himself on the internet yesterday .
" It has been an individual disobedience action against banking that I have carried out to denounce the banking system , " he said .
" Banks need to grant loans because that is the main way for them to get profits .
It is a wheel that will not stop until the system comes to a standstill .
As individuals , instead of helping the wheel to roll by asking for loans we have the opportunity and responsibility of making things difficult for this system . "
The social activist could face a prison term of up to six years if convicted .
" When I started this action I was already prepared for that possibility , " he said .
For example , when the black job candidate is highly qualified , there is no discrimination .
Yet in a more muddled gray area where reasonable people could disagree , unconscious discrimination plays a major role .
Image Nicholas D. Kristof Credit ... Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
White participants recommend hiring a white applicant with borderline qualifications 76 percent of the time , while recommending an identically qualified black applicant only 45 percent of the time .
John Dovidio , a psychologist at Yale University who has conducted this study over many years , noted that conscious prejudice as measured in surveys has declined over time .
But unconscious discrimination  what psychologists call aversive racism  has stayed fairly constant .
“ In the U.S. , there ’s a small percentage of people who in nationwide surveys say they wo n’t vote for a qualified black presidential candidate , ” Professor Dovidio said .
“ But a bigger factor is the aversive racists , those who do n’t think that they ’re racist . ”
Faced with a complex decision , he said , aversive racists feel doubts about a black person that they do n’t feel about an identical white .
“ These doubts tend to be attributed not to the person ’s race  because that would be racism  but deflected to other areas that can be talked about , such as lack of experience , ” he added .
Of course , there are perfectly legitimate reasons to be against a particular black candidate , Mr. Obama included .
Opposition to Mr. Obama is no more evidence of racism than opposition to Mr. McCain is evidence of discrimination against the elderly or against war veterans .
And at times , Mr. Obama ’s race helps him : it underscores his message of change , it appeals to some whites as a demonstration of their open - mindedness , and it wins him overwhelming black votes and turnout .
Still , a huge array of research suggests that 50 percent or more of whites have unconscious biases that sometimes lead to racial discrimination .
( Blacks have their own unconscious biases , surprisingly often against blacks as well . )

One Week Left !
Just one week left in this campaign and the energy is infectious !
Our modest little office is now filled with volunteers on a daily basis , making phone calls and knocking on doors .
Ever since Early Voting began a couple weeks ago , our operations are surprisingly smooth and streamlined , despite the records we break on a daily basis .
The enthusiasm of our volunteers and interns keeps rising , and Karl Rove ’s new attack ad only motivates our staff to work even harder .
News articles are written about our plucky campaign on a daily basis and the Sacramento Bee visited us last Saturday .
Our campaign office was packed with volunteers and interns , many of whom had no idea that it would be such a momentous occasion .
Dr. Bera delivered another stirring speech to get our volunteers fired up and ready to go !
One Week Left !
Today was my birthday and I could not imagine a better way to celebrate than spending a fulfilling day in our campaign office .
I am not joking .
It is a core life principle of mine to make an impact on the world and every day I spend here on the campaign , I feel like I am contributing to a greater cause that could have incredible ramifications on our country .
15 hours a day goes by pretty quickly and there is nothing to complain about because I know that every vote counts .
Every volunteer or intern that I can recruit to our office will be responsible for getting many more votes for Dr. Ami Bera and it is this multiplying effect that attracted me towards the field campaign .
I used to be an apathetic , cynical non-voter who believed that my sole vote meant nothing .
However , when I realized that I could be responsible for getting many more votes through my active involvement , I knew it was important for me to assume a leadership role .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill immediately blamed each other for the failure of a $ 700 billion bailout package in the House on Monday .
House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said there would be no revote Monday on the bill aimed at buying up bad mortgages and stabilizing the faltering economy because House members had left the Capitol .
It was unclear in what form the congressional leadership would bring the bill back to the House floor .
The stock market immediately dipped hundreds of points after it became apparent that the bill would fail .
The Dow closed down 777 points at the end of trading Monday , a record plunge .
Watch blocked bailout win or loss ? »
The package , which was backed by both the Democratic and Republican congressional leadership as well as President Bush , failed in the House by a vote of 228-205 .
See roll call of how House members voted ( PDF )
" My sense is that this exact same bill could n't pass , " said Missouri Rep. Roy Blunt , the No. 2 Republican in the House .
" But this bill could be the basis for final congressional action .
They 'd have to expect some changes . "
Nearly 60 percent of Democrats voted for the bill , and about a third of Republicans supported it .
House Republican leaders blamed Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic Speaker of the House , for the bill 's failure , saying she had scuttled a bipartisan compromise with a " partisan speech " shortly before the vote .
Pelosi started her speech by citing " the Bush administration 's failed economic policies -- policies built on budgetary recklessness , on an anything - goes mentality with no regulation , no supervision and no discipline in the system . "
" I do believe that the vote could have succeeded , " Boehner said in a news conference .
" But the speaker had to give a partisan speech ... that poisoned our caucus . "
Rep. Steny Hoyer , the No. 2 Democrat in the House , rejected the Republicans ' accusation as " absurd . "
Rep. Barney Frank , the House Democrats ' main negotiator on the package , called the Republicans ' finger pointing an excuse .
" Because somebody hurt their feelings , they decided to punish the country ? "
Frank said .
" I do n't believe they had the votes .
They are covering up the fact that they do n't have the votes . "
Rep. Michele Bachmann , a Minnesota Republican , denied that the bill 's opponents had voted against it because of hurt feelings .
" I want to assure you that is not the case .
We are not babies , sucking our thumbs , " she said .
" Clearly it is important to get it done quickly , but it is more important to get it done correctly , " said Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas .
After the vote , President Bush was " disappointed " that the House failed to pass the bailout , saying , " We put forward a plan that was big because we got a big problem .

" Our strategy is to continue to address this economic situation head on .
We 'll be working to develop a strategy , " Bush said .
Bush is scheduled to speak on the bailout plan Tuesday at 8:45 a.m. at the White House .
The Senate had planned to take up the bill after the House had passed it , but now it is unclear how the senators will proceed .
" Democrats are doing our part to improve the administration 's flawed plan , but we will need the support of more Republicans to get this done , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , said in a statement .
" With the stock market recording its largest point drop ever in the aftermath of this vote , it has never been more clear how important it is to put politics aside and come together to stabilize our economy for all Americans , " Reid said .
" I hope House Republicans will reconsider their vote and decide to put country first . "
After the House vote , Sen . Mitch McConnell , the Republican leader in the Senate , said lawmakers were " going to stay here until we get this job done , " but he admitted he could not say how to push a package through .
" No action is not an answer , " McConnell said .
The House will not be in session Tuesday and Wednesday , but behind - the - scenes work will continue until it reconvenes Thursday .
Sen . Judd Gregg , the lead Republican Senate negotiator on the deal , said there would be real consequences if Congress did not approve legislation .

" If we do n't act ... a lot of people are going to lose their jobs , " he said .
When the gavel came down , the members on the House floor were nearly silent .
Democratic members immediately met in Pelosi 's office after the vote .
Republican members went into the office of Boehner , the top Republican in the House .
While thanking Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson for negotiating on the bill , Pelosi said on the House floor that the Democrats had insisted that the bill " protect the American people and Main Street from the meltdown on Wall Street . "
After the vote , Boehner said , " Americans are angry , and so are my colleagues .
They do n't want to have to vote for a bill like this , and I understand that . "
Watch Boehner blame Pelosi »
" I think that we need to renew our efforts to find a solution that Congress can support .
I do believe that we could have gotten there today had it not been for this partisan speech that the speaker gave on the floor of the House , " he said .
But Democrats dismissed the Republican complaints , saying the Republican leadership failed to persuade their members to support the bill .
" They lost 2 - 1 on their own side , voting against their president , their presidential candidate and against every leader in their own party , " one Democratic source said .
Pelosi said the Democrats lived up their side of the bargain .
" We 've entered into those conversations in a spirit of bipartisanship , with the understanding that each side would have half of our votes to pass the bill , " she said .
Watch a Wall Street trader say they need the bill »
" When the legislation came to the floor , the Democratic side more than lived up to its side of the bargain , " she added .
" While the legislation may have failed , the crisis is still with us . "
Watch Pelosi say the Democrats delivered »
Rep. Barney Frank , a Massachusetts Democrat who was a key negotiator of the bill , said Republican leaders were blaming Pelosi because they were embarrassed that they failed to get a majority of the Republicans to vote for the bill .
Watch Frank say the GOP ' punished ' the country »
" There 's a terrible crisis affecting the American economy .
We have come together on a bill to alleviate the crisis , " Frank said .
" And because somebody hurt their feelings , they decide to punish the country ?
I mean , I would not have imputed that degree of pettiness and hypersensitivity . "
Before the vote , many House Republicans expressed opposition to the bill , saying it departed from free - market principles .
Republican congressional aides also said calls from constituents were running 10 to 1 against the legislation .
" The relevant test is , when you look at the good in the bill , when you look at the bad in the bill -- does it take America in a direction that you believe America should go ? " said Rep. Jeb Hensarling , a conservative Texas Republican , before the vote .
" By that test , Madam Speaker , I will vote no on this legislation .
" I fear that ultimately it may not work .
I fear that it is too much bailout and not enough work out .
I fear that taxpayers may end up inheriting the mother of all debts , " he added .
Another Republican called on members to vote their conscience .
" Ask yourselves why you came here and vote with courage and integrity to those principles .
If , like me , you came here because you believe in limited government and the freedom of the American marketplace , I urge you vote in accordance with your convictions , " Rep. Mike Pence , R - Indiana , said .
" Stand up for limited government and economic freedom .
Stand up for the American taxpayer .
Reject this bailout and vote no on the emergency economic stabilization act , " he said .

Exclusive : U.S. Expects Bin Laden Message Near Election Analysts : OBL could speak out in an attempt to prove his relevance .
Oct. 30 , 2008  --
Multiple senior government officials tell ABC
News the intelligence community is anticipating a message from Osama bin Laden before or just after the presidential election .
As we race toward Election Day , sources say a number of intelligence analysts have concluded it is critical for al Qaeda 's top leader to be seen or heard , if only for public relations purposes .
Those analysts believe that if bin Laden is not heard from , he runs the risk of being considered irrelevant or impotent .
The U.S. intelligence community has some indication that there is some confusion among Islamic radicals about their leadership .
According to sources , the full weight of the intelligence electronic eavesdropping and human sourcing is right now desperately looking for any hint of a bin Laden statement .
So far there is only rumor , no hard evidence a message is coming , officials said .
Interestingly , the U.S. government may be the reason why bin Laden could have some problems getting a message out , officials suggested to ABC News .
The United States is engaged in an intensive effort to disrupt the use of the Internet by Islamic radicals .
Message boards and Web sites have been targeted .
Some officials believe that if bin Laden is not heard from , some will conclude he may be dead .
Another source cautioned against such speculation , suggesting that bin Laden is most concerned about his own safety at the moment , and might increasingly fear for his life .
The sources tell ABC News the U.S. government is quietly engaged in a high - tempo moment attacking al Qaeda and Taliban leaders in the tribal regions of Pakistan , where U.S. officials fear the terrorists have found a safe haven from which to stage plots against Afghanistan , Pakistan and throughout the world , including the West .
A review of published reports about drone attacks in the tribal region suggests the United States may have more than tripled the number this year , compared to 2007 , especially in recent months .
One official tells ABC News , " We have killed a lot of senior leaders .
They [ radicals ] are having a really bad month . "
Another source agreed , noting that in recent weeks the No. 4 ranking leader in all of al Qaeda had been killed in a drone attack .
The source said the hit , which was reported in The New York Times , was a huge deal and was surprised it had not gotten more play .
The game plan is simple , the officials said .
Keep al Qaeda off balance and scrambling .
There had been growing fears , not based on any specific intelligence , that al Qaeda has been likely plotting to attack the United States before the election , or during the transition to a new presidency .
Homeland security officials are calling it a Period of Heightened Alert , or POHA , which ABC News first reported in last summer .
Sources confirm that there is an intensive effort all across the U.S. government to play offense .
As of now , there is still no specific , credible evidence pointing to an imminent attack on the U.S. homeland .
But that 's clearly not stopping the government from being incredibly active at what it sees as a critical moment .
In 2004 , bin Laden released a message in the days just before the election .
Though some believe that the message affected the outcome in favor of President Bush , exit poll data do not support that notion .
Among voters who called the tape " very important " in their vote , Kerry won , 53 - 47 percent .
Among those who called it either very or somewhat important , the vote was 50 - 50 .
It was among those who called it unimportant that Bush won , by 56 - 43 percent .

I got a look much like that when I was staying at Brad's .
I left the house in the morning through the garage and crossed over to the other side of the street where reception is better for some reason , then looked back at the house and fumbled with my phone a bit to close the door .
A guy who was waiting by a car on the sidewalk looked like he was about to ask about it but then he got into his car and drove away .
The weird thing is that it seems that phone - controlled doors are n't that unusual .
The apartment block I 'm in right now has a phone - accessible door control that I can in theory call and press 9 to open the door , though they use caller - id as the access control and I 've not told them my number so I 've not tried it out .
I think the intended way to use it is for the door to call you and you to let other people in , but according to the instructions it works both ways .
Toronto police patrolled a midtown area overnight , after vandals cut brake lines on at least 10 cars parked at homes with Liberal election signs on their lawns .
" We 're investigating .
Officers are paying special attention to the designated area and we take this very seriously , " Staff - Sgt.
Shawn Meloche , from 53 Division , said last night .
" This is a danger to life as well as to property .
Regardless of the motivation – and there appears to be a connection ( to the signs ) – this is a public safety issue . "
Affected residents live in the riding of St. Paul's , in a swath of the city around Eglinton Ave. between Bathurst St. and Mount Pleasant Rd. , and had Carolyn Bennett signs on their property .
Although Meloche confirmed 10 cases of vandalism last night , Liberal riding headquarters said the number was going up , reporting 14 by 9 p.m .
The cars were also damaged in other ways ; some were scratched and keyed with L signs .
Phone and cable lines of some homes were cut .
" There are two child seats in the back of my car , " said Andrew Lane , chief financial officer for Bennett 's campaign .
" To cut the brake line on a car like that is just evil .
Awful . "
Added Lane , whose children are 6 months and 22 months : " You have to crawl under someone 's car and cut the brake line , knowing that it could kill someone , or their whole family . "
Lane discovered his brakes did n't work on his silver Saturn View as he tried to pull up at a stop sign near his home yesterday .
He kept slamming the brakes and , in a " moment of terror , " narrowly avoided slamming into a bus .
Later , the garage called to tell him it had been no accident .
When Lane expressed disbelief , the mechanic told him : " Look , this is a big , heavy rubber hose and it's been cut through with a very sharp knife .
You should phone the police . "
Police later said Lane was not alone and asked if he had an election sign , telling him , " The Carolyn Bennett sign seems to be the one thing linking events . "
" I 'm just sick to my stomach about this , " a shaken Bennett told the Toronto Star last night .
She spent the day visiting the vandals ' victims .
" It is so upsetting .
I 've spent my life encouraging people to get involved in the democratic process and now it would appear they are targeted for doing so . "
Brent Johnston , former chief fundraiser for the provincial Liberals , was backing his Volkswagen Golf slowly out of his driveway when alarms went off .
He then discovered brake fluid in his driveway .
When he called Volkswagen , they told him he was n't the first to call , and to check his car for damage .
He , too , has two young children and shudders to think what might have happened if he had driven the car with a cut brake line .
" This is n't about party politics .
Putting people 's lives at risk is a whole different thing , " said Johnston .
" We 're not taking the sign down .
We wo n't be intimidated .
But I am really disappointed this is happening in Canada .
It 's beyond comprehension . "
Bennett 's staff worked the phones last night at riding headquarters , advising many of the 900 - plus people with elections signs that they could be at risk .
" Most people want to leave the signs up , " said Bennett .
" They do n't want to let the terrorists get away with this .
They do n't want to let them win . "
Campaign manager Lynne Steele said there was other vandalism in the riding , including houses defaced with the words " McGuinty lies " and " B. Rae lies . "
However , reports of cut brake lines did n't begin to come in until yesterday morning .

A DRINK which claims to give smokers the same rush as a cigarette is on the way to Britain .
Liquid Smoking , which comes in a red and white can resembling a fag packet , contains 15 per cent nicotine .
And the makers claim it could offer a way around smoking bans .
However , campaigners fear the drink , launched a year ago in Holland , could encourage people to light up .
Deborah Arnott , of Action on Smoking and Health , said : " Our concern would be if the packaging led to the promotion of cigarettes . "
But Martin Hartman , of the Dutch suppliers insisted their drink could make life easier for smokers .
He said : " We 've got a product that has the same effects as nicotine but which you can drink in restaurants and on flights . "
On the firm 's website , they insist smokers desperate for a quick puff would be better off reaching for Liquid Smoking .
They say : " No smoke in the eyes or tar in the blood - just a natural feeling of well - being . "
COLUMBIA , Mo. -
Without eyes or ears , plants must rely on the interaction of molecules to determine appropriate mating partners and avoid inbreeding .
In a new study , University of Missouri researchers have identified pollen proteins that may contribute to the signaling processes that determine if a plant accepts or rejects individual pollen grains for reproduction .
Like humans , the mating game is n't always easy for plants .
Plants rely on external factors such as wind and animals to bring them potential mates in the form of pollen grains .
When pollen grains arrive , an introduction occurs through a " conversation " between the pollen ( the male part of the flower ) and the pistil ( the female part of the flower ) .
In this conversation , molecules take the place of words and allow the pollen to identify itself to the pistil .
Listening in on this molecular conversation may provide ways to control the spread of transgenes from genetically - modified crops to wild relatives , offer better ways to control fertilization between cross species , and lead to a more efficient way of growing fruit trees .
" Unlike an animal 's visual cues about mate selection , a plant 's mate recognition takes place on a molecular level , " said Bruce McClure , associate director of the Christopher S. Bond Life Sciences Center and researcher in the MU Interdisciplinary Plant Group and Division of Biochemistry .
" The pollen must , in some way , announce to the pistil its identity , and the pistil must interpret this identity .
To do this , proteins from the pollen and proteins from the pistil interact ; this determines the acceptance or rejection of individual pollen grains . "
In the study , researchers used two specific pistil proteins , NaTTS and 120 K , as " bait " to see what pollen proteins would bind to them .
These two pistil proteins were used because they directly influence the growth of pollen down the pistil to the ovary where fertilization takes place .
Three proteins , S - RNase - binding protein ( SBP1 ) , the protein NaPCCP and an enzyme , bound to the pistil proteins .
This action suggests that these proteins likely contribute to the signaling processes that affect the success of pollen growth .
" Our experiment was like putting one side of a Velcro strip on two pistil proteins and then screening a collection of pollen proteins to see which of the pollen proteins have the complementary Velcro strip for binding , " McClure said .
" If it sticks , it 's a good indication that the pollen proteins work with the pistil proteins to determine the success of reproduction . "
In previous studies , McClure showed that S - RNase , a protein on the pistil side , caused rejection of pollen from close relatives by acting as a cytotoxin , or a toxic substance , in the pollen tube .
For their study , the MU team used Nicotiana alata , a relative of tobacco commonly grown in home gardens as " flowering tobacco . "
The study , " Pollen Proteins Bind to the C - Terminal Domain of Nicotiana Alata Pistil Arabinogalactan Proteins , " was published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry and was co-authored by McClure ; Kirby N. Swatek , biochemistry graduate student ; and Christopher B. Lee , post - doctoral researcher at the Bond Life Sciences Center .
###
Faculty from six of MU 's colleges and schools perform interdisciplinary research in the Christopher S. Bond Life Sciences Center with a vision to become a recognized world - wide center of scientific excellence and leadership in life sciences research , innovation and education .
The Center integrates the strengths of multiple , often disparate , disciplines to promote discovery that boosts the production and quality of food , improves human and animal health and enhances environmental quality .
The Center enriches the state of Missouri and its people by generating new businesses and jobs , fueling the economy through the creation and dissemination of new knowledge , and training young people to solve complex interdisciplinary problems .

The government should not be building predictive data - mining programs systems that attempt to figure out who among millions is a terrorist , a privacy and terrorism commission funded by Homeland Security reported Tuesday .
The commission found that the technology would not work and the inevitable mistakes would be un-American .
The committee , created by the National Research Council in 2005 , also expressed doubts about the effectiveness of technology designed to decide from afar whether a person had terrorist intents , saying false positives could quickly lead to privacy invasions .
" Automated identification of terrorists through data mining ( or any other known methodology ) is neither feasible as an objective nor desirable as a goal of technology development efforts , " the report found .
" Even in well - managed programs , such tools are likely to return significant rates of false positives , especially if the tools are highly automated . "
The 376 - page report – entitled " Protecting Individual Privacy in the Struggle Against Terrorists " – comes as a rebuke to the Bush administration 's attempts to use high - tech surveillance and data - sifting tools to prevent another terrorist attack inside the United States .
Most memorable of these was the Total Information Awareness project , which wanted to search every possible database – from credit card records to veterinary records – to spot terrorists before they acted .
The controversial program was largely shuttered by Congress , but its central dream and secret progeny live on inside the government 's anti-terrorism agencies .
In particular , the report continually stresses need for the government to follow the law – a none - too - subtle reference to the government 's secret warrantless wiretapping of Americans ' communications .
The committee was comprised of a number of technical and policy experts from government contractors , tech firms and academia .
The group 's official name was the Committee on Technical and Privacy Dimensions of Information for Terrorism Prevention and Other National Goals .
The committee reiterated that the government should have useful tools to fight terrorism , but that they must be useful and respect Americans ' privacy .
To help make such decisions , the committee laid out a step - by - step framework for how government agencies should develop new programs or expand old ones , relying on traditional information privacy concepts that include telling people when and why data is collected , limiting how it is shared and allowing them to correct or challenge inaccurate data .
At the report 's unveiling in Washington , D.C. , Tuesday , co-chair Charles Vest – the president of the National Academy of Engineering – made it clear the committee was not dismissing the threat terrorism poses to us physically and as a nation .
" Terrorists can damage our country and way of life in two ways : through physical , psychological damage and through our own inappropriate response to that threat , " Vest said in opening remarks ( .mp3 ) .
His co-chair former defense secretary William Perry opened by noting that the subject of data mining and privacy was controversial , even within the government and the panel .
He also noted that the report was not an evaluation of any classified program .
Indiana University Professor Fred Cate – who authored much of the report – said the framework came down to two basic questions : whether the program worked and how invasive was it .
The report also suggested that the next administration and Congress look closely at current privacy law which is currently largely a hodgepodge of laws that cover e-mail , video records and government databases – to see how to update the law to keep up with changes in technology .
For example , if the government had a database of who shops at Macy's , and then used that to look up people by name , the database would be covered the the Privacy Act , which limits how it can be used and lets people find out what the government 's databases say about them .
But if the database were only searched with patterns – show me all the people who spend more than $ 1,000 a week on clothes – the database would not be covered by the Privacy Act .

The British team that claimed the land speed record in 1997 , taking a car through the sound barrier for the first time , is planning to go even faster .
RAF pilot Andy Green made history in 1997 when he drove the Thrust SSC jet - powered vehicle at 763 mph ( 1,228 km / h ) .
Now he intends to get behind the wheel of a car that is capable of reaching 1,000 mph ( 1,610 km / h ) .
Known as Bloodhound , the new car will be powered by a rocket bolted to a Eurofighter - Typhoon jet engine .
The team - members have been working on the concept for the past 18 months and expect to be ready to make their new record attempt in 2011 .
Bloodhound project leader Richard Noble told BBC News : " This is one of the most exciting things you can do on God 's Earth ; and when you 've the opportunity to do it really , really well , with the latest technology , you can't resist the challenge . "
The consequences if we do n't inspire the next generation are that we will wither as a country
Lord Drayson
UK science minister
The initial studies have illustrated just how grand a challenge it will be .
The 12.8 m - long , 6.4 - tonne Bloodhound SSC ( Super Sonic Car ) will be expected to travel faster than a bullet fired from a handgun .
Its 900 mm - diameter wheels will spin so fast they will have to be made from a high - grade titanium to prevent them from flying apart .
The car will accelerate from 0 - 1,050 mph ( 1,690 km /h ) in just 40 seconds ; and at its maximum velocity , the pressure of air bearing down on its carbon fibre and titanium bodywork will exceed 12 tonnes per square metre .
BLOODHOUND SSC 1 .
Titanium or composite wheels - rear wheels sit outside bodywork , front wheels are steerable to comply with land speed rules
2. Driver sits behind front wheels and in front of engine air intake duct
3. Carbon fibre and titanium bodywork for optimum aerodynamic performance , reaching top speed over 4.5 miles .
Same distance required for stopping
4. Bloodhound powered by Eurofighter jet engine with hybrid rocket attached , enabling car to accelerate from 0 - 1,050 mph in 40 seconds
5 . Fins maintain stability and downforce to keep car on the ground
6 . Deployable aerostructures slow car at highest speeds ; parachutes slow car at mid-speeds ; finally , driver halts car with carbon fibre brakes
" This is a big engineering adventure , " commented Bloodhound 's technical chief , John Piper .
" We 've not seen anything yet which we can't overcome given the opportunity and the time .
We do n't have all the answers yet , but we have quite a few of them , and I 'm sure other solutions will present themselves . "
Thrust SSC broke the sound barrier when it claimed the record Wing Commander Green acknowledges there will be risks involved but says the car will be designed to maximise his safety .
" Does that make it zero -risk ?
No .
Is life with zero -risk interesting ?
No .
" This is worth making a risk for because it 's a huge challenge and a huge prize at the end , not just for the biggest record but to inspire the next generation of engineers , to share it with every schoolchild in the country , " he said .
Inspiration is a key driver for the project .
The genesis of the idea came from Lord Drayson , the UK's new science minister who also happens to be a racing driver .
He approached Noble and Green when he held a post in the Ministry of Defence to ask them if they could do something that would grab the attention of schoolchildren and turn them to careers in science and technology .
" The consequences if we do n't inspire the next generation are that we will wither as a country , " Lord Drayson told BBC News .

" Over the centuries , we 've been involved in some of the most important scientific discoveries .
The Brits are good at science .
We have got to make sure the next generation gets the vision , and has the opportunity to maintain that tradition . "
As a consequence , a schools programme will be built around the project that aims to involve young people at every stage in the designing and building of the car .
The team 's HQ in Filton , Bristol - the " home of Concorde " - will have a schools visitor centre featuring the " classroom of the future " .
Richard Noble added : " Our industries are starved of engineers .
There are real problems on the education front ; and , of course , what we 've got now is the environmental challenge coming up .
" There are a vast number of new products that are needed , and Britain simply is n't going to play unless we have the engineers . "
Lord Drayson 's role has also ensured one key element of Bloodhound has been made available to the project team : the EJ200 jet engine .
The Ministry of Defence is lending the team engines that were used in the flight development programme for the Typhoon .
These test engines are beyond combat use but have more than sufficient working time left in them to power Bloodhound .
The EJ200 will produce about 20,000 lbs of thrust ( 90 kilonewtons ) and will sit underneath a hybrid rocket engine that produces about 25,000 lbs of thrust ( 110kN )
The rocket will provide most of the power to get Bloodhound close to the speed of sound ( Mach 1 ) ; the Typhoon engine will enable Andy Green to throttle up to the target speed of 1,000 mph ( Mach 1.4 ) .
The rocket engine will be on or off ; the EJ200 can be throttled up and down
Apart from the not - insubstantial in - kind support of the MoD in the loan of the EJ200s , Bloodhound is a private project that will need to raise some £ 10 m in financing .
Parallel to the design effort , a location for the record attempt is being sought .
Thrust SSC broke the sound barrier in the Black Rock desert in Nevada , US .
It is known that a number of other teams are also planning an assault on Thrust SSC 's mark .
" There are three cars out there right now with varying degrees of credibility and at various stages of advancement , " said Andy Green .
" The competition for what we 're doing is a very important part of it . "
The initial design office for Bloodhound is based at the University of the West of England , where a full - scale mock - up of the supersonic car will be built shortly .
Swansea University is also a key early sponsor of the project , assisting in aerodynamics research .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Top U.S. financial officials emerged from a briefing with congressional leaders Thursday night with an agreement to work quickly toward a broad - ranging fix for the crisis roiling U.S. and world financial markets .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke briefed House and Senate leaders to hash out a solution to the massive downturn in global markets and the failure of several financial firms .
Treasury spokeswoman Brookly McLaughlin said in a prepared statement that Paulson , Bernanke and congressional leaders " began a discussion ... on a comprehensive approach to address the illiquid assets on bank balance sheets that are ... the underlying source of the current stresses in our financial institutions and financial markets . "
The talks are expected to continue through the weekend , McLaughlin said .
She offered no additional details .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , said lawmakers could receive a detailed proposal from the Treasury and Fed within a matter of hours .
" We look forward to working closely with Congress to resolve this financial crisis and get our economy moving again , " Bernanke said following the meeting .
" We 're coming together to work for an expeditious solution , which is aimed right at the heart of this problem , which is illiquid assets on financial institutions ' balance sheets , " Paulson told reporters .
At issue is a proposal to create a new government entity that could take bad assets off of banks ' and financial firms ' balance sheets and sell them at auction , according to published reports .
The online edition of The Wall Street Journal , citing unnamed sources , reported that Treasury officials have been studying the creation of such an entity for weeks , " but have been reluctant to ask Congress for such authority unless they were certain it could get approved . "
The Journal reported that the entity would not mirror the Resolution Trust Corp. , which was created to address the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s .
Rather than hold and sell the assets of failed banks as the RTC did , the new entity would " purchase assets at a steep discount from solvent financial institutions and then eventually sell them back into the market " through an auction , the Journal reported .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % closed 410 points higher Thursday on talk of a fix being hammered out in Washington .
Separately , the Securities and Exchange Commission intends to temporarily ban short - selling , the Journal reported Thursday night .
It 's unclear if the commission has approved the move , the Journal reported .
SEC Chairman Christopher Cox attended the meeting on Capitol Hill Thursday .
The U.S. move would follow action by Britain 's financial regulator , the Financial Services Authority , which banned short selling in financial stocks on Thursday .
Meanwhile , presidential candidates Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama laid out their own plans , with McCain calling for Cox 's firing .
Cox responded with a 10 - point list of accomplishments to rebut McCain 's charge that Cox 's agency has been " asleep at the switch . "
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , earlier Thursday called for the creation of a new agency that would give capital to struggling financial companies in exchange for an equity stake in banks and also require banks to permit the refinancing of mortgage loans on primary residences .
" The Federal Reserve and the Treasury are realizing that we need a more comprehensive solution , " Schumer said .
' One of the worst crises in recent memory '
Meanwhile , Democratic congressional leaders left the door open Thursday to legislative action before the end of the year to address the crisis on Wall Street , Congressional Quarterly reported .
Reid said Thursday that , " We are going to work any time it 's necessary , " CQ reported .
House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank , D - Mass. , also says Congress must consider whether a new entity is needed to take over troubled assets as the financial system reels from one of the worst crises in recent memory .
In the past week , a number of extraordinary developments stemming from the ongoing credit crisis have hammered financial markets .
Last Monday , the federal government was compelled to seize control of lending giants Fannie Mae FNM , and Freddie Mac FRE , - 0.64 % .
The government agreed to invest up to $ 100 billion in each firm to keep them solvent , and to run them indefinitely .
Venerable brokerage Lehman Bros. LEH , then went into bankruptcy proceedings over the weekend , before agreeing to sell its stock - trading , underwriting and merger businesses to Barclays PLC .
See related story .
On Monday , fellow troubled Wall Street giant Merrill Lynch & Co. MER , +27.69 % hastily agreed to be sold off to Bank of America BAC , - 1.32 % in an all stock deal worth $ 50 billion .
See related story .
And on Tuesday , the government seized control of floundering insurance giant American International Group AIG , - 1.23 % with an $ 85 billion loan that granted it a roughly 80 % stake .
The reeling financial markets have also brought out a flurry of proposals from Obama and McCain , who are competing in a tight race for the White House .
With Election
Day less than two months away , Obama is proposing a law that would inject capital into the financial system , provide liquidity to the markets and help families restructure their burdensome mortgages .
McCain is calling for a Mortgage and Financial Institutions trust , similar to the Resolution Trust Corp. created after the savings and loan scandals of the early 1990s to regulate the industry .
See full story .
A small group of House Republicans , meanwhile , is urging the Fed and the Treasury against bailing out any more companies , saying the government 's rescue of AIG and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac raises concern about taxpayer risk .
Wardens who set dogs on inmates , an inmate being held under administrative detention for 10 years , and serious flaws in prison medical care are only some of the conclusions of an investigation conducted by the Israel Bar at Hadarim Detention Center and Hasharon Prison .

What the world does n’t see
The investigation , summed up in a report by attorneys Amnon Zikhroni and Michael Atiya , probed the
The report stipulates that in many cases inmates are subjected to unprovoked and whimsical chastisement by the prison guards , and presents charges of assault made by several inmates against the wardens .
Some of them claim the guards responsible for moving them to different venues unleash dogs upon them , humiliate and debase them , and later file unfounded charges against them in order to justify their actions .
One of the more serious cases reported is that of a prisoner named Mohammad Azaan , who has been held for the past 10 years under administrative arrest without trial or indictment .
Azaan traveled to Afghanistan in the ' 80s and was arrested upon returning .
Since then Azaan has been held under the condition that another country accept him .
Aside from the guards ' attitude towards them , the inmates also complained of their conditions , claiming that in many cases their medical care was delayed to the point of death .
They also claim their cells are not properly ventilated or adequately lighted .
In the women's ward the situation is direr , as their infants are sometimes placed in cramped and crowded conditions .
The report 's findings were transferred to the Attorney General 's Office , the Israeli Prison Service , and the Internal Security Ministry .
Attorney Yuri Guy Ron , who heads the Israeli Bar , said the investigation is of paramount importance to maintaining prison conditions .
" This report expresses the significance of allowing professional and objective representatives of the Israeli Bar to visit the prisons and insist the prisoners be held under humane conditions , " Ron said .
In March I wrote a post titled IE8 : The Bad , since then a new beta of Internet Explorer has been released .
It still seems a bit dubious whether they are actually committing to standards .
This could be a communication issue or actually intended .
It is mostly unclear to me .
XDomainRequest : Microsoft unfortunately continues with XDomainRequest rather than making changes to XMLHttpRequest as other browsers are doing and as is being standardized by the W3C Web Apps Working Group .
( Disclaimer : I am the editor of XMLHttpRequest Level 2 . )
Some agreement was made to at least support the same protocol on the server , namely using the Access - Control - Allow - Origin header as per Access Control for Cross - Site Requests .
( Disclaimer : I am the editor of that draft too . )
However , IE8 only supports * as value for that header , not an origin , e.g .
http://annevankesteren.nl ( test ) .
Sunava pointed out that was because the W3C WebApps WG was still debating the matter .
Here is hoping they will fix the bug as there is agreement on that syntax .
HTML5 DOM Storage : localStorage and sessionStorage are now supported .
Enumerating through them does not give the results I was expecting ( I got " length " and " remaining Space " back as well , besides the keys ) and they still have a remaining Space member that is not part of HTML5 .
Given that anything that gives some indication of space is highly vendor specific as it depends on encoding , compression , and type of device , they should really rename it to msRemainingSpace or some such or simply drop it .
IE8 also supports an event named storagecommit that is not part of HTML5 which tells you when the data has been written to an XML backend format IE8 uses .
The event object for used for the storage does not expose key , oldValue , and newValue .
The url member is named uri and the source member is null rather than a reference to the Window object .
Ouch !

Just a year after the first outing , Philips has updated its Aurea TV offering with a new model aptly named the Aurea 2 .
For those unaware , the premise of the Aurea TV is that rather than just shine light out the back of the TV using the company ’s Ambilight technology , light shines from the frame itself towards you .
The technology , according to Philips , will reduce the strain on your eyes , make the picture look better and be a pleasant experience all round ( geddit ? ) .
So what ’s new ?
Following on from the first generation set , Philips has refined the television design and frame .
Now instead of a big hunk of plastic surrounding the television , the “ light frame ” is made from a single sheet of glass .
This as you can imagine gives a much better finish and something that will be , most likely , more in keeping with your décor .
The frame also takes on the new Philips television styling that means it ’s further surrounded ( framed ) in a clear plastic shell .
It ’s a nice design aesthetic that also doubles up to pump the sound in your general direction – an invisible speaker so to speak .
Coming in a 42 - inch screen size the glass frame makes the overall television akin to a 47 - inch model and it ’s something to bear in mind when you measure the space it ’s going to go in .
Designed to be wall mounted ( a stand does come in the box ) the Aurea is unlike other televisions in that you really should wall mount it to benefit from the light bouncing off the wall .
That ’s not to say you ca n’t shove it in a corner covered in flock wallpaper , but you just wo n’t get a decent effect .
In fact if you are hoping to get the most out of the television ’s Ambilight technology you need to not only mount it on the wall , but make sure that wall is white .
So now you ’ve redecorated your lounge to fit around your television what about the picture quality ?
The Aurea uses the new 2008 Philips 9000 series panel that first started appearing in televisions from Philips from around February .
The results we saw then and now have carried through to this model and are very impressive with motion blurring and jaggedness kept to a minimum and blacks well reproduced .
The television sports the latest version of Philips Perfect Pixel HD engine and this means the television is doing plenty to clean up the image regardless of the source .
Obviously the better the source the better the picture but on the range of DVD , Blu-ray , HD DVD , Sky HD and standard definition content we tested the Aurea on , the technology worked well to enhance and improve the image quality .
Annoyingly the over - compensation technology we noticed on the first version of the Aurea is still here and you can get halo effects around people ’s heads as presumably the technologies try and do the best to clean the image .
This , though , is infrequent and something that you ’ll notice now and then if you look out for it rather than something that hinders every frame .
Better still this can be turned down to avoid it happening .
On the resolution front you get 1080 p giving you the magic “ Full HD ” buzzword and the screen operates at 100 Hz with a 2 ms response time ( down from 3 ms last time around ) for an enhanced viewing experience , removing blurry images in real time .
The contrast ratio is 30,000:1 .
Those looking to connect their HD world to the set will be pleased to see the set includes four HDMI ( up from three ) sockets .
Three can be found at the back of the unit with one on the side so you can connect a camcorder or other device without having to fiddle blind around the back .
The Aurea is now also DLNA compatible meaning you can browse PC and home network content from other DLNA devices like the Samsung i8510 .

Ladies and Gentlemen ,
I propose to demonstrate that in accordance with Constitutional Law the Senate of the United States of America did tonight perpetrate an unlawful and illegal act to abrogate the right of citizens of the United States to vote as guaranteed in Article 15 Clause I of the Constitution .
The Congress has revealed itself , our Constitution cannot be interpreted , as it took over ten years to pass and is written in the plain language which can be amended but not abridged .
Currently , the United States Senators who voted yes to an amendment of House Resolution 1424 defeated in the house , never sent to the Senate , and overwhelmingly not approved by the constituency is an act of authority made " Under Color of Law " , a crime against the country â€ œUnder Color of Representative Authorityâ€  not condoned in title 42 and publishable as a treasonous offense and any such law is null and of no effect .
In accordance with Article I Section no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by law under Article I Section 9 of the Constitution .
Unless they have the appropriation in hand an identified they cannot draw from the Treasury .
Additionally , each member of the Senate voting yes on this alleged Bill did in fact , with full knowledge execute an illegal act under " Color of Law "  to pass as piece of revenue legislation by amendment with full knowledge that the Bill had been defeated in the House of Representatives just two days earlier .
They have complete legal understanding that only a Bill that has been properly submitted by first receiving a majority of votes in the House of Representatives could be amended and passed by the Senate .
This unbelievable act of the Senate even attempts to circumvent Article I Section 7 of the Constitution , the " Origination Clause . "
Further , the yeah votes " Under Color of Representation " denied and deprived the American citizen of constitutional rights under the 14th Amendment Section 1 and the 19th Amendment Clause I which collectively protect all right reserved to the citizens and rights not to be denied or abridged which are guaranteed under Article 9 of the Constitution .
These in the Congress of the United States are bound by oath under Article 6 to support the Constitution and any act not supported in the constitution is a felony lawfully considered void and of no effect .
However , we can see the silver lining in this egregious act of lawlessness .
These criminals in the Senate who signed to pass this bill have a responsibility to understand the procedural requirements necessary to pass such an amendment .
House Resolution 1424 is an Amendment .
Clearly it is labeled as an amendment .
Constitutional procedure dictates that you can Amend a Bill that has been passed ..
You can not Amend a Bill which failed to pass and was therefore not properly submitted .
These people have declared themselves as traitors before God and the Citizens of this country .
They have attempted to sell out this country to the public corporations by assuming their private debt without the consent of the Citizens of this country .
Article 15 Section 1 of the Constitution states : " The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude . "
The rights of the !
citizens of this country to vote on this issue has clearly been abridged by this egregious act of the Senate .
To further state my interpretation of this act of the Senate , I refer to Amendment 14 Section 4 of the Constitution : " The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law shall not be questioned .
But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States , or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave ; but all such debts , obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void . "
I ask each of you to send this information to your representatives so that they can understand that their constituents will not tolerate this unlawful act and will seek to unseat every single Senator who voted to pass this fraudulent bill .

" Step 11 : Bill Referred to Other Chamber
Bill approved by one " chamber " of Congress ( House or Senate ) are now sent to the other chamber where they will follow pretty much the same track of committee to debate to vote .

Engrossment and Message to the Senate ||
THE PREPARATION OF A COPY OF THE BILL IN THE FORM IN WHICH IT HAS PASSED the House can be a detailed and complicated process because of the large number and complexity of amendments to some bills adopted by the House .
Frequently , these amendments are offered during a spirited debate with little or no prior formal preparation .
The amendment may be for the purpose of inserting new language , substituting different words for those set out in the bill , or deleting portions of the bill .
It is not unusual to have more than 100 amendments adopted , including those proposed by the committee at the time the bill is reported and those offered from the floor during the consideration of the bill in the Chamber .
In some cases , amendments offered from the floor are written in longhand .
Each amendment must be inserted in precisely the proper place in the bill , with the spelling and punctuation exactly as it was adopted by the House .
It is extremely important that the Senate receive a copy of the bill in the precise form in which it has passed the House .
The preparation of such a copy is the function of the enrolling clerk .
In the House , the enrolling clerk is under the Clerk of the House .
In the Senate , the enrolling clerk is under the Secretary of the Senate .
The enrolling clerk receives all the papers relating to the bill , including the official Clerk 's copy of the bill as reported by the standing committee and each amendment adopted by the House .
From this material , the enrolling clerk prepares the engrossed copy of the bill as passed , containing all the amendments agreed to by the House .
AT THIS POINT , THE MEASURE CEASES TECHNICALLY TO BE CALLED A BILL AND IS TERMED " AN ACT " SIGNIFYING THAT IT IS THE ACT OF ONE BODY OF THE CONGRESS , ALTHOUGH IT IS STILL POPULARLY REFERRED TO AS A BILL .
The engrossed bill is printed on blue paper and is signed by the Clerk of the House .
Bills may also originate in the Senate with certain exceptions .
For a discussion of bills originating in the Senate , see Part XVI .
http://thomas.loc.gov/home/lawsmade.bysec/engrossment.html
|| XVI .
Bill Originating in Senate ||
The preceding discussion has described the legislative process for bills originating in the House .
When a bill originates in the Senate , this process is reversed .
When the Senate passes a bill that originated in the Senate , it is sent to the House for consideration unless it is held by unanimous consent to become a vehicle for a similar House bill if and when passed by the House .
The Senate bill is referred to the appropriate House committee for consideration or held at the Speaker 's table at the Speaker 's discretion for possible amendment following action on a companion House bill .
If the committee reports the bill to the full House and if the bill is passed by the House without amendment , it is ready for enrollment .
If the House passes an amended version of the Senate bill , the bill is returned to the Senate for action on the House amendments .
The Senate may agree to the amendments or request a conference to resolve the disagreement over the House amendments or may further amend the House amendments .
In accordance with the Constitution , the Senate cannot originate revenue measures .
By tradition , the House also originates general appropriation bills .
IF THE SENATE DOES ORIGINATE A REVENUE MEASURE EITHER AS A SENATE BILL OR AN AMENDMENT TO A NON - REVENUE HOUSE BILL , it can be returned to the Senate by a vote of the House as an infringement of the constitutional prerogative of the House .

Imagine watching the international company you run fall apart .
Now imagine you 've got to work double time to keep the company from destroying the global economy because you 've involved your company in many businesses around the world .
Everyday you wake up and the newspaper is hammering your boneheaded decisions .
Meanwhile CNBC has ten people on the screen at once talking about your failures .
Finally , you go hat in hand to the government who reluctantly gives you the money you need to protect the world against the mess you made .
Ugh , feels stressful just thinking about it .
Afterwards , you probably want " Me " time to recuperate , correct ?
Okay , good .
Now that you 've been through what the AIG execs have been through , we hope you wo n't judge them too harshly :
ABC : Less than a week after the federal government committed $ 85 billion to bail out AIG , executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week - long retreat at a luxury resort and spa , the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach , California , Congressional investigators revealed today .
...AIG documents obtained by Waxman 's investigators show the company paid more than $ 440,000 for the retreat , including nearly $ 200,000 for rooms , $ 150,000 for meals and $ 23,000 in spa charges .
" Less than one week after the taxpayers rescued AIG , company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation , " said Waxman as he prepared to question AIG executives .

John McCain has the backing of many older Cuban exiles in Miami In the Maximo Gomez domino park , on the corner of 8th Street and 14th Avenue in Miami , time appears to have slowed down to the pace of endless domino games .
Old men shuffle their tiles and play for hours , day after day , a routine that punctuates a life in exile for Cuban immigrants still waiting for change back home .
As they smoke their cigars , they talk of the embargo on Cuba and their plans to vote for Republican presidential candidate John McCain .
There is unanimous support here for the Republican Party , which has long backed the Cuban exile community and its calls for a continued tough line with Havana .
This has been the dominant view for five decades on Calle Ocho , where thousands of Cubans started their life in exile , where Cuban music blares from loudspeakers outside shops and cafes still serve strong coffee Cuban - style , with sweet condensed milk .
Less obsessed
But the street is changing , as is the Cuban - American community .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
It is no longer the bustling hub it once was .
Many Cubans have moved on and moved up , to the wealthy suburbs of Miami .
Their children and grandchildren do not bear the scars of life under Fidel Castro - they are less obsessed with Cuba , and more focused instead on their future in America .
Hispanics from all over Latin America have also converged here , altering the dynamics in the area and - crucially - the voting patterns .
It all adds a great element of surprise in what has for decades been a place of traditional politics .
This election will be the test - it will depend on how energised the vote is for Obama and how energised young voters are
Miriam Marquez , Miami Herald editor
" The Republican party that I knew and loved has left me behind , so this year I 'm voting for change , I 'm voting for Barack Obama , " said 60 - year - old Carlos Saladrigas .
It is a dramatic change of heart for him .
As he played in his lush garden with his grandchild , along with his daughter - in law and wife , Mr Saladrigas said Cuba remained part of his family 's " fibre " and its heritage , even if his children were now as " American as apple pie " .
They still dream of going back home one day - on a chair in their living room a cushion is embroidered with the words " El ano proximo en Havana " ( " Next year in Havana " ) .
But Mr Saladrigas , who came here when he was 12 with $ 3 in his pocket , no longer believes that the policy of isolation is the way to make this dream happen - and he says he is not the only one .
" Everywhere you go , in cocktail parties and people you meet , people open up and say this policy has n't worked , " he told me .
" You do n't have to be very smart to figure out that after 50 years of trying something that has n't worked , maybe it 's time to try something new . "
' One - trick ponies '
And that is why , for the first time in many years , Republican Cuban - Americans are having to fight for their seats in Congress .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mario Diaz Balart , a member of a political dynasty that has dominated Cuban politics in Miami for decades , is being challenged by Joe Garcia , a Cuban - American Democrat .
Mr Diaz Balart 's brother , Lincoln , another Republican congressman in Florida , is also fighting for his seat .
Mr Garcia claims the Diaz Balart brothers are " one trick ponies " who are focused on Cuba all the time .
" While Cuba is important and we have to work for the liberty of Cuba , that 's not what 's going to take care of my daughter 's future and this community , " Mr Garcia told the BBC .
" I also have to work for jobs , healthcare , the economy , and our relations with Latin America have to be judged on more than just Cuba policy . "
The boisterous , curly - haired father - of - one finds himself boosted by a national surge of support for the Democratic Party and Barack Obama .
Barack Obama is gaining support from many voters for his economic policies
He is getting a lot of backing from young voters worried about the economy .
Some polls suggest Mr Garcia is in a dead - heat race with Mario Diaz Balart , something unthinkable just a few years ago .
But a breakdown of the polling figures also underlines that 60 % of Cuban - American voters are still likely support the Republican candidate .
" If the election were decided by Cuban - Americans alone , it would be an 80 % to 20 % race , but this is a diverse community , " said Mr Diaz Balart , who seemed unfazed by the competition he faces as he seeks a fourth two - year term in Congress .
In a clear swipe at Mr Obama , he said " some people " were willing to make unilateral concessions to the " terrorist regime in Cuba " , asking for nothing in return .
He believes that the majority of the Cuban - American community remains united in its demands for a tough line on Cuba .
Challenged with the idea that the 50 - year - long isolation policy had not succeeded , Mr Diaz Balart retorted that it had just not been applied successfully enough , because many other countries do do business with Cuba .
Travel ban
While there is a surge in talk about change and demands for a different approach to Cuba , no one is talking about lifting the embargo outright .
But even people like Francisco Hernandez , former president of the hard - line Cuban - American National Foundation ( CANF ) , say it is time to rethink the policy .
The US has imposed a trade embargo on Cuba for decades
The powerful CANF lobbied for years in Washington for tighter and tighter restrictions .
But Mr Hernandez feels the Bush administration missed an opportunity when Fidel Castro left the stage earlier this year , to be succeeded by his brother Raul .
In 2004 , President Bush tightened the travel ban for Cuban - Americans and limited the remittances they can send home .
Mr Hernandez wants the next president to lift these restrictions .
" Let the Cuban - Americans be the agents of the change that we want in Cuba , " said Mr Hernandez .
Mr Obama has said he would reverse the Bush administration 's policies .
Mr McCain has taken a hard line on Cuba during this campaign , although in his 2000 run for the White House , he talked of negotiating with Cuba .
But are Cuban - Americans really yearning for a different approach ?
There may be a lot of talk about change , but polls show that older Floridians are still more likely to vote than the younger generation , and they are sticking to their long - held Republican allegiance .
" This election will be the test - it will depend on how energised the vote is for Obama and how energised young voters are , " said Miami Herald editor Miriam Marquez .
" Historically , [ young people ] do n't vote in high numbers and when they do , they vote like their parents .
But this election will be based on getting out the vote and the younger generation will be the test . "
Alexandra Uriarte , a 21 - year - old volunteer with the Garcia campaign , says all her friends are getting ready to vote and , unlike their parents , they are voting for Joe Garcia and Mr Obama .
" It has a lot to do with the country we live in , the issues that we 're exposed to and how we rationalise what our country is doing for Cuba and the Cuban American community , " she said , adding that she and her friends were more concerned about the economy and their job prospects in the US than Cuba .
There is a feeling that whoever wins the US election , the approach to Havana will be reassessed .
But if Little Havana actually turns blue , it will visibly alter the most public face of US policy towards Cuba .

In contrast , military officials said , General Callan was able to review the scene of the airstrikes more extensively .
They said his team interviewed villagers , which the other military units had not done before , and examined new evidence , like cellphone videos and other images showing the bodies of women and children that were not available previously .
The report sticks to the military ’s assertion that the compound was a legitimate target , a finding that is likely to rekindle tensions with the government of President Hamid Karzai .
As a result of that finding , the report does not single out any individual for blame or recommend that any American troops be punished .
The report ’s general findings were described by two American military officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the report has not yet been made public , and Afghan officials have not yet been briefed on the matter .
In recent days , both General McKiernan and Lt. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey , the acting commander of the military ’s Central Command , who appointed General Callan on Sept. 9 to investigate the episode , have received briefings on the report ’s findings .
The New York Times on Sept. 8 described freshly dug graves , lists of the dead , and cellphone videos and other images showing bodies of women and children in the village mosque seen on a visit to Azizabad .
Cellphone images a Times reporter saw showed at least 11 dead children , some apparently with blast and concussion injuries , among some 30 to 40 bodies laid out in the mosque .

Afghan and United Nations officials backed this accounting of a higher civilian death toll , putting them in direct conflict with the American military ’s version of events .
In that account , American Special Forces troops and Afghan commandos called in airstrikes after they came under attack while approaching a compound in Azizabad , a village in the Shindand district of Herat Province .
Among the militants killed , the military said at the time , was a Taliban leader , Mullah Sadiq .
LONDON : The protective bubble around the sun that helps to shield the Earth from harmful interstellar radiation is shrinking and getting weaker , NASA scientists have discovered .
New data from the Ulysses deep - space probe show that the heliosphere , the protective shield of energy that surrounds our solar system , has weakened by 25 per cent over the past decade and is now at it lowest level since the space race began 50 years ago .
Scientists , baffled at what could be causing the barrier to shrink in this way , were set to launch a mission overnight to study the heliosphere .
Trees could be more important to the Earth 's climate than previously thought , according to a new study that reveals forests help to block out the sun .
Scientists in the UK and Germany have discovered that trees release a chemical that thickens clouds above them , which reflects more sunlight and so cools the Earth .
The research suggests that chopping down forests could accelerate global warming more than was thought , and that protecting existing trees could be one of the best ways to tackle the problem .
Dominick Spracklen , of the Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science at Leeds University , said : " We think this could have quite a significant effect .
You can think of forests as climate air conditioners . "
The scientists looked at chemicals called terpenes that are released from boreal forests across northern regions such as Canada , Scandinavia and Russia .
The chemicals give pine forests their distinctive smell , but their function has puzzled experts for years .
Some believe the trees release them to communicate , while others say they could offer protection from air pollution .
The team found the terpenes react in the air to form tiny particles called aerosols .
The particles help turn water vapour in the atmosphere into clouds .
Spracklen said the team 's computer models showed that the pine particles doubled the thickness of clouds some 1,000 m above the forests , and would reflect an extra 5 % sunlight back into space .
He said : " It might not sound a lot , but that is quite a strong cooling effect .
The climate is such a finely balanced system that we think this effect is large enough to reduce temperatures over quite large areas .
It gives us another reason to preserve forests . "
The research , which will be published in a special edition of the Royal Society journal Philosophical Transactions A , is the first to quantify the cooling effect of the released chemicals .
The scientists say the findings " must be included in climate models in order to make realistic predictions " .
Because trees release more terpenes in warmer weather , the discovery suggests that forests could act as a negative feedback on climate , to dampen future temperature rise .
The team looked at forests of mainly pine and spruce trees , but Spracklen said other trees also produce terpenes so the cooling effect should be found in other regions , including tropical rainforests .
Everything in our universe is made of matter , but a century of physics has revealed that at the beginning of time , an exactly equal amount of antimatter existed .
Then , two seconds after the Big Bang , something changed and suddenly there was more matter than antimatter .
What we do n't know is how matter won and opened the door to existence as we know it .
Now , in a former salt mine next door to a nuclear weapons waste repository , Stanford physicists are completing the installation of a new particle detector , the Enriched Xenon Observatory 200 , that they hope will provide the answer to that question .
" We 're in the land where the theorists can't really tell us what to expect , " said Jesse Wodin , a researcher at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Lab who is working on the EXO - 200 .
" No one has done this at this scale . "
When it 's fully installed next year , the EXO - 200 will be one of , if not the most , sensitive radiation detectors in the world .
Located inside the Department of Energy 's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad , New Mexico , the new underground lab will be tracking the behavior of neutrinos , mysterious particles that hardly interact with anything .
Though fundamental to our understanding of the universe , we know next to nothing about them .
The new detector will try to fill in the picture , determining basic features of the particles , like their mass and whether or not they , unlike almost all other particles , are their own antiparticles .
That quirk is why some scientists believe neutrinos could be the mechanism for the creation of our matter - filled universe .
Almost all other particles have an antiparticle twin that , if it comes into contact with the particle , immediately annihilates it .
But if neutrinos are their own antiparticles they could conceivably be knocked onto matter 's
" team , " thereby causing the cascading win for matter over antimatter that we know occurred .
As the Indian theoretical physcist G. Rajasekaran put it in a speech earlier this year , neutrinos that are their own antiparticles would explain " how , after
[ the ] annihilation of most of the particles with antiparticles , a finite but small residue of particles was left to make up the present Universe . "
But to test that theory , they 'll need to catch one of the rarest events predicted by particle physics , a particularly strange kind of radioactive decay of purified xenon .
Driven by faster computers , physicists have been able to build increasingly sophisticated detectors and analysis equipment .
They bury them underground to avoid interference from cosmic rays and other less exotic sources .
For decades , scientists have been building larger and larger particle detectors with greater and greater sensitivities .
But for exceedingly rare events , they run into some hard physical limits .
" If you had a single atom of Xenon 136 , you 'd have to wait 1025
years for it to have a reasonable probability of decaying , " Wodin said .
" That 's orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe ....
The only way to increase your odds of seeing it is to get a lot of atoms . "
Getting more atoms requires building bigger detectors .
The new experimental rig is composed of 200 kilograms of liquid xenon , made up of an almost unthinkable number of atoms of the noble gas .
It is the largest detector purpose - built for catching what scientists call double beta decay .
" You can imagine a big vat of liquid xenon , " said Wodin .
" This one atom goes and becomes a barium .
Basically , you want to have detected that process . "
There are two ways that the double beta decay can occur .
In the standard version , two electrons and two antineutrinos are sent hurtling out from an atom 's nucleus .
Scientists were only able to experimentally confirm that type of decay in 1986 , after decades of trying .
Now , the search has shifted to the more improbable , neutrinoless radioactive decay , wherein only the electrons are emitted .
That would only be possible if the two neutrinos that are normally emitted actually annihilate each other , which would confirm that neutrinos are their own antiparticles .
And with a neutrinoless beta decay observation in hand , the physicists could also determine the mass of the neutrino .
" You combine the results of regular beta decay and neutrinoless beta decay and basically do a kind of subtraction , and you can figure out what the mass is , " Wodin said .
Back in 2006 , some members of a team running an experiment called the Moscow - Heidelberg made a much - disputed announcement that they 'd witnessed the special type of decay , but their claim is not generally accepted within the particle physics community .
At its current size , the EXO - 200 team expects to have a shot at observing a few decay events per year .
To further increase their odds of catching neutrinoless decay , they are planning an even larger 1 - ton detector .
The main limiting factor had been finding a place that could purify xenon enough to avoid any bad data sneaking into their experiment .
To enrich their xenon to the experimental levels they wanted , the team had to reach out to our former Cold War opponents .
" We used money available from the U.S. government to keep former
Soviet weapons scientists busy , " Wodin said .
" This was a fantastic partnership .
We gave them our Xenon and they purified it to a single isotope .
That increases our sensitivity massively . "
That relationship , Wodin said , is a key advantage the team of Stanford researchers and their international collaborators has over their competitors in the search to figure out the neutrino 's fundamental properties like the fantastically named Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events in Italy , and the Germanium Detector Array and the Cadmium - Zinc - Telluride 0 - Neutrino Double Beta Research Apparatus in Germany .
And that 's important because with a prize as large as understanding how matter came to persist in the universe , the competition is intense .
" It 's basically at the top of the list in terms of rare decays , "
Wodin said .
" It 's certainly competition , but it 's also friendly and there 's a lot of information exchanged . "

And not surprisingly it comes from a Senate Republican who should have been coasting but now finds himself with a real chance losing his seat .
Last week , Sen. Mitch McConnell ( R ) squared off in a debate with Democratic challenger Bruce Lunsford .
But on Lunsford ’s podium a GOP operative had placed a small voice recorder , presumably to pick up some off - mic comments Lunsford might make — apparently a violation of the debate rules .
( The recorder itself — sans recording — was eventually returned . )
Now , from here the accounts differ .
According to the Lunsford campaign , Lunsford actually did n’t see the recorder .
But since it was nestled in among his papers it was included when he handed his papers off to his staffers after the debate — staffers who say they later erased the recording since it violated debate rules to have a planted recorder on the opponents podium .
According to the McConnell staffers , however , Lunsford did see the recorder during the debate and essentially confiscated it .
Richard St. Onge , II ( who , in a separate story , may have absconded with his name from some neo - gothic southern novel ) is the GOP operative who planted the recorder .
And according to St. Onge , when he went up to Lunsford after the debate to demand his recorder back , Lunsford said , “ No you wo n’t get it back . ”
And now St. Onge and the chairman of McConnell ’s campaign have filed a criminal complaint against Lunsford for petty larceny and destruction of property — because of the erasure .
Now , we ’re digging into this to get a clearer sense of what happened .
But I must say that even if you accept McConnell ’s version of events , is there really an affirmative responsibility to return your opponent ’s campaign bug after you discover it ?
Campaign ‘ trackers ’ with handcams have become a normal and I think generally benign part of modern campaigns .
But this seems a bit different .
Thoughts ?
Unsustainable practices cost the global fishing industry $ 50 billion every year , and have wasted some $ 2 trillion in the last three decades , says a joint report from the World Bank and United Nations .
The numbers might not seem like much when compared to the ongoing economic crisis or the cost of deforestation – $ 1.5 trillion lost from Wall Street in weeks , between $ 2 trillion and $ 5 trillion of forests cut down annually .
But the losses , calculated in terms of declining productivity , are a troubling warning sign .
Despite better equipment , larger fleets and ever - growing markets , the industry is catching the same amount of fish now as it did 30 years ago .
The reason : oceanic fish populations have been decimated .
Some researchers say that the world will run out of wild seafood within 40 years .
There will still be farm - raised fish — which now account for 50 percent of all fish production — but the $ 80 billion global fishing industry , which employs some 200 million people , will be as depleted as North Atlantic cod .
Speaking to the Victoria Times Colonist last month about the consumption of fish that were once considered waste , University of British Columbia fisheries director Daniel Pauly asked , " If we have to have substitutes for the substitutes and substitutes for the substitutes ' substitutes , when does it end ? "
He answered his own question : " It ends when we have nothing left . "

Why I like D language Time : 02:28 am
http://confusion.tweakblogs.net/blog/1141/an-example-of-why-i-like-python.html
/> During the past week , the Dutch alternative radiostation Kink FM aired the Kink 1300 : the top 1300 songs their listeners wanted to hear .
I was interested in finding the most popular bands in the list and wrote a small Python program to do just that . <
The list :
http://www.kinkfm.com/kink1300
My Python version without REs :
from collections import defaultdict bands2titles = defaultdict ( list ) for line in open ( " songs.txt " ) : band , title = line.split( " - " , 1 ) band = band.split( " . " , 1 ) [ 1].strip ( ) bands2titles[band].append(title.strip ( ) ) pairs = sorted ( bands2titles.iteritems ( ) , key=lambda ( b , t ) : ( - len ( t ) , b ) ) for band , titles in pairs : print len( titles ) , band + " : " , " , " .join ( sorted ( titles ) )
Python version with REs :
import re , collections bands2titles = collections.defaultdict( list ) for line in open ( " songs.txt " ) : artist , song = re.search ( " \d+\. (.+? ) - (.+ ) " , line ) .groups ( ) bands2titles[artist].append( song ) pairs = sorted ( bands2titles.iteritems ( ) , key=lambda ( b , t ) : ( - len ( t ) , b ) ) for band , titles in pairs : print len( titles ) , band + " : " , " , " .join ( sorted ( titles ) )
My D 1 version using my libs ( and Phobos ) , it 's quite similar to the Python version :
import d.all , std.regexp , std.string ; void main ( ) { string [ ] [ string ] aa ; foreach ( line ; xfile ( " songs.txt " ) ) { auto mobj = search ( line , r" \d +\. (.+? ) - (.+ ) " ) ; aa[ mobj.match ( 1 ) ] ~= mobj.match ( 2 ) ; } auto bands = sorted AA ( aa , ( string b , string [ ] t) {return record ( - len ( t ) , b ) ;} ) ; foreach ( b ; bands ) putr ( len ( aa[ b ] ) , " " , b , " : " , sorted ( aa [ b ] ) . join ( " , " ) ) ; } The D version uses xfile ( ) that yields the lines ( strings ) lazily , with newline .
search ( ) comes from the std.regexp .
sorted AA sorts with an associative array according to the given key function .
The given lambda uses record ( ) that builds a struct on the fly , inferring its fields , and it contains universal comparing , hashing , joining , etc , indexing , methods , it can be used almost as a Python tuple .
array.join ( ) comes from std.string .

I guess Palin ’s John Birch Society background should n’t surprise us .
From the Post …
Palin also made a point of mentioning that she loved to visit the “ pro-America ” areas of the country , of which North Carolina is one .
No word on which states she views as unpatriotic .
Also , was n’t her husband a member of a political party that calls for the dissolution of the United States government until Sarah entered statewide politics in 2002 .
Below is a video compilation released by the Human Rights Campaign which shows friends and colleagues of Barack and Michelle Obama .
They discuss their experiences with them and their hopes for a brighter future .
As Joe has pointed out before , the Des Moines Register endorsed McCain in the primaries .
He was on friendly turf .
And he still flipped out .
Des Moines Reigster columnist :
John McCain is angry .
You can feel it in the clenched muscles in his throat , the narrowing of his eyes , the controlled tone with which he handles a question he does n’t like , as if struggling to contain something that might spill out .
We ’ve seen that body language on TV .
But around a Des Moines Register table Tuesday , the anger and tension were palpable .
And unsettling .
McCain ’s volatility has been written and whispered about by staff and Senate colleagues : the mercurial temper , the quixotic outbursts of reproach , then jocularity .
But those alleged episodes were behind the scenes .
The combative , prickly McCain we saw was seeking the Register ’s endorsement .
He already got it in the caucuses .
He took frequent offense at questions , characterizing them as personal viewpoints of the questioners rather than legitimate topics .
True , he was asked some tough , pointed questions about his running mate and his honesty .
But America is having those discussions , and you ’d expect he’d be ready , not defensive .
It takes a thick skin to be president .
McCain says he is angry because “ people are angry . ”
But his behavior suggests it ’s more than that .
Maybe it ’s because his poll numbers are falling , his running mate is being ridiculed and his attempt to play fixer on the bailout failed to launch .
Or maybe , a more worrisome prospect , this is the real McCain – who ca n’t deal with stressful situations without feeling attacked , who lashes out when he feels threatened … .
Newspapers regularly put candidates in the hot seat .
Some playfully disarm the questioner .
Some deflect the question .
The confident relish the chance to make their case .
McCain seemed put out .
The presidency requires a special temperament .
It demands statesmanship with foreign leaders , persuasiveness with Congress and calm assuredness with the public .
If McCain is so flustered in an editorial meeting , how would he guide a nation in crisis ?
The Bush doctrine , which flung open the doors to the catastrophe in Iraq , was such a fundamental aspect of the administration ’s foreign policy that it staggers the imagination that we could have someone no further than a whisper away from the White House who does n’t even know what it is .
Image Bob Herbert
You ca n’t imagine that John McCain or Barack Obama or Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton or Joe Lieberman would not know what the Bush doctrine is .
But Sarah Palin ?
Absolutely clueless .
Ms. Palin ’s problem is not that she was mayor of a small town or has only been in the Alaska governor ’s office a short while .
Her problem ( and now ours ) is that she is not well versed on the critical matters confronting the country at one of the most crucial turning points in its history .
The economy is in a tailspin .
The financial sector is lurching about on rubbery legs .
We ’re mired in self - defeating energy policies .
We ’re at war .
And we are still vulnerable to the very real threat of international terrorism .
With all of that and more being the case , how can it be a good idea to set in motion the possibility that Americans might wake up one morning to find that Sarah Palin is president ?
I feel for Ms. Palin ’s son who has been shipped off to the war in Iraq .
But at his deployment ceremony , which was on the same day as the Charlie Gibson interview , Sept. 11 , she told the audience of soldiers that they would be fighting “ the enemies who planned and carried out and rejoiced in the death of thousands of Americans . ”
Was she deliberately falsifying history , or does she still not know that Iraq and Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with the Sept. 11 attacks ?
So just how bad shape was Morgan Stanley in September ?
Really bad .
Morgan Stanley was forced to buy $ 23 billion of securities from its money market funds to meet investor redemptions .
Of course , if those securities wind up declining in value , it could be forced to write - off billions more .
Here ’s Reuters describing how bad the money market bank run got :
Morgan Stanley clients withdrew a net $ 46 billion from money - market accounts last month , forcing the embattled investment bank to buy $ 23 billion of securities from the funds to keep them afloat .
According to its quarterly results , filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission , anxious customers withdrew cash from money - market and liquidity funds as the breakdown of capital markets hammered banks and raised doubts about the future of Wall Street .
The September flight followed net outflows of $ 8 billion in the three months ended Aug. 31 , Morgan Stanley said in the filing .
Morgan Stanley purchased securities to help fund investor redemptions as a wide range of money market instruments were impossible to trade .
The bank said it bought highly rated , short - term commercial paper , municipal bonds , certificates of deposit and notes for its own books .
Such purchases could fuel losses for Morgan Stanley in future periods , if the recent past is any guide .
But wait !
They ’re highly rated !
Surely that means they ’re safe investments , right ?
Anyone ?
Hello ?
Where did everyone go ?
Republican Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska was convicted of all 7 counts of making false statements in connection with , and failing to report , political gifts valued at $ 250,000 .
Here 's Stevens with his longtime friend , Governor Sarah Palin .
The same governor who earlier this month was herself under investigation for abusing her office in the attempted firing of a relative , i.e. , " Troopergate . "
That 's a lot of misuse of office and corruptions charges for a state with a population of 700,000 .
Somebody 's " pallin ' around " with convicted felons , and it's not Obama .
Cynematic blogs at P i l l o w b o o k .
The case , which could well decide the movement 's future in France , is the first since the adoption there last year of tough anti-cult legislation that allows the dissolution of suspected sects found guilty of common offences .
Prosecutors will charge the Church 's inner temple , the Spiritual Association of the Church of Scientology in the Paris region , and its president , Marc Walter , with abuse of civil liberties , misleading publicity and attempted fraud .
" It 's a hugely important case , the first time the Church has been accused as a legal entity in its own right , " said Olivier Morice , a lawyer for the National Union for the Defence of Families and Individuals , which is demanding that the organisation be outlawed .
The case stems from the complaints of three men , including two former Scientologists , who were sent brochures , booklets and invitations from the Church two or three times a week for several years despite having repeatedly demanded to be removed from its mailing lists .
A year - long inquiry headed by Judge Renaud van Ruymbeke found that the three men's names featured in half a dozen different Scientology databases maintained in France and Britain but also at the organisation 's European HQ in Denmark and the International Association of Scientologists in Los Angeles .
" That is a clear - cut case of breach of civil liberties and data protection legislation , " a spokesman at the public prosecutor 's office said yesterday .
" The judge also argues that the organisation was set up specifically to commit these offences . "
The Church , which has dismissed the case as " a minor affair about the complaint of a couple of individuals " , will also be accused of attempted fraud based on the " false allegations and untrue promises " in its tracts .
Unlike the US , France refuses to recognise Scientology as a religion , arguing that it is a purely commercial operation out to make as much money as it can at the expense of often vulnerable victims .
In a trial in Marseille three years ago , five Scientology officials were found guilty of selling bogus " purification " treatments costing between £ 1,200 and £ 15,000 but consisting mainly of sessions in the sauna , jogging and vitamin pills .
Other leading French Scientologists have in the past been sentenced to jail terms - often suspended - for fraud and other financial offences , but this is the first time the Church itself and its recruitment methods have gone on trial .
Founded in 1954 by the late L Ron Hubbard , an American science fiction writer , the Church of Scientology claims more than 8 m members worldwide , including the Hollywood stars Tom Cruise and John Travolta .
In France , where the organisation says it has some 50,000 members , Scientology was first described as a sect in a 1996 parliamentary report , and still features on a list of 173 groups under permanent government surveillance .
The movement was again strongly criticised this week in the government 's annual report on quasi-religious activity .
It accused the Scientologists of trying to " cash in on catastrophe " , handing out thousands of pamphlets offering help and advice after last September 's explosion at a chemical factory in Toulouse that killed 30 people , injured 2,500 , and left 1,400 families homeless .
Last year France became the first country to pass specific legislation against sects , creating a new offence , the " fraudulent abuse of a state of ignorance or weakness " , which carries a prison sentence of up to three years and a maximum fine of £ 250,000 .
The Church of Scientology has described it as " an attempt to impose state atheism " .

Why The Patriot Act of Finance Failure Prevents Dictatorial Control
So for those who are sitting in their soon - to - be - foreclosed - on homes financed with FHA or subprime mortgages , a little bit of righteous indignation seems to be in order over the rejection of The Bush Bailout Plan by Congress .
That was your ticket out , right ?
Big deal if you bought a house you knew you could n’t afford with taxpayer subsidies !
You ’re entitled to a rescue !
Well , you might want to keep your shirt on for the moment , unless that was purchased with make - believe credit , too .
The bailout plan put before Congress is n’t exactly something that would ’ve been good for America .
The plan contained a very sly stipulation that would ’ve given Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson more power than God .
What They Tried to Sneak By
At face value , “ bailout plan ” sounds well and good to those who have no objections to socialist economic policies .
Ah , but the plan was not so benign .
The law contained the following insidious and downright frightening provision : “ Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency . ”
Translation : Henry Paulson can do whatever the hell he wants .
To a lesser extent , so can his agency at its “ discretion . ”
But beware - discretion is soon to be the new fascism .
Recap on Dictators
Under the bailout plan that Congress had the good sense to shut down , Henry Paulson would have basically been allowed to make unilateral decisions , all while enjoying the unparalleled pleasure of an accountability - free reign .
He could rule with an iron fist , toying with the nation ’s economic equilibrium , and no one would be able to say a word .
So let ’s recap how this kind of dictatorial strategy has fared throughout history .
Consider the following rip-roaring success stories and all - around just nice guys :
Benito Mussolini
Adolf Hitler
Fidel Castro
Kim Jong II
Henry Paulson ( still in a dictatorship intern program … full honors come with the next bailout plan )
So What ’s the Patriot Act Got to Do with It ?
Sometimes “ crises ” force politicians to do foolish things .
Even more so than usual .
For example , 9/11 was the impetus for the Patriot Act , which also managed to completely circumvent court oversight .
Abuses of power and a sort of extreme - sports eavesdropping went down , and the bill managed to totally buck any kind of judicial review .
Thus , the scuttlebutt has pegged the defeated bailout plan as the Patriot Act of finances .
And , really , who could argue ?
This moment calls for a cliché : absolute power corrupts absolutely .
We Have to Blame Someone
The government is an easy whipping boy when economic hard time strike .
The media creates what I like to call a CINO ( a crisis in name only ) , people panic , causing the market to take a dive , and , because it ’s an election year , suddenly politicians are in a feverish frenzy to “ fix ” the alleged crisis .
But , honestly , has the government ever really fixed anything ?!
Government attempts to correct the market always fail miserably , as do most government plans to remedy situations .
It ’s like when the dishwasher would break in your house , and your dad , eager to demonstrate his mechanical prowess , would refuse to call a professional and instead try to fix it himself .
Before you know it , you ’re sleeping on a mattress of dirty dinner plates , the kitchen ’s on fire , you ca n’t find the dog , and the whole fiasco ends up costing you more , in stress , money , and time , than it would ’ve if your dad had just stayed out of it .
Like it or not , we ’re sticking with the dishwasher analogy .
In the case of our economic “ crisis , ” the professional dishwasher repair man is what the father of modern economics , Adam Smith , called “ the invisible hand . ”
Notice that he did not say the very visible hand ( or iron fist ) of Henry Paulson , Barack Obama , or Dubya ( God love him ) .
The market naturally goes through vicissitudes - ups and downs that are part of the economic cycle .
What really screws the economy up is when Dad , representing almost any politician today , comes along and tries to fix something he ’s incapable of fixing and probably had a role in breaking in the first place .
A Henry Paulson dictatorship is not going to fix the economy .
Remember “ laissez - faire , ” that vaguely familiar term from high school econ and the cornerstone of capitalism ?
Literally , it means , “ let do . ”
In other words , leave it alone , Henry Paulson .
Leave it alone , George W. Bush .
Leave it alone , two buffoons who are running for president .
New Leadership : Our Economic Savior ?
The current administration has taken its best shot at the economic crisis , and I use the term loosely , and failed .
Congress rejected the plan , thankfully , but , had the bill passed , the equivalent of the Patriot Act of finances would have been upon us .
I ’m going out on a limb here , but Henry Paulson dictating monetary policy with unbridled power may not be the answer .
So what IS the answer ??
New leadership ?
Doubt it .
Let ’s evaluate John Sidney McCain III and Barack Hussein Obama II on this issue .
John McCain has entered Congress in 1982 .
His career in the Senate began in 1987 .
Age - wise , John is in his early hundreds .
The point : McCain has had ample time to “ fix ” and perhaps even foresee this crisis , but he has seen fit to do so only in the month before a presidential election in which he is the Republican nominee .
Something smacks of political expediency , would n’t you say ?
You have to remember when politicians throw around phrases like “ suspending my campaign to fix the economic crisis , ” this really can just be summed up in one word : gimmick .
Now onto the political Messiah , Barack Obama .
First , recall that one of the biggest disasters that kick - started this economic panic was the failure of the Lehman Brothers , whose collapse was traced to corruption and abject stupidity at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
These two massive mortgage banks continued to survive , doling out loans to deadbeats who were clearly terrible credit risks to begin with , but how could any business manage that ?
The answer : political contributions .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were bedfellows with a number of senators in order to keep their unsound and floundering business afloat .
Now guess the politician who received the second - largest amount of political donations from these banks , despite having only been in the Senate for four years .
None other than Barack Obama .
Bottom line , we do n’t need Dad , Obama , Bush , Paulson , or any other politician fixing our economic dishwasher .
We have one Patriot Act , and that ’s plenty .
Every corner of the military community has its own boogeyman .
Some lock in on bioterrorists ; others , crybercriminals , or the growing Chinese Navy .
For nearly ten years , a collection of Congresscritters and missilemenhave fixated on the possibility that some madman might detonate a nuclear in the skies – triggering a king - sized electromagnetic pulse that would instantly fry all of America 's electronics .
The country would be instantly returned back to the mid-20th Century .
Or worse .
The other day , driving through Alaska , I heard one of these types on talk radio , warning that Iran was thisclose to be able to bring America on her knees with such a weapon .
Previous predictions to the same have n't exactly panned out – and have often been based on fishy evidence .
But Iran has made strides in missile and nuke technology , this fellow argued .
And besides , remember what EMPs did in the * Matrix * trilogy ?
Either way , the Navy is n't waiting around to find out .
It 's given L- 3
Services , Inc. a $ 7.4 million contract to build a " state - of - the - art Electromagnetic Pulse ( EMP ) Pulser and its associated control system . "
Expected completion date : 2010 .
The Navy does n't want the pulser to knock out enemy electronics , Defense Industry Daily says .
" Military systems are checked for their ability to survive specific EMP
levels – but to do that , one needs to generate an EMP .
Since the exact fate of any one device depends on its resistance , the power of the original pulse , and its distance from the source , testing EMPs from devices like L - 3 ’s pulser can be much smaller – and much closer – than the real thing . "
Across the world , there are museums of history , of art and of science .
Some of the most famous include the Louvre , the Smithsonian and San Francisco ’s Exploratorium .
But for as many famous museums as there are around the world , there are just as many strange museums .
To make it on this list , the wackier museum is the better .
10 . Leeds Castle Dog Collar Museum
Everyone loves their pets .
A pet museum might be interesting , but a museum dedicated to dog collars , not so much .
However , that ’s what London offers with more than 100 specimens that range from Medieval times to the Victorian Age .
It looks like the Leeds Castle Dog Collar Museum has a collar on the competition !

9. British Lawnmower Museum
Year after year , people go out to purchase lawnmowers so that they may keep their lawns crisp and presentable .
But a good portion of those people do n’t know the history behind the lawnmower and possibly do n’t care .
If you do care , then there ’s a museum for you in Southport , Lancashire , Great Britain .
The British Lawnmower Museum holds more than 200 specimens of this ever - important machine for the lawn junkie .

8. International Friendship Exhibition Hall
How do I love thee ?
Let me count the ways .
That ’s what has happened with the gifts received by Kim IL Sung and the Kim Jong IL in Kim IL ’s International Friendship Exhibition Hall .
Displaying more then 90,000 gifts , these were the items given by foreign dignitaries to the two leaders during their respective reigns as heads of state for North Korea .
Who can resist green train rail cars as gifts of gratitude for your leadership ?
See the Friendship Exhibition Hall
7 . The Museum of Bad Art
Founded in 1993 , the Museum of Bad Art is “ the world ’s only museum dedicated to the collection , preservation , exhibition and celebration of bad art in all its forms . ”
Their mission : to bring the worst of art to the widest of audiences .
With a collection of more than 400 pieces between two museums in Dedham Square and Somerville , Mass. , these museums give new meaning to “ ca n’t color between the lines . ”
See the Museum of Bad Art
6. Marikina City Shoe Museum
It only seems appropriate that former First Lady of the Philippines Imelda Marcos ’ shoe collection would be a part of the Marikina City Shoe Museum .
Only a fraction of the more than 3,000 shoes she collected , the display still helps with the vast amount of shoe knowledge and lore presented in Marikina City .
Their mission : to inform the world about how shoes were and are now made , especially in this city supposedly known for its shoemaking abilities .
More from the Shoe Museum
5 . The Mütter Museum
One of the few science museums on our list , the Mütter Museum is located in Philadelphia , Penn .
The medical museum features medical oddities , wax models and antique equipment .
Among the more famous displays are a preserved nine - foot long colon full of fecal matter , a growth taken from Lincoln ’s assassin and a woman whose remains turned to soap – essentially making her the cleanest mummy in the world .
More of the Mütter Museum
4. Burlesque Hall of Fame
Located between Los Angeles and Las Vegas on Route 66 , the Burlesque Hall of Fame features burlesque displays and holds annual fundraising events for a wide audience .
Their mission : to inspire , educate and entertain the public , fostering an understanding of the history and heritage of classic burlesque – including but not limited to the art , artifacts and personal histories of its brightest stars .
I guess they keep abreast of all situations related to classic burlesque .
See more of the Burlesque Hall of Fame 😉
3. Sulabh Museum of Toilets
Several thousand years ago it was almost unheard of to have running water , sewers and bathroom facilities that were actually sanitary .
That makes it seem all that more fascinating at the Sulabh Museum of Toilets in New Delhi , India .
There are displays of toilets from centuries past as well as documentation of how toilets have helped the world .
Perhaps that would be good reading on the throne ?
Visit the Museum of Toilets
2. Vibrator Museum and Masturbation Hall of Fame
Perhaps the most erotic museum on this list , this San Francisco “ museum ” displays ancient products originally designed to help women fight hysteria .
As one of the first five products to use AC power , the vibrator has a long history and the museum would like to shed some light on the practices of women ’s darkened bedrooms .
In addition to vibrators from decades ago , there are also plenty of modern toys to help anyone and everyone with their hysterical frustrations .
1. Icelandic Phallological Museum
An ode to the phallus :
Where oh where have you gone ?
Where will I find you ?
Perhaps at the Icelandic Phallacological Museum .
This Reykjavík museum boasts a penis or penis parts from just about every mammal and sea creature indigenous to Iceland .
Perhaps the Vibrator Museum and the Phallacological Museum should hook up ?

PRAGUE , Czech Republic , Oct. 27 ( UPI ) --
A teenager hit by a car and left for dead in the Czech Republic is being sued by the driver 's former employer , who contends he caused the accident , lawyers say .
Karel Pravec , then 15 , had both his legs broken two years ago when he was struck by a car driven by Petr Neisser .
The car was owned by Neisser 's employer , Pavel Imon , whose company , Abi Plus , makes jukeboxes .

Neisser is now in prison after being convicted of attempted murder for dumping Pravec in the woods rather than summoning help , the Monitor reported .
While Pravec survived , he is now being sued by Imon for damaging the company car , the Prague Daily Monitor reported Monday .
In his suit , Imon argues Pravec caused the accident by stepping into the dark road and into the car 's path .
Pravec 's family has called the lawsuit immoral while Imon , in a statement he published on the Internet , called the suit " moral and right , " the Monitor reported .
Darpa , the Pentagon 's far - out research wing , is launching a new , classified effort to find enemies by the phone they use .
It 's called Gandalf .
Announced yesterday by Darpa , the SECRET / NOFORN program 's goal is to employ " set of handheld devices " to track down a particular " signal emitter of interest , " using " radio frequency geolocation . "
The " specific goals and performance objectives ... for the Gandalf system are classified , " Darpa says .
But former Royal Navy officer Lew Page , who unearthed the project , explains what he believes the R&D agency has in mind :
It would appear that a group of undercover operatives … dispersed near a target ( perhaps a specific cell or satellite phone ) might carry portable gadgets , presumably networked .
The netted devices would be able to pick out the phone , radio or whatever they were after and track it .
This sort of thing is already done by surveillance aircraft and / or drones ; the new wrinkle is being able to do it using handheld devices .
So Project Gandalf [ is ] presumably intended for situations where the spy planes and drones can't be used - perhaps where the local government is unaware of the operation .
A classified meeting to discuss Gandalf is being held in northern Virginia at the end of October .

On August 7 , 1998 , hundreds of people were killed when terrorists detonated car bombs at the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya .
Almost immediately , the United States had evidence that a little - known group called al Qaeda was complicit in the attacks .
Though al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden had been plotting against the United States for years , this act of mass - murder won the band of Islamic terrorists and its leaders worldwide infamy .
Weeks after the attack , President Clinton fired scores of Tomahawk missiles at a suspected al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan , and he also attacked a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan his administration claimed was a chemical weapons plant .
Ten years later , this past August 7 , John McCain released a statement on the anniversary of the embassy bombings .
It was a harsh indictment of the Clinton administration and others who in McCain ’s estimation had not regarded the threat of al Qaeda with sufficient seriousness back then :
Today marks the 10th anniversary of the al Qaeda terrorist attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed more than 225 people , including 12 Americans , and injured thousands others .
The attacks made it painfully clear that al Qaeda ’s terrorist call to arms to attack Americans anywhere in the world was not an empty threat .
The attacks proved the vulnerability of U.S. installations overseas , and demonstrated — to any that needed further evidence — that al Qaeda was a well - funded , organized and treacherous terrorist organization determined to kill Americans .
Tragically , the U.S. response to the 1998 embassy bombings was wholly inadequate in addressing the threat posed by Al Qaeda despite the horrific toll of the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania .
Too many Clinton Administration officials refused to act effectively to counter the dangers posed by al Qaeda .
Three years later , al Qaeda ’s commitment to kill was devastatingly brought to our soil .
But at the time–even after the embassy bombings –McCain , too , was slow to recognize the nature of the threat posed by al Qaeda and bin Laden .
Weeks after these attacks , he even came across as dismissive of bin Laden as a danger and showed no enthusiasm for hunting down this terrorist and his al Qaeda allies .
And he did so in a Mother Jones interview .
In mid-September 1998 , journalist Jason Vest , on assignment for the magazine , conducted an hour - long interview with McCain .
At the time , McCain ’s efforts to pass campaign finance reform and anti-tobacco legislation had made him , as Vest put it , “ the darling of political reporters . ”
Much of the interview covered issues of money and politics .
But with the embassy bombings still in the news , Vest asked McCain about bin Laden and how to deal with terrorism .
The following exchange ensued :
Vest :
You not only have had combat experience in Vietnam , but you were also a prisoner of war .
When you look at terrorism right now , with people like Osama bin Laden , do you have any reservations about watching strikes like that ?
McCain :
You could say , Look , is this guy , Laden , really the bad guy that ’s depicted ?
Most of us have never heard of him before .
And where there is a parallel with Vietnam is :
What ’s plan B ?
What do we do next ?
We sent our troops into Vietnam to protect the bases .
Lyndon Johnson said ,
Only to protect the bases .
Next thing you know … .
Well , we ’ve declared to the terrorists that we ’re going to strike them wherever they live .
That ’s fine .
But what ’s next ?
That ’s where there might be some comparison .
McCain ’s answer makes it seem that he was not overly concerned about bin Laden or eager to go after him and that he was worried that military action against al Qaeda could draw the United States into another quagmire .
That is , he was talking like those people whom McCain attacked in 2008 for not having realized in 1998 that “ al Qaeda was a well - funded , organized and treacherous terrorist organization determined to kill Americans . ”
On August 20 , 1998 – the day that Clinton attacked the al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan and the factory in Sudan–McCain did issue a press release praising the military action as a “ welcome response ”
He added that “ American credibility and resolve have been enhanced by today ’s strikes . ”
Two days later on CNN , he again hailed Clinton ’s response : “ The president ’s decision to strike and his administration ’s promise to prevail in what may well be a long - term campaign were right . ”
But a search of the Congressional Record at www.thomas.loc.gov indicates McCain made no statements on the Senate floor regarding bin Laden or al Qaeda any time that year .
And a Nexis search of the six months following the embassy bombings produced no references to any McCain comments related to this terrorist outfit and its leader–other than his praise for Clinton ’s retaliatory strikes .
McCain ’s 1998 remarks to Mother Jones and the absence of public statements from him about bin Laden at the time suggest that McCain had been as much behind the curve on al Qaeda as the people he would decry ten years after the fact .
At the time , he did not in public treat al Qaeda as a serious danger or advocate swift and extensive action .
A decade later , he had no reason–other than politics –to be pointing fingers .
ST . PAUL , Minnesota ( CNN ) -- John McCain 's running mate , Sarah Palin , dealt with two startling disclosures Monday .
She announced that her 17 - year - old unmarried daughter is pregnant and plans to keep the baby .
And Palin has hired a lawyer as Alaska investigates the firing of her public safety commissioner .
Bristol Palin , second from right , holds infant brother Trig at Friday 's announcement of their mother 's candidacy .
Palin hired a lawyer three weeks ago to act on her behalf as state legislators investigate whether she may have abused her power in firing the state public safety commisioner for refusing to fire her ex-brother - in - law , a state trooper , CNN confirmed .
A report of findings of a legislative inquiry that began several weeks ago is expected to be released just days before Election Day .
Palin also revealed that her daughter Bristol is pregnant and will marry the baby 's father .
John McCain was aware of Bristol Palin 's pregnancy before he chose her mother for his running mate , a top adviser to the Republican presidential candidate said .
The adviser , Doug Holtz - Eakin , said Monday that Palin " was completely vetted by the campaign " before she was chosen .
" Sen . McCain knew this and felt in no way did it disqualify her from being vice president , " said an aide who asked not to be named .
" Families have difficulties sometimes and lucky for her she has a supportive family . "
The McCain aide emphasized that Bristol decided to keep the baby , a decision " supported by her parents . "
iReport.com : Share your thoughts on Palin
Senior McCain advisers said Palin told McCain about her daughter 's pregnancy in one of their " private conversations " last week before he officially asked her to run with her .
However , McCain aides said he already knew , having found out about it earlier in the vetting process .
" She was very upfront about it , " one aide insisted .
Asked how the unmarried teenager 's pregnancy would be received by the American people , another senior McCain adviser , Steve Schmidt , replied , " I do n't know ; I 'm not a psychic . "
Delegates to the Republican convention in Minneapolis - St. Paul , Minnesota , said the disclosure of Bristol 's pregnancy would not hurt the Republican ticket and may make Palin " a real person like all the rest of us . "
" I have a 17 - year - old daughter , and they start making choices without us , " said Annette Ratliff , a delegate from Texas .
" I appreciate the choice she is making to have the baby , but it just makes her a real person .
It happens every day in America . "
" I think , if anything , it shows the Republican Party is a real American party , " said Rex Teter , another Texas delegate .
" Every family has to deal with children , and sometimes children make decisions that parents wish they would not have been made , and things happen .
But I think children are a blessing from God . "
Sen .
Barack Obama said firmly that the news should not have any bearing on the campaign for president .
" Let me be as clear as possible , " Obama said .
" I think people 's families are off - limits , and people 's children are especially off - limits .
This should n't be part of our politics .
It has no relevance to Gov. Palin 's performance as governor or her potential performance as a vice president . "
Bristol Palin , a senior in high school , is about five months along , according to the aide who asked not to be named .
The aide said the Palins and the McCain campaign decided to reveal the information now because of Internet rumors that Sarah Palin 's 4 - month - old baby , who has Down syndrome , was actually Bristol's .
" In the course of correcting that , we needed to get the truth out , " the McCain aide said .
iReport.com : Share your thoughts
Sarah and her husband , Todd Palin , issued a statement saying they are " proud of Bristol 's decision to have her baby and even prouder to become grandparents . "
" Bristol and the young man she will marry are going to realize very quickly the difficulties of raising a child , which is why they will have the love and support of our entire family , " they said in a statement issued by McCain 's campaign .
They also asked the media to respect their daughter 's privacy , a request echoed by McCain adviser Schmidt .
" The one thing that all the candidates agree on is this : Leave the kids alone .
Leave the kids alone .
This is an election about the future of the country , " he said .
McCain unveiled Sarah Palin , a 44 - year - old first - term Alaska governor and former small - town mayor , as his running mate Friday .
The choice was a surprise to many .
Watch analysts discuss the choice »
Palin said when running for governor in 2006 that she would support funding for abstinence - only education in schools , according to Eagle Forum Alaska , a conservative group that sent a questionnaire asking gubernatorial candidates their views on a range of issues .
Tony Perkins , president of the influential conservative Family Research Council , on Monday issued a statement supporting the Palin family .
" Fortunately , Bristol is following her mother and father 's example of choosing life in the midst of a difficult situation .
We are committed to praying for Bristol and her husband - to - be and the entire Palin family as they walk through a very private matter in the eyes of the public , " Perkins said in a written statement .
All About John McCain • Sarah Palin
WASHINGTON -- September began as John McCain 's month and ended as Barack Obama's .
McCain 's high - risk wagers aimed at shaking up the campaign turned into bad investments .
And Friday 's debate eliminated McCain 's best chance to deliver a knockout blow to his opponent .
McCain is supposed to own the foreign - policy issue -- and he should have owned Friday 's debate .
During their respective primary battles , McCain was a better debater than Obama , who could be hesitant , wordy and thrown off his stride .
But the Obama who showed up at Ole Miss was sharper and more concise than the man who frequently lost debates against his Democratic foes .
He was also resolutely calm in standing his ground against McCain , whose condescension became a major talking point following the debate .
If Al Gore suffered from his sighs during the 2000 debates , McCain will be remembered for his supercilious repetition of seven variations on " Senator Obama does n't understand . "
This gave special power to Obama 's peroration about McCain 's " wrong " judgments on going to war in Iraq .
McCain 's dismissal of Obama brought back memories of how advocates for the war arrogantly dismissed those who insisted ( rightly , as it turned out ) that the conflict would be far more difficult and costly than its architects suggested .
His derisive approach may help explain why the instant polls gave Obama an edge in a debate that many pundits rated a tie -- and why women seemed especially inclined toward Obama .
An Obama adviser who was watching a " dial group " -- in which viewers turn a device to express their feelings about a debate 's every moment -- said that whenever McCain lectured or attacked Obama , the Republican 's ratings would drop , and the fall was especially steep among women .

As the wrenching shifts within the American financial industry shook world markets on Wednesday , Morgan Stanley , one of the two major Wall Street banks left standing , was considering a possible merger with the Wachovia Corporation or another bank , according to people briefed on the discussions .
A tie -up with a bank would restore Morgan Stanley to its structure during the Depression , when the firm split from the Morgan banking empire .
It would also leave Goldman Sachs , long the envy of Wall Street , as the only major American investment bank left .
As Morgan Stanley ’s share price came under renewed assault on Wednesday , the firm ’s chief executive , John J. Mack , received a telephone call from Wachovia expressing interest in the Wall Street bank .
Other banks have also expressed interest in Morgan Stanley , which is considering various options .
The talks with Wachovia are preliminary and no deal may emerge .

I 've wanted to do my own amateur high altitude balloon project for some time .
However , it 's significantly harder and more involved than one might think .
All I knew is that I wanted to send cameras to high altitude to take cool photographs .
I did n't know how .
Fortunately , I met people who do .
James Coxon ( http://www.pegasushabproject.org.uk/wiki/doku.php ) invited me to provide the payload for our first joint project - HAPS 1 ( High Altitude Photo System ) His avionics side was quite adventurous .
My photo side was a single Canon Powershot A560 running a hacked firmware with a script to take movies and stills .
Long story short - it worked ( although everything went wrong on the day )
http://www.pegasushabproject.org.uk/wiki/doku.php/missions:haps:haps-1 for details .
- 32.3 km altitude - 900 photos - a hell of chase to get it back .
Amazingly , only 4 days later , a member of the CU Spaceflight team ( http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~cuspaceflight/ ) asked if I wanted to take my camera on another flight with their plan for a dawn launch .
HELL YES says I - net result - from Thursday at 0700 to Friday at 2300 - I did n't sleep - instead at 0407 on the Friday morning - we launched again .
I could n't follow for the full chase and recovery , but the radio system worked beautifully to the point that the recovery car was less than 1 km from the landing point at touch down .
Their paylods were called Nova , and mine is HAPS - so this was Nova 8 / HAPS - D ( d for dawn ) - and it was a stunner - lot of videos etc here http://vimeo.com/1628664

This is a really popular hobby in the US - not so much in the UK yet , but it 's picking up .
It 's the closest thing to spaceflight an amateur can get - and it's just the most amazing experience , especially when helped by the brilliant talents of Pegasus and CU Spaceflight !

The police are to expand a car surveillance operation that will allow them to record and store details of millions of daily journeys for up to five years , the Guardian has learned .
A national network of roadside cameras will be able to " read " 50 m licence plates a day , enabling officers to reconstruct the journeys of motorists .
Police have been encouraged to " fully and strategically exploit " the database , which is already recording the whereabouts of 10 million drivers a day , during investigations ranging from counter - terrorism to low - level crime .
But it has raised concerns from civil rights campaigners , who question whether the details should be kept for so long , and want clearer guidance on who might have access to the material .
The project relies on automatic number plate recognition ( ANPR ) cameras to pinpoint the precise time and location of all vehicles on the road .
Senior officers had promised the data would be stored for two years .
But responding to inquiries under the Freedom of Information Act , the Home Office has admitted the data is now being kept for five years .
Thousands of CCTV cameras across the country have been converted to read ANPR data , capturing people 's movements in cars on motorways , main roads , airports and town centres .
Local authorities have since adapted their own CCTV systems to capture licence plates on behalf of police , massively expanding the network of available cameras .
Mobile cameras have been installed in patrol cars and unmarked vehicles parked by the side of roads .
Police helicopters have been equipped with infrared cameras that can read licence plates from 610 metres ( 2,000ft ) .
In four months ' time , when a nationwide network of cameras is fully operational , the National ANPR Data Centre in Hendon , north London , will record up to 50 m licence plates a day .
The Home Office said in a letter that the Hendon database would " store all ANPR captured data for five years " .
The photograph of a person 's licence plate will , in most cases , be stored for one year .
Human rights group Privacy International last night described the five - year record of people 's car journeys " unnecessary and disproportionate " , and said it had lodged an official complaint with the Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) , the government 's data watchdog .
In a statement , the ICO said it would take the complaint " seriously " and would be contacting police " to discuss proposed data retention periods " .
" Prolonged retention would need to be clearly justified based on continuing value not on the mere chance it may come in useful , " it said .
In 2005 the government invested £ 32 m to develop the ANPR data - sharing programme after police concluded that road traffic cameras could be used for counter - terrorism and everyday criminal investigations .
Senior police officers have said they intend the database to be integrated into " mainstream policing " .
Half of all police forces in England and Wales have now been connected to the network , reading between 8 and 10 m licence plates a day .
The Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) said the database would be linked to ANPR systems run by all but two police forces by the end of the year .
The database will be able to store as many as 18 bn licence plate sightings in 2009 .
The Acpo ANPR strategy document , obtained under the Freedom of Information Act , envisages the database will be used at all levels of policing .
The document , which sets policy up until 2010 , states that police forces should " fully and strategically exploit " the database .
Officers can access the database to find uninsured cars , locate illegal " duplicate " licence plates and track the movements of criminals .
The Acpo adds that the database will " deter criminals through increased likelihood of detection " .
" Experience has shown there are very strong links between illegal use of motor vehicles on the road and other types of serious crime , " said Merseyside Police 's Assistant Chief Constable , Simon Byrne , who leads Acpo's ANPR policy .
The director of Privacy International , Simon Davies , said last night the database would give police " extraordinary powers of surveillance " .
" This would never be allowed in any other democratic country , " he said .
" This is possibly one of the most valuable reserves of data imaginable . "
Peter Fry , of the CCTV User group , said that licence plate images captured by CCTV are generally retained for 31 days .
" There 's not a great deal of logic to explain keeping the same images for five years , " he said .
SEATTLE --

READ THE RELEASE
John McCain is heading to near - certain defeat in the presidential election because American voters no longer trust Republicans on the economy , a strategist for the party warned yesterday .
Steve Lombardo , who has worked on Republican campaigns since 1992 and advised McCain 's opponent , Mitt Romney , in the primaries , said it would take a major external event , such as a terrorist attack or a crippling error by Barack Obama , for McCain to make a comeback .
" Basically unless there is some external event the dynamics of this race are being driven almost entirely by the financial situation here in the United States and globally , and that works for Barack Obama , " Lombardo told the Guardian .
" If there is n't some sort of event or , God forbid , a terrorist attack that moves the election on to foreign affairs or national security , it is unlikely that McCain can regain the lead , just because voters have decided that the base of the problems they face are the Republican party , George Bush , and , by extension , John McCain . "
McCain last night tried to get past Obama 's advantage on the economy by making a personal connection with voters , in the second of three presidential debates in Nashville , Tennessee .
Taking advantage of a town hall format , McCain walked up to the studio audience to make his pitch .
" I know how to get American working again , " he said .
But the outlook for Republicans did not look good .
Yesterday saw Bush brought to a new low .
The 25 % approval rating was recorded just after Congress approved a $ 700 bn ( £ 400 bn ) economic bailout , suggesting the public gave no credit to the White House for its rescue plan .
The rating , a new nadir for a historically unpopular president , puts Bush one point ahead of Richard Nixon on the eve of his departure in 1974 .
It is three points higher than the poll 's all - time low for any president , Harry Truman 's 22 % in 1952 .
Lombardo laid out his misgivings in a memo obtained by the Guardian , in which he wrote that McCain 's attempts to make the election about Obama 's character were unlikely to work .
The memo argues such attacks at this point seem " desperate " ; the time to define the Democrats ' character had been in August - before the presidential debates .
" The economic situation has virtually ended John McCain 's presidential aspirations and no amount of tactical manoeuvring in the final 29 days is likely to change that equation , " the memo said .
" There are more turns to come in this election and it is not over yet but it sure seems like it is . "
The memo said McCain lost the election on September 15 - two days after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy - when he told a rally in Florida : " The fundamentals of the economy are strong . "
McCain saw fresh signs yesterday of the damage to his prospects in polls showing him trailing in four battleground states and fighting to keep Indiana and North Carolina .
He suffered another blow when the wife of a retiring Republican senator seen as one of the Republicans ' experts on national security officially endorsed Obama .
" We 're in two wars , two of the longest we 've ever been in .
We 've run up a third of our nation 's debt in just the past eight years .
We 're in the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression , " said Lilibet Hagel , whose husband , Chuck , is a senator from Nebraska .
With less than four weeks until election day , the slide in the polls brought an even more personal edge to McCain 's attacks on Obama .
The Democrats hit back with an ad released on cable networks yesterday , accusing McCain of being " out of ideas " and seeking to distract voters from America 's economic problems .
" With no plan to lift our economy up , John McCain wants to tear Barack Obama down , " it said .
In the latest bad news for McCain , a Time magazine - CNN poll showed the Republican struggling to hold states Bush carried easily in 2004 .
In Indiana , Republican since 1964 , McCain and Obama were tied among registered voters on 48 % .
Palin , meanwhile , emerged as the attack dog .
The vice - presidential candidate redirected her attack from Obama 's association with 1960s radical Bill Ayers to Obama himself .
" You mean he did n't know that he launched his political career in the living room of a domestic terrorist ? " she asked a rally in Jacksonville .
To the unrefined or unbred , the visiting card is but a trifling and insignificant bit of paper ; but to the cultured disciple of social law , it conveys a subtle and unmistakable intelligence .
Its texture , style of engraving , and even the hour of leaving it combine to place the stranger , whose name it bears , in a pleasant or a disagreeable attitude even before his manners , conversation , and face have been able to explain his social position .
- Our Deportment
In the 19th and early 20th century , social interaction was a richly cultivated , well - mannered affair .
The tool that facilitated these interactions was the calling card .
Calling cards streamlined introductions and helped remind people of new acquaintances and needed visits .
The calling card also served as a way to brand your social identity .
The way your card looked and felt or the way you handed it to someone communicated your standing and relationship with the receiver .
While the calling card had gone the way of top hats and knickers , they ’re starting to make a comeback .
What follows is a brief history of the calling card and how men today can resurrect this tradition to create some stylish panache in their social interactions .
The History of Calling Cards
During the 1800 ’s and early 1900 ’s the practice of “ calling ” upon or visiting one ’s relatives , friends , and acquaintances was a middle and upper class social ritual governed by countless rules and traditions .
Central to visiting etiquette was the use of the calling card .
Every gentleman kept a ready supply of calling cards with him to distribute upon his visits .
When calling upon a friend , a gentleman gave his card to the servant answering the door .
The servant would be holding a silver tray and the card would be placed upon it .
If the person the gentleman was calling upon was home , the servant would take the card to them and they would come meet the gentleman .
If the person being called upon was not home , the servant would leave the card for when they returned .
Generally upon a gentleman ’s initial visit to a home , he would simply leave a card and then depart .
If the new acquaintance wished to formally visit with him , he or she would send a card in return .
If no card was sent , or the return card was sent in an envelope , this signaled that the new acquaintance did not wish for a personal visit to occur .
This signal ( the card in an envelope ) could indeed be sent after any visit in which the visited party no longer wished to be called upon by this particular person .
It was basically the well - mannered brush off .
A calling card was also used when a gentleman was desirous to see someone at a hotel or parlor .
He would send up his card while he waited in the reception area or office for his acquaintance or business associate to come and greet him .
A man ’s calling card was simple and plain in design .
About the size of a playing card ( they were toted about in a carrying case tucked in one ’s breast pocket ) , they bore a man ’s name , and later on , his address as well .
The name was written in the center , sometimes with a middle initial and sometimes not .
A young man did not preface his name with “ Mr. ” A military officer included his rank and branch of service .
A physician could include his professional title , as in “ Dr. Robert Smith , ” or “ Robert Smith M.D. ”
But honorary titles such as Prof. , Hon. , and Esq. were not acceptable .
The card sometimes also included the name of the gentleman ’s club or fraternal organization a man belonged to .
A man might have a set of calling cards that included his address and a set that left that space blank .
This latter type of card would be larger and engraved with fancier writing .
The blank space would be used for written notes inviting a friend to dinner or the theater or some other social event .
An engraved card was considered to have the most distinguished style , followed by a handsomely handwritten one , and if these could not be obtained , a nicely printed card would do .
The precise rules governing card giving and the style of the card , from the type of font to whether to include your middle initial or not , changed each year and could leave a person a bit anxious about what was currently in fashion .
19th Century Calling Card Etiquette
The giving and receiving of calling cards developed a very elaborate set of rituals and rules that every gentleman tried to master .
While one ’s modern sensibilities might find these rigid formalities laughable , I ’ve got to say there ’s a certain appeal to it .
Far more dignified than poking someone on Facebook , would n’t you say ?.
Just in case you step through a time warp and land in the 19th century , here ’s your calling card etiquette survival guide .
On a first visit to a household , a gentleman gave one card to each lady of the house .
A married man had a medium sized card , while an unmarried man had a smaller card .
Men ’s cards were always smaller than women’s .
When calling upon the lady of the house , if she was not home , but her daughter was , the gentleman sent in his card and departed , as it was not usual for a young lady to receive calls from a gentleman unless they were very intimate friends .
Special significance was given to the turning down of the card ’s corners :
A visit in person ( as opposed to being sent by a servant ) : the right hand upper corner
A congratulatory visit : the left hand upper corner
A condolence visit : the left hand lower corner
Taking leave ( if you were going on a long trip ) : right hand lower corner
If there were two of more ladies in the household , the gentleman turned down a corner of the card to indicate that the call was designed for the whole family .
Initialing a calling card
Gentleman would also inscribe initials upon the card to denote the reason for his visit .
The initials stood for the following French words :
p. f. – congratulations ( pour féliciter )
p. r. – expressing one ’s thanks ( pour remercier )
p. c. – mourning expression ( pour condoléance )
p. f. N. A. – Happy New Year ( pour feliciter Nouvel An )
p. p. c. – meaning to take leave ( pour prendre congé )
p. p. – if you want to be introduced to anybody , send your visiting card ( pour présenter )
Card Etiquette Regarding Certain Occasions :
For Congratulations
Congratulatory cards were best given in person , but it was acceptable to send a card in lieu of an actual visit .
One month after the birth of a child , acquaintances were to call to offer their congratulations .
For Weddings
If you could n’t attend the reception you would send a card and then wait until the couple announced the place of their new residence to send another or make a visit .
But in the meantime you were expected to call upon the parents or relatives who had given the reception .
When a man ’s wedding only included his family and closest friends , he would send his bachelor ’s card , enclosed in an envelope to those of his acquaintances with whom he wished to remain friends .
Those who received this card were expected to call on the couple within 10 days of them taking possession of their new home .
After a wedding , the friends of the bride and groom were expected to send their calling cards to the new couple .
In this way , the couple would have all of their friends ’ contact information on file and would be able to stay in touch with them .
Cards of Condolence
When someone passed away , acquaintances would send a card of condolence , which as mentioned , was indicated by folding down the left hand lower corner of your usual card .
This card was delivered in person and the visitor would inquire after the health of the family before departing .
When the bereaved once more felt up to receiving visitors , they would send cards to the friends and loved one who had left theirs , indicating their readiness to again visit with company .
Resurrecting the Calling Card in the Modern Age
When the household servants moved out , and Alex Bell ’s new fangled talking machine moved in , the practice and etiquette surrounding the sending and receiving of calling cards suffered a slow death .
The only place where calling cards survived was in the U.S. Armed Forces .
Officers still carry on the tradition today .
But quite happily for the modern day gentleman , they are now making a comeback in civilian life as well .
While technology has opened up a legion of ways to communicate these days , something within us still craves the transfer of something tangible , something more civilized and refined .
Enter the calling card .
Why not just use a business card ?
During the heyday of calling cards , using a business card for a social purpose was considered bad manners .
Today , while business cards are great for making business contacts , they still are n’t really suited for social situations .
They probably have your work number and work email , and not much else on them .
Think of all the times you meet someone you ’d like to see again .
Handing them a business card is too stiff and formal .
Ditto for simply having them put your digits into their phone .
Oftentimes when meeting someone , the connection you establish is too new for your acquaintance to feel comfortable calling .
Perhaps before pursuing more contact , they ’d like first to check out your Facebook page or blog or send you an email .
And how many times in a conversation does someone tell you about their website or their blog , and you swear to check it out , but then ca n’t remember its name when you get home ?
A calling card is the answer to all of these situations .
A calling card can tell a new acquaintance more about you and help them better remember you .
It provides a chance to enhance the first impression you make and gives your new acquaintances the ability to pursue a relationship with you in the way they feel most comfortable .
Designing a Calling Card
As aforementioned , during the heyday of calling card use , the design of men ’s calling cards were fairly spartan , just name and address .
Today it is more acceptable to create a calling card design that gives you a chance for a bit of self - expression .
How to Design a Card
Your calling card should reflect your personality .
When someone puts your phone number into their cell , they may look at this entry some time later and fail to remember much about you .
A calling card should include something to jog their memory ( although in truth , currently simply giving someone a calling card should render you fairly unforgettable ) .
Pick a color scheme , font , and design that convey something about you .
But do remember , you ’re still a gentleman , not a lady , so do n’t make it too flowery or cartoony .
You may still opt for simply having a traditional , plain card with only your name on the front .
This of course , would likewise say much about your personality .
What to Include on the Card
To call upon a friend in the Victorian age , there was only one option - drop by their house .
In our modern society , technology has provided a myriad of ways for a new acquaintance to contact you , and your card should reflect this .
In addition to your name and phone number , consider including some ( but certainly not all - you do n’t want it to be cluttered ) of the following pieces of information :
Blog or website address
Twitter username
Facebook or Myspace name ( if it ’s different than the one on the card )
Email address
Instant message name
If you decide to go for a very traditional man ’s design with only perhaps your name on the front , you can then tailor the information you wish to give to each individual you meet by simply writing on the back and making the desired additions .

How to Use the Card
A calling card can come in handy in any social situation in which you want to exchange information with someone .
Remember , you may use the blank back of the cards to write notes and invite someone to meet up with you again .
For example , you might write , “ Join me for coffee this Saturday , 3:00 pm .
Starbucks on 51rst and Harvard . ”
Or use the back to invite someone over for dinner and write down your address for them .
Here are some more situations where a calling card would particularly come in handy :
Class reunions .
You ’re going to run into a ton of people with which you want to exchange information .
Instead of constantly busting out the pen and paper , just hand them your card .

Networking between jobs .
You ’re not currently employed , so you do n’t have a business card .
Or if you do , it has your old employer ’s info on it .
While you ’re looking for work , have a calling card ready to present to potential contacts and leads .

Parties .
If you ’re planning an informal party or get together , write down your address and the time of the party on the back .
When you run into people you ’d like to see there , give them one of your cards and invite them over .
Sometimes calling cards also come with small envelopes , sized to fit your card .
You can therefore always use your calling cards as traditional invitations sent through the mail .
Also , if your calling card comes with an envelope , you can use them as gift cards .

The classroom .
It ’s often hard to make the leap from being “ in-class ” friends to “ outside of class ” friends .
Give someone you enjoy chatting with in class your calling card .
They ’ll probably start posting on your Facebook page and your friendship will take off from there .
Or use the card to set up a study group .

Dating .
When trying to meet a lady , it ’s nerve racking to ask for her number , and if you foist yours upon her , she may not call you .
Giving a potential lady friend your calling card is a great third option .
First of all , it ’s non-threatening .
She may be too shy to call you outright .
She may rather start off with a casual email .
And she may not be sure about what she thinks of you .
Giving her your calling card lets her peruse your blog or Facebook page first .
Second , giving her your calling card gives you a chance to give a two minute blurb about the history of the tradition .
You ’ll immediately be set apart in her mind from the usual cads she meets and she ’ll think you a true gentleman .
Finally , when she takes home your calling card , it ’s something tangible that will remind her of you and make it more likely that she ’ll reach out and contact you .
Where to Find a Calling Card
Here are a few sites that offer calling cards that will appeal to the modern gentleman .
Most will send you a sample before you buy , so you wo n’t be stuck with something you do n’t like .
Crane & Co. ( Nice , quality cards , priced between the low and high end )
The Stationery Studio .
( Big selection , many are designed for women but there are many for men too , decently priced )
American Stationery ( Only one design to choose from , but inexpensive )
Dempsey and Carroll ( For the traditional gentleman with exquisite taste .
Dempsey and Carroll have been in the biz since 1878 .
Very high quality .
Very expensive .
Custom made to your specifications . )
Piccolo Press
( For our friends across the pond .
Piccolo press still prints and engraves their cards the old fashioned way . )
For the frugal gentleman , or the man who does n’t mind sacrificing quality for variety , you may wish to consider simply buying a box of business cards from Office Depot , downloading a business card template , and then printing them at home .
They ’ll be flimsy of course , but you can forever tinker with the font and design , and print new ones off that will especially suit a particular occasion .
Undergraduate and graduate students in an advanced computer security course at Rice University in Houston are learning hands - on just how easy it is to wreak havoc on computer software used in today 's voting machines .
As part of his advanced computer science class , Rice University Associate Professor and Director of Rice 's Computer Security Lab Dan Wallach tests his students in a unique real - life experiment :
They are instructed to do their very best to rig a voting machine in the classroom .
Here 's how the experiment works :
Wallach splits his class into teams .
In phase one , the teams pretend to be unscrupulous programmers at a voting machine company .
Their task : Make subtle changes to the machines ' software -- changes that will alter the election 's outcome but that cannot be detected by election officials .
In the second phase of the experiment , the teams are told to play the part of the election 's software regulators .
Their task is to certify the code submitted by another team in the first phase of the class .
" What we 've found is that it 's very easy to insert subtle changes to the voting machine , " Wallach said .
" If someone has access and wants to do damage , it 's very straightforward to do it . "
The good news , according to Wallach , is " when looking for these changes , our students will often , but not always , find the hacks . "

" While this is a great classroom exercise , it does show how vulnerable certain electronic voting systems are , " Wallach said .
" If someone had access to machines and had the knowledge these students do , they surely could rig votes . "
Even though students were often able to find the other team 's hacked software bugs , Wallach said that in real life it would probably be too late .
" In the real world , voting machines ' software is much larger and more complex than the Hack - a - Vote machine we use in class , " he said .
" We have little reason to believe that the certification and testing process used on genuine voting machines would be able to catch the kind of malice that our students do in class .
If this happened in the real world , real votes could be compromised and nobody would know . "
Wallach hopes that by making students aware of this problem , they will be motivated to advocate changes in America 's voting system to ensure the integrity of everyone 's vote .
In 2006 , electronic voting machines accounted for 41 percent of the tallied U.S. votes .
Fifty percent were cast on paper , and 9 percent " other , " including New York 's lever machines .
Dan Wallach is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rice University in Houston and associate director of ACCURATE ( A Center for Correct , Usable , Reliable , Auditable and Transparent Elections , multi-institution voting research center funded by the National Science Foundation . ) .
His research involves computer security and the issues of building secure and robust software systems for the Internet .
William Randolph prepares to jump ship :
When I read something like this , it makes me realize : there are only so many times I can tell people that I 'm a conservative , but not that kind of conservative before it becomes clear that I 'm using the wrong word .
Like all words , the meaning of “ conservative ” emerges from a complex communal process .
It 's not mine to control .
So do I spend the next few years putting the word in dissociative quotation marks ?
Or do I just let it go free , knowing that if the word does not come back , then we were never meant to be together in the first place ?
It might be fun to try to keep the word for contrarian purposes , or just out of sheer stubbornness , but : what 's the point ?
John Schwenkler urges Randolph to not take the plunge .
I face the dilemma every time I go to a college campus and speak about conservatism .
When you use the c-word among the next generation , they no longer associate it with small government , individual freedom , humble faith , balanced budgets , respect for tradition or a strong but prudent foreign policy .
They think of religious fanaticism , big spending , massive debt , and social intolerance .
When I give my stump speech in defense of the conservatism I lay out in my book , there is considerable interest , but it sounds nothing like the current GOP .
I come close to washing my hands of the word as Randolph is .

いつも、私たちはドバイの建物の壮大さに驚かされていますよね。世界で一番背の高いビルとか、世界一長い橋とか、思いもよらないような形の建築物とか、兎に角ドバイには、スゴイものがバンバン建っていきますから。
去年Addyと私がドバイに行った時は、光輝く華麗な建築物の裏にある暗い苦難を見ることは無く…、そこらじゅうにある大量のコンクリート、グラス、銅を目にして、ただただ驚いていました。思ってみれば、建築物が建つということは、それを造っている人達がいるのは当然ですが、キラキラしたドバイの摩天楼の影は想像していたよりも真っ黒でした。
ドバイには、一歩間違ったら奴隷のような労働者が30万人も存在しているそうです。彼らは窮屈な強制労働収容所みたいなところで働かされ、中には命を落としてしまう人もいれば、ケガをしている人も少なくないとのこと。そんなリスキーな仕事なのに1日働いても、ほんの数ドルにしかならないとか…。今回、幸いなことに、Guardianの記者Ghaith Abdul - Ahadさんが、この事を私たちに伝えてくれたので、写真と一緒にお伝えしたいと思います。

彼らは全員、建築ブームを支援している巨大な詐欺の一部として巻き込まれているのです。何十万もの出稼ぎ労働者は、彼らは皆インドとパキスタンの斡旋業者に1000ポンド以上を支払っているのです。そして、本来は実際にもらっているお給料の2倍の金額を約束され、1年に1回家族に会いに行くための飛行機代も貰えるはずなのですが、実行されていないようです。なぜなら、その部屋の人たちの誰も実際に契約を読んでいないのです。文字が読める人は、たったの2人しかいませんでした。
出稼ぎ労働者たちは一旦アラブ首長国連邦に着くと、ヘルスケアもその他のいろいろな基本的権利も手に入れることはできません。牛よりちょっと扱いが良いぐらいです。そして、彼らのスポンサーになった企業は、彼らが働き続けるように、パスポートと1か月か2か月分の賃金をキープするのです。なので、
。1か月に400ディルハム（62ポンド）しか稼げないというのに…。

The IP address and domain name do not directly identify the sender , but if the IP address or domain name is acquired from a registering organization , a database search of the address or domain name can eventually lead to the contact information on file with the registration organizations .
A sender 's IP address or domain name which is not registered will not prevent the transmission of the e-mail ; however , the identity of the sender may not be discoverable through a database search and use of registration contact information .
The first 20 pages of the decision , which are all about legal standing , jurisdiction , and overbreadth , made my eyes glaze over .
I 'm not analyzing those at all except to point out that on most of those issues , the lower court came to exactly the opposite conclusion from that of the Virginia Supreme Court , and there is no reason to think that the higher court is any more likely to be " correct " than the lower court ( even granting the assumption that there is an objectively " correct " answer to these questions ) .
Any time you feel intimidated by " experts , " it 's helpful to step back and ask whether the alleged experts even agree with each other Page 21 is where the technical stuff starts that we can tear apart directly .
The decision says , in talking about the transmission of e-mail :
These are statements that are only true if you play some kind of parlor game to find a way to read them as " true , " not statements that indicate the court knew what was going on .
To review : IP addresses in the U.S. are generally allocated by ARIN in blocks to Internet service providers and Web hosting companies ; these companies then lease the IP addresses to their customers .
You can look up an IP address with ARIN to determine which ISP or hosting company has been assigned that particular block , but the ISP or hosting company generally wo n't tell you the identity of their customer who has leased it from them .
And anybody can register a domain , but most domain registrars give you the option of registering the domain anonymously , so that only the registrar knows the owner 's true identity .
So the court 's statement that a database search " can eventually lead " to contact information is correct only if you clarify that it " can " lead there , but it usually wo n't .
As a finding of fact , this is 100 % true , and about as useful as " Obama might win in November .
Or he might not . "
But it 's impossible to defend what the court says next :
As shown by the record , because e-mail transmission protocol requires entry of an IP address and domain name for the sender , the only way such a speaker can publish an anonymous e-mail is to enter a false IP address or domain name .
Therefore ... registered IP addresses and domain names discoverable through searchable data bases and registration documents " necessarily result [ ] in a surrender of [ the speaker 's ] anonymity . "
Now , there are two possible definitions of " anonymity " to consider : ( 1 ) you can be anonymous to the extent that ordinary citizens reading your content cannot determine your identity without a subpoena ; or ( 2 ) you can be anonymous to the extent that even the government , armed with subpoenas and wiretaps , can never find out who you are .
But under either interpretation of the word , the court 's statement that " the only way such a speaker can publish an anonymous e-mail is to enter a false IP address or domain name , " is wrong .
By default , almost all Internet users are already anonymous in the first sense , even without using forged headers or other tricks in their e-mails .
When you send e-mail through your own Internet service provider 's mail server , or when you log on to Hotmail and send messages from a Hotmail account , or when you lease a dedicated server from a Web hosting company and use it to send mails , the messages do n't contain any more information about your true identity than you decide to put in them .
Only the government could ordinarily discover your identity in those cases , by looking at the IP address that the message was sent from , and subpoenaing the Internet service provider or hosting company for the identity of the person using that IP address at that time .
But there are even ways to be anonymous in the second sense -- such that not even the government could identify you -- without resorting to forged e-mail headers .
You can create Hotmail and Gmail accounts without giving the providers any of your true information .
When you send messages through those services , they pass along the IP address that you used to connect to their Web sites , but you can obscure your IP address as well , by using an anonymizing proxy or a service like Tor .
Elsewhere in their decision , the court indicated that what they really wanted to protect was the right to send anonymous bulk e-mails that were political or otherwise non-commercial .
But even by that standard , it 's still possible to use Hotmail and Gmail together with an anonymizing proxy ( the mail services do impose limits on how many messages each account can send in a day , but if you want to send bulk mails badly enough , you can always sign up for multiple accounts ) .
And if you only care about staying beyond the reach of U.S. subpoena power , you can always sign up for a dedicated host overseas and send the bulk mails from there .
Apart from the court 's misstatement that forged headers are the only way to publish anonymously in e-mail , there is the incorrect presumption that forged headers actually do afford anonymity in either of the senses given above .
The court wrote , " [ T ] he only way such a speaker can publish an anonymous e-mail is to enter a false IP address or domain name . "
But while it is possible to enter any domain you want in your return e-mail address when you send an e-mail , the court apparently did n't know what it was talking about when it referred to " entering a false IP address . "
You ca n't just " enter " any arbitrary IP address when sending an e-mail .
If user@domain name.com receives an e-mail , the mail server at domain name.com has to receive the message over a connection made from some other machine , and the domain name.com mail server can always see the IP address of the machine on the other end of the connection .
Normally , this machine on the other end would be the mail server of the sender 's Internet service provider .
Or if the sender has leased a dedicated machine at a hosting company , that dedicated machine would be the one connecting to the domain name.com mail server .
Some desktop spamming programs let you turn your home computer into the sending mail server , so that it connects directly with the remote mail server to send the message .
In all of these cases , the receiving mail server can see the IP address of the sending machine , so a government subpoena would usually be enough to determine the sender 's identity .
( I know you all know this , but I have delusions that some helpful clerk will print out this article and explain this to the judge . )
When spammers " enter " false IP addresses in sending mails , that usually means entering made - up IP addresses in headers that are sent along with the contents of the message .
However , these would normally only have the effect of throwing someone off the trail who opened the message sent to user@domain name.com and was reading the headers manually .
Perhaps they would see some random IP addresses scattered in the headers , would go to ARIN and look up the hosting company or ISP that those IP addresses were assigned to , and would mistakenly file a complaint with that company .
But the domain name.com server can always see the true IP address that the message was received from , and for people who know how to read the headers properly , that IP address will be indicated in the headers as the address that connected to the domain name.com mail server to send the mail .
So the court 's statement that " the only way such a speaker can publish an anonymous e-mail is to enter a false IP address or domain name " is doubly wrong : because it 's easy to send e-mails anonymously without using forged headers , and because forged headers do not in fact provide the level of anonymity that the court said should be protected anyway .
The only way to truly obscure your identity by hijacking a third - party IP address without permission , would be to hack into a third party 's computer , by infecting a user 's home computer with a Trojan horse for example , and using it to send mail .
Presumably the court was not contemplating that such an activity should be considered legal , even as a means of sending political speech .
It would presumably be unconstitutional for an anti-spam law to prohibit anonymous political e-mails which attempted to hide the sender 's identity -- that is after all what " anonymous " means !
You could n't pass a law outlawing Tor , for example .
But the Virginia law does n't apply to senders merely trying to hide their identity , it applies only to the use of computers " to falsify or forge electronic mail transmission information or other routing information in any manner in connection with the transmission of unsolicited bulk electronic mail " ( emphasis added ) .
There is a difference between obscuring one 's identity ( which Tor and anonymous remailers allow you to do ) , and actively trying to frame an existing third party by using forged headers to make the mail appear that it came from somewhere else , especially when sending bulk mail , which is likely to generate complaints whether it 's commercial or not .
By contrast , the Washington anti-spam law prohibits any mail which " misrepresents or obscures " the origin of the message ( emphasis added ) .
This is broader and could be construed to include a wider range of things , such as the use of overseas IP addresses to send bulk mail on behalf of a U.S. company , or the use of anonymously registered domains to hide the sender 's identity .
It would probably be unconstitutional to prohibit these obscuring techniques for non-commercial anonymous e-mail , which is why the Washington law specifically applies only to commercial messages .
But here I 'm getting into issues like constitutional law where different experts might disagree .
The clear - cut technical fact is that , contrary to the court 's ruling , forged e-mail headers do not provide true anonymity when sending mail , whereas there are other , legal , ways of sending mail that do make the sender truly anonymous .
What is frustrating about the court 's misstatements about IP addresses , domain names , and anonymity , is that the judge is obviously intelligent and could have understood the concepts if they had been explained correctly to him .
I held some misconceptions for a long time myself about domain names and IP addresses , because the first explanations I read were incomplete or wrong , or I did n't understand them .
But the mistakes in the ruling would have been caught if the judge had just showed a draft to an Internet guru and said , " Hey , can you check if there 's anything wrong here ? "
I know , I know , that 's " just not done " ( and there are probably formal rules in most states against showing a draft of a ruling to a third party before publishing it , even if the third party reviewer is sworn to secrecy , as they should be ) .
But there 's nothing stopping the judge from asking a technical expert during the trial , " It seems to me that the only way to publish anonymously on the Internet would be to use forged headers in e-mail .
Can you tell me if that 's right before I go too far down that line of reasoning ? "
I 've appeared before judges in Small Claims court who did ask questions about any part of the technical issues that they wanted to understand , and were even willing to revise some prior misconceptions .
But all of them , even the open - minded ones , proceed by gathering information during the trial , and then in the conclusion , spell out their argument and their ruling ( during which time you 're not allowed to interrupt ) , which is then set in stone unless you appeal .
I 've never seen a judge say , " Here 's the line of reasoning in my head right now , and my tentative conclusion .
Is there anything in that chain of reasoning that you want to dispute , before I make it final ?
I am not promising to change my mind just because you disagree with something .
But I will take it into account . "
This is essentially what scientists do when they submit their papers for peer review before publishing them , to minimize the chance of making an error .
Judges could do the same thing -- if not formally , because they 're not allowed to show opinions to third parties , then at least informally , by running their ideas past the experts assembled in their courtroom -- to reduce the chance of making a mistake .
But have you ever heard of a judge doing that ?
The Virginia judges probably did about as well as one could be expected to do , having learned all these technical terms only recently , and then withdrawing to their chambers to form an argument without any feedback from any technical experts .
So , given the technical howlers that ended up in the ruling , the moral is that forming an argument in isolation from experts is probably not the right way to go about it .
IF you ask Adam Fulrath who is the love of his life , he will barely blink an eye before responding : Parappa .
Mr. Fulrath , a 37 - year - old design director at Time Out New York , keeps five photographs of Parappa , a shorthaired , bicolored , mixed - breed cat , on his desktop .
He knows that it might be considered a little weird that a grown man would be so enamored with his kitty , but Mr. Fulrath , who is into video games and comic books and calls himself a “ straight , geeky guy , ” does n’t care .
“ She ’s my primary relationship , ” he said .
Mr. Fulrath is one of a growing number of single  and yes , heterosexual  men who seem to be coming out of the cat closet and unabashedly embracing their feline side .
To that end , they are posting photographs and videos of their little buddies on YouTube and on Web sites like menandcats.com , and Twittering about them to anyone who will listen .
Indeed , it seems that man ’s best friend is no longer a golden retriever , but a cuddly cat named Fluffy .
This movement , such as it is , is in direct contrast to the most notable in the recent spate of reports about the relationship between a man and a cat , which were far darker ; they focused on a young actor who was recently on trial in New York City for killing his girlfriend ’s cat  he said it attacked him  only to have a jury decide after several days that it could not reach a verdict .

Today in Charlotte , NC Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama expanded his attack on John McCain and the economy to include McCain ’s support for deregulating the health insurance industry .
He said that McCain wants to continue on the same disastrous path that created the economic crisis .
He painted McCain as dangerous because of his lack of knowledge about the economy , “ We ’re now seeing the disastrous consequences of this philosophy all around us – on Wall Street as well as Main Street .
And yet Senator McCain , who candidly admitted not long ago that he does n’t know as much about economics as he should , wants to keep going down the same , disastrous path . ”
The Democrat then connected McCain , deregulation , and healthcare , “ He calls himself “ fundamentally a deregulator , ” when reckless deregulation and lack of oversight is a big part of the problem .
And here ’s the really scary part .
Now this “ Great Deregulator ” wants to turn his attention to health care .
He wrote in the current issue of a magazine – the current issue – that we need to open up health care to – quote – “ more vigorous nationwide competition , as we have done over the last decade in banking . ”
That ’s right , John McCain says he wants to do for health care what Washington has done for banking .

“ Over the years , states have come up with common sense rules to make sure that insurance companies are n’t just looking out for their own profits , but for your health .
And we cannot toss those rules out the window .
As anyone who has health care knows , the one thing we do n’t need to do is give insurance companies an even freer hand over what they charge , who they cover , and what they ’ll cover , ” Obama said .
He stressed that deregulation ca n’t be allowed to spread to healthcare , “ The radical idea that government has no role to play in protecting ordinary Americans has wreaked havoc on our economy .
And we cannot let this dangerous philosophy spread to health care .
What we ’ve seen over the last few days is nothing less than the final verdict on this failed philosophy . ”
Obama seems to have hit his stride on the issue of the economy .
The campaign has found a message that they can use against McCain with voters every single day .
The complete bungling of the issue of the federal bailout is something that the McCain campaign is still reeling from , and we have reached the point in the campaign where voters are paying attention and the time for gimmicks and distractions is over .
McCain ca n’t hide anymore .
He has to talk about the issues that matter , and so far , he is off to a very poor start .

“ Internships really are a great way to test new water and gain new skills , ” said Ms. Levit , who is also president of Inspiration at Work , a career consulting firm in Chicago .
“ The benefit comes from immersion ; doing is the best way to learn . ”
Learning was exactly the objective for Lisa Tresmontan when she agreed earlier this year to take a low - paying internship with Joshua Charles Catering in San Mateo , Calif .
In this position , she works nights and weekends helping Josh Feinbloom , the company ’s chief executive , with everything from food preparation to event planning .
Earlier this fall , Ms. Tresmontan oversaw every aspect of a customer ’s wedding reception .
While the moonlighting gig is a lot of work on top of her full - time job as associate sourcing manager for the Pottery Barn , she said she was n’t ready to take a leap into the catering business without checking it out first .
“ I wanted to make sure I liked it , and I ’ve actually liked it more than I thought I would , ” said Ms. Tresmontan , 31 .
“ The hope is that someday , when I ’m ready , I can leave the corporate world behind me and commit full time to catering . ”
The experience of a midcareer internship has already paid dividends for David Rose , a 40 - year - old music lover .
Following an extensive career in business development , Mr. Rose was laid off from an employer in the software development industry in 2005 and took a 30 - day unpaid internship with Yep Roc Records , a small record label in Haw River , N.C.
During this time , he worked on some complex recording contracts and learned what he described as a “ boatload of insider knowledge ” about the industry as a whole .
Earlier this year , after a stint as the director of business development at a nearby software company , he put this knowledge to good use and started KnowTheMusicBiz.com , a service - oriented Web site for independent musicians .

Are you a hardcore geek that wants to let everyone know of your love for gadgetry even before they set foot in your house ?
Sure , you could put down a doormat with the word “ welcome ” written in binary , but some people might miss it .
What you could do is change out your doorbell with one made to look like the enter key from a keyboard .
This is one of those designs that just makes you chuckle when you see it .
It seems like a perfect match , the word “ enter ” on a doorbell ; it just does n’t get much better than that .
This is only a concept idea , but I ’m sure if you had an old keyboard , a Dremel and some glue you could make a pretty decent one for yourself .

In the real world of political ads , McCain and his surrogates are shouting ugly insults at Barack Obama .
He is accused of saying that US airstrikes have killed innocents .
This is true and McCain said it , too .
They say he was on a committee with a professor who used to be a Weatherman 40 years ago .
And …?
How nonsensical these attacks are is demonstrated by the inability of McCain to repeat them to Obama ’s face .
What sort of allegation wo n’t hold up in a debate ?
A flimsy one .
One with the form of propaganda .
McCain ’s nasty personal attacks on Obama were apparently felt by his campaign to be inappropriate to a live appearance .
They feared such smears would look mean in the mouth of a presidential aspirant .
But then why does it not look mean for McCain to “ approve ” the scurrilous smears ?
Does he think we can not see him ?

Now Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson has proposed a $ 700 billion bailout of the entire industry .
I do think that some sort of sweeping measures needs to be instituted ; otherwise , having the sword of Damocles will hang over every financial firm for far too long .
That being said , his refusal to doing anything more other than give Wall Street firms a ' Get out of jail free ' card is bothersome , but not surprising : before he was at Treasury , Paulson was CEO at Goldman Sachs after Jon Corzine 's departure in 1999 up until his appointment in 2006 ... just before the housing bubble burst .
Put in plain English , if Congress wants to hold banks accountable for their actions , there has to be some punitive action .
Otherwise , the same thing is going to happen again - but on a bigger scale - as it did this time .
Looking back since the onset of the conservative ascendancy in politics - and the increasingly laissez - faire attitude taken towards regulating the financial industry - each financial crisis that has hit the markets has been on a bigger , grander scale each time .
Whether it was the real estate bust and the ensuing RTC resolution in the late 1980s , or the Long Term Capital Management blowup in the late 1990s ( a hedge fund that had to be bailed out by a consortium of banks because of leveraged bets went awry when Russia was hit with a financial crisis ) , the lessons were n't learned .
What we see happening today is a confluence of the two problems that led up to those crises - lax lending standards and the making of huge bets on borrowed cash .
For Wall Street , there is always plenty of talk about managing risk and doing due diligence , but at the end of the day , it 's always about making as much money as possible , as fast as possible .
That 's why there was shoddy documentation done on subprime mortgages , less - than - adequate analysis of the securitization of all kinds of debts into structures such as CDOs , and a poor job done by the rating agencies in properly evaluating these complex derivative securities .
And when the only way you had of valuing a great many of these securities was plugging them into proprietary computer models instead of seeing a market price - because they were illiquid instruments that were thinly traded - it was inevitable once things blew up that contagion was impossible to avoid .
In this situation , no one really knows what to do , but what Paulson has proposed is simply to throw money at the problem .
Yes , whether we like it or not , Wall Street has to receive some kind of government assistance in order to prevent prolonging the credit crisis longer - or risk dragging the worldwide economy into a deep recession .
But the fact that there is not going to be any significant increase in transparency or regulation - or , more importantly , punitive action taken against irresponsible banks who got us here in the first place - suggests that we are going to end up back here sooner or later .
The end result of the makeover by the financial industry is to concentrate even greater pools of risk in fewer hands .
Be thankful that this time , it was non -deposit - taking investment banks that took the fall .
Imagine if it was a Citigroup or a BoA that had been the victims ... it would have been worse .
While it 's now taken as conventional wisdom that it 's safer having an investment bank tied to a deposit - taking retail / commercial bank , the main effect is to allow the investment bank to take on even more risk than before - with a bigger asset base , they can borrow at even higher levels .
The Glass - Steagall
Act was meant to prevent that from happening , but its repeal in 1999 ( via Gramm - Leach - Bliley ) means that customer 's deposits can be used to effectively fund losses in riskier parts of the bank .
Instead of separating the units - which is what UBS did with its investment bank , putting it out to sea without the ability to fund its losses from the much more profitable wealth management unit - there 's now a move to further consolidate .
All it means is that next time , it will be even worse .
Bailing out Wall Street has to happen in some form or another , but they have to be held accountable for their actions .
That is Congress ' job , and they should not simply acquiesce to the wishes of Paulson and Ben Bernanke , who have ad - hoc'ed their way through this whole crisis - mainly by throwing lots of money at the problem .
If Congress does n't stand up to the bailout in its current state , do n't be surprised if the same thing happens 5 , 10 , 20 years down the road ... because in the financial industry , history will likely repeat itself .
Walrus - Graph Visualization Tool
Walrus is a tool for interactively visualizing large directed graphs in three - dimensional space .
By employing a fisheye - like distortion , it provides a display that simultaneously shows local detail and the global context .
Source Code Available
The Walrus source code is available on GitHub under the GNU GPL .
Description
Walrus is a tool for interactively visualizing large directed graphs in three - dimensional space .
It is technically possible to display graphs containing a million nodes or more , but visual clutter , occlusion , and other factors can diminish the effectiveness of Walrus as the number of nodes , or the degree of their connectivity , increases .
Thus , in practice , Walrus is best suited to visualizing moderately sized graphs that are nearly trees .
A graph with a few hundred thousand nodes and only a slightly greater number of links is likely to be comfortable to work with .
Walrus computes its layout based on a user - supplied spanning tree .
Because the specifics of the supplied spanning tree greatly affect the resulting display , it is crucial that the user supply a spanning tree that is both meaningful for the underlying data and appropriate for the desired insight .
The prominence and orderliness that Walrus gives to the links in the spanning tree , in contrast to all other links , means that an arbitrarily chosen spanning tree may create a misleading or ineffective visualization .
Ideally , the input graphs should be inherently hierarchical .
Walrus uses 3D hyperbolic geometry to display graphs under a fisheye - like distortion .
At any moment , the amount of magnification , and thus the level of visible detail , varies across the display .
This allows the user to examine the fine details of a small area while always having a view of the whole graph available as a frame of reference .
Graphs are rendered inside a sphere that contains the Euclidean projection of 3D hyperbolic space .
Points within the sphere are magnified according to their radial distance from the center .
Objects near the center are magnified , while those near the boundary are shrunk .
The amount of magnification decreases continuously and at an accelerated rate from the center to the boundary , until objects are reduced to zero size at the latter , which represents infinity .
By bringing different parts of a graph to the magnified central region , the user can examine every part of the graph in detail .
Applicability
Please note that Walrus currently has the following requirements , restrictions , or limitations which may render it unsuitable for a given problem domain or dataset :
Only directed graphs are supported .

Walrus was developed and tested on a Sun Ultra 60 with an Elite 3D card and 512MB of RAM , running Solaris 7 , a box graciously donated by Sun .

Walrus differs from their product in at least three ways .
We work in 3D instead of 2D , use the Klein model of hyperbolic geometry instead of the Poincare , and use a very different layout algorithm .
Laying out graphs in 3D is challenging , as occlusion along the line of sight diminishes some of the benefits of the additional dimension .
Hence , 3D layout algorithms can differ considerably from similar 2D algorithms .
Walrus uses a modified version of the H3 layout algorithm designed by Munzner .

Petraeus Talk Bolsters Obama
Created : October 08 , 2008 16:16 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Gen. David Petraeus ( WDCpix )
Throughout Sen. John McCain ’s presidential campaign , the Republican nominee has wrapped himself in the mantle of U.S. Army Gen. David H. Petraeus , proclaiming himself the leading advocate of the former commanding general in Iraq who devised last year ’s controversial troop surge .
Yet during a talk Wednesday about Iraq at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative Washington policy organization , Petraeus repeatedly made statements that bolstered the foreign - policy proposals of Sen.
Barack Obama , McCain ’s Democratic rival , or cut against McCain ’s own lines .
Petraeus relinquished command in Iraq last month .
He assumes responsibility for U.S. Central Command later this month , putting him in charge of U.S. forces in the Middle East and South Asia .

As a serving military officer , Petraeus attempted to avoid any explicit political discussion .
“ I ’m not walking into minefields now , ” Petraeus said , to laughter , when asked a question that referred to Tuesday night ’s presidential debate .
In fact , the general averred that he did n’t watch the debate .
Yet Petraeus , whether intentionally or not , often waded into areas of dispute between Obama and McCain involving Afghanistan , negotiating with adversaries and other recent campaign controversies .
Each time , the general either lent tacit support to Obama or denied tacit support to McCain .
Unbidden , Petraeus discussed whether his strategy in Iraq — protecting the population while cleaving apart the insurgency through reconciliation efforts to crush the remaining hard - core enemies — could also work in Afghanistan .
The question has particular salience as Petraeus takes over U.S. Central Command , which will put him at the helm of all U.S. troops in the Middle East and South Asia , thereby giving him a large role in the Afghanistan war .
“ Some of the concepts used in Iraq are transplantable [ to Afghanistan ] while others perhaps are not , ” he said .
“ Every situation is unique . ”
Petraeus pointed to efforts by Hamid Karzai ’s government to negotiate a deal with the Taliban that would potentially bring some Taliban members back to power , saying that if they are “ willing to reconcile , ” it would be “ a positive step . ”
In saying that , Petraeus implicitly allied with U.S. Army Gen. David McKiernan , the U.S. commander in Afghanistan .
Last week , McKiernan rejected the idea of replicating the blend of counterinsurgency strategy employed in Iraq .
“ The word that I do n’t use in Afghanistan is the word ‘ surge , ’ ” McKiernan said , opting against recruiting Pashtun tribal fighters to supplement Afghan security forces against Al Qaeda and the Taliban .
“ There are countless other differences between Iraq and Afghanistan , ” he added .
McCain , however , has argued that the Afghanistan war is ripe for a direct replication of Petraeus ’ Iraq strategy of population - centric counterinsurgency .
“ Sen. Obama calls for more troops , ” McCain said in the Sept. 26 debate , “ but what he does n’t understand , it ’s got to be a new strategy , the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq .
It ’s going to have to be employed in Afghanistan . ”
McCain qualified that statement in Tuesday ’s debate , but clung to it while discussing Afghanistan and Pakistan .
“ Gen. Petraeus had a strategy , ” McCain said , “ the same strategy — very , very different , because of the conditions and the situation — but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in Iraq .
And that is to get the support of the people . ”
Petraeus also came out unambiguously in his talk at Heritage for opening communications with America ’s adversaries , a position McCain is attacking Obama for endorsing .
Citing his Iraq experience , Petraeus said , “ You have to talk to enemies . ”
He added that it was necessary to have a particular goal for discussion and to perform advance work to understand the motivations of his interlocutors .
All that was the subject of one of the most contentious tussles between McCain and Obama in the first presidential debate , with Obama contending that his intent to negotiate with foreign adversaries without “ precondition ” did not mean that he would neglect diplomatic “ preparation . ”
McCain , apparently perceiving an opportunity for attack , Tuesday again used Obama ’s comments to attack his judgment .
“ Sen. Obama , without precondition , wants to sit down and negotiate with them , without preconditions , ” McCain said , referring to Iran .
Yet Petraeus emphasized throughout his lecture that reaching out to insurgent groups — some “ with our blood on their hands , ” he said — was necessary to the ultimate goal of turning them against irreconcilable enemies like Al Qaeda in Iraq .
Petraeus favorably cited the example of one of his British deputies , who in a previous assignment had to negotiate with Martin McGuiness of the Irish Republican Army , responsible for killing some of the British commander ’s troops .
The British officer , Petraeus said , occasionally wanted to “ reach across the table ” and choke his former adversary but understood that such negotiations were key to ending a war .
Petraeus reflected at length on the need to “ take away and hold the strongholds and safe havens ” possessed by Al Qaeda in Iraq during 2007 and 2008 , saying that without doing so , the rest of the counterinsurgency strategy “ wo n’t work . ”
While he did not initially make reference to Al Qaeda ’s much greater presence in the Federal Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan , it was hard not to hear the overtones of the current argument over Pakistan policy between Obama and McCain .
McCain has attacked Obama for explicitly stating conditions under which he would order U.S. military action against the senior leadership of Al Qaeda in Pakistan , deriding that by saying Obama is “ going to attack Pakistan , ” while advocating that the Pakistanis perform the task instead of U.S. troops .
Barbara Starr of CNN attempted to draw Petraeus out further , asking him about the importance of capturing or killing Osama bin Laden , believed to be in the tribal areas of Pakistan .
Petraeus did not tip his hand on advocating anything , saying merely , “ clearly , Osama bin Laden remains very important , if for no other reason than sheer symbolic importance , ” and warning that “ decapitating ” Al Qaeda would not end the threat from a jihadist entity that he compared to a “ syndicate . ”
He did , however , say that he was encouraged by what he called signs that the Pakistanis “ increasingly see an existential threat to their country being in FATA , ” referring to the tribal areas — something that might gel with McCain ’s stated preference .
Naturally , since Petraeus centered his hour - plus talk on progress in Iraq , McCain could fairly claim to be closer to the general than Obama — who opposed the surge — on the subject .
But , particularly given the Republican - friendly audience , it was remarkable as well what Petraeus did not say .
Unlike his three recent rounds of congressional testimony , Petraeus did not discuss withdrawal from Iraq .
He did not issue warnings that withdrawal — which Obama and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki support , while McCain instead calls for “ victory ” — would lead to a downward spiral of violence .
While the general warned that there were several “ potential storm clouds ” threatening to undermine progress , he said that Iraq was on a more stable footing since his last appearance on Capitol Hill in April .
He never said terms like “ victory ” or “ success ” that McCain uses , and which the GOP nominee frequently chides Obama for avoiding .
The Heritage Foundation crowd clearly loved hearing from Petraeus .
The think tank ’s executive vice president , Philip Truluck , referred to Petraeus ’ “ history - making service in Iraq ” before the audience greeted the general with the first of two prolonged standing ovations .
A questioner proclaimed himself “ honored and proud to be in the same room with you . ”
Petraeus has repeatedly averred that he has no interest in running for president .
“ I think that Gen. Sherman had it right , ” he told Fox News ’s Chris Wallace in December , when asked if he ’d run , referring to Sherman ’s famous declaration that if nominated he would not run , and if elected , he would not serve .
But given McCain ’s recent lagging poll numbers , perhaps many at Heritage hope Petraeus will change his mind before 2012 .
Belgium has launched a drive to reshape its institutions , following months of government paralysis .
At the heart of the crisis is a tension between the Dutch - speaking Flemish and Francophones .
In the final of a series of articles , Henri Astier asks if Belgium can remain united , and considers the lessons for other multi-ethnic entities .
Flemish separatists are burning to tear up the Belgian constitution Earlier this month the Flemish sports minister suggested restructuring Belgium 's football federation , creating Francophone and Dutch - speaking wings .
The plan drew loud boos from French - speakers .
The vice - president of national champions Standard Liege called it as a " dangerous first step towards a split " - and threatened to make an even bigger step by joining the French league if it went ahead .
The row neatly encapsulates what some fear could be the unravelling of Belgium itself .
The events might unfold along the following lines : the autonomy - minded Flemish , who are richer and more numerous than French - speakers , grow impatient with protracted devolution talks ; in next year 's regional election Flemish nationalists do well ; alarmed Francophones seek solace in a union with France .
A recent poll by Le Soir newspaper suggested that 49 % of people in Wallonia , the French - speaking half of Belgium , want to become French if their country breaks up .
" There is a vicious circle where Francophones feel that radicalisation is gathering pace in Flanders , " says Olivier Mouton , Le Soir 's political editor .
" They brace themselves for Flemish independence and become radicalised themselves . "
Flemish Copernicus
The paradox is that separation would happen without either side actively seeking it .
Only about 10 % of Flemish voters want independence .
Support for unity is overwhelming in Wallonia .
For me the most important level will be the regional level
Kris Peeters
Minister - President of Flanders Could Belgians really be sleepwalking towards separation ?
Flemish leaders say they only want to reform the Belgian state , not dismantle it .
" I am not in favour of the independence , " Kris Peeters , Flanders ' Minister - President , told the BBC News website .
" Solidarity " between Flanders and other regions will remain , he insists .
However his stated goal is a " Copernican revolution " where federal powers are greatly reduced and the main decisions taken by regions .
" For me the most important level will be the regional level , " he says .
Mr Peeters ' career reflects this belief in the regions ' supremacy .
He spurned a seat in the Belgian parliament .
Asked what he would do if offered a key federal ministry he says unhesitatingly : " I would turn it down too . "
And his description of the current " dialogue between the communities " points to his ideal of quasi - sovereign entities : " We have two delegations , like two separate states discussing a treaty . "
Anonymous celebrities Some commentators believe that the dynamic of Belgian politics lead the French and Dutch speakers away from each other .
The changes you bring to the political build - up of a country have a long - term snowballing effect
Gie Goris
Editor , Mo Magazine Following devolution reforms over the past 45 years , all parties are now either Dutch - speaking or French - speaking .
Gie Goris , editor of Mo magazine , notes that countries which accept ethnically based politics , like Sri Lanka , are inherently unstable .
Belgians are not about to kill each , Mr Goris admits , but they should be wary of ever more devolution : " The changes you bring to the political build - up of a country have a long - term snowballing effect . "
Belgium has no common public sphere to speak of .
The communities do n't watch the same TV channels .
BELGIUM BY NUMBERS 10.5 million people Flanders : 6 million people Wallonia : 3,5 million people Brussels : 1 million people
Belgium 's devolution conundrum Celebrities from one side can walk totally anonymously across the " linguistic border " - as it is tellingly called .
" You have a whole different cultural universe in the north and the south of the country , " says Yves Desmet , political commentator for the Dutch - language De Morgen newspaper .
Differences are striking in both big and small ways .
Although the railways are federal , train tickets are not bilingual - in Flanders they are in Dutch only , while tickets for the same journeys printed in Wallonia are in French .
Health habits also vary widely .
French - speakers , like most southern Europeans , are heavy users of antibiotics and expensive diagnostic procedures such as MRI scans , while the Flemish tend to frown on these , as do most northern Europeans .
Digital divide
To be sure , some things still unite Belgians .
They drink the same beers .
They all cheered the mixed team that won silver for Belgium in the women 's 4x100 m Olympic relay in Beijing .
Belgium 's successful relay team enjoyed cross-community support
The king commands respect on both sides - although his Flemish subjects are more lukewarm in their affection .
In economic matters , the picture is mixed .
Flanders and Wallonia are each other 's main trading partner , but in the booming technology sector contact is limited .
Nonillion , an up - and - coming IT firm based in Ghent , does not have a single customer in Wallonia .
Chief executive Rudi Van den Bossche says French is not a requirement for his staff .
" Most of our customers ask for bilingual - meaning Dutch and English , " he says .
In Brussels , on the other hand , bilingualism tends increasingly to be the norm .
Still , the overall picture is one of division .
" If you were a Martian and read the Flemish newspapers and the Walloon newspapers you would think they 're describing two different countries , " says De Morgen 's Yves Desmet .
You say you want a revolution
But does this continued estrangement mean that Belgium is doomed ?
Many commentators do not think so .
With us , rupture is never possible because compromise must always be reached
Olivier Chastel
Deputy foreign minister First there is the question of Brussels .
The capital is a region in its own right , distinct from both Flanders and Wallonia .
It is also richer than both , as well as the seat of the EU and Nato .
As a result , neither side can accept a takeover of the other on Brussels .
And without it , each is a marginalised hinterland .
The status quo is thus the best option for both .
Moreover , Belgium 's proportional representation voting system is a big hurdle for those seeking radical change .
In a first - past - the - post systems , a winner clearly takes charge .
But Belgian leaders have to cobble coalitions with groups from both sides of the divide .
" When [ President Nicolas ]
Sarkozy is elected in France , he can implement a policy of ' rupture ' .
But with us , rupture is never possible because compromise must always be reached with other parties , " says Belgian deputy Foreign Minister Olivier Chastel .
Revolutions , Copernican or otherwise , are mightily difficult to bring about in Belgium .
Muddling through According to Dave Sinardet , a political scientist at Antwerp University , the fact that Belgium 's communities lead largely separate lives , and have no great affection for each other , need not spell the end of the country .
Flemish and Walloons give their views on tensions in Belgium
In pictures
" These things are also true of the European Union and are not a problem for its continued existence , " he says .
This raises an interesting point about parallels between Belgium and the EU .
The country was long regarded as a model for nations living in harmony under common institutions .
Then , over the past year , the Belgian stalemate was seen as a reflection of the EU 's divisions and the travails of its reform treaty .
The real parallel , however , may be neither rosy nor gloomy , but bitter - sweet .
In both Belgium and the EU , shared institutions seem able to muddle through despite indifference from their constituent nations - rather like old couples who do n't talk but stay together because separation is more trouble than it is worth .
Federalists both in Belgium and Europe might see this as too negative an argument for union - but it is a comfort of sorts .

Treasury , FDIC Crafting Plan to Rework Millions of Mortgages
Officials with the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. are crafting a plan under which the government would guarantee the mortgages of as many as 3 million homeowners now struggling to avoid foreclosure , according to three sources familiar with the discussions .
Under the program being discussed , the lender would agree to reduce borrowers ’ monthly payments , for example by lowering the interest rate or principal of a mortgage loan , based on the homeowner ’s ability to pay .
These reconfigured loans could help homeowners avert foreclosure .
To attract financial institutions to the program , the government would then guarantee to repay the lender for a portion of its loss if the borrower defaulted on the reconfigured loan .
The mortgage guarantee program would vastly expand the role of the Treasury Department in helping homeowners , while at the same time ensuring some return for lenders .
It would cost between $ 40 billion and $ 50 billion , sources said .
The program is being discussed as members of Congress are voicing frustrations that the $ 700 billion rescue program thusfar has been aimed at helping banks , but not homeowners .
While Treasury and FDIC officials have reached an agreement on the principles of the program , the White House is resisting , according to the sources , who declined to be identified because the negotiations are ongoing .

QUEBEC CITY – Despite criticism that his government has n't done enough to deal with climate change here in Canada , Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced today $ 100 million to help poor countries deal with the pressing environmental issue .
Harper made the announcement during the closing press conference of the Summit of la Francophonie , which wrapped up this afternoon in Quebec City .
The Francophonie is an organization of 55 countries where French is a spoken language , largely comprised of developing countries in Africa that were once colonized by France or Belgium .
The money will be distributed this fiscal year primarily through international development organizations , Harper said .
" Those monies are to be distributed almost exclusively to countries that are n't major contributors to climate change , or major sources of greenhouse gas emissions , " Harper said , " but nonetheless will be affected " by climate change .
Targeted regions include the poorest countries in Africa , the Caribbean and the south Pacific , to minimize the impact of climate change .
Harper said it has n't been decided yet exactly what programs the money will be used for , but emphasized that it 's " not a mitigation fund .
It 's an adaptation fund . "
The Harper government has rejected the original greenhouse gas targets of the Kyoto Protocol as unattainable .
Kyoto called for a 6 per cent cut in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2012 .
Canada 's emission levels have risen 27 per cent since 1990 .
With respect to Kyoto , Harper would only say that his government is participating in post - Kyoto negotiations .
Earlier this summer , Harper hailed G - 8 leaders for agreeing to a 50 per cent greenhouse gas reduction by 2050 .
" Our government has always been convinced we must find a concrete and truly planetary solution to climate change , " Harper said .
" All emitting countries must contribute to this solution , and Canada will do its part .
We are conscious of the fact developing countries can afford to do more . "
The Francophonie yesterday spend its time discussing the promotion and facilitation of the French language around the world .
Previous days were spent primarily on the global financial crisis , and delegates here supported France 's call for a summit on the reorganization of capitalism in the face of unregulated markets .

( NOTE FROM JOHN :
This may sound fun and silly , but it ’s actually quite serious stuff .
The conventional wisdom is , and I agree with it , that Americans vote for who they like in their gut , who they ’d like to watch a game with , have a beer , share dinner .
And while the numbers for Obama and McCain are close , though Obama is ahead , Obama intrigues people on the right whereas McCain horrifies people on the left .
That ’s interesting , in terms of how it might play with independents .
Cuz let ’s face it , would you rather hang out having a beer with someone around your age , or with your grandpa ? )
And if Obama can help my Buckeyes learn how to quit choking in big games ( besides against Michigan ) all the better .
What is especially interesting about this new poll is that even normal Republican voters understand that McCain ca n’t control his temper .
Democrats have struggled with the “ likeability ” factor in the last few campaigns but this year Obama has won over Americans .
The Factor web framework was recently redeveloped and my previous post on the topic is out of date .
I 'm re-learning how to write Factor web applications as I work through a simple app I 'm building .
At first I was overwhelmed by the large number of features in the new framework , but once I got a bit of an understanding I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to put an application together .
Starting the web server has n't changed much .
Start a web server running on port 8888 in a background thread :
USING : http.server threads ; [ 8888 httpd ] in - thread
A web application is written as a bunch of responders .
Each responder handles a request from the client browser .
An easy way of creating a responder is to create an ' action ' object .
An ' action ' object has a number of slots , one of which is called ' display ' .
Setting ' display ' to a quotation will cause that quotation to be called when the client browser makes a request .
The quotation should return a ' response ' object .
The ' response ' object defines what gets sent back to the client browser .
The ' body ' slot of the ' response ' object can be a string which is returned to the browser as the contents of the request .
So a basic responder is :
< action > [ < response > 200 >> code " text / plain " >> content - type " Hello World " >> body ] >> display
The web browser uses a global variable called ' main - responder ' as the first responder to try when a request is made .
If we set ' main - responder ' to the value of our responder then it immediately becomes available to a web request .
So our entire simple web application is :
USING : http http.server threads furnace.actions ; [ 8888 httpd ] in - thread < action > [ < response > 200 >> code " text / plain " >> content - type " Hello World " >> body ] >> display main - responder set- global
Visiting http://localhost:8888/ should display a page with ' Hello World ' as the text .
A responder that works just from the root of the URL is not very practical .
A dispatcher is an object that can acts as a responder that calls other responders based on part of the URL .
Here 's a dispatcher that calls one responder when / hello is requested , and another when / goodbye is requested .
USING : furnace.actions http http.server http.server.dispatchers threads ; [ 8888 httpd ] in - thread TUPLE : my - dispatcher < dispatcher ; my - dispatcher new - dispatcher < action > [ < response > 200 >> code " text / plain " >> content - type " Hello World " >> body ] >> display " hello " add - responder < action > [ < response > 200 >> code " text / plain " >> content - type " Goodbye World " >> body ] >> display " goodbye " add - responder main - responder set- global
First I create a tuple called ' my - dispatcher ' that inherits from the base dispatcher class .
The I create an instance of this using ' new - dispatcher ' , create my actions and add them under the paths ' hello ' and ' goodbye ' .
Writing response objects gets a bit tedious .
Factor provides two template systems that can be used to make writing web applications easier .
One is ' fhtml ' which existed in the previous web framework incarnation .
The other , chloe , is an XML based templating language , and is covered quite well in the Factor documentation .
To create an action that uses a Chloe template , create a ' page - action ' instead of an ' action ' .
Set the ' template ' slot of the page - action to be a two element array containing the dispatcher class and the template filename ( without the .xml extension ) :
USING : furnace.actions html.templates.chloe http http.server http.server.dispatchers threads ; [ 8888 httpd ] in - thread TUPLE : my - dispatcher < dispatcher ; my - dispatcher new - dispatcher < page - action > { my - dispatcher " main " } >> template " foo " add - responder main - responder set- global
When this ' / foo ' is accessed on the webserver , this action will run .
It will look for main.xml which needs to be a chloe template file .
Here 's a simple example template :
<?xml version = ' 1.0 ' ?> < t:chloe xmlns:t= " http://factorcode.org/chloe/1.0 " > < html > < body > < p > Hello !</p> </ body > </html > </t:chloe >
The chloe help goes into a lot of detail about how to use the template to substitute variable values , etc .
I 'll cover that in a later post .
The web framework has a lot of other features .
Sessions , Authentication , Database , Validation , etc .
Hopefully this will help you get started .
All the example above can be entered and run ( barring typo 's and unescaped html entities ) in a Factor listener .
Download it and try it !
Update :
There is a wiki page on the concatenative wiki with more information about the web framework .
The 2008 presidential election may see the highest participation in U.S. history .
Voter - registration organizations and local election boards have been overwhelmed by enthusiastic people eager to vote .
But not everyone is happy about this blossoming of democracy .
ACORN , the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , has become a lightning rod for the right wing .
ACORN ’s Web site notes that “ the electorate does not reflect the citizenry of the United States of America .
It skews whiter , older , more educated and more affluent than the citizenry as a whole . ”
Bertha Lewis , ACORN ’s lead organizer , told me : “ We organize low - and moderate - income people , usually folks who are minorities — African - Americans , Latinos , Asians and working - class white people .
And most of these folks have always been disenfranchised out of the electoral process . …
We ’ve registered 1.3 million new voters across the country over an 18 - month period of time .
We had over 13,000 hard - working voter - registration workers .
And we may have had a few bad apples , but I do n’t know any organization that did n’t . ”
Barack Obama himself was questioned about ACORN ’s problematic registrations .
He said : “ Having run a voter - registration drive , I know how problems arise .
This is typically a situation where ACORN probably paid people to get registrations , and these folks , not wanting to actually register people , because that ’s actually hard work , just went into a phone book or made up names and submitted false registrations to get paid .
So there ’s been fraud perpetrated on probably ACORN , if they paid these individuals and they actually did n’t do registrations .
But this is n’t a situation where there ’s actually people who are going to try to vote , because these are phony names . ”
ACORN has seen some clearly fraudulent registrations submitted , with names like “ Mickey Mouse ” turned in .
ACORN says it reviews all the registration forms .
However , it does not serve as the ultimate arbiter of which registrations are fraudulent .
In fact , ACORN cannot legally throw away any voter - registration cards .
It flags suspicious cards and submits them to the appropriate state election authority to make the judgment .
Republicans are increasingly alarmed at the shifting demographics of the United States .
Minorities tend to vote Democratic , and the United States is slowly becoming a majority minority country — by 2050 , whites will no longer represent a majority in the U.S.
As right - wing commentator Patrick Buchanan lamented in 2004 : “ In 1960 , when JFK defeated Nixon , America was a nation of 160 million , 90 percent white and 10 percent black , with a few million Hispanics and Asians sprinkled among us .
We were one nation , one people .
We worshiped the same God , spoke the same English language . ”
Buchanan ’s xenophobia highlights a political reality : Immigration and mobilization of the urban poor are shifting the electorate to the Democrats , especially in key swing states like New Mexico , Colorado , Florida and Ohio .
The federal Help America Vote Act was passed in 2002 in response to the electoral crisis of 2000 .
But it requires new voters to present identification at the polling place , which critics allege is a modern - day Jim Crow law .
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ( the son of the assassinated 1968 presidential candidate ) said recently : “ I have an ID , and most Americans have an ID .
But one out of every 10 Americans do n’t have a government - issued ID , because they do n’t travel abroad , so they do n’t have passports , and they do n’t drive a car , so they do n’t have driver ’s licenses .
The number rises to one in five when you ’re dealing with the African - American community . ”
The online Michigan Messenger revealed that Michigan Republicans were planning to use a list of people with foreclosed homes to purge voter rolls .
And a federal judge in Detroit has just ordered that 1,500 people be restored to the Michigan voter rolls , based on “ voter caging ” — purging people if mail to them is returned as undeliverable .
The scandal around the firing of U.S. attorneys , which ultimately led to the resignation of U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , was based largely on the refusal of the Republican prosecutors to pursue unfounded voter - fraud cases .
Citizen groups like Election Protection and Video the Vote are organizing to document and report problems at the polls on Nov. 4 .
It is more likely that they will see honest people denied the right to vote , purged from the voter rolls , than an attempt by Mickey Mouse to vote Obama .

IN December , Johnny Chung Lee , then a Ph.D. candidate , posted a five - minute video on YouTube that became an Internet sensation .
The video showed how , in a few easy steps , the Nintendo Wii remote controller  or “ Wiimote ”  could transform a normal video screen into a virtual reality display , with graphics that seemed to pop through the screen and into the living room .
So far , the video has been seen more than six million times .
That video , together with others that Mr. Lee , now 28 , posted on YouTube , have drawn people to the innovator as well as his innovations .
Video game companies have contacted him and , in September , M.I.T. ’s Technology Review named him as one of its top innovators under 35 .
When he completed his degree this year at the Human - Computer Interaction Institute of Carnegie Mellon , he received “ lots of offers from all the big places , ” according to Paul Dietz , who convinced Mr. Lee to join him in the applied sciences group of Microsoft ’s entertainment and devices division .
“ When we told Bill Gates we were trying to recruit Johnny , he already knew about his work and was anxious to bring him to Microsoft , ” adds Mr. Dietz , a research and development program manager .
A startling admission from McCain ’s top economic adviser to CNNMoney.com :
Younger , healthier workers likely would n’t abandon their company - sponsored plans , said Douglas Holtz - Eakin , McCain ’s senior economic policy adviser .
“ Why would they leave ? ” said Holtz - Eakin .
“ What they are getting from their employer is way better than what they could get with the credit . ”

On April 9 , 2006 , in the early - morning hours , the Hillsdale County Sheriff 's Department brought a culture of violence and total lack of value for life to my home .
The result was the brutal and senseless killing of our son , Max .
We arrived on the scene about four minutes after the police .
Standing on the lawn nearby , we witnessed everything .
The police displayed a total lack of professional conduct .
Four deputies with the cover of darkness and behind their patrol cars , yelled and screamed demands , creating an environment for a tragic ending .
We were shocked when they started shooting .
We yelled and pleaded for them to stop .
They hit trees and a house .
They hit my son in the ankle and the top of the head .
They were soon standing over our dying son , and we could hear them reminding each other that there were witnesses present .
We think of the senseless loss of our son every day , and will for the rest of our lives .
If we would have arrived five minutes before the police , this never would have happened .
The news media at the time only gave what the police told .
When they killed Max , they killed us .
It 's time for a change in Hillsdale County .
It 's time we established a new mission and a new culture for the police , one of honesty and respect for citizens and for life itself .
Please join us , our family and friends in supporting Gerald Perham , candidate for Hillsdale County sheriff on Aug .
5 . We need competent leadership .

I RECEIVED my dear friend ’s two letters , one for Wednesday and one for Saturday .
This is again Wednesday .
I do not deserve one for to - day , because I have not answered the former .
But , indolent as I am , and averse to writing , the fear of having no more of your pleasing epistles , if I do not contribute to the correspondence , obliges me to take up my pen ; and as Mr. B. has kindly sent me word that he sets out to - morrow to see you , instead of spending this Wednesday evening , as I have done its namesakes , in your delightful company , I sit down to spend it in thinking of you , in writing to you , and in reading over and over again your letters .
1
I am charmed with your description of Paradise , and with your plan of living there ; and I approve much of your conclusion , that , in the meantime , we should draw all the good we can from this world .
In my opinion we might all draw more good from it than we do , and suffer less evil , if we would take care not to give too much for whistles .
For to me it seems that most of the unhappy people we meet with are become so by neglect of that caution .
2
You ask what I mean ?
You love stories , and will excuse my telling one of myself .
3
When I was a child of seven years old , my friends , on a holiday , filled my pocket with coppers .
I went directly to a shop where they sold toys for children ; and being charmed with the sound of a whistle , that I met by the way in the hands of another boy , I voluntarily offered and gave all my money for one .
I then came home , and went whistling all over the house , much pleased with my whistle , but disturbing all the family .
My brothers , and sisters , and cousins , understanding the bargain I had made , told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth ; put me in mind what good things I might have bought with the rest of the money ; and laughed at me so much for my folly , that I cried with vexation ; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistle gave me pleasure .
4
This , however , was afterwards of use to me , the impression continuing on my mind ; so that often , when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary thing , I said to myself , Do n’t give too much for the whistle ; and I saved my money .
5
As I grew up , came into the world , and observed the actions of men , I thought I met with many , very many , who gave too much for the whistle .
6
When I saw one too ambitious of court favor , sacrificing his time in attendance on levees , his repose , his liberty , his virtue , and perhaps his friends , to attain it , I have said to myself , This man gives too much for his whistle .
7
When I saw another fond of popularity , constantly employing himself in political bustles , neglecting his own affairs , and ruining them by that neglect , He pays , indeed , said I , too much for his whistle .
8
If I knew a miser , who gave up every kind of comfortable living , all the pleasure of doing good to others , all the esteem of his fellow - citizens , and the joys of benevolent friendship , for the sake of accumulating wealth , Poor man , said I , you pay too much for your whistle .
9
When I met with a man of pleasure , sacrificing every laudable improvement of the mind , or of his fortune , to mere corporeal sensations , and ruining his health in their pursuit , Mistaken man , said I , you are providing pain for yourself , instead of pleasure ; you give too much for your whistle .
10
If I see one fond of appearance , or fine clothes , fine houses , fine furniture , fine equipages , all above his fortune , for which he contracts debts , and ends his career in a prison , Alas !
say I , he has paid dear , very dear , for his whistle .
11
When I see a beautiful sweet - tempered girl married to an ill - natured brute of a husband , What a pity , say I , that she should pay so much for a whistle !
12
In short , I conceive that great part of the miseries of mankind are brought upon them by the false estimates they have made of the value of things , and by their giving too much for their whistles .
13
Yet I ought to have charity for these unhappy people , when I consider that , with all this wisdom of which I am boasting , there are certain things in the world so tempting , for example , the apples of King John , which happily are not to be bought ; for if they were put to sale by auction , I might very easily be led to ruin myself in the purchase , and find that I had once more given too much for the whistle .

Enough is known about the causes of breast cancer to make a vaccine or prophylactic drug a real possibility , a leading cancer expert said last night .
Professor Valerie Beral of Oxford University , who leads the Million Women 's Study into the causes of the disease , told the Guardian the study had put beyond doubt what had long been guessed - that many breast cancers are caused by the absence of hormonal changes connected with childbirth .
Beral challenged the scientific community to turn its efforts to preventing breast cancer .
While money and effort is poured into better drug treatments , hardly anyone is working on prevention .
Speaking to the Guardian , she said that while death rates have been slashed by new drugs and earlier diagnosis , the number of women getting breast cancer and having to go through traumatic surgery and chemotherapy was rising .
Genes played a part in only a very small number of cancers .
The processes of giving birth and breastfeeding protected a woman from breast cancer more than anything else .
The more children a woman had and the longer she breastfed , the lower her risk was of later contracting breast cancer .
Women in developed countries where small families are the norm have six times the breast cancer risk of those in rural parts of Asia with large families .
Returning to an era where women had endless babies and breastfed for two years or more at a time was not an option , Beral told the Guardian .
" But why are n't we thinking of mimicking the effects of childbirth ? " she said .
" We do n't know how this happens and nobody is doing research on it .
We should be looking at hormone production during late pregnancy and lactation . "
Beral is director of the cancer epidemiology unit of Oxford University .
Her work , funded by Cancer Research UK , uses large amounts of statistical data to identify the traits or behaviour that put women at risk of breast cancer .
She is not a biochemist , but last night she asked the National Cancer Research Institute 's annual conference why the avenue of breast cancer prevention which might lead to a drug or vaccine was not being pursued .
It has already happened in cervical cancer , she pointed out .
The discovery that most cervical cancers are caused by the humanpapilloma virus has led to a vaccine which is expected to give women many years of cancer protection .
A school immunisation programme began last month for all girls aged 12 and 13 .
The interaction between the hormone surges around childbirth and breastfeeding and breast cancer is not simple .
Oestrogen , the hormone which surges in pregnancy , fuels tumour growth .
Many women with breast cancer are given drugs to stop oestrogen production .
Beral thinks a more interesting candidate for study is prolactin .
" The one hormone that has to do with breast changes does n't appear until late pregnancy .
It goes up exponentially .
It produces the changes in the breast that make for lactation , " she said .
" Why is n't anyone looking at it ? "
Whichever hormone or hormones are responsible , she said , short - term exposure during late pregnancy and breast - feeding provide life - long protection which is exactly what is required of a vaccine or preventive drug .
But " fewer than a dozen people " are looking in this direction , she said .
" It is not well - funded .
It is not mainstream research .
Why is n't it a priority of the cancer community ? "
If somebody made the breakthrough that led to the prevention of breast cancer , it would win a Nobel Prize , she said .
Dr Jane Cope , director of the National Cancer Research Institute , said the NCI wanted to boost research into prevention .
" Research into breast cancer has been a great success story , with survival rates at an all - time high .
" However , the number of women diagnosed with the disease is increasing year after year , " she said .
" Preventing all types of cancer is now an exciting prospect for researchers in the UK .
In 2002 , our partners spent £ 6 m on prevention research .
Since that time the NCRI has used its influence to help boost this figure to £ 14 m in 2006 . "
Mamluk rule across the Middle East and India during the 13th and 14th centuries has been a historical phenomenon for not just the Muslim world , but the entire world .
A whole class of slaves rising up the military ranks to positions of rule over the societal elite has yet to be repeated at any point in history .
Raised to think only in terms of loyalty , strategy and survival , it is easy to see how a Mamluk could have rose to the rank of military general and not only influence administrative decisions , but eventually become a Sultan .
This is exactly what happened in Egypt in 1257 AD .
The commander of Sultan Malik al - Salih ’s personal army , Qutuz , took control of the state 7 years after al - Salih ’s death , the death of al - Salihs wife Shajar al - Dur , and her new husband , Aybak .
Qutuz ’s reign marked the beginning of the Bahri Mamluk Dynasty of Egypt .
About 70 years later India would see its own adoption of Mamluk rule when General Malik Tughluq gained control of Delhi and the Punjab from Khusraw Khan in 1320 AD , forming the Tughluqid Dynasty .
The difference in the rise to power by the two Mamluks is only one example of the many differences that existed between the two states and their governing customs .
However , of all the differences , there seems to be one that stands out ; the contrasts in Sultanate succession between the Mamluks of Egypt and India . ]
Very Brief History of the Egyptian Mamluks
The incoming Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt was a welcomed change by the masses , who were growing tired of the Ayyubid Dynasty .
Though the Mamluks had been an established part of society in Egypt during Ayyubid rule , it was not until the reign of Malik al - Salih that they would actually gain any administrative influence .
al - Salih ’s reign also marked a rapid increase of the Mamluk population .
When al - Salih became Sultan , he was adamant on increasing the amount of Mamluk soldiers in his personal army .
By increasing the Mamluk army size al - Salih increased their political influence .
After a domestic violence dispute in which al - Salih was killed by his wife , Shajar al - Dur took power until she too was killed .
Once Shajar was killed , there was an opening for the Sultanate and the Mamluks , specifically Qutuz , took the opportunity to take control of the kingdom .
Once in power , Qutuz was expected to set up a familial dynasty , like all preceding Sultanate dynasties .
However , the Mamluks used their administrative expertise to their advantage , and abolished a lineage - based succession in favour of a meritocracy .
What ibn Khaldun had to say about the Egyptian Mamluks
ibn Khaldun had this to say about the Egyptians Mamluks and their administrative customs ,
“ Often they use them in the service of the state , appoint them to high state offices , and some of them are chosen to sit on the throne of the Sultans and direct the affairs of Muslims , in accordance with divine providence and with the mercy of God to his creatures .
Thus , one intake comes after another and generation follows generation , and Islam rejoices in the benefit which it gains through them , and the branches of the kingdom flourish with the freshness of youth .

Concluding Thoughts on the Mamluks
One can see by what Khaldun has said here that the Mamluks of Egypt were very astute in their belief in Islam and looked to its teachings when making important decisions .
This would be an important observation byKhaldun , especially because of the Mamluk claim to be protectors of Islam , particularly Sunni Islam .
Khaldun also points out their disfavour of dynastic rule .
He informs us of the Mamluk favour for keeping the Sultanate , the ruling class , and the military class , in check by maintaining a constant threat of regicide and exile .
He proclaims their active execution of their threats by consistently overthrowing the Sultan whenever they felt change was needed .
Moreover , like the military , their appointment to particular offices was not based on lineage , but by merit .
Merit , in this case , could mean anything from public popularity to killing your opponents .
The Mamluks of Egypt use of this tactic when removing their Sultans resulted from struggles among the ranks of army commanders , which tended to culminate with the death of the incumbent and the rise of a new leader .
This process became cyclical during their 100 year reignWe can compare and contrast this with the Indian Mamluks , who operated in stark contrast to their Egyptian counterparts .
They did not depend on the military as a ruling class , nor was there always an ensuring struggle for ascendancy to the throne .
The Indian Mamluks were constantly under threat by neighbouring kingdoms and incoming armies .
They never worried about internal struggles during the Sultans rule .
They practiced dynastic rule , where the most capable son ascended to the throne after the death of the previous Sultan .
However , there are conflicting reports that the very first succession to the Mamluk throne was the result of patricide by Jawna Khan against Malik Tughluq .
The story , as reported by the great traveler and historianBattuta is that Jawna Khan had built a pavilion to honour Malik Tughluq upon his return from successful annexation of East Bengal .
During an elephant parade , the roof of the pavilion , according toBattuta , collapsed as Jawna Khan had planned , instantly killing Malik Tughluq .
Another prominent historian at the time , Barania sharp critic of Malik Tughluq ) , denies the report that it was intentional and that the roof collapsed because of poor design .
Regardless , Jawna Khan took the throne and eventually came to be known as Muhammad bin Tughluq .
He died of an illness himself and was reluctantly succeeded by his cousin Feroz Shah .
Once Feroz Shah died of an illness at 83 , the royal family was entrenched by an internal struggle for ascendancy .
Mahmud took over the reigns for a very brief period , but was probably better known for running away to Palam when Timur the LameTamerlane ) rampaged through Persia and Northern India while en route to China .
When contrasting the Mamluks of Egypt and India , one tends to overlook that the Egyptian Mamluks ruled over a majority Muslim population while the Indian Mamluks ruled over a majority Hindu population .
If one delves deeper into Mamluk rule , one can conclude that this was the main dividing point for the system of succession that evolved out of the two states , but certainly not the only one .
One should take note of the fact that the Mamluks of Egypt and India alike , ruled over their states while successfully keeping themselves culturally distant from the masses .
Throughout the reigns of both Mamluk dynasties , they kept their Turkish heritage alive by conducting a large chunk of administrative duties in their Turkish language .
This isolated them from the population , something the Mamluks enjoyed .
However , this distinction that they laid upon themselves created a very small margin of support from the masses .
Narrow support meant , whether in Egypt or India , they would have to keep a tighter grip on the masses .
This was none more evident than in India , where the Mamluks were very strict about corruption , and did not tolerate any lawlessness or disobedience to the monarchy .
Punishment for such crimes was usually death .
Muhammad bin Tughluq was so “ strict about corruption ” , according toBattuta , that he carried out executions and tortures everyday , and frequently had dead bodies piled up on the front of his palace .
In Delhi , the extraordinarily defensive Mamluks probably emphasized dynastic rule not only to preserve their Turkish heritage , but also to ensure the maintenance of Muslim power in a predominantly non-Muslim state .
The possibility of losing control to another Muslim Dynasty was also out of the question , since they feared giving up power to non-Turkic Muslims .
Dynastic rule amongst the Indian Mamluks could also have been a defensive mechanism used by them to get over a possible inferiority complex .
We could argue they believed without the monarchy they had nothing .
They were proud that even though they were of slave origin , they still conquered lands and maintain control over populations where slavery was not nearly as common as in the Middle East .
The evolution of the Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate succession system may have been the result of the opposite conditions that had undertook the Indian Mamluks .
While the Indian Mamluks ruled over Hindus , the rule of the Egyptian Mamluks was over a majority Muslim population , which comparably made the notion of Turkish rule over Egyptians more acceptable .
Middle Easterners would also have been more accepting of Turkish rule than the Indians because of their previous experience with Turkic rule under the Seljuk Dynasty .
The Egyptian Mamluks also had a strong military presence south of Cairo , where the Nile Barracks was located and housed the Bahri Mamluks , allowing them to maintain a strong following and influence .
Ultimately , successive rule through meritocratic appointment would not have been a problem for the Mamluks since they were the military class in Egypt , and also the ruling class .
Also , with the Caliphate not too far from Cairo , the Mamluks had no fear for an Islamic uprising .
However , for all their power , the Egyptian Mamluks were still a defensive bunch , like the Indian Mamluks .
Their defensiveness , though were based on two very different reasons .
While the Indians were defensive because of their presence over a majority non-Muslim population , they did not have to worry about their opponents relegating them slavery , as the Egyptians did .
The Egyptian Mamluks , because of their proximity to the Nile Barracks , and the widespread use of slaves in Egypt and the Middle East , were constantly fighting off propaganda from their opponents who invoked their slave - status as reason for uprising against them .
Despite the opponents the Egyptian Mamluks ’ system of meritocratic succession lasted for approximately 100 years .
Ultimately , the most interesting contrast between the Mamluks of Egypt and those of India came down to a contrast between meritocratic successions versus inherited succession .
Both systems worked out very well for each dynasty .
Had the opposite occurred and the Mamluks of India practiced succession - by - merit and the Egyptian Mamluks took up inherited succession , neither government would have survived past the first generation .
The Hindu population and local Muslim opponents of the Indian Mamluks would have seized the opportunity to overthrow their Turkish Monarchy and implement a more local style of government .
The Egyptians would not have survived either , since Mamluks ’ sons were barred from joining the elite corps , effectively undermining a possibility of their sons growing up to be great military leaders or members of government .
Thus , one can say that there is an interesting contrast between the forms of succession used by the Mamluks of Egypt and that used by the Mamluks of India .
Yet , out of all that was , each was perfectly suited for their societies , and , had not these regimes been overthrown by external powers , both could have reigned much longer and perhaps even popularized their systems of succession on a more global scale .

Helping children face their fears may be more productive than focusing on other techniques to help them manage their anxieties , according to research presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in Chicago .
The research , which identified similarities between cognitive behavioral therapy administered in a clinical practice and protocols recommended in common treatment manuals , showed that as children were taught to face their fears , their ability to function increased .
The study also showed that children were able to complete exercises exposing them to their fears much earlier than suggested in the treatment manuals .
The more children focused on other techniques for managing their anxieties , however , the less improvement they showed in functioning .
Stephen Whiteside , Ph.D. , from Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn. , explained that more research into treatment options for childhood anxiety needs to be conducted .
" We have children face their fears and we teach them techniques for managing their anxiety , but research is n't advanced enough to show which element should be the main part of treatment or whether both parts are necessary for improvement , " he says .
Dr. Whiteside also says that treatment manuals suggest introducing exposure -- having children face their fears -- late in the treatment process .
" We wondered whether we could begin exposures closer to the beginning of the process , " Dr. Whiteside says .
" If we focused on exposures and did n't provide anxiety management techniques , would kids still get better ? "
According to Dr. Whiteside , treatment that was shorter and began exposures earlier than standard manuals recommended not only improved the children 's ability to function but also could to be more cost - effective .
Jennifer Vande Voort , M.D. , and Stephen Whiteside , Ph.D. , both of Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn. , will present this research entitled , " Exposure Therapy for Childhood Anxiety in Clinical Practice Versus an Empirically Supported Manual " during the AACAP annual meeting at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers on Oct. 29 .
Cultural constructs ( our " management systems " ) and technology allowed humanity , over eons , to overcome natural limits and thrive in every ecosystem on the planet .
We even went " to the moon , Alice " to steal a phrase from Ralph the Honeymooner .
Now , a modern and very effective management system , the corporation , along with industrial technology are overwhelming nature .
The honeymoon is over ...
Human activities -- pollution due to energy production and transportation , worldwide development to a " western standard " , over - fishing of ocean nurseries , deforestation , unsustainable agricultural -- are destroying the Earth 's ability to sustain human life .
Our unlimited population growth , abetted by health technology , greatly accelerates damage , even as we live longer .
Corporations are a rather recent addition to human societies .
They are a fantastic means to focus efforts of human beings and technology .
Corporations are beholden to their shareholders and therefore will not change their environmentally unsound practices eagerly if shareholder profits are put at risk .
Yet , consumers , along with shareholders , will shortly no longer have an environment which will support their lives !
Can we count on shareholders to force corporations to save themselves and the very market upon which they depend ?
Corporations , as they developed , became persons under the law .
They are without a conscience and / or moral compass of any sort , they answer to stockholders and market forces , and laws but only when they can't get away without , and have an unlimited lifetime !
Quite an unnatural " person " .
Being persons before the law has several consequences .
They can be taxed .
They can sue and be sued .
They can cloak their shareholders from suits against the corporation .
They also can finance election campaigns and lobbyists , thanks to having free speech rights .
Corporate activities and influence are the biggest impediments to reversing activities that are accelerating biosphere destruction .
The car companies , to name a current and especially egregious example , blocked inproving car mileage ( CAFE Standards ) for 20 plus years , and now claim they need government money to re-tool their outdated and unprofitable plant and equipment !
Corporations can no longer be persons under the law .

has become the party of war and thus the party of unlimited government .
With war has come FEAR , magnified many times over by the governing party .
Fear is pulling Americans into the arms of
the state .
If only we were better at
resisting .
Alas , we Americans say that
we love liberty but we are fair - weather lovers .
Liberty will flourish only with peace .
Have libertarians gained on other margins in the past eight years ?
Not at all .
Under the Republicans we have been sailing due South - West on the Nolan
Chart – fewer civil liberties and more government , including the largest new
government program in a generation , the Medicare prescription drug plan , and
the biggest nationalization since the Great Depression .
Tax cuts , the summum bonum of Republican
economic policy , are a sham .
The only
way to cut taxes is to cut spending and that has not happened .
The libertarian voice has not been listened to in Republican politics for a
long time .
The Republicans take the libertarian wing of the party for granted
and with phony rhetoric and empty phrases have bought our support on the
cheap .
Thus – since voice has failed – it is time for exit .
Remember that if
a political party can count on you then you cannot count on it .
Exit is the right strategy because if there is any hope for reform it is by
casting the Republicans out of power and into the wilderness where they may
relearn virtue .
Libertarians understand better
than anyone that power corrupts .
The
Republican party illustrates .
Lack of
power is no guarantee of virtue but Republicans are a far better – more libertarian –
party out - of - power than they are in power .
When in the wilderness , Republicans turn naturally to a critique of
power and they ratchet up libertarian rhetoric about free trade , free
enterprise , abuse of government power and even the defense of civil liberties .
We can hope that new leaders will arise in
this libertarian milieu .
After eight years of near - zero growth in atmospheric methane concentrations , levels have again started to rise .
" This is not good news for future global warming , " says CSIRO 's Dr Paul Fraser , who co-authored a paper to be published in Geophysical Research Letters , a journal of the American Geophysical Union .
" Over recent years , the growth of important greenhouse gases , namely methane and the CFCs , had slowed .
This tended to offset the increasing growth rate of carbon dioxide that results mainly from large increases in the consumption of fossil fuels , particularly in the developing world .
" Now that methane levels have resumed their growth , global warming may accelerate . "
Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere after carbon dioxide , accounting for nearly 20 per cent of global warming since the industrial revolution .
Methane is emitted to the atmosphere from natural wetlands , rice fields , cattle , forest and grassland fires , coal mines , natural gas leakage and use , and other sources .
" Over the past decade these methane sources have been close to balancing the absorption of methane through atmospheric oxidation and into dry soil , " Dr Fraser says .
" This fragile balance has resulted in little growth of methane in the atmosphere .
Apparently some sources have been increasing , such as from fossil fuel use , cattle , and rice , while others have been decreasing , particularly natural tropical wetlands .
However , over the past year , the total sources have overwhelmed the total sinks , and methane has again started to rise . "
Dr Fraser says that recent analyses of global data by CSIRO and collaborators at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the University of Bristol suggest that the methane increase is , at least in part , due to methane releases in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere .
" Such increases have been predicted as rapid Arctic ice melting creates more high latitude wetland sources , " says Dr Fraser .
" A possible additional cause of the methane increase is that atmospheric oxidation may be weakening , for reasons as yet unknown , although recovery from ozone depletion , which is predicted to have commenced , may be involved . "
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) has identified the need to understand causes of the variations of methane growth rates as a priority area of research .
" The reality is that scientists have only a very basic understanding of these methane variations , " Dr Fraser says .
" In order to predict the future contribution of methane to climate change , continuing high - quality observations , in particular in tropical and boreal locations , are required as input to , and verification of , sophisticated climate models . "

Moments after authorities discovered the plane wreckage of Steve
Fossett , a millionaire pilot missing since last year , a blogger managed to zoom in on a virtual view of the crash site using Google Earth .
To narrow down his search , Frank Taylor , writer of Google Earth Blog , pieced together information about the characteristics and general location of the crash site .
He then learned from a commenter on his blog that the FAA put out a temporary no - fly restriction to prevent pilots from flying over the area in support of the investigation .
Taylor deduced that must have been where the crash occurred , and he zoomed in on the FAA 's coordinates .
The final piece that completed the puzzle was a photo of the crash site from the Los Angeles Times .
Because Google
Earth 's 3D terrain is rich in detail , Taylor believes he was able to make a very close match .
" I went into Google Earth to maneuver my view around to match where that photo was taken , " Taylor said in a phone interview .
" I estimate the location where I put that now is about
250 feet of where that photo was taken . "
In addition , another commenter on the blog said he found what appeared to be the mine site where hikers discovered Fossett 's belongings and recreated
Fossett 's flight in Google Earth .
By virtually " flying " there , he said he found a " dead - end canyon " with very little room for a plane to turn .
Taylor said he has been tracking Fossett 's missing plane since it was reported missing in 2007 .
His amateur sleuthing demonstrates a sophisticated usage of Google
Earth , a program that combines satellite imagery , aerial photography and 3D illustrations to provide users virtual views of the entire world .
Other than tracking down missing persons , authorities and searchers have used Google Earth 's detailed imagery to virtually learn the terrain — familiarizing themselves with lakes , craters and rough terrain , for example — before embarking on their rescue operations .
Taylor was n't alone in his virtual search for
Fossett , either .
Hundreds participated in trying to track down the missing pilot using Google Earth last year , but when authorities called off the search , most of the online sleuthers gave up , too .
Fossett , a millionaire adventurer , was last seen the morning of Sept. 3 , 2007 .
He reportedly said he was planning to fly over the Sierra Nevada .
His disappearance prompted not only hundreds of online trackers to search for his plane , but also thousands of volunteers and hundreds of authorities searching from above and below — to no avail .
Authorities suspended the search in October 2007 .
On Wednesday , investigators found his crashed plane on the area near Mammoth Lakes on the Sierra Nevada after hikers there found Fossett 's ID card , a sweat shirt and cash .
Authorities have not found Fossett 's body .
Updated 3 p.m. PDT
Thursday : Google Earth users can download Taylor 's KMZ file to view his findings .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In the first economic reading from the period since the Wall Street crisis erupted , a government report Thursday showed initial unemployment claims rose last week much more than expected .
According to a study by the Department of Labor , initial filings for state jobless benefits increased by a seasonally adjusted 32,000 to 493,000 in the third week of September .
It was the highest number of weekly claims since Sept. 29 , 2001 , when unemployment soared in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
The consensus estimate of economists surveyed by Briefing.com was 450,000 .
" The labor market is very weak , " said Mark Vitner , an economist for Wachovia .
" Layoffs have ticked up for the last two months , and there has been a slowdown in hiring , so we have n't been able to absorb new entrants into the workforce . "
The Labor Department said about 50,000 of the new claims were due to the effects of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike .
There were 18,400 more claims from the week before in Louisiana alone , and Texas added 1,200 .
That helped boost the four - week moving average of new jobless claims by 16,000 from last week to 462,500 .
A level at or above 400,000 for the four - week average has also been present throughout the last two recessions .
In all , there were 12 states that reported at least a 1,000 - claim increase from the prior week .
New York , which is expected to continue to be hard - hit by the financial crisis on Wall Street , was among the dozen .
" This is n't just related to the crisis on Wall Street , " Vitner said .
" If we fixed the credit markets , we 'd still be left with a very weak U.S. economy . "
Falling home prices , sluggish income growth , weak consumer spending and rising inflation all have created a weak job environment .
That led the government to extend unemployment benefits to claim seekers in June .
Continued unemployment insurance claims from those already receiving benefits rose in the week ended Sept. 13 - the most recent week available - to 3.54 million , up 63,000 from the previous week .
The four - week moving average for continued claims rose by 28,250 to 3.49 million .
Earlier this month , the government reported that there were 84,000 jobs lost in August , bringing to 605,000 the number of jobs cut from payrolls by U.S. employers in the first eight months of the year .
The unemployment rate surged to 6.1 % last month , a nearly five - year high and up from 5.7 % in July .
In the last recession , unemployment reached a high of 6.3 % .
" Without a doubt , we 'll blow right past that , " Vitner said .
With last week 's demise of Lehman Brothers , Bank of America 's ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) takeover of Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) and government bailout of American International Group ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) , even more job losses are expected , especially from the financial sector .
Wolf Campaign Apologizes for Staffer who Struck Feder Worker
Rep. Frank R. Wolf 's campaign is apologizing this morning for the actions of a congressional staffer , who apparently struck a campaign worker for opponent Judy Feder after a candidate 's forum in Winchester Friday .
The incident was caught on tape and posted on the blog www.raisingkaine.com last night by Feder 's paid blogger , Lowell Feld .
According to both camps , the two Feder staffers , one carrying a video camera , approached Wolf and peppered him with questions .
Dan Scandling , Wolf 's campaign spokesman , said the two workers had been " circling " Wolf , his wife Carolyn and congressional staffer Ben Dutton , and asking aggressive questions in an attempt to provoke an angry response .
Marisa McNee , a Feder spokeswoman , acknowledged that Matt Kent and Josh Goodman , both paid campaign workers , were " a little aggressive " but generally polite in their questioning .
At one point in the video , as Kent asks Wolf a question , the camera abruptly shakes and the videographer shouts , " Sir , please do n't ! "
This is the moment at which both camps say Dutton struck Kent .
Though you can't see it , both camps say it was with a cane .
Scandling said Dutton , an 83 - year - old former Winchester town councilman , felt that Carolyn Wolf " was being threatened " and responded in a " knee - jerk " way .
McNee said Dutton struck Kent a second time , and there is another abrupt shake later in the tape that could corroborate this .
Scandling denies this .
He said the events transpired behind Wolf 's back and that Wolf did not witness anything .
" The campaign apologizes if Ben used poor judgment and hit him with his cane , " Scandling said .
But he said the reaction was " provoked . "
The two Feder staffers had been egging him on with questions like , " How does it feel to be in the real Virginia ? "
Scandling said .
McNee , however , said that Kent and Goodman were trying to nail down Wolf on his position on health care .
Moreover , she said , nothing justifies physical violence .
She said the two campaign workers , who also approached Wolf at an event in McLean on Saturday , are considering whether to file a complaint with the police .
Neither was injured .
At the GeekDad Blog we 're around cool geeky kids all the time – our own .
At least we aspire that they will be geeky .
As good parents we ( typically ) let them evolve their own interests and personalities .
Still , it never hurts to expose them to some positive role models .
In this case , I 'm talking about cool kids in geeky flicks !
After hours and hours of viewing in the dusty GeekDad film archives , I assembled what I consider the definitive list .
One thing to note : somehow I ended up with a more - or - less equal number of girls and boys .
I was n't trying to be PC , there are just a lot of cool kids of both sexes in science fiction and fantasy movies .
10 . The Goonies Kids :
They are more of an amorphous , chattering , puzzle - solving , PB&J - eating colony organism than a bunch of separate kids , so I 'll rate them together .
They get insane points for urban exploration , teamwork , and for defeating the over - privileged squares out to destroy their idyllic community .
9. Lex Murphy from Jurassic Park : Remember the tween girl who doubled as a l33t Unix she - HaX0r ?
Good thing she 's there – undoing the shenanigans of that fat guy who got eaten is more than Samuel L. can handle .
Also , escaping from velociraptors is worth tonna points .
8. Newt from Aliens : Newt has enough wits to be the only survivor of a whole colony , eluding the most cunning xenomorphs in the galaxy .
Earmuffs , Newt – Hudson is talking about Arcturians again .
Of course the haters who wrote Alien III had to kill her off – they could n't handle her cool .
7. Mitch from Real Genius : Perhaps the truest warts - and - all depiction of a nerd .
Of course , they had to make him a super - genius .
But there was a truth there : his insecurity and naivete , balanced by his wits , made him more than a caricature .
In true Hollywood fashion , he somehow manages to find a girl .
6. Jack from Pitch Black : Tough , smart and resourceful , Jack packs Newt's ( # 8 ) survival skills .
Like many of the kids on this list , she becomes expert in outwitting alien predators .
She beats out the others because she has the good fashion sense to emulate Vin Diesel 's style .
5 . The Feral Kid from The Road Warrior :
He 's not geeky in the classic sense , but the apocalypse eats the pocket protector set for lunch .
Geeks must evolve to survive .
In this case , evolution means an atrophied speech center and a steel boomerang .
Ironically , his howls make him seem like Patrick Stewart next to the socially awkward Max .
4 : John Connor from Terminator II :
He grows up knowing he 's the human race 's savior , but can still humble enough to enjoy a juice box with the pals .
Rocks a mean palmtop for that all - important hacker cred , and can make friends with heartless cyborgs .
3 : Acid Burn and Crash Override from Hackers :
The movie does n't depict realistic hacking escapades , but what it does do is demonstrate a wonderful geeky spirit .
These kids totally evoke that spirit ... curious , adventurous , intelligent .
Yes , geeky kids can be mega hot ... if only in Hollywood .
2 : David Lightman from WarGames :
The prototypical hacker in the original Hollywood hacker movie .
Wardialing Sunnyvale for the scoop on a new game company he heard about , instead he logs into a sentient supercomputer and nearly starts World War III .
All this while spitting game with Ally Sheedy and fixing his bad grades on the school 's database .
1 : Leia in Star Wars : A New Hope :
At 19 , technically she 's not a kid , but c'mon , we 'll fit her in .
Not only did she not break under torture , but her eyeshadow and hair stayed perfect and there was always a wisecrack on her lips .
Her brother got the Force , she got the style .
Did I miss anyone ?
Drop a comment if you have something to say ... but they gotta be at least ten magnitudes cooler than Anakin in Episode I .
Down with the Four - Year College Degree !
The proposition that I hereby lay before the house is that the BA degree is the work of the devil .
It wreaks harm on a majority of young people , is grotesquely inefficient as a source of information for employers , and is implicated in the emergence of a class - riven America .
Before explaining why , let me specify a few things that I am not arguing .
I am not complaining that too many people are getting education after high school .
On the contrary , I am in favor of education after high school for almost all young people .
I am not denying that that possession of a BA is statistically associated with higher income across the life span , and that this economic benefit persists after controlling for measures of human capital ( e.g. , IQ scores ) , field of study , and other background variables .
I am not disparaging the value of a liberal education , classically understood .
On the contrary , I think far too few young people are exposed to the stuff of a liberal education ( that ’s the last I ’m going to say on that issue in this presentation .
There ’s a long discussion of liberal education in the book . )
Why the Current System Does n’t Make Sense
So what ’s my beef with the current system ?
Perhaps the easiest way to introduce the argument is to ask you to imagine that you have been made a member of a task force to design America ’s post - secondary education system from scratch .
One of your colleagues submits this proposal :
First , we will set up a single goal to represent educational success , which will take four years to achieve no matter what is being taught .
We will attach an economic reward to it that often has nothing to do with what has been learned .
We will urge large numbers of people who do not possess adequate ability to try to achieve the goal , wait until they have spent a lot of time and money , and then deny it to them .
We will stigmatize everyone who does n’t meet the goal .
We will call the goal a “ BA . ”
You would conclude that your colleague was cruel , not to say insane .
But that ’s the system we have .
It does n’t make sense .
Here ’s why :
… which will take four years to achieve no matter what is being taught .
Four years makes sense for students who are trying to get a liberal education and therefore need to take a few dozen courses in philosophy , religion , classical and modern literature , the fine arts , classical and modern history ( including the history of science ) , plus acquire fluency in a foreign language and take basic survey courses in the social sciences .
The percentage of college students who want to do that is what ?
Ten percent ?
Probably that is too optimistic .
Whatever the exact figure , it is a tiny minority .
For everyone else , four years is ridiculous .
Assuming a semester system with four courses per semester , four years of class work means thirty - two semester - long courses .
The occupations that require thirty - two courses are exceedingly rare .
In fact , I ca n’t think of a single example .
Even medical school and Ph.D.s do n’t require four years of course work .
For the student who wants to become a good hotel manager , software designer , accountant , hospital administrator , farmer , high - school teacher , social worker , journalist , optometrist , interior designer , or football coach , the classes needed for the academic basis for competence take a year or two .
Actually becoming good at one ’s job usually takes longer than that , but competence in any profession is mostly acquired on the job .
The two - year community college and online courses offer more flexible options than the four - year college for tailoring academic course work to the real needs of students .
… attach an economic reward to it that often has nothing to do with what has been learned .
The BA really does confer a wage premium on its average recipient , but there is no good reason that it should .
First , consider professions in which the material learned in college is useful for job performance , such as engineering , the sciences , and business majors .
Take the specific case of accounting .
It is possible to get a BA ( I use BA as a generic term embracing the BS ) in accounting .
There is also the CPA exam required to become a Certified Public Accountant .
The CPA test is thorough ( four sections , timed , totaling fourteen hours ) .
To achieve a passing score indicates authentic competence ( the pass rate is below 50 percent for all four tests ) .
Actual scores are reported in addition to pass / fail , so that employers can assess where the applicant falls in the distribution of accounting capability .
If I am an employer of accountants and am given the choice between an applicant with a mediocre CPA score but a BA in accounting and another who studied accounting on - line , has no degree , but does have a terrific CPA score , explain to me why should I be more attracted to the applicant with the BA
The merits of the CPA exam apply to any college major for which the BA is now used as a job qualification .
To name just some of them : journalism , criminal justice , social work , public administration , and the many separate majors under the headings of business , computer science , engineering , engineering technology , and education .
Such majors accounted for almost two - thirds of bachelor ’s degrees conferred in 2005 .
In every one of those cases , a good certification test would tell employers more about the applicant ’s skills than the BA does .
Now consider job applicants for whom the material learned in college is , to put it charitably , only indirectly related to job performance .
I am referring to people like me ( BA in Russian history ) , and BAs in political science , sociology , English lit , the fine arts , and philosophy , not to mention the flakier majors ( e.g. , gender studies ) .
For people like us , presenting a BA to employers amounts to presenting them with a coarse indicator of our intelligence and perseverance .
If we have gone to an elite college , it is mostly an indicator of what terrific students we were in high school ( getting into Harvard and Duke is really tough , but getting through Harvard and Duke for students not in math or science is really easy ) .
Yes , the wage premium for college is associated with these majors as well , but please do n’t tell me it ’s because employers think college augmented our human capital .
Employers are not stupid .
They know that college might have augmented our human capital .
Occasionally , college does teach students to become more rigorous thinkers and writers , and those are useful assets to take into a job .
But employers also know that it would be foolish to assume that the typical college graduate has sought out the most demanding teachers and slaved over the syntax and logic of his term papers .
The much more certain implication of the BA is that its possessors have a certain amount of raw intellectual ability that the employer may be able to exploit after the proper job training .
Finally , consider the hundreds of thousands of students who go to college just because they have had it pounded into their heads since childhood that the good jobs require a BA
The wage premium that shows up in regression equations may or may not apply to them .
In Real Education , I offer an extended example involving a hypothetical young man graduating from high school who is at the 70th percentile in intellectual ability –smart enough to get a BA in today ’s world –but just average in intrapersonal and interpersonal ability .
He is at the 95th percentile in the visual - spatial and small motor skills useful in becoming a top electrician .
He is trying to decide whether to go to college , major in business , and try to become a business executive , or instead become an electrician .
The bottom line of the example is that he cannot compare the mean income of business managers to the mean income of electricians .
If his configuration of abilities means that he could get a BA in today ’s colleges , but his cognitive and interpersonal skills are minimal for success in business , he has to recognize that he will be at a huge disadvantage in the competition for promotions after he gets his entry - level white - collar job .
The relevant income figures are those for people in the bottom few deciles of the distribution of income for business managers .
If his configuration of abilities means that he could become an excellent electrician , he needs to focus on the income of electricians in the top few deciles of that distribution .
We will urge large numbers of people who do not possess adequate ability to try to achieve the goal , wait until they have spent a lot of time and money , and then deny it to them .
Historically , an IQ of 115 or higher was deemed to make someone “ prime college material . ”
That range comprises about 16 percent of the population .
Since 28 percent of all adults have BAs , the IQ required to get a degree these days is obviously a lot lower than 115 .
But the cognitive ability required to cope with genuine college - level material has not changed .
A recent study of “ college readiness ” by the College Board asked what SAT scores were required to have a 65 percent chance of maintaining a 2.7 grade average in the freshman year in a sample of 41 major institutions that included both state universities and elite schools .
The answer was a combined SAT Verbal and Math score of 1180 , a score that only about ten percent of 18 - year - olds could get if everyone took the SAT .
Nor was this requirement inflated by the inclusion of the elite colleges in the sample - the difference in the benchmark scores for unselective and selective universities was a trivial 23 points .
So even though college has been dumbed down , it is still too intellectually demanding for a large majority of students , in an age when about 50 percent of all high school graduates are heading to four - year colleges the next fall .
The result is lots of failure .
Of those who entered a four - year college in 1995 , only 58 percent had gotten their BA five academic years later .
Another 14 percent were still enrolled .
If we assume that half of that 14 percent eventually get their BAs , about a third of all those who entered college hoping for a BA leave without one , often after accumulating a large student - loan debt .
If these numbers had been produced in a culture where the BA was a nice thing to have but not a big deal , they could be interpreted as the result of young adults deciding that they did n’t really want a BA after all .
Instead , these numbers were produced by a system in which having a BA is a very big deal indeed , and that brings us to the increasingly worrisome role of the BA as a source of class division .
We will stigmatize everyone who does n’t meet the goal .
The United States has always had symbols of class , and the college degree has always been one of them .
But through the first half of the twentieth century , there were all sorts of respectable reasons why a person might not go to college–not enough money to pay for college ; needing to work right out of high school to support a wife , parents , or younger siblings ; or the commonly held belief that going straight to work was better preparation for a business career than going to college .
As long as the percentage of college graduates remained small , it also remained true , and everybody knew it , that the majority of America ’s intellectually most able people did not have BAs .
Over the course of the twentieth century , three trends gathered strength .
The first was the increasing proportion of jobs screened for high academic ability due to the advanced level of education they require–engineers , physicians , attorneys , college teachers , scientists , and the like .
The second was the increasing market value of those jobs .
The third was the opening up of college to more of those who had the academic ability to go to college , partly because the increase in American wealth meant that more parents could afford college for their children , and partly because the proliferation of scholarships and loans made it possible for most students with enough academic ability to go .
The combined effect of these trends has been to overturn the state of affairs that prevailed through World War II .
Now the great majority of America ’s intellectually most able people do have a BA .
Along with that transformation has come a downside that few anticipated .
The acceptable excuses for not going to college have dried up .
The more people who go to college , the more stigmatizing the failure to complete college becomes .
Today , if you do not get a BA , many people assume it is because you are too dumb or too lazy .
Face it :
To say “ I ’m just a high school graduate ” as of 2008 is to label oneself in some important sense as a second - class citizen .
No amount of protestations of egalitarianism by people who like the current system ( i.e. , people who do well in an academic setting ) will change that reality - a reality fostered by a piece of paper that for most students in most majors is close to meaningless .
Testing Is Ideal
And so I have taken as my mission to do everything I can to undermine the BA .
The good news is that the conditions are right for change .
There is a diverse world of work out there , filled with jobs that are interesting , well - paying , and intrinsically rewarding , that do not call for the kind of training that colleges are designed to provide .
There is a vital and growing world of on - line education that is revolutionizing the possibilities for delivering post - secondary education .
No technical barriers stand in the way of evolving toward a system where certification tests would replace the BA .
Hundreds of certification tests already exist , for everything from building code inspectors to advanced medical specialties .
The problem is a shortage of tests that are nationally accepted like the CPA exam .
But when so many of the players would benefit , a market opportunity exists .
If a high - profile testing company such as the Educational Testing Service were to reach a strategic decision to create definitive certification tests , it could coordinate with major employers , professional groups and nontraditional universities to make its tests the gold standard .
A handful of key decisions could produce a tipping effect .
Imagine if Microsoft announced it would henceforth require scores on a certain battery of certification tests for all of its programming applicants .
Scores on that battery would acquire instant credibility for programming job applicants throughout the industry .
In my ideal system , the college campuses of America will still exist and they will still be filled with students .
Some of those students will be staying for four years as before , but many others will be arriving and leaving on schedules that make sense for their own goals .
The colleges in my ideal system will have had to adapt their operations to meet new demands , but changes in information technology are coming so fast that major adaptation is inevitable anyway .
The greatest merit of my ideal system is this :
Hardly any jobs will still have the BA as a requirement for a fair shot at being hired .
Employers will rely more on direct evidence about what the job candidate knows , less on where it was learned or how long it took .
To me , the most important if most intangible benefit of my ideal system is that the demonstration of competency in European history or marketing or would , appropriately , take on similarities to the demonstration of competency in cooking or welding .
Our obsession with the BA has created a two - tiered entry to adulthood , anointing some for admission to the club and labeling the rest as second - best .
Here ’s the reality : Everyone in every occupation starts as an apprentice .
Those who are good enough become journeymen .
The best become master craftsmen .
This is as true of history professors and business executives as of chefs and welders .
Getting rid of the BA and replacing it with evidence of competence –treating post - secondary education as apprenticeships for everyone –is one way to help us to recognize that common bond .

ACLU demands info on domestic military deployments Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday October 21 , 2008
Print This Email This Following reports that US troops will be permanently on call to work inside the United States handling " civil unrest , " " crowd control " and other functions traditionally carried out by civilian law enforcement agencies , activists are demanding to know why the Pentagon is reversing a longstanding prohibition on domestic deployment of the military .
The Department of Defense for the first time is assigning a full - time Army unit to be on call with Northern Command , which was created after Sept. 11 to facilitate military cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security in the event of another terrorist attack .
The American Civil Liberties Union is demanding more details on the domestic deployments , which appear to violate the Posse Comitatus Act , which prohibits use of the military to direct internal affairs of the US .
The ACLU warns that without fully knowing the reasoning and justifications behind the Army 's plan , the domestic deployments could be used to expand a militarized surveillance apparatus that already includes the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping program and DHS 's plans to turn military spy satellites inside US borders .
 This is a radical departure from separation of civilian law enforcement and military authority , and could , quite possibly , represent a violation of law ,  former FBI Agent Mike German , an ACLU national security policy counsel , said in a news release .
 Our Founding Fathers understood the threat that a standing army could pose to American liberty .
While future generations recognized the need for a strong military to defend against increasingly capable foreign threats , they also passed statutory protections to ensure that the Army could not be turned against the American people .
The erosion of these protections should concern every American . 
The ACLU sent a nine page Freedom of Information Act request ( pdf ) to the Justice Department , Pentagon and DHS for documents related to the decision to deploy an army unit and outlining the unit 's duties .
A report in the Army Times last month first brought the domestic deployment to light .
The Army 's 3rd Infantry Division 1st Brigade Combat Team became the first unit assigned permanently to Northern Command .
According to the Army Times report , the Team would be on - call to respond in the event of a natural disaster or terror attack anywhere in the country , or they could be used to " help with civil unrest and crowd control . "
But most of their time would be spent training for an expected return to either Iraq or Afghanistan in early 2010 .
Some fear the possibility that the unit 's training could serve a dual purpose if the soldiers were deployed domestically , although the Army is attempting to downplay those concerns .
The 1st BCTs soldiers also will learn how to use  the first ever nonlethal package that the Army has fielded ,  1st BCT commander Col.
Roger Cloutier said , referring to crowd and traffic control equipment and nonlethal weapons designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals without killing them .
The package is for use only in war - zone operations , not for any domestic purpose .
 It s a new modular package of nonlethal capabilities that they re fielding .
Theyve been using pieces of it in Iraq , but this is the first time that these modules were consolidated and this package fielded , and because of this mission were undertaking we were the first to get it . 
The package includes equipment to stand up a hasty road block ; spike strips for slowing , stopping or controlling traffic ; shields and batons ; and , beanbag bullets .
The ACLU 's request focuses on the deployments as yet another step in a series of what it calls " incremental encroachments " by the military towards operating within the US .
 The militarys deployment within U.S. borders raises critical questions that must be answered ,  said Jonathan Hafetz , staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project .
 What is the units mission ?
What functions will it perform ?
And why was it necessary to deploy the unit rather than rely on civilian agencies and personnel and the National Guard ?
Given the magnitude of the issues at stake , it is imperative that the American people know the truth about this new and unprecedented intrusion of the military in domestic affairs . 
But I digress .
It 's said of Ronn Torossian that he represents " right - wing " Israeli politicians , but this description does not do his clients justice .
" Right - wing " is Bibi Netanyahu .
Torossian represents the lunatic fringe .
Several years ago , in one of my only encounters with him , he introduced me to Benny Elon , a rabbi and settler leader who was then Israel 's tourism minister , and who , at various points in his career , has more or less advocated the ethnic cleansing of Israel of its Arab citizens .
At one point , when Elon had gone to take a telephone call , Torossian and I started talking about Israel 's right to reprisal for terrorist attacks .
I was arguing in favor of some sort of proportionality ( this was after Jenin , in which the Israeli army chose to root out terrorism block by block rather than bomb the city from the air ) but Torossian interrupted : " I think we should kill a hundred Arabs or a thousand Arabs for every one Jew they kill . "
I was somewhat taken aback , of course , because this is a Nazi idea , rather than a Jewish idea .
I asked him to explicate : " If someone from a town blows himself up and kills Jews , we should wipe out the town he 's from , kill them all .
The Israelis are suckers .
They should have destroyed Jenin . "
He went on like this for some time .
I would only note that Torossian , to the best of my knowledge , never volunteered for the Israeli army , so he seemed to me by definition a chickenhawk .
Torossian 's attitude toward Arabs and toward the peace process are echoed in the approach of Aish HaTorah , which is just about the most fundamentalist movement in Judaism today .
Its operatives flourish in the radical belt of Jewish settlements just south of Nablus , in the northern West Bank , and their outposts across the world propagandize on behalf of a particularly sterile , sexist and revanchist brand of Judaism .
Which is amusing , of course , because " Obsession " is meant to expose a particularly sterile , sexist and racist brand of Islam .
The tragedy of " Obsession " is not that it is wrong ; the tragedy is that it takes a serious issue , and a serious threat -- that of Islamism -- and makes it into a cartoon .
Its central argument is that the " Islamofascism " of today is not only the equivalent of Nazism , but worse than Nazism .
This is quite a thing for a Jewish organization to argue .
One of the featured speakers in " Obsession " is a self - described " former PLO terrorist " named Walid Shoebat , who argues on film that a " secular dogma like Nazism is less dangerous than Islamofascism is today . "
This is lunacy , of course .
Islamism is n't Nazism .
It 's bad enough without being labeled Nazism .
Martin Gilbert , the biographer of Churchill , shows up in the film as well , and does n't cover himself in glory : " History has an unfortunate habit of always repeating itself , " he says .
Always ?
Does this mean that the Arabs are right now constructing death camps for the Jewish citizens of Israel ?
While the battle over same - sex marriage has been all but invisible in the presidential race this year , it is raging like a wind - whipped wildfire in California .
Conservative religious leaders from across the country are pouring time , talent and millions of dollars into the state in support of Proposition 8 , which would ban same - sex marriage .
They are hoping to reverse a California Supreme Court ruling in May that gave same - sex couples permission to marry , resulting in thousands of exultant same - sex weddings .
Similar marriage amendments are on the ballot next month in Arizona and Florida .
But religious conservatives have cast the campaign in California as the decisive last stand , warning in stunningly apocalyptic terms of dire consequences to the entire nation if Proposition 8 does not pass .
California , they say , sets cultural trends for the rest of the country and even the world .
If same - sex marriage is allowed to become entrenched there , they warn , there will be no going back .
His notion that leaders in the US should actually engage the leaders of other powers in order to negotiate is , according to the vice - presidential candidate for the Republicans :
That 's beyond naïve .
And it 's beyond bad judgment .
She also denied that Kissinger even believed such a thing :
I 've never heard Henry Kissinger say , " Yeah , I 'll meet with these leaders without preconditions being met . "
Ilan Goldenberg has .
What must Kissinger and Baker and Scowcroft think about their party now ?
Someone who before her selection had only one single , semi-coherent thing to say about foreign policy in her entire career , could now become president at a moment 's notice in one of the most perilous times in world history .
The days when Republicanism meant actual responsibility and judgment and experience and realism have been replaced by gimmicks , pure politics , Fox fem - bots , and constant , random gambling with the most dangerous things imaginable .

The company formerly known as Apple Computer and now called simply Apple , Inc. is unique in many ways -- including in its ability to drive even folks who admire it positively batty .
It makes great products ( usually ) , yet its secretiveness about them borders on paranoia , and its adoring fans can be incredibly irritating .
Of course , its fans have to put up with some irritations , too : Simply being a member of the club still means you must endure unending jabs from the other side of the socio- political - techno aisle .
But do they have to wear their suffering as a badge of honor ?
Today , we -- that 's us , Narasu and Alan , veteran Mac users both -- are going to get some stuff off our chests .
We 've enumerated ten things we hate about Apple ( or its followers , or simply about the experience of using its products ) .
But in the interest of fair play ( not to be confused with FairPlay , Apple 's DRM technology ) we 're also publishing another list -- Ten Things We Love About Apple .
Use the Comment link at the end of this article to add your own gripes about Apple - - or to defend it .
And so , with protective helmets in place , off we go :
1 : Free Speech , Anyone ?
Even if you 're no Apple fan , this particular issue might not rise to the top of your own personal gripe list -- but hey , we 're journalists .
So sue us .
Er , that 's probably not the right turn of phrase to use , considering that in December 2004 , Apple filed a lawsuit against the AppleInsider , O'Grady 's PowerPage , and Think Secret Web sites for posting information about upcoming technologies that Apple had shared with outsiders under nondisclosure agreements .
In the case of O'Grady , the news was of a FireWire interface for GarageBand .
In the words of O'Grady himself : " yawn . "
Apple pressured the sites to reveal their sources , and even worse , pressured the sites ' ISPs .
In May 2006 , a California court said no way , ruling that online journalists enjoy the same First Amendment rights as " legitimate " offline journalists .
Seems silly in today 's world , does n't it ?
Recently , the court ordered Apple to pay the sites ' legal fees -- about $ 700,000 .
2. More Secretive Than Homeland Security
Those feds are secretive , but they 're no match for Apple reps ' infuriating stock answer : " We do n't comment on future product plans . "
Being an Apple adherent means never knowing for sure if the shiny new MacBook or iPod you just bought is about to be rendered obsolete by a Steve Jobs keynote .
Of course , Apple is merely the most famous secretive Silicon Valley company , not the only hush - mouthed one .
And tight lips make for explosive buzz when the company does decide to drop a bombshell .
But contrast Apple 's secrecy with Microsoft 's lack thereof -- Bill Gates , Steve Ballmer , and company love to talk about their company 's upcoming products , and they still get their fair share of buzz .
Even though many of those plans have a tendency to not actually come true .
3. Ain't Too Proud to Blame
When Apple shipped iPods containing a worm last year , instead of issuing a humble mea culpa , Apple took a swipe at Microsoft , saying , " As you might imagine , we are upset at Windows for not being more hardy against such viruses , and even more upset with ourselves for not catching it . "
As you can imagine , that did n't fly with security experts .
How about an apology to the folks who were unlucky enough to buy the infected iPods , period ?
4. iHate iAnything
Apple first floated the idea of product names with a leading lowercase letter in 1994 with eWorld , an ill - conceived online service that went belly - up after a year and a half .
But when it introduced the original iMac in 1998 , it hit on a phenomenal success -- and prompted hundreds of third - party manufacturers to follow with sickeningly cute Bondi Blue products with names that also began with a lowercase " i. "
Now dozens of Apple and third - party product names begins with " i. "
Their manufacturers are all jumping on the bandwagon , hoping that a single letter will sway us to buy their stuff .
Meanwhile , you can't even start sentences with the products ' names .
Is it any wonder that we 're inclined to like Apple TV in part because it turned out not to be iTV ?
Or that we 're kind of sorry that Apple was able to strike a deal with Cisco to share the name iPhone ?
While locating the most useful sites on the Web , we felt it only fair to call out the some of the most useless , too .
We found no shortage of sites that are poorly designed or boring , but we list here some of the sites that go that extra mile -- the dazzlingly ugly , the patently offensive , and the mind - bogglingly pointless .
AOL AIM Dashboard ( dashboard.aim.com ) : I 'll admit that Dashboard already has two strikes against it just because it immediately gets right into my face every time AIM starts up , which means every time I fire up my PC .
Once this lame site has your eyeballs , the site seems willing to do anything to keep them , if just for a few seconds , using eye - candy graphics and tabloidy headlines like " High School Love Triangle " and " My Nasty Texts Went to my Dad ! " Strike Three .
HavenWorks ( havenworks.com ) :
If a Web - design program got sick and threw up , it might look something like this site .

Zombo ( www.zombo.com): A Web site ?
Concept art ?
A prank gone horribly wrong ?
I honestly do n't know .
Open the page and you will hear : " This is zombo.com .
You can do anything at Zombo.com .

Anything can happen at zombo.com . "
Well , in fact , nothing happens at zombo.com .

Wait , why am I here ?
City Optix ( cityoptix.com ) : Sorry to pick on this little local optometry franchise , but sites that immediately launch and force you to watch ridiculously long , loud , and inane flash presentations -- and there are many of them - - drive me nuts .
This one is one of the worst examples of site design I 've seen .
Digg ( digg.com ) : OK , Digg is n't a horrible site , but it is one of the most depressing when you compare it to what it once was .
Digg 's top stories ( as voted on by Digg users ) used to be interesting , and tech - oriented .
But since Digg has grown so immensely popular , the top 10 Diggs usually consist of " lowest common denominator " stories : funny photos and videos , for the most part .
It 's a site cursed by its own popularity .
Weekly World News ( www.weeklyworldnews.com): " The world 's only reliable news " site is chock full of news you can't do without .

" Why ...
The Cappuccino JavaScript framework has been open source for an entire week .
You 've glanced at the tutorials , and tried to get 280 Slides to break while feverishly mumbling about the JavaScript Rock Star that desecrated the JQuery website .
In the back of your head , though , you have a question .
And its an important question .
Actually , damn it , you have more than one question , but I do n't know who ate the last slice of cheesecake or why it is n't lunch time yet .
I 'm here to answer a different quetion :
Do you care about Cappuccino ?
Why , yes , you do .
That is n't to say that you 'll ever use Cappuccino .
You probably wo n't , but you do care .
Why You Care
Cappuccino not only encourages , but demands API - centered development .
Because the majority of application logic is handled client side , your server only needs to implement a simple API for serving the limited aspects of your application that cannot be handled client side .
Consider an application that retrieves Flickr images and then allows users to rate them .
You can retrieve the Flickr images on the client side , display the images client side , and handle rating client side .
The only thing your server needs to do is record the image 's rating .
An API to accomplish that would be remarkably simple ( a POST request with an image 's id , the rating score , and a value to track the user ) , and would require far less server power than a traditional web application .
Also , this API - centric approach supports developing applications on multiple platforms .
The API could support a Cappuccino application as well as an iPhone application .
Flexibility is a good thing .
Cappuccino promotes code reuse .
By making it easier to separate code into multiple files -- and making traditional OO inheritance easy to take advantage of -- Cappuccino makes it easier to design reusable swathes of code .
This means it 's easy to reuse your components in other projects , but also that it is easier to incorporate others ' work into your projects as well .
JavaScript 's single namespace -- and lack of an import mechanism beyond simply loading the file -- are lacking in this regard , and Cappuccino is a valuable step forward in this regard .
More than just promoting code reuse , Cappuccino helps manage complexity .
Large JavaScript projects can become unwieldly , and you often end up writing custom build scripts to manage that complexity , but Cappuccino will help you reduce complexity .
Cocoa -- the Objective - C framework that Cappuccino was based on -- uses a handful of design patterns over and over to ruthlessly manage complexity .
Delegation helps reduce the amount of subclassing you need to perform , singletons provide easy access to important instances even without a direct reference , and rich superclasses expose numerous methods for overriding to customize behavior .
Together these make living by Once and Only Once much easier than in traditional JavaScript .
Cappuccino will shine when dealing with large projects that become unwieldly when approached with traditional JavaScript .
The angle that the 280 North creators have focused on in Cappuccino is that Cappuccino allows bypassing CSS and HTML cross - browser hell .
This is an important asset , but personally I do n't consider it to be the most compelling benefit .
Managing cross-platform issues is frustrating , but as more designers and companies begin to ignore IE6 , the process is becoming signifigantly less burdensome .
Cappuccino is about the future , and cross- platform issues are part of the receeding past , so focusing on them too heavily seems a diservice to Cappuccino 's appeals .
Although many have traditionally felt uncomfortable with JavaScript heavy frameworks ( YUI or ExtJS ) , we 're finally reaching a point where impressively quick JavaScript performance is becoming ubiquitous .
Even a year ago the issue of slow JavaScript implementations would have been far more threatening , but Firefox , WebKit and Chrome sport excellent JavaScript implementations , and are getting faster every month .
Internet Explorer 's JavaScript implementation still lags a bit in raw speed , but IE8 appears to have some exciting promise in that direction as well ( and Windows users have the option of using WebKit or Firefox as well ) , so it seems safe to declare that JavaScript has become fast enough .
Why You Probably Wo n't Use It
There are a number of compelling reasons to use Cappuccino , but nonethless I suspect that most developers will never come in contact with it ( beyond some experimention in their personal time ) .
The biggest reason you 'll never use Cappuccino is because its too different from what everyone else is using .
This is one of the key reasons why Lisps have never caught on in the main stream , and in the end I suspect it will prevent Cappuccino from crossing over from niche to ordinary .
One of the side - affects of modeling Cappuccino after a desktop application toolkit is that functionality is cheap , but presentation is expensive .
For its sundry problems , HTML and CSS are masterful at displaying content , and desktop applications generally have a much simpler approach to displaying content .
I 'd go so far as to say that the standard for web design has continued to grow higher and more nuanced over the past decade , but desktop application design has grown in much smaller steps , and presently the expectations for desktop applications are far below that of websites .
With the high standards for design on the web , cheap functionality can only go so far , most projects require cheap presentation as well .
HTML and CSS are the lingua franca of the web , and many existing services provide their data in them .
Because Cappuccino does n't speak the lingua franca fluently , it is less able to reuse existing code and less able to interoperate with existing services ( although it handles JSON quite well , so services which are data -- but not formatted data -- heavy will interoperate nicely ) .
Like I told you , you do care about Cappuccino .
It 's exciting , and it will inspire a number of copycat projects in the coming months and years .
Whether or not these projects come into mainstream usage will likely depend on their ability to coexist with the existing HTML / CSS infrastructure .
Along that route exists a balance between ease of functionality and ease of presentation , and potent new avenues of web development .
Introducing Chalkinator : Native desktop blogging app 7 Jun , 2020
Would you be interested in me creating a native ( macOS maybe ? ) desktop app that would manage your blog , geared at developers ?
I ’ve been struck by how , over the years , I ’ve had so many great work opportunities that have come my way through tech blogging , and how so few developers do it - surely they should , and if it was easier , maybe they would ?
Please let me know , I really want to know if it ’s worth investing time and effort into this , if it seems like an idea that could help people or if it would just be a waste of time and effort .
So I ’ve created a prototype ( the screenshot was above ) for what I ’d like to call ‘ Chalkinator ’ .
Basically with it you ’d set up your site , choose your template , manage your posts , and voila you have a tech blog .
It would manage the hassles of organising your AWS / Cloudflare hosting so your blog would basically cost zero to run ( unlike say Wordpress where reputable hosting costs a bit for a hobby blog ) , and would n’t slow down under load .
It would n’t be complicated like using Jekyll or Hugo or managing AWS hosting yourself , because I do n’t think many people have endless hours they can waste getting their blog working .
I ’ve used plenty of blogging platforms over the years .
And when I ’ve blogged for over 10 years it has become apparent that you need something that ’ll stick around , otherwise you face painful migrations every few years .
This is why I ’d charge monthly instead of one - off , this is a win -win for customers and me : Customers get an app maintained in perpetuity , and I get to pay my bills in perpetuity .
It would n’t necessarily be only for developers , but it would be geared that way .
Code highlighting would ‘ just work ’ out of the box without any plugins .
I imagine you ’d write in Markdown and certain indents would automatically be treated as code .
macOS native perhaps , or maybe cross- platform - I ’m not 100 % clear on what would be best here to be honest , and would love to hear your suggestions .
So what ’s with the bizarre name ?
Well , the thesaurus came up with ‘ chalk ’ as a synonym for write ; my kids love watching ‘ Odd Squad ’ where agents use their gadgets to solve all sorts of weird problems , and all the gadgets end with ‘ inator ’… and so , this crazy portmanteau was born :)
Anyway I repeat , please let me know if this is a good idea or not .

Flare : Open source 2 - way folder sync to Backblaze B2 in Swift 28 May , 2020 Over the years , various syncing applications have bugged me with how often they spike to 100 % CPU usage , their memory usage , pricing , and other issues .
So I set out to write my own for fun !
Spoiler : in the end , I learned you really should just use Dropbox 🤣
However , I did manage to make it work , and reliably enough that I ’m using it for some personal files , so I ’m open - sourcing it in case anyone wants to check it out .
Flare
The project is called Flare , which is in reference to the ‘ blaze ’ part of the backend service ’s name .
It is essentially a Dropbox clone that performs 2 - way sync of files between a local folder and ‘ the cloud ’ ( in this case , Backblaze B2 ) .
These files will then sync to many computers automatically .
You could use it to keep a folder synced for members of a team , for instance .
And because it uses Backblaze , your storage costs are miniscule .
It ’s written in Swift , available at github.com / chrishulbert / flare , and ( more - or - less ) works !
You really should n’t use this for important use , it ’s a hobby project !
Features
Uses zero CPU / RAM at idle because it only syncs hourly ( and upon wake from sleep ) , and has no process running the rest of the time .
Even when running , uses little CPU / RAM due to simplicity and native code .
Syncs to Backblaze B2 , which has extremely generous free tier and inexpensive pricing :
If you used Flare and could live with its limitations , you could theoretically save a bucketload vs an office of people paying for a popular sync service .
If you delete a file , it will remain accessible in the Backblaze B2 admin panel for the duration of their garbage collection period ( a week or a month , potentially ) .
Limitations Both macOS and Windows ( probably Linux too , I did n’t check ) do not update the ‘ last modified ’ date of the tree of folders above a modified file .
Eg , say you have a structure similar to foo / bar / yada / blah.txt and modify blah .
txt .
Foo , bar , and yada ’s last modified date will unfortunately not change .
In a slightly better case , if you rename blah . txt to blah2.txt , the immediate parent folder ( yada ) will change it ’s last modified date , however grandparents and great - grandparents ( foo and bar , respectively ) will not .
This is because those operating systems want to remain efficient .
However this means that Flare cannot simply look at a last modified date and determine that it can skip an entire folder tree : it must still scan every subfolder and every file to see if anything has changed , every time it syncs .
This is the biggest limitation of Flare .
This could be resolved with an always - running agent , but then you ’d also need a full - scan when launching the agent to catch any changes that occurred while it was n’t running .
However , for a hobby project I simply do not have the time to pursue this ( I have children to chase ! ) .
Also , B2 does not give you folder last modified dates either , so you ’d need a custom backend .
and modify blah .
txt .
Foo , bar , and yada ’s last modified date will unfortunately not change .

Also , B2 does not give you folder last modified dates either , so you ’d need a custom backend .
Flare handles subfolders very poorly .
If you create a subfolder , it will sync fine .
But if you delete that subfolder , it wo n’t have the smarts to know to ‘ push ’ that deletion to the server and ‘ pull ’ it down and apply it to other computers .
IIRC this was due to the lack of metadata that could be reasonably stored with B2 , which is totally understandable from their perspective .
I really pushed B2 too far with all this .
Renames count as a deletion of the old file , and creation of a new file .
Huge files are simply thrown in the too - hard basket and ignored .
The macOS service that it used to schedule it is flaky :
It launches Flare on wake from sleep only about half the time .
In general : What this project taught me is that 2 - way sync is an exponentially more complicated problem than 1 - way sync ( although not an impossible problem : I got reasonably close to a useful solution ! ) and you should use one of the popular services for anything important , and be amazed when they ‘ just work ’ .
Installation
These instructions are only for macOS .
However , the app should compile fine on any Swift - supported platform if you see fit .
Create a Backblaze B2 account and bucket .
Install homebrew if needed : brew.sh
Install flare : brew install chrishulbert / flare / flare
Configure it : flare configure
Schedule it to run hourly : flare schedule Musings
Swift really won me over with it ’s ability to model all the edge - cases of synchronisation in a way that would n’t compile unless I handled every one .
A great example of this is the switch statement in ListingReconciliation .
swift .
This is how a good language fosters safe code , and I ’m a huge fan .
So : thanks , Chris Lattner .
Thanks for reading , I hope this interests someone , and have a great week !

Making a baby monitor out of a couple of ESP32s , an I2S microphone , and a small speaker 16 Apr , 2020 I ’ve been struck by how many baby monitors have died over the span of our children .
The things just seem to last about a year or two , and they cost a lot !
So I ’ve finally decided to make my own .
Hardware I ’m using a pair of ESP32 boards here , because they ’re popular , common , and cheap .
They have ESP - Now which allows you to communicate between them without Wi -Fi , an I2S audio input , and a DAC for audio output .
You should be able to find them on ebay for under $ 10 each .
For the microphone , I ’m using an INMP441 .
It ’s a 24 - bit I2S non-PDM microphone which is , you guessed it , cheap .
You should be able to find them for under $ 5 on ebay .
The speaker I used is an 8 Ω one I had lying around in a learn electronics kit .
It ’s very quiet .
If you were doing this project for real , you should probably find a small amplifier board instead .
Microphone wiring
To connect the microphone to one of the ESP32s , I recommend reading about I2S on Wikipedia first .
Here ’s the connections : L/R ( left / right ) ->
This goes to ground .
According to the INMP441 datasheet this makes it the left channel .
WS ( word select , aka LRCLK ) ->
This goes to pin D15 on the ESP32 .
SCK ( serial clock , aka BCLK / bit clock ) -> D14 .
SD ( serial data , aka DOUT ) -> D34 .
VDD -> To +3.3V .
GND -> Ground .
Speaker wiring
To connect the speaker ( or line - out ) to the other ESP32 : One wire to ground .
Another wire to D25 on the ESP32 .
Arduino I ’m using Arduino to program the ESP32s , because it ’s simpler than Espressif ’s toolchain .
Install Arduino , then follow these instructions to add ESP32 support .
You ’ll probably need to install drivers to suit whatever USB - UART bridge chip is on your boards .
There should be two chips near the USB connector : one is power ( not many pins ) , and one is the UART ( lots of pins ) .
Read the chip number , find the manufacturer ’s page , and find and install the drivers .
In my case , it was a Silabs CP2102 .
The Arduino settings that work for me are as follows , perhaps they will work for you : Tools > Board > ESP32 Wrover module
Tools >
Port > /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART
Tools > Programmer > ArduinoISP
I find that I need to hold down the ‘ boot ’ button on my boards while programming them .
ESP - Now setup
You ’ll need to find the MAC of the receiving ESP32 .
Here ’s some Arduino code to do this : #include " WiFi.h " void setup ( ) { Serial.begin( 115200 ) ; WiFi.mode( WIFI_MODE_STA ) ; Serial.println(WiFi.macAddress ( ) ) ; } void loop ( ) {} Transmitter
Here ’s the code for the ESP32 which listens to the mic via the I2S input , converts to 8 - bits , and transmits over ESP - Now : #include " WiFi.h " # include " esp_now.h " #include " driver /i2s.h " uint8_t receiverMAC [ ] = { 0x11 , 0x22 , 0x33 , 0x44 , 0x55 , 0x66} ; <- Replace this with the MAC of your other board ! void setup ( ) { Serial.begin( 115200 ) ; WiFi.mode( WIFI_MODE_STA ) ; // Wifi ( prerequisite for ESP - Now ) .
// Setup ESP - Now first , because I2S uses it .
Serial.println ( " Setup ESP - Now ... " ) ; if ( ESP_OK != esp_now_init( ) ) { Serial.println ( " esp_now_init : error " ) ; return ; } esp_now_peer_info_t peerInfo = { 0} ; memcpy ( peerInfo.peer_addr , receiverMAC , sizeof ( receiverMAC ) ) ; // TODO encrypt , by setting peerInfo.lmk. if ( ESP_OK != esp_now_add_peer(&peerInfo ) ) { Serial.println (" esp_now_add_peer : error " ) ; return ; } // I2S.

Things you might want to consider , because this project is far from perfect : Using an ESP - Now encryption key .
Making the ‘ sender ’ not transmit a packet if the sound level is quiet , which will likely extend the life of the radio circuitry .
Making the ‘ receiver ’ handle missed packets gracefully and treat them as quiet .
Some kind of amplifier , or I2S sound output from the receiver , for better sound quality .
Mounting it nicely !

WASHINGTON
Some of John McCain ’s friends , from the good old days when he talked straight , feared that his Greek tragedy would be that he would be defeated by George Bush twice : once in 2000 , because of W. ’s no-conscience campaigning , and again in 2008 , because of W. ’s no -brains governing .
But if McCain loses , he will have contributed to his own downfall by failing to live up to his personal standard of honor .
John McCain has long been torn between wanting to succeed and serving a higher cause .
Right now , the drive to succeed is trumping any loftier aspirations .
He cynically picked a running mate with less care than theater directors give to picking a leading actor ’s understudy .
And he has been running a seamy campaign originally designed by the bad seed of conservative politics , Lee Atwater .
It was adapted in 2000 in Atwater ’s home state of South Carolina by Atwater acolytes in W. ’s camp to harpoon McCain with rumors that he had fathered out of wedlock a black baby ( as opposed to adopting a Bangladeshi infant girl in wedlock ) .
Sulfurous Atwater - style rumor - mongering by Bush supporters  that McCain had come home from a Hanoi tiger cage with snakes in his head  aimed to stop him during that primary after he had zoomed in New Hampshire .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
There 's no doubt about it .
The European media has given Sarah Palin a hard time .
One European newspaper called the idea of a Palin presidency a " half - baked Alaskan nightmare . "
Things started quite well , with the curiosity factor .
To many Europeans there is something exotic about snowy Alaska .
Viewers and readers were intrigued by the shots of the outdoorswoman with her eyes squinting fixed along a gun barrel , the thought of a vice president who had once been a beauty queen .
Columnists were approving that here , for once , was a politician in the higher reaches who probably actually knew the price of a loaf and a pint of milk .
Women writers in particular responded warmly to her joke about the difference between a pitbull and a hockey mom --" Lipstick . "
But soon the carping began , and it was not confined to what U.S. rightists like to dismiss as the " liberal media elite . "
We were , the Irish Times warned , " just a heartbeat away from the biggest half - baked Alaskan nightmare . "
Britain 's Financial Times said his selection of vice president raised serious questions about John McCain 's judgment and added : " The Palin appointment is yet more proof of the way that abortion still dominates American politics . "
Prominence was given to an onslaught on Palin 's environmental and animal rights record by veteran ex-film star Brigitte Bardot .
Spain 's left wing El Pais described Palin as " a figure who comes from the America that is farthest removed from and incomprehensible to the European spectator . "
Since then the scorn has been constant , the jokes unrelenting , the YouTube exposure devastating .
But let us dispel one bit of nonsense from the start .
It is nothing to do with Sarah Palin being of the feminine gender .
Sound Off : Is it fair for Europeans to criticize Sarah Palin ?
Europeans have been astonished that America has never had a woman president .
After all we in Britain elected the redoubtable Margaret Thatcher three times as prime minister .
Norway did the same with Gro Harlem Brundtland .
Germany has a female chancellor , Angela Merkel , even if she does tend to underline the remark I once heard from a British Ambassador : " A German joke is no laughing matter . "
Nicolas Sarkozy 's socialist challenger for the French presidency was the elegant Segolene Royal .
When Sarah Palin first became McCain 's running mate there were even headlines in some British media suggesting that America had found its own Margaret Thatcher .
That certainly was overdoing it .
So much so that after 20 years close up reporting on the original I can't resist the temptation to paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen 's comment when Dan Quayle unwisely compared himself to John F. Kennedy .
" I 've interviewed Margaret Thatcher , Governor Palin , and I can tell you that you are no Margaret Thatcher . "
No , the problem for Sarah Palin in terms of her acceptance in Europe has been the deep wave of Obamamania that had already swept through the European media before her appointment , the self - inflicted wounds of her early media appearances and the apparent box - ticking cynicism of her choice .
That was summed up for some by the appearance of those women at McCain rallies wearing T - shirts emblazoned " Small Town Gun-Totin Christians for McCain . "
For Europeans , who were alienated during George W. Bush 's first four years by a president who showed little interest in their continent and patently cared nothing for the opinions of its leaders , the turning point probably came with the appearance on the Katie Couric show when Palin confessed to not having had a passport until 2006 .
Europeans are appalled at the thought that someone who wants to be vice president of the most powerful nation on earth had so little interest in the rest of a world which is so vitally affected by the decisions of the man , or woman , in the White House .
iReport : Why are the 2008 U.S. Elections important to you and your home country ?
And they are not much impressed by explanations that her parents did not have the money to send her on a fact - finding tour of the world as a student .
Anybody with the money to own an SUV , hunt moose and drive a snowmobile has the money to travel .
It was the American Mark Twain who reminded us all that " travel is fatal to prejudice , bigotry and narrow - mindedness . "
If Sarah Palin wanted to be loved in Europe she should have got about a bit .
Stretching his 15 minutes of fame : Joe the Plumber may put out a country album just in time for the Inauguration .
Joe the Plumber pursued for record deal
Move over , Sanjaya , and tell William Hung the news :
Joe the Plumber is being pursued for a major record deal and could come out with a country album as early as Inauguration Day .
“ Joe ” — aka Samuel Wurzelbacher , a Holland , Ohio , pipe - and - toilet man — just signed with a Nashville public relations and management firm to handle interview requests and media appearances , as well as create new career opportunities , including a shift out of the plumbing trade into stage and studio performances .
Advertisement
On Tuesday , Wurzelbacher joined country music artist and producer Aaron Tippin to form a new partnership that includes booking - management firm Bobby Roberts and publicity - management concern
The Press Office to field the multiple media offers he ’s received over the past few weeks .
Among the requests : a possible record deal with a major label , personal appearances and corporate sponsorships .
A longtime country music fan , Wurzelbacher can sing and “ knocks around on guitar ” but is not an accomplished musician or songwriter , according to The Press Office ’s Jim Della Croce .
“ He ’s a complicated guy with a very dynamic personality , ” Della Croce told Politico .
“ He can sing and obviously has a strong political point of view . ”
The Press Office , a PR firm based in Nashville , Tenn. , represents an eclectic array of other clients including country stars John Anderson and the Gatlin Brothers , quirky folk singer Leon Redbone , NASCAR driver Chase Mattioli and animal repellent firm Liquid Fence .
The Bobby Roberts Company reps several of the same acts , in addition to Juice Newton , Merle Haggard and Jon Secada .
Wurzelbacher made his auspicious debut earlier this month when Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama appeared in “ Joe ’s ” neighborhood and was buttonholed on his tax plan .
The media blitz went into high gear after John McCain talked about Wurzelbacher during the last televised presidential debate .
He has since made an appearance on Fox ’s weekend variety show starring former presidential aspirant Mike Huckabee , and this week was showcased by McCain in a series of “ Joe the Plumber ” events .
The new partnership originated on the set of the “ Huckabee ” show , where Tippin appeared with his band during the same program .
On a recent case , deputies were called to evict residents at a foreclosed building on North Spaulding Avenue , and arrived to find six families who were all paying rent to the landlord .
“ All the time we paid every month , he never said nothing , ” said Alma Aquino , who lived in one unit with her husband , their two children , and Mrs. Aquino ’s mother and sister , for a rent of $ 850 .
“ My husband tried to explain , but the sheriffs said we ca n’t talk , we need to evacuate . ”
The family ended up staying , and Sheriff Dart , who has supported legislation to protect residents in foreclosures , soon stopped evictions .
Sheriff Dart said the evictions had taken an emotional toll on his staff .
“ It ’s one of most gut - wrenching things we do , seeing little children put out on the street with their possessions .
And the hard part is that the parent played by all the rules , and they ’re being traumatized . ”
Nationally , only about 10 percent of residents in properties with subprime mortgages  the ones most likely to go into foreclosure  are renters , said Eric Halperin , director of the Washington office of the Center for Responsible Lending , an advocacy group .
But in some cities the figure is much higher .
Daniel Lindsey of the Home Ownership Preservation Project run by Legal Assistance of Chicago , estimated that half of the city ’s foreclosures involved renters .
“ This is a big deal in the sense that it shows the pressures local governments are under when they ’re forced to carry out those foreclosures and evictions , ” Mr. Halperin said .
“ It ’s another example of how the foreclosure crisis is overwhelming our institutions .
Homeowners and renters ca n’t get the relief they ’re entitled to under the law . ”
Barack Obama is fully prepared to fight back on the “ nuclear option ” John McCain has promised to use in the final 30 days of this election campaign .
And when the campaign opened that “ Use in case of smear campaign ” drawer of their filing cabinets , there was plenty to find .

Most of us have at least one bad financial habit .
But some habits are worse than others , especially over time .
Do you have any of these ?
Treating your credit card like free money …
So many people get so excited when they get their credit card .
The problem here , of course , is that people tend to use their credit card as free money for ages after they get it .
You need to pay back everything that you use your credit card for – and usually at unkind interest rates .
The average interest rate is about 19 % APR .
Do n’t think that ’s a lot ?
Over time , that ’s a bundle .

… then making minimum payments on your credit card
This is actually a problem even if you ’re not overspending with your card .
When people are n’t treating credit cards like free money , they ’re treating it like very cheap money .
They have to start paying that credit back every month , but they ’ll pay the least that their bank will allow them to pay .
Big mistake .
The longer you take to pay back credit , the more expensive it is in the long run .
It will also look bad on your credit report if you ever have to get one .
Read more about credit report no -nos at http://moneyover55.about.com/od/managingdebt/a/creditscore.htm.
Not exploring your options
I ’ll admit that this sounds a little vague .
Technically , this can be split up into two habits .
The first is not looking for another deal when it comes to something you want to buy .
This could either be searching for a cheaper option , or looking for an outlet that sells the same item for less .
However , it would be fair to ss .
Stores usually have savings schemes if you ’re a member , for example .
You can also search online for coupons before you start shopping .

Impulse buying
You may have heard before that you should let time pass when you think you want to buy something .
But that kind of advice assumes that all impulse buys are quite expensive .
Not so .
Have you ever walked into a shop to buy one food item , then ended up stockpiling for what seems like a month ?
That ’s a type of impulse spending .
When you go out for specific items , try to stick to those items !
Read some more tips at https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/how-to-stop-impulse-spending.
Not letting your investments be
This does n’t apply to everyone , of course .
But if you ’re making frequent visits to a financial blog such as this , chances are you ’ve got an investment or two .
Or , perhaps , you ’re merely interested in looking into investments .
In any case , one of the most understated bad financial habits that investors have is always checking their investments .
It seems like a good idea , on the surface .
But let ’s say you have a long - term investment .
Long - term investments tend to be quite volatile in the short - term .
Over long amounts of time , they tend to see good profits .
But in - between , it ’s a bit of a rollercoaster .
If you check it obsessively , you might be tempted to sell off prematurely .

A couple of weeks ago I started a post with this nugget of , uh , wisdom :
This should be a vendor 's first rule when inviting 1,200 IT pros to a seminar about securing data and protecting personal information :
Make sure you protect the personal information of the 1,200 professionals you 're trying to impress .
I did n't think the second rule required mentioning at the time , but I 've been proven wrong , so here is rule No. 2 : If you make the mistake of breaking rule No. 1 , do n't be foolish enough to do it again .
Verizon has done it again ... to the same people .
David Williams , technology coordinator for a Texas school district , was the fellow who told me about the original fumbling .
He wrote then : " In a period of three hours I received 14 e-mails promoting Verizon 's ' Secure the Information .
Secure the Infrastructure ' webinar series ...
Considering their content ( about data - breach seminars ) , I thought it very humorous that the TO : field of the e-mails contained over 1,200 e-mail addresses . "
Verizon apologized for the goof - up and blamed a problem with Microsoft Exchange .
However , Williams yesterday sent me this message :
" Update on Verizon .
Just received the e-mail from Verizon promoting the Texas DIR seminar series 14 more times last night between 9:36 and 11:53 p.m .
Same e-mail as before , same 1,200 - plus e-mail addresses .
...
Looks like a relay server resent the e-mails from Oct 7th again ? "
Can you believe it ?
Williams sent the e-mail headers , so you can believe it .
Note to Verizon :
If you 've already broken rules No. 1 and No. 2 when inviting 1,200 IT pros to a seminar about protecting personal information , be aware that there is no rule No. 3 . You 're in uncharted waters .
Apple is continuously working on its iOS and it seems that it has just released a new public beta version of the iOS 10.3.2 , which can now be downloaded and installed on your iPhone or iPad .
We remind you that that yesterday , the BETA was available only for the developers , but Apple has decided in just a few hours that the version is already good enough to be released for the public .
Unlike developers , the public beta testers are able to try out the latest iOS beta version for free , via the Beta Software Program that Apple provides .
In other words , if you do n’t want to wait for the iOS 10.3.2 stable version , you can already start downloading and installing the public BETA of iOS 10.3.2 on your handset .
Keep in mind that in order to be able to download and install the iOS 10.3.2 public BETA on your device you will need to be part of the Beta Software Program that Apple provides .
So , if you ’re ready to join the beta program , head to this Apple web page and tap the “ Sign Up ” button .
The iOS 10.3.2 public beta update has about 195MB in size , which means that it is just a bit larger than the iOS 10.3.2 BETA version that was released last week .
However , it does n’t seem that the build has changed much , which means that Apple has just worked on fixing some bugs that they ’ve found in the previous version of the operating system .
However , some users have already reported that this build is delivering a very slight performance increase .
We remind you that Apple has n’t released the iOS 9.3.2 build before introducing the iOS 10 .
We remind you that the WWDC is scheduled for June 5 - 9 , 2017 , when the iOS 11 is expected to be announced .
This clearly shows that Apple is trying to patch almost everything in iOS 10 that could allow hackers to jailbreak the operating system .
Until now , it has managed to do this without any problems , but there are reports saying that one of the two hacker groups TaiG or Pangu , or maybe both , will release an iOS 10 jailbreak .
Man shot three times in street by racist gunman - for wearing Barack Obama T - shirt
A man told today how he was shot three times in a London street for wearing a Barack Obama T - shirt .
Dube Egwuatu was buying a mobile telephone top - up card in an off - licence when the gunman confronted him and glared at the top , which carries an image of the Democrat US presidential candidate underneath the legend ' Believe ' .
The man then launched into a tirade of racist slurs , shouting ' I f*** ing hate n*****s' and urging 36 - year - old Mr Egwuatu to leave the shop with him .
Respect : Dube Egwuatu wearing the Obama T - shirt that provoked a racist attack
The man then left the shop but when Mr Egwuatu re-emerged , the attacker was waiting for him in broad daylight with a threatening - looking dog and holding a gun behind his back .
Realising what had sparked the increasingly violent assault , the terrified Mr Egwuatu zipped up his jacket to cover the image of Mr Obama and walked to his car .
But the shaven - headed man , who was white , followed Mr Egwuatu and after pulling open the passenger door pointed the gun at him .
After pleading with the man to leave him alone , the married former street warden put the keys in the ignition and turned the engine on .
The attacker then fired the gas - powered ball - bearing pistol three times , hitting the civil servant in the face , hand and shoulder .
Fearing for his life and bleeding heavily , Mr Egwuatu raced away in his car and found somewhere safe to call for help .
He was taken to hospital and later sent to have a piece of metal removed from his jaw .
Mr Egwuatu , a data analyst with Croydon Council , said : ' The venom in his voice was frightening .
' He was telling me that he was going to kill me .
' I could n't believe it was happening - and just because I was wearing an Obama T - shirt .
He was trying to make me walk somewhere quieter , saying : ' I 've got something for you , ' and ' I 'm going to kill you . '
He added : ' Obama inspires me , his educational track record alone is quite unbelievable - that is why I was wearing the T - shirt .
' I did not think for one minute it could stir up such powerful feelings of hatred and I never said a word to him . '
Mr Egwuatu 's wife , Angela , 35 , said neither of them had experienced anything like it during their childhood in Nigeria .
Mrs Egwuatu , an immigration officer , said : ' At first my feelings were pure horror and now it is pure anger .
' If he had been carrying a real gun I would have been a widow .
It is just ridiculous .
' I do n't know how a person 's mentality works .
Why would a T - shirt get you to the point where you want to shoot someone . '
To the untrained eye , ball - bearing guns like the one used in the attack look every bit like a real firearm .
The potentially lethal weapons are often converted by criminals to fire real bullets , and can be bought easily in high - street shops and on websites .
The Met said it was investigating the incident , which took place in South Norwood , and that police searched a nearby house which the attacker was seen going into .
No one has been arrested .
Yes , you read that title correctly .
An Ice Hockey game in Sweden ’s second - tier professional league was delayed several times due to the fans littering the ice with dildos .
The organized taunting of an opposing player also included banners and a large inflatable penis .
Ahead of Tuesday ’s match against Leksand , the website for AIK ’s unofficial supporter group had instructed fans to bring dildos to the match to remind defenseman Jan Huokko of the sex scandal which plagued him earlier in the year .
Since we do n’t really have the resources to scout Swedish second - tier professional ice hockey , we will have to rely on The Local for more on the wacky festivities :
As one of Leksand ’s top - scoring defencemen and a former member of Sweden ’s national team , Huokko is known for putting the biscuit in the basket .
But back in June , Huokko ’s reputation for “ scoring ” took on a different twist when a sexually - charged video clip featuring the 34 - year - old blueliner and his girlfriend ended up on the internet .
Huokko had recorded the clip on his mobile phone , and was n’t surprised to find it spreading like wildfire on the internet after the phone was stolen .
“ It was a private thing between me and my girl , ” he said at the time .
“ That ’s what people do when it comes to sex . ”
Before Tuesday ’s match even started , AIK fans had already littered the ice with dozens of dildos , causing a slight delay as crews worked to clear the sex toys from the playing surface .
AIK club management was aware of their fans ’ plans for knocking Huokko off his game , but elected not to intervene .
“ We ’d also heard mention of it , but we decided that it would only be worse if we went out and told the fans they were absolutely not allowed to throw dildos on the ice , ” said AIK club head Mats Hedenström to the newspaper .
I was n’t able to find the mobile phone video on the internets .
I blame google , and my lack of ability to speak Swedish .
I was able to find the next best thing though , video from the hockey game !
If you happen to be going to a Hockey game this weekend , please do n’t forget to use our affiliate linkto purchase your “ equipment ” .
Hopefully this is the last dildo story you will see on this site , but we ca n’t promise anything .
I guess this makes the octopus tradition in Detroit , or rats in Florida seem a bit tame in comparison .
No Gay Sex , Please ;
We 're from Virginia Guidebooks to Minneapolis returned to publisher due to gay nightlife section .
September 3 , 2008  --
A campaign official for the Virginia Lieutenant Governor cancelled an order for 150 guidebooks to entertainment in Minneapolis - St .
Paul after discovering they included a 6 - 8 page section for gay and lesbian nightclubs .
" Having a section dedicated solely to GLBT will be a BIG problem for many of our folks .
We simply can't hand them out , " wrote the aide , Melissa Busse , in an email to the guidebook publisher , Rake Publishing , obtained by ABC affiliate KSTP .
Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling said he was not aware of the decision by his aide and disagrees with it .
The books , intended as welcome gifts to members of the Virginia delegation , were called " Secrets of the City . "
Rake 's website features information and listings for an array of nightlife activities for gays and lesbians in the Minneapolis area , including " queer speed dating " , trivia night , and dildo bingo .
Rake 's COO did not immediately return calls for comment .
The Minneapolis- St. Paul area has a large and vibrant gay nightlife , where club managers said many Republicans were expected this week .
" We 've had quite a spike , mostly people who are curious come down and they wind up leaving and having a good time , " said Robert Parker , the manager of the Gay 90's club in downtown Minneapolis which features a popular " drag queen " show .
" Mississippi , Alabama , California , Arizona , I 've seen people from all over , said Parker .
" Shame on them " for not distributing the guidebooks " , said Parker .
He said his club " is all about inclusiveness , including everybody no matter who and what you are , and I think if perhaps Republicans come and see that and they would come in and see that the world could be that way , and they may learn something . "
In a statement , Virginia Lt. Gov Bolling said he was sorry the cancellation occurred " and wish it had not happened . "
He said the delegation would reimburse the publisher for his costs .

Last night , Tiff Chow , Jim Sterling , Aaron Linde and myself were joined by Jonathan Blow , creator of the single best game ever to hit Xbox Live Arcade .
It was pretty awesome .
You can listen to the whole thing here .
Though we did n't technically discuss any spoilers , I still would n't recommend listening unless you 've played through the game : certain things about the ending are hinted at , and most of the discussion probably wo n't be that interesting to you anyway if you have n't actually experienced the game yet .
Topics of discussion included :
- Tiff Chow : sings her most frightening jingle yet - Was the ending set in stone from the beginning of production ?
- Jon likes Space Giraffe , Aaron and Jim are rocked to their very cores - Jon weighs in ( sort of ) on the whole " Braid is about the development of the nuke " theory - Game prototypes - The one thing in Braid Jon is n't 100 % happy with
Considering almost every single reader question asked resulted in a really interesting response from Mr. Blow , it was even harder than usual to pick a best question .
However , Jon personally picked out The GHost 's question near the end of the episode , and gave an answer I did not expect .
Just post your email in the comments , GHost , and I 'll contact you about receiving your swag .

A new discovery could lead to treatments which turn off the inflammation in the lungs caused by influenza and other infections , according to a study published today in the journal Nature Immunology .
The symptoms of influenza , such as breathlessness , weight loss and fever , are made much worse by the immune system responding in an exaggerated way to the virus , rather than by the virus itself .
The virus is often cleared from the body by the time symptoms appear and yet symptoms can last for many days , because the immune system continues to fight the damaged lung .
The immune system is essential for clearing the virus , but it can damage the body when it overreacts if it is not quickly contained .
Such overreaction occurs in a number of diseases as well as influenza , such as asthma and inflammatory conditions in the gut .
During influenza infection , the immune system 's prolonged response causes the lungs to become inflamed and this can clog the airways and cause difficulty breathing .
The new study , led by researchers from Imperial College London , reveals how the activity of immune cells in the lung is normally kept under control by a receptor known as CD200R , working with another molecule called CD200 .
CD200R is found in high levels in the lungs and the new research shows that it is able to limit the immune system 's response and to turn off inflammation once it has started .

Influenza overrides the CD200 molecule and without CD200 to bind to , CD200R cannot work to prevent the immune system from overreacting , so the lungs become inflamed .
In the new study , the researchers gave mice infected with influenza a mimic of CD200 , or an antibody to stimulate CD200R , to see if these would enable CD200R to bring the immune system under control and reduce inflammation .
The mice that received treatment had less weight loss than control mice and less inflammation in their airways and lung tissue .
The influenza virus was still cleared from the lungs within seven days and so this strategy did not appear to affect the immune system 's ability to fight the virus itself .
Following these results in mice , the researchers hope that a therapy could be developed for people which can quickly work with the CD200R receptor and stop the immune system from fighting when it is no longer needed .
They believe this would quickly reduce symptoms and reduce the damage that the immune system causes in the lungs and elsewhere .
Professor Tracy Hussell , the lead author of the research from the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London , said : " The immune system is very sophisticated and much of the time it does a fantastic job of fighting infection , but it has the ability to cause a lot of damage when it overreacts .
Our new research is still in its early stages , but these findings suggest that it could be possible to prevent the immune system going into overdrive , and limit the unnecessary damage this can cause . "
Dr Robert Snelgrove , a Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellow at Imperial College London and another author of the research , added : " Although flu is just an inconvenience for some people , it can be dangerous and even fatal in the very young and elderly .
We hope our research could ultimately help to develop treatments which fight the effects of this sometimes lethal virus . "
The researchers hope that in the event of a flu pandemic , such as a pandemic of H5N1 avian flu that had mutated to be transmissible between humans , the new treatment would add to the current arsenal of anti-viral medications and vaccines .
One key advantage of this type of therapy is that it would be effective even if the flu virus mutated , because it targets the body 's overreaction to the virus rather than the virus itself .
In addition to the possible applications for treating influenza , the researchers also hope their findings could lead to new treatments for other conditions where excessive immunity can be a problem , including other infectious diseases , autoimmune diseases and allergy .
The research was funded by the Medical Research Council , the US National Institutes of Health , the Wellcome Trust , and the European Union .
Take out Eli and Denise , add a 13 year old me and this is a basically a true story .
I had to recover deeply repressed memories to bring you this comic ( the first in a week of Halloween themed HE’s ) .
If you are unfamiliar with the concept of a HELL HOUSE , it is essentially a haunted house put on by a fundamentalist Christian church with the intent of giving children night terrors and guilt for things they have n’t even thought of doing yet all for the glory of Christ .
When you ’re 13 and someone says , “ Hey , instead of boring old youth group , we ’re going to a haunted house / hay ride out in the middle of nowhere ! ” you ’re typical response would be “ meh . ”
You ’re 13 , so everything is pretty much , “ meh . ”
But internally you ’re all “ sounds cooler than singing praise songs then talking about how we ’re better than everyone else for an hour . ”
When I said a Hell House is essentially a haunted house … well , it ’s not .
It IS NOT a haunted house !
In a haunted house you pay money to walk through a maze of dark corridors while “ actors ” dressed as ghouls and monsters jump out and scream at you .
Sometimes there ’s a chainsaw .
It ’s fun for every one .
I should know , I worked at one in high school .
It was pretty much awesome .
A Hell House , on the other hand is a place where you pay money to walk through a barn that has been outfitted to look like a house and in each room “ actors ” act out short vignettes depicting different ways one might damn oneself to Hell .
It is seriously a living instruction manual on “ How to Win Friends and Get Into Hell . ”
Oh , also it ’s fucking terrifying when you ’re a kid .
Also it ’s ONLY for kids .
I ’ll reconstruct the scenerio as best as my fragile mind can :
We entered the Hell House has a group and were greeted by our demon guide .
Let me preface the rest by saying this particular church had purchased basically EVERY rubber demon mask from Spencer ’s gifts .
The demon guide took us through various scenes , including : a motorcycle wreck caused by awesome teenage drunk driving , a Satanic sacrifice caused by awesome teenage Satan worship ( this is happening in our neighborhoods RIGHT NOW !
Why do n’t you care ?! ) , an abortion caused by awesome teenage sex complete with a pan full of blood and fetus parts ( no shit ) , a chick that OD ’d due to awesome teenage drug use ( needle hanging out of her arm ) , and a teen suicide caused by listening to awesome rock and roll ( it WAS “ Welcome to the Jungle ” ) .
After all of these little one act plays were performed for us ( many of the children were convulsing and in tears – PRAISE THE LORD ! ) we were lead into a room full of coffins and told to “ get in . ” ( still not making any of this up ) .
I got into a coffin with a girl that I had a crush on .
Unfortunately I was n’t able to make my move because she was too busy sobbing uncontrollably , and having a claustrophobia induced panic attack .
A voice read our collective eulogy , then the back of the coffins sprang open and we were catapulted into Hell .
I ’m assuming dimensional gateways were involved .
Demons were dancing around a pit of fire as the Prince of Lies himself stood atop an altar shooting laser beams into our eyes ( still still still not making this up – all true ) .
Satan had a giant evil goat mask , red cloak , an ample supply of smog machines and ( seriously ) laser pointers mounted to each finger with which he wrote his initials on our retinas .
Just beyond the eternal torment and despair there was a doorway , beaming with light ( and more smog ) .
Turns out the portal to Heaven is just behind Hell … sort of in the back - left corner .
Afterward we were further indoctrinated counseled by various members of the congregation and encouraged to come back and bring our “ unsaved ” friends .
Because , honestly , if Hell House did n’t scare the shit out of a little kid until he believed whatever the shit you told him to believe , what else could ?
LATER THERE WAS A HAY RIDE !!!
In retrospect , I am deeply disturbed by the amount of fear and guilt that I was purposely saddled with as a “ youth group teen . ”
They seemed to be intentionally molding maladjusted young adults .
I suppose a guilty , fearful and confused kid is easier to brainwash teach .
LATER THERE WAS A HAY RIDE !!!
As Adam Boesel pedals an exercise bike , he sends power to a generator that converts his workout calories into electricity .
Across the room in his small eco-friendly gym are half a dozen energy - efficient treadmills .
On the roof , solar arrays gather more natural energy .
In Boesel ’s new gym , people will not only slim their waistlines , they will also shrink their carbon footprint .
Welcome to people - powered exercise for a small planet .
Boesel says the Green Microgym -- which is to open Friday in the eclectic Alberta Arts district of northeast Portland -- is the first fitness center in the country to use solar power as well as human - powered cycling and cardio machines to generate renewable energy .

“ We are creating a neighborhood gym that is as comfortable and effective as any other , ” he said .
“ At the same time , our members are doing their part to help the Earth . ”
Boesel recently showed off the Human Dynamo prototype , an exercise machine consisting of four spin bikes attached to a small generator .
As he pedaled one of the human - powered bikes , a digital readout showed the amount of watts , a measure of power , that he was producing by pedaling and turning an arm crank that strengthens the upper body , he said .
As many as four riders can propel the prototype system , which can produce 200 watts to 600 watts of energy an hour .
It ’s not only the exercise machines that exude green -- so does the entire gym , which is about 3,000 square feet .
Yoga enthusiasts can practice sun salutations on cork - lined floors .
Cardio fans can jog , run intervals on treadmills or spin on recycled rubber flooring .
The 37 - year - old fitness entrepreneur revels in his belief that he has designed an ideal energy - efficient gym that will appeal to a new generation of young , healthy and environmentally - conscious Portlanders .

Most gyms are energy hogs , with sweeping floor space , high heating costs and hot showers always steaming in the locker rooms .
Boesel does n’t know how much energy the solar arrays and human - powered equipment will produce , but he expects his fitness center to use about half the energy of most gyms its size by providing as much as 40 % of its energy needs .
His goal is to have the gym run solely on the energy it generates .
In years past , when fitness companies looked at human - powered machines , they calculated there was n’t much energy savings , said Mike Taggett , owner of Henry Works in El Paso , which designed the Human Dynamo prototype .
“ Yes , it is n’t a lot of power , but it is better than nothing , and there is gratification in actually doing something during your workout , ” he said .
The gym also features treadmills that use nearly one - third less energy than most of their counterparts because they have energy - efficient , self - regulating , brushless motor drive systems that run more cleanly than traditional motors .
And they ’ll be switched off when not in use .

Although one gym in Hong Kong and another in Australia have prototype systems that harness some human power , Boesel ’s gym is believed to be the first to integrate such equipment and eco-philosophy into its business model .
Green Microgym uses only energy - efficient lighting , ceiling fans and televisions .
It has a mostly paperless membership system .
Its five elliptical machines are non-motorized and do n’t require electricity ; Boesel is working on getting them hooked up to generators .
Gym members will be asked to either turn off or lower lighting systems and fans when not in use .
Boesel said many commercial gyms could save electricity by turning off treadmills when not in use , but most do n’t .
“ I ’ve noticed in the past year or two that more club owners are becoming more interested in going green , ” said Pamela Kufahl , editor of Club Industry ’s Fitness Business Pro magazine , based in Overland Park , Kan .
Advertisement
“ People in general are paying more attention to being more environmentally friendly , ” she said .
“ Club owners and their staffs are aware of this and they know their members are too . ”
The trade magazine in recent months has detailed the efforts of YMCAs , military fitness centers and university recreation centers to go green , as most have focused on installing water - efficient toilets and recycled floor products .
But none have attempted to energy from human exercisers and use it to power a gym , Kufahl said .
So far , about 50 people , eager to sweat it out and still conserve energy , have signed up for membership at Green Microgym .
Most of them live in the neighborhood , which is another green advantage : no parking lot , no energy - consuming showers .
“ It appeals to people who want to walk or bike to the gym and then go home and shower , ” Boesel said .

Maggie Vail , 34 , works within easy walking distance at Kill Rock Stars , an independent record label .
She signed up because she liked the proximity and the green ethos .
“ It ’s the perfect business for Portland , and the timing is perfect , ” she said .
“ It ’s time to be more conscious about everything we do . ”
The new business fits in nicely with Portland ’s young , urban and environmentally mindful culture , said Ethan Seltzer , an urban studies professor at Portland State University .
“ There is tremendous interest in our community in energy conservation , alternative transportation , fitness and healthy eating and lifestyles , ” he said .
“ We have a large and growing population of college - educated , 25 - to 35 - year - olds , and they are here because they care about being green , need affordable places to live and want to create , not just consume , the local culture . ”

Do not try this at home !
From a wing - walking granny to the washing machine Houdini , the world 's craziest stunts
There are plenty of crazy ways to risk your life - driving a motorbike at top speed into a parked van , lying pink - faced while a truck drives over your stomach , and allowing yourself to be trapped and handcuffed in a spinning washing machine - but while most people would n't entertain such foolishness , stuntmen are queueing up to sample them all .
These jaw - dropping pictures were taken by American photo - journalist Jeffrey R. Werner and are featured in his new book , Incredible Stunts .
They are the results of a 30 - year career spent travelling across 60 countries .
' I try to stay out of harm 's way as much as possible , but once in a while things go a bit awry , ' he says .
' Like when a stunt man was rocketed into the air , got the angle wrong and crashed into my head - that was quite a bloody mess . '
A word of warning : do n't , whatever you do , try any of these at home .
Forget bikes , or cars or lorries .
When stuntman Doug Danger dices with death , he goes large - the 160ft wingspan of a passenger jet , to be precise .
And he makes it look easy , reaching the pre-calculated speed of 73 mph before launching himself off a 120ft narrow ramp , straight up and over the parked plane
For escape artist Rick Meisel to get clean away he must negotiate his way out of six pairs of handcuffs and two leg irons , while trying not to drown in a soap - filled , spinning , washing machine .
And he takes his ' art ' very seriously .
He has had himself surgically altered in order to fit better into the machine
Despite the shattering impact - the equivalent of hitting a brick wall at 120 mph - both crash drivers walked away uninjured before a crowd of 55,000 at the Astrodome in Houston , Texas .
They owe their lives to incredibly strong strapping , special crash protectors , and a good dose of luck
Dennis Pinto from North Carolina knew that powering a motorbike at 60 mph into the side of a parked van would send him pleasingly airborne .
But he wanted a bit more excitement than that .
So he popped on a flame - retardant outfit and set himself on fire .
Amazingly , he landed on a pile of cardboard boxes , unhurt
Granny Mary Ella McLivain , 52 , wears just a sun dress instead of protective harnesses as she strides across the wing of a biplane , 1,000 ft in the air above Vancouver .
Why ?
She was a secretary , but was tired of being deskbound
John Richmond claims to have shot his brother Ken more than 100 times : in the chest , face and on top of his head .
Here , he has another pop at him - from 25 ft , aiming not for Ken , but for the watermelon on his head and knowing that a quarter of an inch off target will mean death .
Happily , both live to see another day
A truck alone was n't enough to guarantee Strongman Tom Owen a proper work - out .
So he insisted it was loaded with 20 children , before he allowed it to park on his stomach .
The result ?
A thumbs up for the crowd minutes after , then a trip to hospital with a couple of broken ribs and internal bleeding
As world records go , being dragged along a pavement at 236 mph by a 14,000 - horsepower jet - car for a quarter of a mile is n't one most of us are likely to challenge .
But stuntmen Reno Jaton was delighted with his achievement , despite being a little singed by flames by the end of his ordeal
It 's not the usual school run - flying 109ft , over 15 motorcycles and through a giant fireball before crashing to earth .
But driver Steve Hudis was delighted to break a world record in his yellow bus at this stunt filmed in Las Vegas .
Oh yes , and there were no children on board
GLOBAL CITIZEN AND HEADCOUNT ANNOUNCE ‘JUST VOTE ’ CAMPAIGN
Global Citizen and HeadCount today announced the launch of the Just Vote campaign to engage young Americans to check their status , register and vote in November and elections beyond .

The stump speeches and political advertisements that define our
political season have been focused on a few traditional themes : the
economy , terrorism , and jobs , jobs , jobs .
But there ’s one surprising
issue that keeps cropping up in progressive campaigns this year : A
woman ’s right to choose .
Despite the fact that a majority of people in the United States support Roe v. Wade ,
moderate restrictions on abortion , and access to contraception ,
reproductive choice is n’t usually the centerpiece of progressive
political campaigns .
For one , it excites people on the wrong side —
anti-choice conservatives .
And for many moderate voters , choice is an
important issue but not the dominant one — economic or national
security issues more commonly drive voting patterns .
But this year , Democratic political operatives have been surprised
by the success they ’ve had in deploying pro-choice messages .
Congressional campaigns from New Jersey to Nevada have picked up on the
trend , and outside groups spreading the word are not just usual
suspects like NARAL and Planned Parenthood , but also the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) .
" We did n’t use it as much in 2006 .
Voters then were really focused
on Iraq and the economy , " says Celinda Lake , a Democratic pollster who
is working on several House and Senate races this year .
" I was
surprised , honestly .
You think the economy and nothing else will break
through , but this is breaking through . "

Lake points to a number of factors that are making the issue key
this cycle .
It ’s a presidential year , and the president ’s choice of
Supreme Court justices ( the next president could nominate several ) are
deeply important at a time when court - watchers anticipate several
challenges to Roe .
This message is aimed squarely at moderate
and independent women whose more conservative views on other issues
have often trumped their pro-choice beliefs .
In previous years , it
has n’t seemed possible for one or two judicial appointments to tip the
scale in favor of overturning Roe , but that changed during the Bush years .
Choice is also a clear - cut issue that distinguishes the two
presidential candidates in the minds of low - information voters ,
especially when compared the complexities of tax plans or health care
reform .
Another factor has been that many potential moderate candidates
on the Republican side chose to sit out this cycle due to the poor
political climate for the GOP , leading to the nomination of candidates
with more extreme views .
This was reinforced by McCain ’s running - mate
selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , who believes abortion should be
illegal even in cases of rape or incest .
Some voters , worried about a
possible GOP win on the presidential level , feel the need to support
congressional candidates who will protect choice in Congress .
GOP candidates who are unwilling to support free access to
contraception are especially ripe targets , according to Lake .
" Women
voters react , ‘ I have enough to worry about , I do n’t need to add this
to my plate , I do n’t need to be running around trying to get my
prescriptions filled , ’" Lake says .
" When politicians are interfering
and making their lives more difficult , that really has an edge to it . "
These factors have led congressional campaigns and
independent - expenditure committees in New Jersey , Colorado , Illinois ,
Virginia , Arizona , Connecticut and Washington , among others , to push a
pro-choice message in television and radio ads , and through direct
mail .
And it ’s not just Democratic candidates who are touting their
reproductive - rights credentials .
One example is New Jersey ’s 7th Congressional District , a
traditionally Republican seat where Democratic challenger Linda
Stender , a member of the state Assembly , is in a close race with
Republican State Senator Leonard Lance .
The candidates share more than
an affection for rhyming insults ( " big spender Stender , " " the Leonard
Lance dance " ) ; they both also seek to define themselves as the
pro-choice candidate , and have aired advertisements to that effect .
While Lance says he is pro-choice and has previously voted for Planned
Parenthood funding , he was one of only six senators to vote against a
bill Stender supported in the Assembly that would have required
pharmacists to fill birth control prescriptions for women , regardless
of their personal feelings on the matter .
( Eleven other Republican
state senators voted for it . )
The DCCC has gotten in on the action ,
spending at least $ 2.2 million in the district .
Lance ’s stance on the bill " exposes his whole ‘ I ’m a moderate ’
façade , " says Irene Lin , communications director for the Stender
campaign .
She adds that this is why " Republicans are losing fluid ,
suburban districts . "
Lance ’s attempt to establish his moderate
credentials has undercut his support among more the conservative GOP
base .
" Women ’s health and prevention seem to resonate with voters , " says
Tait Sye , a Planned Parenthood spokesperson , citing Barack Obama’s
advantage in social issues over John McCain , as well as pro-choice
commercials run by Jeff Merkley , the Democratic Senate candidate in
Oregon .
He pointed to another reason that pro-choice messages are
important this cycle : Many voters initially assumed McCain is
pro-choice , and in February a Planned Parenthood poll showed that 38
percent of pro-choice women supporting McCain were likely to switch
their vote when told he opposes Roe v. Wade .
There ’s one other reason that pro-choice ads are springing up around
the country .
This year , the electorate will be much younger than in
recent cycles , both because more young people tend to vote in
presidential elections and Obama has galvanized young voters unlike any
politician in recent memory .
Surveys show that young voters are more
consistently pro-choice than their older counter - parts .
Though it does n’t seem that this burst of emphasis on choice by
congressional candidates will change the framework of the abortion
debate in electoral politics , it does suggest that many voters are n’t
pleased with the way the Bush administration slowly chipped away at
women ’s autonomy .
These candidates , including Obama , appeal to voters
who may be ambivalent about abortion by emphasizing access to
contraception , women ’s health , and social programs to prevent unwanted
pregnancy .
Or they focus on the absolutist stands of conservative
candidates like Keith Fimian in Virginia ’s 11th District , where the
DCCC ran an ad arguing that his no exceptions stance on banning abortion was " too extreme . "
Indeed , for all of the right - wing attempts to make pro-choice voters
seem like extremists the message of many Democratic ( and a few
Republican ) campaigns this season is that it is n’t extreme to let women
control their bodies .
At the final presidential debate , John McCain was
discussing abortion and noted that " [ Senator Barack Obama supports ]
health for the mother .
You know , that ’s been stretched by the
pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything .
That ’s the
extreme pro-abortion position , quote , ‘ health . ’ "
For most Americans ,
health is n’t an extreme position .
As long as conservatives make it out
to be , progressives can claim an advantage on the issue .
General Motors Corp Headquarters is seen along the Detroit River in Detroit , Michigan September 17 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Rebecca Cook
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - General Motors Corp is suspending matching payments to employee 401K plans as of November 1 and continues to assess its staffing needs as part of efforts to conserve cash amid a deep downturn in sales , the automaker said on Thursday .
GM spokesman Tom Wilkinson said the company could reinstate matching payments into the 401K program if business conditions improve .
The No. 1 U.S. automaker , which has lost $ 51 billion over the past three years , said in July that it would raise $ 15 billion in liquidity through 2009 through a series of steps , including a 15 percent reduction of salaried workers in North America .
GM said it did not have a final tally for its salaried workers who have taken early retirement and buyout packages .
It declined to comment on whether it would need involuntary layoffs to meet the target for workforce reductions .
GM ’s U.S. sales through September were down 18 percent from a year earlier , hit by tightening credit , a slowing economy and a housing market slump , and its ability to ride down the downturn has come under increasing scrutiny .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A procedure to restore Vice President Dick Cheney 's heart to a normal rhythm went " smoothly and without complication , " his spokeswoman said Wednesday .
Earlier , Megan Mitchell said doctors called to Cheney 's White House office Wednesday morning found he was experiencing a recurrence of atrial fibrillation , an abnormal rhythm involving the upper chambers of the heart .
Doctors at George Washington University Hospital delivered an electrical impulse to restore Cheney 's heart to a normal rhythm , Mitchell said in a statement released late in the day .
After the procedure , Cheney returned home , Mitchell said .
He had spent the morning at the White House , although he did not attend the morning Cabinet meeting .
Mitchell said she was unsure what prompted the morning call to physicians .
Cheney also canceled a Wednesday campaign event in Homer Glen , Illinois , for Marty Ozinga , a Republican nominee for a U.S. congressional seat .
The vice president instead called and expressed his support for Ozinga , Mitchell said .
Prior to the procedure , Cheney updated President Bush on his health condition , White House Deputy Press Secretary Tony Fratto told reporters .
Fratto said Bush wished the vice president well .
Cheney previously experienced atrial fibrillation last November .
George Washington University Hospital doctors also used an electrical impulse then to restore his normal heart rhythm .
Cheney has had four heart attacks dating back to 1978 , when he was 37 .
He suffered his second in 1984 and a third in 1988 before undergoing quadruple bypass surgery to unblock his arteries .
His fourth heart attack occurred in November 2000 , after he was elected vice president .
At that time , doctors inserted a stent to open an artery .
In 2001 , the vice president had a cardiac defibrillator implanted to regulate his heartbeat .
In July , after his annual checkup , doctors said his cardiac status remained stable .
All About Dick Cheney
Virtually certain now of McCain 's imminent defeat Chris Shays effectively tosses McCain under the bus .
In an interview with the Yale Daily News :
NEW CANAAN , Conn . -
The first ballot has yet to be tallied , but some Republicans are already hammering nails into the McCain - Palin campaign 's coffin .
Locked in a tight congressional race , Rep. Chris Shays of Connecticut 's 4th district is the latest in a slew of Republican incumbents , including Sen. Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina , to concede a near - certain victory to the Obama camp .
" I just do n't see how [ McCain ] can win , " Shays said in an interview here on Sunday .
Shays , the Connecticut co-chair of McCain 's campaign , said he was disappointed by the standards of McCain 's race , which has increasingly relied on mudslinging .
" He has lost his brand as a maverick ; he did not live up to his pledge to fight a clean campaign , " Shays said .
And for AP :
" He 's taken the thing that is most valuable , his ( maverick ) brand , and he 's not staying true to it , " Shays said .
" I admire John McCain more than you can imagine .
He would make a great president . "
But , Shays added , " I do n't see how he wins if he is n't true to who he is ... a straight shooter talking about the issues . "
I suppose this would be surprising coming from the co-chair McCain 's Connecticut campaign if it were anyone else but Chris Shays .
But right now survival is the name of the game and it's every man for himself .
Connecticut Republicans tried to put on a brave face , at least in public .
Connecticut Republican Party chairman Chris Healy said he did n't think Shays ' comments were damaging to McCain 's campaign .
" Chris Shays is a loyal Republican , a great asset to the party , " Healy said .
" Chris Shays always speaks his mind , and that 's why people like him .
I think part of it is frustration with our message not getting out .
" But like a lot of things about Chris Shays , " Healy added , " he says things that give people something to reflect . "
Behind the scenes things were clearly different .
So it looks like a McCain supporter put the internet classes he was learned in prison to good use and decided to send out a racist email to the world , basically saying that Obama is nothin ’ but a fried chicken , watermelon eating , porch monkey of a person , like they used to have down in the South afterthe republicans , who from what I understand , were an anti-slavery party , helped abolish slavery , because before that they were treated like fucking animals .
The real joke in all of this is that Obama is half white , living the white dream , meaning he ’s got the same genes as the redneck fucks who hate him for being black , when really they hate him for being better at being white than them , you know he ’s gone to white schools , has white friends , and is pretty much just a dark skinned white dude and the only thing black about him is his cock , at least that ’s what I ’ve been told .
I assume he makes good money , lives in a good neighborhood , has a nice enough car , does normal people things like taking his kids to soccer and walking his dog or whatever the fuck else suburban white folk do , while whoever made this is probably shoveling shit in the barn , half broke , shocked he figured out how to spell the subject line of the email , drunk and beating his wife as he builds a fire in the corner of the shack he sleeps in to keep warm , with the only hope he has in life is the fact that he ’s white and from what the lessons the last 10 generations of his poor white trash fave have told him , God values that a lot more once you die in a farm related accident or accidentally catching fire at your cross burning meetings , than he values the blacks … .
Sure I make racist jokes , because it is funny to offend and stir people up , but that does n’t mean I think racism is n’t pretty fucking dated and unnecessary .
Eventually we ’ll all be a shade of beige and I think that because someone is black , white , asian or mexican , they should have equal rights to be heard , especially if they have hot tits .
I mean if we based everything on appearances , you ’d never get laid ….oh right …. you never get laid .
Bad analogy .
But you get what I am saying .
That said , I am not offended by this , I just think it ’s a pretty weak attempt to attack someone , or make fun of someone , it ’s just way too fucking obvious of a joke and that ’s why you ’ll probably find this funny , because I seem to attract the real winners in life .
I am not an Obama or McCain supporter , so I do n’t want emails to me calling me “ nigger lover ” or whatever the fuck else I ’ve been getting emailed to me the last 2 months from you hicks , I am just posting it , because I find it ridiculous .
I am not posting it because I want to out McCain fans for being uneducated scum , or because I support the shit they are doing , I am just doing it because I am doing it .
And in case you need to be reminded that Obama is white , watch this video of him dancing on Ellen …
On a side note , here ’s a weird video of Terrry Tate tackling Sarah Palin that I do n’t understand …
Enough with this political shit , time for tits .
Update : I hear the person behind the email blast was Heidi and Spencer and here are some pictures of the fake couple in some staged pictures , showing their fake support for McCain – Palin , because they know that if they actually wanted McCain – Palin to win , they ’d keep their mouths shut , since the world hates them .
If “ Guns , God and Glory ” is really the McCain – Palin slogan , you are all in a lot of trouble if they win .
I
have a feeling it ’s just Spencer and Heidi being ironic or sarcastic or Facetious or whatever the fuck this is .
So here are Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt trying to be funny , with beer and a rifle and a book about profiting during the economic crisis , considering they have both profited way too much already , and lets just hope that this date that ends in murder suicide , not because we do n’t agree with their politics , but because we do n’t agree with their existance …

That basically sums up my life right now , except for the exciting " spy " part .
Naturally , as a professional peacemaker , I have no inclination to aid and abet , never mind incite , acts of violence against anyone , least of all the US Government or my fellow citizens .
This should go without saying .
But also notice that there is just not a lot of time in there for me to even go to the grocery store or get the laundry done , never MIND make mischief that could rise to the level of International Intrigue .
Little did you know ... I am The Subversive Single Mom .
Once in a blue moon , I do manage to make time for myself , to do something fun -- something just for me .
And it was that sort of evening I had in mind a couple of weeks ago when I went to Montpelier , VT , after work hours to attend a meeting for Displaced Southerners that was being held at the Kellogg - Hubbard Library .
I am originally from Atlanta , so I thought it would be a hoot to attend .
As I was getting out of my car there in the library parking lot , my cell phone began to ring .
I answered .
" Hello ? " " Hello .
Yes , is this Patricia McIntosh ? " " Yes . "
" Patricia , this is Chris Destito .
Is this a good time to talk ? "
" Well...ummm... sort of .
Who are you ?
And why are you calling ? "
I was wracking my brain , wondering if I should know this person 's name somehow -- was it one of the software vendors we 've been working with lately ?
I could n't place it .
" I'm with the FBI , and we were wondering if we could talk with you . "
" With ME ? ( laughing )
No , seriously -- who is this ? "
At this point I was scanning the parking lot for hidden cameras , wondering if I was being punked ...
" This is Chris Destito with the FBI , and I realize this is probably the weirdest phone call you 've ever gotten ... "
" You could say that .
But -- okay , let 's say you really are with the FBI .
I would need to see ID , of course , but let 's say you are .
Why are you calling me ?
I mean , did I do something wrong that I 'm not aware of ? "
I was a little smart - mouthed to that TSA agent when I went through customs on my way back from Jamaica in February ...
Is that what this is about ?
I was wracking my brain at this point , but coming up with nothing .
" No , ma'am .
This is not about anything you 've done .
We just think you might have information about someone else that could be useful to us .
It 's really probably totally inconsequential , but we would like to speak with you , today if possible .
We 're in White River Junction right now .
We could meet you at your home if you 'd like . "
That threw up red flags for me all over the place .
They 're in White River ??
So these people know exactly where I live already -- and they want to come into my home ?
Uh uh .
No .
" I 'm sorry -- I 'm not comfortable with that .
How about you meet me at my office instead ? "
( Office .
Daylight .
Lots of people around .
Much safer . )
" Sure ! " he said , " We can be there in an hour . "
" Oh , gosh -- I meant tomorrow -- like for coffee ?
Or lunch ?
Does it have to be tonight ?
I was about to go into a meeting . "
Because by gum not even the F - B - damn - I was going to stop me from enjoying the company of my Southern Sistren ...
" Well , yes ma'am , if you would n't mind . " ( sigh ) " I 'll be out of my meeting around 8:00 .
Can you meet me here in Montpelier ? "
" Certainly .
We 'd just really like to discuss this with you as soon as possible . "
At this point it was after 6:00 in the evening and my Displaced Southerners meeting was about to begin soon .
I really had to go , and so excused myself from further discussion , agreeing to meet these fellows in the foyer of the library at the appointed time .
The gathering at the library was lovely and genteel -- a comical mix of ladies who , by appearances could have passed for Vermonters any day , but whose origins were betrayed ( like mine ) the minute they opened their mouths .
We sipped sweet tea and nibbled pecan pie and talked about how we miss properly prepared grits and red - eye gravy , but I digress .
Once my meeting was beginning to wrap up , I put in a quick call to my parents to tell them about this strange phone call I 'd received .
My stepfather is a former CIA officer , and his response to this news , as relayed through my mother , was nothing short of unbridled panic :
" DO NOT GET INTO A CAR WITH THEM .
DO NOT LET THEM GET YOU ALONE .
STAY IN PLAIN SIGHT OF OTHER PEOPLE . "
I was mildly nervous before , but my stepfather 's reaction gave me pause .
My mother insisted on calling me back in five minutes to make sure I was okay .
My stepfather was ready to put in a call to the Emergency line at Langley .
So there the FBI agents were , waiting for me in the entrance to the library as I emerged from my meeting .
Per my original request , Agent Destito provided ID and – yes indeed – these guys were the real deal .
100 % genuine FBI .
Though I still would not have voluntarily gone anywhere with them , we shook hands politely and Chris did his best to reassure me I had nothing to fear , which I appreciated .
At this point my cell phone rang again .
It was my mother , bless her heart .
" Are you okay ?
Is everything okay ? "
" Yes Mom , it 's fine -- I do n't know yet why they want to talk with me , but it 's okay .
I think they 're harmless . "
It did n't make sense to tell her that it was also abundantly clear to me that these guys , if they had to , could take down anyone -- or maybe everyone -- in the library should a fight break out .
I doubt they 'd even need the guns I 'm sure they were carrying ... somewhere .
Agent Destito 's demeanor was that of a practiced relaxed stance , but I could tell there was a tightly coiled spring inside .
" Okay , well if I do n't hear back from you in 30 minutes I 'll be calling back .
And you let them know that if you do n't answer , steps will be taken ... " ( chuckling ) " Okay Mommy - and thank you for worrying about me .
I think it will be okay .
I promise I 'll call you when we 're done talking okay ? "
After some preliminary explanation about the various reasons why the FBI might come a - knockin ' on the door of someone like me -- someone whose life is about as exciting as memorizing the begats in Genesis from Adam all the way down to Abraham while Lawrence Welk music plays in the background -- he finally came to the point .
Apparently it had come to their attention that I had received several phone calls from Pakistan , or at least from a phone number that originated in Pakistan , and they wanted to ask me what that was about .
You see , I have a Muslim friend from Pakistan -- Moazzam Ali Khan -- who calls me from Beijing on occasion ( because that is where he is studying Chinese culture and language in his graduate school program ) , and courtesy of those phone calls , from his cell phone to mine , the FBI had apparently flagged me as a " person of interest . "
Once this dawned on me , I literally laughed out loud , which was probably a completely undignified , if not inappropriate , thing to do in front of the FBI and yet ... it was my authentic response once I realized what they were there to question me about .
After all , my connection with Moazzam is SO completely innocent .
Back in 2003 , when I was recruiting supporters for Howard Dean 's presidential campaign , there was a lot of emphasis placed on having a diverse base of supporters .
There were Dykes for Dean , and African Americans for Dean , and Mormons for Dean , and Latinos for Dean , and so yes ... there were also Muslims for Dean , and I had volunteered to inquire among various Muslim student groups online as to whether they were familiar with Gov.
Dean 's policies , and if so , might they be inclined to support him , etc .
It was in one of these groups that I met Moazzam .
Though not a student in the US himself , at the time that I met him , he was completely captivated by US music and culture .
He wanted nothing in this world more than to come here .
So in the meantime he emailed me saying he figured having an email buddy in the US might be the next best thing to being there .
He was in Islamabad at the time , working on his MBA .
And folks , this guy is the sweetest , most nonviolent , kindhearted fellow , and over the years we have become good friends .
We never EVER talked politics -- his country 's or mine -- because it just did not seem either relevant or wise to do so , and we had a myriad other interesting things to discuss .
So I talked with these gents from the FBI at some length and told them the story of how Moazzam and I came to be friends , and what a sweet person he is , and how innocent it all is , and how there ’s no " there " there for them to find but I would be happy to talk with them further if it would help , etc .
And they said , no , this would be a matter of " nothing to see here - case closed . "
And I hope that remains so .
As you may well imagine , Moazzam was chagrined to learn that I ’d been approached by the FBI courtesy of his phone calls .
We ’d actually joked , in the past , about the government listening in on occasion .
After all , Pakistan 's government was notoriously intrusive under Musharraf , and the PATRIOT
Act has been in effect here for several years now .
Courtesy of that Act , our right to privacy has pretty much gone out the window , at least as far as the US government is concerned .
And needless to say , as a citizen of Pakistan , he has , in the last 6 years , developed an increasing disdain for imperialist - style US foreign policy .
We do n't need to go to Pakistan to find that sort of disdain though .
There are plenty of us right here who feel the same , but that does n't mean we 're gonna go all Timothy McVeigh on the nearest piece of Federal - Gummint - owned real estate .
I do want to add , Chris and his ( mostly silent ) partner were supremely nice guys – very friendly and decent and clearly just trying to do their job – but dammit it still sticks in my CRAW that I ca n’t talk to a friend from Pakistan without the FBI stalking me and then finally calling my cell phone to set up a time to grill me about it .
You see , it turns out that they 'd staked out my house for days , but I was never home during the hours they were looking for me , so the phone call was an act of desperation .
Pressing the boundaries of cheekiness , I told them that my mole in their organization had kept me well - informed of their comings and goings and I had thus been able to elude their grasp thus far but now , doggone it , he took a day off and they 'd finally caught up with me .
They laughed , though I could tell there was that little part of them that was wondering , " Wait ... was she serious about that ? "
Right .
I am The Subversive Single Mom .
Yes , I know it 's bizarre .
But what can I say ?
I guess everyone is a suspect these days .
Dr. Arnold Heller , if you 're out there somewhere , I hope you read this and feel proud -- like yours , my name is now apparently on file with the FBI .
As you warned us in AP History class , it does n't take much to qualify .
Apparently you do n't even have to be photographed at an anti-war rally with a " Down with the USA " sign in your hand anymore .
You just have to have a friend from an " unfriendly " nation who calls you once in a while .
And seriously , it ’s only a coincidence that Bush is risking a war one week away from the election with McCain down in the polls .
Pathetic .
What ’s left in his bag of tricks – National Guard gonna call off the elections due to rain ?

When we think of the word “ judicial ” what comes to mind is truth .
My preconceived thoughts come from the Latin meaning jus right , law and dicere to determine .
Hence , my conclusion at first glance - an organization seeking the truth - without political bias , with a dedication to the constitution .
Judicial Confirmation Network has an agenda , which they tout is integrity , common sense , education and experience in the law and lastly , a devotion to the Constitution .
All those wonderful words that make us seek the truth , not just with our minds but with our hearts .
Their “ About Us ” section makes you believe that those virtues of which they speak , is their goal .
That is when reality of what they really stand for becomes clear , not only with the video that is on their website http://judicialnetwork.com/, but the fact that they are using it as a campaign ad against Barack Obama .
If you are a legitimate group trying to send a strong and powerful message the last possible method you use is an attack ad .
That not only takes away from the message but uncovers the ugly underbelly of what you truly stand for .
Those powerful words like integrity and zeal for the constitution become tarnished with their twisted ideology of lies which they perpetuate in TV ads in Michigan and Ohio currently - but is being launched nationally .
To give you a little background on their true agenda and what they have been endorsing over the years - will give you an insight into their deeply entrenched right - wing philosophies .
Back in July 2005 , Bush taps conservative Appeals Court Judge John Roberts for the Supreme Court .
Gary Marx , the Executive Director of the Judicial Confirmation Network fully endorsed this Bush nomination .
Marx has also worked as a coalition organizer for the Bush - Cheney 2004 national campaign and served as Development Director and lobbyist for The Family Foundation of Virginia .
Here is what Gary Marx had to say at the time to Democracy Now about the John Roberts nomination .
You know , they support the President and they support his nominee , especially a place like Indiana where this nominee hails from .
Senator Biden is going to have a difficult decision to make and Senator Kent Conrad in North Dakota is up for re-election in 2006 .
We have a mainstream nominee who is one of the most qualified you ’ll ever find , argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court , tremendous experience , tremendous personal integrity and humbleness , and I think it ’s going to be very difficult for a lot of democrat senators in the middle like Mary Landrieu to somehow oppose this nominee and at minimum at least give him a fair up or down vote and not allow a filibuster to go forward on this nomination .
The biggest problem I had with this choice was , as deputy solicitor general for the first Bush administration in 1990 , he argued in favor of a government regulation banning abortion - related counseling in federally financed family planning programs .
He also helped write a brief then that restated the administration ’s opposition to Roe v. Wade , the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established the constitutional right to abortion , contending , “ We continue to believe that Roe was wrongly decided and should be overruled . ”
Also , replacing Justice O’Connor with Roberts - puts Roe v.
Wade in jeopardy in the future - that is not an issue most Americans are willing to compromise on .
In July 2006 , many right - wing groups formed a coalition to deliver a letter to the Senate GOP leaders for action on Judge Terrence Boyle .
These organizational leaders got together to support George Bush ’s circuit court nominee pending before the full Senate .
Phyllis Schlafly from the Eagle Forum , Gary Marx from JCN , and Tom Shields from the Coalition for Marriage and Family to name a few that rallied together to send this letter .
We see once again that Gary Marx is supporting another George Bush decision and the other name that jumped out at me was Phyllis Schafly .
Are we seeing a political bias here ?
I would say it is a neon beacon .
A noteworthy part of their letter stated that Democrat Judiciary Committee Chairman Joe Biden ; never granted a hearing when Judge Boyle was first nominated by President George H.W. Bush .
It is another judicious decision by Senator Biden that deserves praise .
The Judicial Confirmation Network is a right wing group that is launching a full scale attack on Barack Obama .
The first phase with a vested interest of $ 1 million dollars , includes television ads in national and targeted markets .
Under the guise - of raising awareness and recruiting activists for their cause on the issue of the U.S. Supreme Court - to promote their campaign of lies to further the Republican policies .
They have been exposed as just another Bush lackey .

Misinformation campaign tells VA Dems to vote on wrong day Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday October 28 , 2008

This A forged flyer going to voters in a closely fought Virginia congressional district seems aimed at suppressing Democratic turnout on Election Day .
Purporting to come from Virginia 's Board of Elections , the flyer says " All Democratic party supporters and independent voters supporting Democratic candidates shall vote on November 5th . "
That 's one day after Election Day .
Whoever is circulating the flyer seems concerned with electing Republicans .
The phony information tells " Republican party supporters and independent voters supporting Republican candidates " to vote on Nov. 4 , the real day of the election .
The flyer 's circulation was first reported in the Virginian - Pilot .
The somewhat official - looking flier - it features the state board logo and the state seal - is dated Oct. 24 and indicates that " an emergency session of the General Assembly has adopted the follwing ( sic ) emergency regulations to ease the load on local electorial ( sic ) precincts and ensure a fair electorial process . "
The four - paragraph flier concludes with : " We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause but felt this was the only way to ensure fairness to the complete electorial process . "
The flyer was circulated around several locations in Hampton Roads , according to the paper .
Hampton Roads , in southeast Virginia near Virginia Beach , sits in the commonwealth 's 2nd Congressional District , where Democrats are in a hard - fought race to unseat incumbent Republican Rep.
Thelma Drake , who won re-election two years ago by a margin of just 5,000 votes .
The latest poll in the district shows Drake leading by just 5 percent .
It is unclear who is circulating the flyer , but state police are investigating .
Hampton County Virginia also was strongly supportive of Barack Obama 's candidacy during this year 's primary .
Obama took nearly 80 percent of the vote from the county 's Democrats ; the county 's Republicans split their votes between John McCain and Mike Huckabee .
Polls have showed Obama is pulling away in Virginia in recent weeks , and many analysts say it is becoming more likely he will prevail in the state .
DAMASCUS ( Reuters ) - The United States said on Wednesday it will close its embassy in Damascus to the public on Thursday due to security concerns amid rising tensions between the two countries following a U.S. raid on Syria .
A demonstration is planned in the Syrian capital on Thursday to protest against the raid which Damascus said killed eight civilians .
Syria had earlier ordered an American school and cultural center to be shut down in an apparent response to the U.S. action on Sunday .
Relations between Washington and Damascus are already strained by U.S. accusations that Syria is failing to stop militants , including al Qaeda fighters , from entering Iraq .
The U.S. embassy in Damascus said in a statement it will be closed on Thursday due to “ increased security risk . ”
An embassy spokesman earlier said that Americans in Syria must be aware that “ unforeseen events or circumstances may occur that could cause the U.S. Embassy in Damascus to close to the public for an unspecified period of time . ”
“ The U.S. Embassy in Damascus remains concerned about the continued threat of terrorist attacks , demonstrations and other violent actions against U.S. citizens , ” he said .
The spokesman declined to comment on whether the number or status of U.S. diplomats in Syria could change .
The demonstration planned for Thursday is to be staged by groups describing themselves as independent .
A U.S. official has said that a smuggler of foreign fighters into Iraq was believed to have been killed in the attack .
Diplomats said the crisis could escalate into tit - for - tat retaliation if the protest turns violent .
But a source familiar with the planning for the event said it will be held away from the embassy .
“ There are no plans to march on the embassy .
An American flag may be set alight but the protest will be peaceful , ” the source said .
WAITING GAME
Responding to Sunday ’s raid , Syria decided to close an American school with 450 students and an American cultural center in Damascus .
Hundreds of U.S. nationals live in Syria .
Thousands more have dual U.S. - Syrian nationality .

The official news agency SANA said Damascus informed Washington on Wednesday of its decision to close the two facilities .
Syria also has called on the U.N. Security Council to take action to prevent a repeat of the attack in which military helicopters flew over the border and struck a farm just inside Syrian territory .
The Syrian Foreign Ministry called in foreign ambassadors for a meeting on Wednesday to explain the measures Damascus has taken against the United States , SANA said .
Deputy Foreign Minister Fayssal al - Mekdad said Syria was waiting for an official explanation from Washington and Baghdad about “ the unacceptable violation of Syrian sovereignty ” before taking any more measures .
Washington recalled its ambassador to Syria following the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al - Hariri in February 2005 .
The United States also has Syria on a list of states that support terrorism and Damascus has been under U.S. sanctions since 2004 over its support for militant groups .
Thousands of protesters attacked the U.S. embassy in Damascus in 1998 during a demonstration against U.S. - led military strikes on Iraq .
Throughout human history , relatively few men seem to have had a greater input into the gene pool than the rest , suggests a study of variations in DNA .
Tens of thousands of years of polygamy has left a mark on our genomes that is a signature that small numbers of males must have mated with lots of females .
Over time , such a pattern will spawn more genetic differences on the X chromosome than other chromosomes .
This is because women have two copies of the X , while men only one .
In other words , the diversity arises because some men do n’t get to pass on their genes , while most women do .
“ Humans are considered to be mildly polygynous and we descend from primates that are polygynous , ” says Michael Hammer , a population geneticist at the University of Arizona in Tucson .

Polygyny refers to the practice of males mating with multiple females , and its most common form in humans is polygamy or multiple marriages .
To find our hidden genetic history , Hammer and his colleagues sequenced DNA from 90 people belonging to six groups : Melanesians , Basques , Han Chinese , as well as three African cultures : Mandenka , Biaka and San .
Long tradition
Hammer ’s team discovered more genetic differences in the X chromosome than would be expected if equal numbers of males and females tended to mate , over human history .
The only explanation for this pattern is widespread , long - lasting polygyny , he says .
His team ’s analysis reflects all of human history , and modern monogamy has not even left a blip in our genomes .
“ I do n’t know how long monogamy has been with us , ” Hammer says .
“ It seems it has n’t been around long , evolutionarily . ”
Besides , “ most societies practice some form of polygamy ” , he says .
Even if most Western men do n’t take multiple wives , men tend to father children with more females than females do with males , a practice called “ effective polygamy ” .
“ It ’s not unexpected , ” says Dmitri Petrov , an evolutionary geneticist at Stanford University in California .
“ Polygany is something you would expect to find . ”
Petrov and his colleagues uncovered the same genetic pattern in fruit flies .

Is that a pig flying ?
Do I see my cats cuddling up with the yappy dog next door ?
Why is n’t this mandatory across the board as banks need governments to keep them afloat ?
The top executives of Deutsche Bank , Germany ’s largest bank , will forego bonus payments for 2008 , the first complete management board of a bank to do so in reaction to the global financial crisis .
Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Josef Ackermann decided to waive the extra payments for 2008 , and the rest of the executive board will follow suit , a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said on Thursday .
The spokesman confirmed comments that Ackermann made in an interview with German paper Bild am Sonntag .
The money will be used to prop up wages of other bank employees whose salaries are hit harder by the effects of the finance crisis , Ackermann said in an interview in the Sunday edition of the paper that was released early .
Even though the 2008 payments for the four - member board have not yet been set , they would have been worth “ millions of euros , ” for Ackermann alone , despite the financial crisis , the chief told the paper .
In 2007 , the management board received 28.9 million euros ( $ 38.94 million ) in bonus payments , compared with fixed payments of 4.3 million euros in the period .
Paul Trujillo decided it was time to do something positive and inspiring .
The 16 - year - old graffiti artist ’s moniker , ERA , was scrawled on retaining walls and in alleyways throughout Denver .
But after the Democratic National Convention came here in late August , Paul decided to try something new :
He and two friends spray - painted a 26 - foot - long mural of Barack Obama along the rear fence of his grandparents ’ house .
Now the city is ordering him to get rid of it .
Paul ’s artwork includes the word “ Vote , ” which Denver officials ruled makes it an illegal election sign .
The city gave him until Friday to come up with a new design .

“ We took our time to do that , ” Paul said this week as he stood in his grandparents ’ kitchen , “ and for someone to just come by and say you ca n’t have that . . . "
He trailed off dejectedly .
Denver permits political signs that are 8 square feet or less to be displayed on private property .
“ It just does n’t meet the code as it is , ” said Kerry Buckey , an assistant city attorney .
The problem , Buckey said , is that the artwork is clearly political .
He cited the two words that flank a black - and - white image of the Democratic presidential nominee on the mural .
“ It ’s pretty clearly promotional when you say ‘ Vote Obama . ’ ”
Paul ’s grandparents , Henry and Esther Vigil , describe themselves as “ hard - core Democrats ” and say they are proud of their grandson .
Their bungalow in a blue - collar Denver neighborhood is crammed with artwork produced by generations of their family , including a son ’s sketch of Jesus , pinatas designed by Esther and the intricate needlepoint samplers of the Vigils ’ parents .

Paul -- who has grown up in the house -- regularly spray - painted the interior door of his bedroom before graduating to the back fence .
He and his friends started displaying their personal logos there to cover up marks left by taggers , but they had never done a project that could be considered politically relevant .
Then early last month , his grandmother suggested he use his talents for something more ambitious .
“ I said , ‘ I do n’t just want words up there , do something artistic , ’ ” Esther Vigil said .
Paul said that he and his fellow graffiti artists were inspired by the red , white and blue Obama posters created by guerrilla artist Shepard Fairey .

The focal point of their mural is a portrait of Obama .
The background evokes the colors of the American flag .
Paul -- slim and quiet , with piercings in his eyebrows and chin -- said the work was driven by political hope .
“ We need a change from everything that ’s going on , ” he said .
“ We need to get out of war .
We need a change from prices all going up . ”
Taggers have left the mural untouched .
People stop by and take pictures .
One visitor was Patricia Calhoun , editor of the alternative weekly Denver Westword , who was writing about how city police had painted over a mural just before the Democratic convention .
She asked officials if Paul ’s work would count as art .
If so , it would qualify for an exemption from Denver ’s ordinance under federal law .
But , Buckey said , the mural does not meet the legal standards .
So once Calhoun asked them about the work , the city was obligated to cite the Vigils .

“ You ca n’t fight City Hall , ” Henry Vigil said .
But Tuesday , Buckey hinted at a possible solution .
He noted that the family could appeal the citation to the city ’s zoning department .
The board responsible , Buckey said , has so many cases in front of it already that any hearing on the mural likely would be delayed until after the election .

Mercedes - Benz have developed a shark - like concept car called the Formula Zero , which looks more at home in the water than on the race track for which it was designed .
The car is a solar - powered green - machine , supposedly inspired by Formula One and Yacht Racing .
What it actually looks like is a cross between a shark , a vehicle and the USS Voyager .
Designed in - house by the Mercedes - Benz Advanced Design Center , the Formula Zero is part of an idea for a futuristic style of motor racing where the emphasis is on energy efficiency .
Teams would start with an equal allocation of energy and it would be down to the skill of the driver and the design of the car to win the race .
Winners would be determined based on both time elapsed and energy used , which seems like a fun challenge , but not something that would be much fun to watch .
Perhaps anticipating this , the designers also envision a race track made of a see - through material so that spectators can watch the action ( read : crashes caused by the lack of traction ) from beneath the road surface .
The car would have electric hub motors on each of its four wheels and a solar skin that would recharge the batteries .
Sounds …quiet .

The first and most important rule of speculation is to cut your losses quickly , while they are still small .
In poker , this means folding when you do n’t have good cards .
In research and development , it means halting investment when the initial results are unpromising .
In stock speculation , it means selling a purchase when it falls by 7 — 8 percent below a well - chosen entry level .
The first loss is the smallest , the saying goes .
The Fed is violating that rule , and it is encouraging banks to violate that rule .
It is doubling down on a bad hand .
It is buying more stock as it falls , instead of selling out .
How is it doing this ?
The Fed is lending more and more of its liquid government securities to client banks .
In return , it is accepting their questionable and risky collateral .
The Fed is making three kinds of bad loans .
First , the Fed is lending to banks that are in bad shape and need the funds badly .
They are simply bad risks .
If the Fed were a profit - maximizing banker , it would not make such loans , throwing good money after bad .
The Fed is simply gambling ( not wisely speculating ) that in time these banks will recover .
The gamble is huge ; the amounts it is lending are a huge portion of its assets .
Second , the Fed is lending to banks that have agreed to take over some other failing financial institution , like JP Morgan Chase taking over Bear Stearns and Bank of America taking over Merrill Lynch .
These buyouts and these loans are hastily arranged affairs .
The buying bank does n’t really know what liabilities it is absorbing , and neither does the Fed .
More often than not , mergers do not work out at all well .
The costs of bringing two organizations together often are far greater than the buyers imagined .
These mergers will end up weakening the stronger bank as it absorbs the corpse of the weaker bank .
No prudent banker would make such large loans on such short notice .
The Fed is not a prudent banker .
Third , the Fed is lending to banks that have themselves agreed ( under Fed pressure ) to make loans to such failing giants as AIG .
The Fed then has an indirect stake in making loans to a very risky enterprise like AIG .
Again , both the lending banks and the Fed weaken themselves by making these loans that are supposed to shore up and save a failing institution .
We have a series of Titanics in these failing financial businesses , and their rescuers are not in much better off condition .
They all employed too much leverage .
They all made unsound investments .
They are all sinking .
Now , the Fed attempts to keep them going and / or prevent their outright bankruptcy by lending out its own high - grade securities .
And the banks it is lending to have problems all their own to boot !
The losses do not disappear by these maneuvers .
Perhaps they are submerged for a time within watered down balance sheets , but they will bob up and surface later .
The Fed is prolonging the credit bust .
It is also weakening itself by making such questionable loans to risky deals upon collateral whose value is probably only a fraction of par .
What is going through the minds of the Fed ’s governors ?
Fed Chairman
Bernanke says of recent steps that they " are intended to mitigate the potential risks and disruptions to markets . "
In other words , the Fed is trying to lessen the price declines in asset markets .
And its preferred method is itself to make loans and have its client banks make loans to failing banks and other financial institutions .
There are a number of cogent reasons why the Fed will fail in this attempt to stem price declines in such markets as stock markets , preferred stock markets , and corporate bond markets .
First off , the Fed is speculating against the market .
If Merrill Lynch stock is worth $ 10 a share and not $ 60 , it is because the cash flows of Merrill that come from its assets can only produce a cash return that justifies a $ 10 price .
The assets are able to produce a cash flow such that , after paying a return to the bondholders , the stock ’s price is only worth $ 10 in view of that net cash flow .
Lending Merrill more money will not create value for the stockholders unless that money can be put to use by buying assets that earn returns in excess of the required return on Merrill ’s capital .
But if Merrill actually possessed such good investment projects , it would be able to borrow money or issue stock and get capital based on the merits of those investments .
The fact that the stock has sold off drastically is because it does not have such projects .
It is a sign that investors do not want to provide Merrill with more capital .
In making its loans , the Fed is basically pitting its judgments of value against the market ’s .
The evidence of such past attempts , such as in currency markets , is one - sided .
Central bankers do not know more about valuation than markets know .
If that is so , then no matter how much the Fed lends to a Merrill or a bank whose stock has declined greatly , the loans cannot shore up the stock price .
They can only keep the patient alive and substitute the Fed ’s ownership for the ownership of investors in the market .
Secondly , the Fed is only one player in the market .
The markets are in the aggregate much larger than any single player , including a large one like the Fed .
There was a time when J.P. Morgan could place a bid under U.S. Steel and stem a stock market decline .
At that time , people knew that Morgan was risking his own capital , and so they interpreted his buying as a positive signal .
But even then , speculators understood that perhaps Mr. Morgan was liquidating other issues under cover of strength in Steel .
The Fed has no such credibility when it makes loans .
The Fed governors are not risking their own money , and they have a backup which is an open checkbook to create high - powered money .
When the Fed steps up to bail out a failing bank , it is taken , not as a sign that the bank is worth more than what the market thinks , but as a sign that the Fed is afraid that prices will fall further ; for that is exactly what Bernanke has himself said .
Indeed , one institutional investor said of the Fed ’s moves : " There is little doubt that the Fed believes systemic risk is coming closer to really landing on shore . "
Each time that the Fed makes a move to shore up the system or keep it " orderly , " it has the opposite effect of what a Morgan could do .
It is interpreted as a sign of the Fed ’s negative expectations .
Each time that the Fed raises the ante , it communicates more and more desperation .
In this latest Lehman episode , the Fed will for the first time in its history accept stocks as collateral .
The Fed in all likelihood has already accepted a good deal of very low - grade mortgage collateral .
From that viewpoint , accepting stock collateral is not a big stretch .
But there is an important difference .
The stock collateral has quoted markets .
Will the Fed now follow the rules and require maintenance margins and issue margin calls if the stocks decline in price ?
In past bear markets , institutions that are pressed often sell stocks to raise liquid capital .
If stocks are held off the market , will this stem their price declines ?
They will not , because the stock prices are determined by the cash returns that the assets can produce .
If the stocks are locked up in the Fed vaults rather than traded , the main effect may be to make markets less liquid .
The day is coming closer when the Fed is out of securities to lend .
At that point , its only tool will be to print money if it wants to bet against the financial markets .
Helicopter Ben will have to gas up and learn how to fly .
But since the Fed ’s paper is not real capital , this will do nothing to augment value in the capital markets .
Value creation induces the creation of credit when lenders believe that a value - creator has or can create assets that have returns that warrant loans , but credit creation itself does not create value .
The Fed can not create value .
Causation runs from sound assets to sound credit .
Causation does not run from credit creation to sound assets .
Judging from price declines that have already occurred , many more bank failures lie ahead .
More large banks and important regional banks will fail .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Fund will quickly be depleted .
The Fed will be helpless to address the problems .
Its moves to date already show how ineffectual it is .
As with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , so with the rising tide of failures to come .
The Congress and the Treasury will be directly involved in their resolution .
This prospect is a fearful one .
There is no telling what schemes legislators will propose and pass in the face of widespread bank and financial institution failures .

A new amended law in Switzerland protects the dignity of vegetation .
A law protecting the dignity of plants ?
Laugh if you will .
I ’m down on my knees in respect and awe .
At last the Western World is realizing the dire importance of taking other species into account .
Recently , the Swiss Parliament asked a panel of philosophers , lawyers , geneticists and theologians to determine the meaning of dignity when it pertains to plants .
Lo and Behold , the team published a treatise on “ the moral consideration of plants for their own sake . ”
The treatise established that vegetation has innate value and that it is morally wrong to partake in activities such as the “ decapitation of wildflowers at the roadside without rational reason . ”
Over a decade ago , an amendment was added to the Swiss constitution in order to defend the dignity of all creatures — including vegetation — against unwanted repercussions of genetic engineering .
The amendment was turned into law and is known as the Gene Technology Act .
However the law itself did n’t say anything specific about plants , until recently , when the law was amended to include them .
[ social_buttons ]
The obvious question at hand : how does this new ruling affect the production of genetically modified organisms ?
Beat Keller is a molecular biologist at the University of Zurich .
Keller recently asked permission of the government to conduct a field trial of a genetically modified wheat bred with a resistance to fungus .
In order to actually gain permission to go ahead with the trial , he needed to hash out the potential threats to the dignity of the wheat .
The majority of the panel agrees that genetically modified plants are ok , “ as long as their independence , i.e. , reproductive ability and adaptive ability , are ensured . ”
In other words , no forced sterility and terminator genes .
And Keller did , in the end , get to plant his GMO grain .
“ Where does it stop ? ” asks Yves Poirier , a molecular biologist at the laboratory of plant biotechnology at the University of Lausanne .
“ Should we now defend the dignity of microbes and viruses ? ”
And even though I think it ’s a great law , where does it stop ?
How humiliated is a boiled potato ?
A peeled carrot ?
Corn turned into a lowly , tortilla chip meant for dipping ?

John McCain has lately taken to sounding like some kind of biblical prophet , railing about how America is paying the price for the sin of greed on Wall Street .
And now his Wall Street backers have had enough .
" In short order , we 're going to put an end to the reckless conduct , corruption and unbridled greed that have caused the crisis on Wall Street , " McCain has taken to saying as part of his stump speech .
At a recent meeting with key business supporters at a New York hotel , McCain got " an earful " about blaming greed and Wall Street for our economic and financial troubles .
" Some of them warned him against getting personal and making Wall Street the scapegoat for the nation 's troubles , " the Wall Street Journal reports .
Of course , while greed on Wall Street is nothing new , it 's a bit of a stretch for anyone on Wall Street to complain about being made the scapegoat for " the nation 's troubles . "
Our troubles might not have started on Wall Street but Wall Street certainly does n't have clean hands .
It 's not exactly like anyone made , say , Lehman Brothers decide to buy a huge Southern California mortgage company .
SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - Rising sea levels as a result of climate change will erode Sydney ’s iconic beaches by 2050 , with some at risk of disappearing , and threaten beachfront homes and commercial properties , a new climate change study said .

Sea levels along Sydney ’s coast are expected to rise by up to 40 cm above 1990 levels by 2050 and by 90 cm by 2100 , with each one centimeter of rise resulting in one meter of erosion on low - lying beaches , said the Sydney climate change impact report .
“ The Sydney region has a heavy density of residential and commercial beachfront developments that may be threatened by either ocean inundation or sea level rise - induced recession , ” said the report by the NSW Department of Climate Change .
“ Rising sea levels may exacerbate flood risk in coastal rivers , ” said the report received on Wednesday .
The report said further study was needed to determine the extent of coastal erosion in particular locations .
But low - lying Sydney beaches such as Collaroy and Narrabeen , which have already been severely eroded by storm seas , and Dee Why and Curl Curl , are most at risk .
Beaches which have a hard promenade , such as Manly , Bondi and Coogee , will shrink as sand is washed away and may need sand deposits in order to survive in further decades .
“ In general we expect a recession of the coastline of a sandy beach of about one meter for every centimeter rise in sea level , ” said Simon Smith , deputy director - general with the department .
“ The coastline will move inward .
What is now currently a vegetated dune may become the beach , ” Smith said on Wednesday .
“ It depends on the beach and the coastal area .
Some coastal areas have a rocky foreshore and 40 cm does not make much difference .
Some beaches are very deep and high so the beachline will retreat , other beaches are very low - lying and they are up against higher landforms behind them , they will become narrower . ”
The Sydney Coastal Councils Group , which represents 15 local authorities and some 1.3 million people , has launched a study of “ beach nourishment , ” which involves building up shorelines and beach dunes with sand to combat future rising sea levels .
Being a coastal city , some of Sydney ’s most important infrastructure is built on its foreshore , and may be affected by rising sea levels .
Sydney international airport is built on the edge of Botany Bay , with a runway jutting out into the bay .
“ Most of the state ’s infrastructure was built with a provision for half a meter of sea level rise , but the individual asset owners are already looking to see if they need to make a change in their asset to prepare for the future , ” said Smith .
Jennifer Brunner 's ruling could help Democrats in a key battleground state .
Ohio secretary of state prevents vote caging
Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner won plaudits from voting rights activists by issuing a directive that they say will protect the ability of millions of registered voters to cast ballots on Election Day .
Since those voters skew urban , young and low - income , Brunner ’s ruling could be good news for Democrats .

Ohio Republicans , though , disagree with the ruling , saying that the voting rolls must be purged of outdated registrations in order to prevent voter fraud .
They even compare her ruling with that of her predecessor — a Republican whose administration of the 2004 election led to partisan charges of voter fraud .
“ It ’s fairly clear that the secretary [ Brunner ] has decided that she is the ultimate arbiter of Ohio law and when she wants to change it she will , ” said William Todd , chairman of the Ohio chapter of the Republican National Lawyers Association and co-chairman of Lawyers for McCain in Ohio .
The voting rights activists worried that a 2006 state law — requiring that a piece of registered mail with election information be sent to every registered voter in the state — could disenfranchise voters .
The practice known as “ vote caging ” occurs when legitimate voters are removed from election rolls because their residency is being questioned .
Instead they would have to vote provisionally .
Kevin DeWine , a Republican in the Ohio State House of Representatives who authored the 2006 law , says it is not an undue burden on people whose mail is returned to show an identification card at the voting booth or to vote provisionally .
“ People think provisional ballots are a bad thing , ” he said .
“ I think they are a safeguard on the integrity of the ballots . ”
Under the law , the state is supposed to keep a list of voters whose mail is returned as undeliverable .
Voting rights activists feared that those voters who are more likely to have their mail returned — young people , minorities and low - income people — will be removed from voter lists by local election officials .
Daniel Tokaji , an election law expert at Ohio State University , says that because certain groups such as low - income and young voters move more frequently , they are more likely to have their mail returned as undeliverable .
“ We can expect that vote caging would have a disproportionate effect on college students and any others who tend to move frequently , ” Tokaji said .
If they do move within the county , they are still allowed to vote without updating their registration , even if they no longer receive mail at their old address .
The law required them to then show a form of identification at the voting booth and cast a provisional ballot if they did not have one .
Voting rights activists , and Brunner , noted that 60 - day notices cannot be forwarded .
Therefore people who are having their mail forwarded , such as a college students who are away for the term , will be put on the list even if they are valid residents .
In response to these concerns , Brunner issued a release last week directing that 60 - day notices sent by boards of election to voters that are returned as undeliverable cannot be used as the sole reason for canceling an Ohio resident ’s voter registration .
Brunner noted that voting rights groups intended to sue over this point if she had not issued the directive and that avoiding such suits would facilitate election administration .
“ Secretary Brunner took an important step today to protect Ohio voters from partisan voter caging , ” said Michael Slater of Project Vote .
But Todd disagreed .
“ Her statement that people should disregard Ohio law is just incredible , ” he said .
“ She has no authority to do that . ”
There are no plans yet for any Republican group or the McCain campaign to challenge her actions in court , even though Republicans say the ruling is helpful to Democrats because the groups most likely to be disenfranchised tend to lean Democratic .
Ohio Republicans also contest the assertion that mail - delivery issues disproportionately affect certain groups .
Todd compared Brunner ’s action with those of her predecessor , Ken Blackwell , a Republican , whose controversial administration of the 2004 election led many Democrats to allege that fraud and disenfranchisement may have cost them the state of Ohio .
“ The perception was created by Blackwell that he put his thumb on the scale for partisan purposes , ” Todd said .
“ That has caused a lot of people to lose confidence in the system .
I agree with critics of Secretary Blackwell and Secretary Brunner that you have to be exquisitely careful to not undertake actions that will have a partisan impact . ”

Cheney Authorized Libby to Disclose Classified Documents
Once upon a time , a former agent of Italian military intelligence named
Rocco Martino , who had had some experience in the African country of Niger , came into possession of some forged , fraudulent documents .
These alleged Iraqi purchases of yellowcake uranium in 1999 .
In fact , the signatures were of Nigerien officials who had been in power a decade earlier , in the late 1980s .
So they were clumsy forgeries .
Martino passed them on to the Italian magazine Panorama , which passed them to the US embassy .
Tantalizingly , President George W. Bush ’s chief political adviser , Karl Rove , has an indirect connection to Italian intelligence .
Rove ’s chief adviser on Iran policy is Neoconservative wildman and notorious warmonger Michael Ledeen ,
who has a longstanding connection to the darker corners of Italian intelligence .
Vice President Richard Bruce Cheney heard of the alleged uranium purchase .
Cheney asked George Tenet to look into the allegation .
The issue went to the Directorate of Operations secret unit on counter - proliferation .
Among the field officers there was Valerie Plame Wilson , who had spent her life fighting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction under cover of a dummy corporation .
Valerie Plame Wilson was married to former US Ambassador Joseph Wilson IV , who had served bravely as acting ambassador in Iraq in 1990 , and when threatened by Saddam he showed up to a press conference wearing a hanging noose instead of a necktie .
President George H. W. Bush highly praised him .
Joe Wilson had not only served in Iraq , he also had been ambassador to the West African countries of Gabon and Sao Tome , and spoke fluent French .
When Plame Wilson ’s superiors brought up the possibility of sending him as a private citizen to look into the plausibility of the report that Saddam had bought Nigerien uranium , she was consulted and agreed ( she was not part of the decision loop ) .
He went , and soon saw that the uranium industry in Niger was actually under the control of French companies and was strictly monitored .
There was no possibility of corrupt Nigerien officials selling it off under the table .
A separate military mission led by Marine General Carlton Fulford , Jr , deputy commander of the United States European Command ( EUCOM ) , went to Niger the same month , February 2002 .
Fulford quickly came to the same conclusion as Wilson , that it was implausible that al - Qaeda or anyone else could secretly buy uranium from Niger .
Wilson came back and was orally debriefed by people who wrote a report for Tenet , expecting that Tenet would pass it on to the high officials of the Bush administration .
Wilson was amazed when the Niger uranium story was put into Bush ’s State of the Union address .
Then Libby
wanted Secretary of State Colin Powell to make allegations about Saddam and al - Qaeda before the United Nations Security Council .
Powell was also pressed by someone to bring up the Niger uranium story .
Powell is said to have exclaimed , “ I ’m not reading this bullshit ! ”
Libby appears to have been a big influence on the speech Powell gave , almost every detail of which was inaccurate , and at which United Nations officials who heard it openly laughed .
After the war , Wilson wrote an opinion piece for the New York Times in which he revealed his mission and again called into question the Bush administration assertion that Iraq had an active nuclear weapons program .
Cheney was extremely upset by Wilson ’s op - ed .
He saw it as an allegation that he had personally sent Wilson and then ignored Wilson ’s report .
Or at least that was the spin .
But Wilson had said no such thing in the article .
He simply said that Cheney had asked Tenet to look into the story , which Cheney probably did .
Cheney was afraid that if the American public became convinced that there had been no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , the war effort would collapse , along with all those billions of no -bid uncompetitive contracts for Halliburton .
Cheney , it has now come out , then authorized Libby to leak the classified 2002 National Intelligence Estimate to the press .
The NIE , which may have been produced under pressure from Cheney himself , had incorrectly suggested that Iraq was only a few years from having a nuclear weapon .
In fact , Iraq did not have an active weapons program at all after the early 1990s when it was dismantled by the UN inspectors .
The pre-war NIE in any case was just old bad intelligence , which was contradicted by David Kay ’s team on the ground in post - war Iraq , which just was n’t finding much .
Libby now began telling reporters that Wilson ’s wife was a CIA operative , itself classified information , since she was an undercover operative .
Karl Rove engaged in the same routine .
Apparently Cheney , Rove and Libby ( and Bush ? ) believed that Wilson ’s credibility would be undermined if the Washington press corps could have it intimated to them that his story was a CIA plant .
Robert Novak used the information given him by the White House staff to out Valerie Plame Wilson as an undercover operative .
Her career was ruined .
All her contacts in the global South were burned , and their lives put in danger .
The CIA ’s careful project combating weapons of mass destruction collapsed .
The same administration that alleges it should be able to listen to our phone calls at will for national security purposes deliberately undermined US security for petty political purposes , making us all much less safe .
The likelihood is that the crimes of Bush , Cheney , Libby and Rove so far revealed are only the tip of the iceberg .
