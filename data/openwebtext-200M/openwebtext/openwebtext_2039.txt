Newsha Tavakolian , a 26 - year - old from Tehran , points to one of her photographs , a woman in a bright green scarf with swollen pink lips , bruised eyes and a thinly plastered nose .
" What do you see ? " she asks me .
I 'm not sure , I say - a woman who has been beaten up , maybe by her husband .
" I met her in a doctor 's surgery , " she says .
" I thought something dreadful had happened to her , but she told me she had had the works done - a nose job , liposuction , the bags under her eyes , even a boob job , all in one go - to make herself more beautiful . "
Through her work , Tavakolian hopes to challenge western preconceptions about Iran , and particularly about Iranian women 's lives .
Far from being a portrait of domestic abuse , her photograph illustrates the national obsession with beauty .
" You often hear the saying , ' Kill me , but make me more beautiful , ' " she says .
As with all her photographs , Tavakolian has worked to bring out the virulent colours of the bruising and the blood , " to show that Iran is a colourful country , even if the outside view is that it's a grey and miserable place " .
She shows me another image of a downcast young woman , enveloped in a white cape like a Carthusian monk , sitting beneath the upturned face of a sultry , long - haired beauty .
The woman looks unhappy and trapped - perhaps she is about to enter an arranged marriage .
Again , I 'm wrong .
" She 's 27 , " Tavakolian says , " she's in love with her fiance , but she 's been in the beauty salon since 5 am , preparing for her big day , and she 's simply bored and exhausted . "
In the privacy of her own home , Tavakolian says , the woman will take off the cape and look more like the beauty on the wall .
" Within our homes , we can be exactly who we want to be .
In Iran , there 's a big divide between the outside and inside worlds . "
Tavakolian has worked for newspapers since she was 16 , and last year won a major international award from the National Geographic Society for " indigenous and underrepresented photographers " .
Along with six women photographers born in Tehran between 1974 and 1981 , her work is currently on show in Berlin .
These women belong to a generation that has little , if any , experience of the time before the Islamic Revolution of 1979 , but who are nevertheless not fully part of the modern world .
The search for identity is central to the work of all of them .
Until a few decades ago , photography in Iran was solely the preserve of men .
But in recent years increasing numbers of women , who first began to emerge as press photographers during the Iran - Iraq war , have been graduating from Tehran 's Art University .
These women are using photography to investigate aspects of Iranian society , rather than simply to document it - something that has been compared by critics in Germany to the Weimar Republic .
In Germany in the 1920s and 30s , many women photographers used the camera as a tool , to help them define their place in a rapidly changing society .
Perhaps the most arresting photographs on show in Berlin are those of 27 - year - old Mehraneh Atashi , who offers a highly unusual insight into a Zourkaneh or " power house " - a sort of spiritual fitness centre for Iranian men in which virility , religion and the powerful symbolism of the Persian hero all come into play .
Atashi's pictures of sweaty , bare - chested men are not what you might expect from a young female Islamic photographer .
Atashi , who graduated from Tehran 's University of Art in 2002 , gained access after months of persuasion .
She was finally given permission to photograph on condition that the men would not be naked .
Atashi decided to put herself in her pictures , placing a mirror between herself and her subjects , so that the image we get is of a chador - clad woman watching the half - naked masculine spectacle .
The contrast is strange and fascinating .
" It was n't me , but the power of my camera to freeze them in time that persuaded them to let me in , " says Atashi .
" I wanted to place myself as both object and subject of the picture , because I wanted this to be more than just documentary .
Their narcissism and desire to show off their sexuality , as well as the competition they feel between each other , made it possible . "
Katajun Amirpur , Islamic expert at the University of Cologne , points out that Iran is still a society " in which girls can be married at the age of nine , where women can be punished for having pre-marital sex , where they cannot become judges or presidents , they are banned from football stadiums , and where the wearing of the chador is obligatory .
" At the same time , a third of the work force is female , two - thirds of students are women , there are female MPs , doctors , mayors , policewomen , taxi drivers .
Karate is the most popular female sport , and 97 % of women can read and write .
The reality is that women are exceptionally self - confident members of Iranian society . "
Despite an active political movement , led by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , which would like to keep Iranian women suppressed , Amirpur argues that they now play too significant a part in Iranian society to be " brought back to the stove " .
The reason has much to do with the Iran - Iraq war of 1980 to 1988 : " The war led to women taking over many of the roles previously held by men , including that of the photographer , " she says .
" Women 's photography in Iran is part proof that you can't put the lid back on the pot - Iranian women are out there . "
Made in Tehran is at the Cicero Gallery for Political Photography , Berlin , until January 19 .

Jon Healey correctly points out that the debate over intellectual - property theft is complex because we are often dealing with “ non-real properties . ”
These properties cost nearly nothing to produce , and an infinite number of people can use the same property at the same time .
And yet , we still want to treat them as if they were “ real ” property .
Significantly , some of these non-real properties have major effects on human welfare .
Take , for example , the formula for “ oral rehydration therapy , ” a mixture of salt , sugar and water .
Although it could potentially be copyrighted , it has saved more lives in the Third World than almost anything else .
The world is lucky that this formula is in the public domain , not copyrighted and subject to use charges that people who need it could n’t afford .
The present system treats these copyrighted works as a funny kind of real property with no carrying costs , taxes or significant fees .
Without carrying costs , copyrights remain in force almost forever - even though , over time , the demand for the copyrighted material can fall to almost nothing .
As the demand decreases , the value may remain , but it becomes effectively unavailable to , as the Constitution puts it , “ promote the progress of science and useful arts . ”
Witness all the copyrighted books , scientific journals , audio works and visual works that are out of print or otherwise unavailable because copyright law prevents the new , low - cost methods of distribution from being utilized .
In the scientific field , this has devastating effects on the advancement of human knowledge - which is just the opposite of the intent of copyright law .
As a member of a scientific journal ’s editorial board - and as a senior citizen - I see reams of manuscripts that just reinvent the wheel .
Because the whole scientific enterprise has become so complex that non-electronic research is effectively impossible , many young scientists do n’t know and can’t find out what has already been done from older , copyrighted , paper - based literature .
This results in a huge waste of resources .
The same can be said for copyrights in creative areas such as music and writing , in which older works with limited distribution could be built upon to “ promote the progress of science and useful arts . ”
A solution to determining which works are in the “ Mickey Mouse ” category of copyrights and which are in the more socially valuable “ oral rehydration therapy ” class of work is not feasible for a government bureaucracy .
However , if all copyrights were taxed at a fixed ( but significant ) amount per year to maintain the copyright ( all registered through the copyright office and searchable ) , there would be a significant carrying cost and most of the copyrighted material would revert to “ public domain ” and become available to “ promote the progress of science and useful arts . ”
As intellectual property and copyrights become an even more significant part of our economy , and as copyright holders ( not necessarily the creators ) make claims of “ stealing ” as though it is real property , it should be taxed .
Relative to copyrights ’ significance in our economy , the amount of revenue from this source should be in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year .
With a proper tax system , publishers like the L.A.
Times or scientific journals may maintain a copyright for only a year or so before letting the content revert to public domain and letting Google and everyone else utilize the material for its small , but socially significant , remaining value .
The human enterprise could continue to build on itself in these creative , sustainable and non-resource - consuming ways , with copyrights only applying to a small subset of this enterprise .
It should also be noted that some of the most valuable and significant intellectual property and creative works ca n’t be copyrighted .
For example , Mickey Mouse is copyrighted , but E=MC2 could not have been .
Which was truly the more significant creative work ?
Dallas Weaver is a scientist and consultant .
In a landmark judgement with far - reaching social implications , Italy 's highest appeals court has ruled it is a criminal offence for Italian men to touch their genitals in public .
The judges of the court of cassation stressed that the ban did not just apply to brazen crotch - scratching , but also to what might be termed superstitious pre-emption .
Anyone who has seen a hearse go past in Italy , or been part of a discussion in which some terrible illness or disaster is mentioned , will know it is traditional for men to ward off bad luck with a quick grab at what are delicately called their " attributi " .
The practice has become increasingly frowned on , but " io mi tocco i … " , which translates as " I touch my … " is still a common phrase , roughly equivalent to " fingers crossed " .
The judges helpfully suggested that those seeking reassurance should wait till they had returned to the privacy of their own homes before letting their hands stray trouser - wards .
The court was ruling on the appeal of an unnamed 42 - year - old workman from Como near Milan .
In May 2006 , he was convicted of indecent behaviour for " ostentatiously touching his genitals through his clothing " .
His lawyer said it was merely a " compulsive , involuntarily movement , probably to adjust his overalls " .
The third penal division of the Rome court was having none of it .
It said that public genital - patting " has to be regarded as an act contrary to public decency , a concept including that nexus of socio-ethical behavioural rules requiring everyone to abstain from conduct potentially offensive to collectively - held feelings of decorum " .
The judges said such actions risked generating " awkwardness , disgust and disapproval in the average man " , unexpectedly perhaps failing to mention the average woman .
The workman was ordered to pay a € 200 fine and € 1000 costs .
The volatile users at social news ranking site Digg.com Thursday launched a new revolt against the site , protesting a new algorithm that would let a more diverse set of users determine which stories reach the top of its rankings .
A group of Digg users organized a temporary boycott of the site because they felt the new algorithm would leave submissions from some Digg " power users " stuck in the queue .
In an open letter to Digg 's executives posted this morning , four of the site 's so - called top users Andy Sorcini , David Cohn , Muhammad Saleem and Reg Saddler said that they planned to stop submitting to Digg .
" The alternatives are plenty - now is the time to venture into new territory , " the letter said .
" Digg is , in part , a game .
It always has been - and that is one of the reasons we love it .
Unfortunately the rules to the game have never been under the community 's full control .
The latest change in the algorithm , along with rumors of secret editors , auto - buries , etc. , have led us to believe it is time to break ties with Digg.com . "
In addition , the group later organized a live podcast where about 125 users discussed the changes and thousands more listened in , according to Saleem .
The latest revolt is the second collective move by Digg users in less than a year .
In May , many of the site 's users staged an " Internet riot " by continuously posting a software key for cracking the encryption technology used to limit the copying of HD - DVD and Blu-ray discs after Digg management had removed it .
The users prompted Digg to relent and allow the key to be posted .
The latest letter cited several grievances against Digg , including a lack of communication and disregard for the community , the unexplained banning of some top users and a lack of transparency by not showing stories that are not Dugg .
" Digg users hunt down the stories online , craft the descriptions and titles , Digg the stories , provide all the comments , " the letter said .
" Despite this dependency , anecdotal evidence suggests that Digg has repeatedly failed to respond to its users and address their concerns . "
In addition , the users criticized Digg 's auto bury list , noting that dozens of sites are on a buried after a certain period of time with no explanation .
" In short - the site has become too powerful a media force and its lack of transparency and faith in the community is reason for concern , " according to the letter .
" The collective ' WE ' built this site from the ground up and while it is sad to leave it , the time has come to move on . "
Saleem noted on his blog that Digg founder Kevin Rose and CEO Jay Adelson joined the podcast and listened to the problems noted .
Rose and Adelson " acknowledged that there were issues and promised to address them as soon as possible , " Saleem wrote .
" It was never our intention to cause harm to Digg ( though every protest naturally gains that element as it intensifies ) and ultimately all we needed was to be assured that our concerns were being listened to and that the community we have helped build was going to address them in a timely fashion , " Saleem wrote .
" Big things are coming ahead for digg , based on what we have learned from our conversation , and with the channels of communication now open , hopefully we will all be a part of the conversation .
In a blog post ( blog.digg.com ) published before the protest , Rose said the changes to the algorithm were aimed at ensuring the most popular content dugg by a diverse , unique group of users reached the home page .
" Our goal is to give each person a fair chance of getting their submission promoted to the home page , " he wrote .
" When the algorithm gets the diversity it needs , it will promote a story from the Upcoming section to the home page .
This way , the system knows a large variety of people will be into the story . "

We were warned that there could be problems with vote counts , because of e-voting vulnerabilities .
The warnings came true .
And now , we face a disastrous set of e-vote rigging risks on Super Tuesday .
Before the New Hampshire primaries we were warned . :

THE CAT THAT CONTROLS NEW HAMPSHIRE ELECTION PROGRAMMING
Oh , no , the mainstream / corpsestream media did n’t say a word .
The Democratic party did n’t mention it .
They ’re afraid to dampen voter turnout .
But we sure covered it .
Thers were headlined stories .
We expected vote count problems .
And lo and behold , when the word came in that there were huge discrepancies between electronic and paper ballot records , we were not surprised .
And the corpsestream media failed to cover the story .
Sure , they asked questions , “ Why did the pollsters fail ? ”
They even convened special discussions , unfortunately , using the regular pundits .
And of course , nothing was mentioned of the data that explained WHY THE POLLS FAILED .
It did n’t ’ take long for the reports to come in and for our writers to report on them .
As soon as the first one came in , I decided to jump on this — that it was a major , important story that I knew the mainstream media would pass on , even though , just this past weekend , the NY Times did a major article on it in its magazine .
I contacted our voting integrity editor , Joan Brunwasser and asked her to put out the word to our team of voting integrity writers and activists .
We put a 12 noon Thursday deadline on the articles .
OpEdNews is generally a volunteer site .
Writers submit articles they ’ve written .
They do n’t do articles on assignment and they do n’t do them with deadlines .
So this was something new .
We put the deadline on it because the freshness of the New Hampshire story would quickly be lost in the news cycle .
The word went out and the stories started to come in .
Here they are :
The Surprising Democratic Primary Results in New Hampshire By Pokey Anderson

There 's a pamphlet scudding around my kitchen ; it has accumulated coffee rings and fingerprints , but I keep rescuing it from the recycling bin with the good intention of signing up to a green tariff on electricity again .
( I can't quite understand why the deal I signed up to years ago ever ended . )
A good intention that has a 50 - 50 chance of fulfilment .
According to all the research , there are a lot of people like me : full of good intentions , deeply concerned about climate change and yet ineffective at translating that into their behaviour .
Why ?
A mixture of information overload , time poverty ( a much overlooked aspect of environmental sustainability is how much time it requires ) and utter confusion about what " doing one 's bit " entails .
Plus the killer equation : what sacrifices is one prepared to tolerate when they are pathetically insignificant compared with Chinese power stations going up at the rate of two a week ?
Is it enough to have halved family meat consumption , have foregone flights for several sun-starved years and arranged a life in which habits of cycling to work and walking to school are routine ?
No , it 's just scratching at the surface .
If the developed world is to implement the 80 % cuts in carbon emissions the UN demands as part of the talks beginning in Bali today , the lives of our children will have to be dramatically different from everything we are currently bringing them up to expect .
In 2006 , each person in the UK produced 9.6 tonnes of C02 , and that needs to come down to less than three tonnes by 2050 .
That is the non-negotiable on which there is widespread consensus among environmental scientists and economists .
The much more controversial issue is whether that means consuming less or just consuming differently .
In other words , does sustainability require an entire recasting of the good life , or can we continue on our way , our aspirations to comfortable homes , nice cars and fancy holidays unchecked , delivered by green techno - wizardry ?
Government environmental policy is entirely built around the latter .
But the problem is that there is no evidence that techno - wizardry can deliver the cuts in carbon emissions needed .
In the past increased energy efficiency has only driven up aspirations : " If my fridge is more energy efficient and thus cheaper to run , perhaps I 'll now buy that air conditioning unit for these new hot summers . "
Technological innovation is an important part of the solution , but it wo n't be enough .
Wizardry it is rightly nicknamed : there is an irrational faith at the heart of government thinking .
But the alternative of lower consumption is something no politician is prepared to consider .
In one policy discussion on the subject , Treasury officials responded with contempt , and referred to it as tantamount to " going back to living in caves " .
We have a political system built on economic growth as measured by gross domestic product , and that is driven by ever - rising consumer spending .
Economic growth is needed to service public debt and pay for the welfare state .
If people stopped shopping , the economy would ultimately collapse .
No wonder , then , that one of the politicians ' tasks after a terrorist outrage is to reassure the public and urge them to keep shopping ( as both George Bush and Ken Livingstone did ) .
Advertising and marketing , huge sectors of the economy , are entirely devoted to ensuring that we keep shopping and that our children follow in our footsteps .
But there is a madness at the heart of this economic model with its terrible environmental costs .
It 's best illustrated by a graph used by the US psychologist Tim Kasser at a Whitehall seminar last week .
One line , representing personal income , has soared over the past 40 years ; the other line marks those who describe themselves as " very happy " , and has remained the same .
The gap between the two yawns ever wider .
All this consumption is not necessary to our happiness .
Kasser 's graph has both hopeful and disturbing implications .
On the hopeful side , this is good news : a low - consumption economy would n't mean misery .
But what 's disturbing is how we continue to shop when it does n't make us happier .
He argues that our hyperconsumerism is a response to insecurity , a maladaptive type of coping mechanism .
Over the past few decades , the sources of insecurity have multiplied : in addition to the manipulation long practised by advertising , there are new sources of insecurity in highly competitive market economies , ranging from identity ( who am I and where do I belong ? ) to basics ( who will look after me in my old age ? ) .
This relationship between materialism and insecurity helps explain why countries as diverse as the US and China are deeply materialistic ; they are places of endemic insecurity .
The brilliance of this economic system built on insecurity is that it is self - reinforcing .
The more insecure you are , the more materialistic ; the more materialistic , the more insecure .
As Kasser has shown , materialistic values ( which are on the increase among teenagers on both sides of the Atlantic ) make you more anxious , more vulnerable to depression and less cooperative .
Studies show that people know what the real sources of lasting human fulfilment are - good relationships , self - acceptance , community feeling - but they face a formidable alliance of political and economic interests that have a vested interest in distracting them from that insight to ensure they work longer hours and spend more money .
The task of turning this around is enormous , and the transition to a low - consumption economy has to be carefully managed to ensure a soft landing .
The greatest dilemma is that the shift could produce a damaging feedback loop - this is Kasser 's anxiety .
Lower consumption could lead to economic instability and increased insecurity ; plus climate change makes people insecure .
The response might be to reinforce our current frantic hyperconsumerism : an attitude of " eat , drink and be merry , for tomorrow we die " ; or a lunge after as much as possible to insulate yourself against the impacts of climate change .
But equally possible is a win - win scenario ; a low - consumption economy oriented towards facilitating the real sources of human fulfilment .
Most of us dimly recognise that huge lifestyle changes are necessary , but we 're waiting for someone else to initiate the process .
It 's a question of " I will if you will " - the title of a thoughtful report last year from the government 's Sustainable Development Commission .
Hearteningly , we know it can be done - our parents and grandparents managed it in the second world war .
This useful analogy , explored by Andrew Simms in his book Ecological Debt , demonstrates the critical role of government .
In the early 1940s , a dramatic drop in household consumption was achieved - not by relying on the good intentions of individuals ( and their ability to act on that coffee - stained pamphlet ) , but by the government orchestrating a massive propaganda exercise combined with a rationing system and a luxury tax .
This will be the stuff of 21st - century politics - something that , right now , all the main political parties are much too scared to admit .

Peterhansel claimed victory in the Dakar Rally last year The 2008 Dakar Rally has been cancelled because of safety concerns in the African republic of Mauritania .
Four French tourists were murdered in Mauritania on 24 December , which led to the French government advising against any travel to the country .
Eight of the rally 's 15 stages were due to pass through Mauritania .
The event 's organisers , the Amaury Sport Organisation , said there had been " direct threats against the race issued by terrorist groups " .
The annual car and motorcycle marathon had been due to start in Lisbon on 5 January with the finish coming in Dakar on 20 January .
" Following several consultations with the French government and taking into account its firm recommendations , the organisers of the Dakar have taken the decision to cancel the 2008 edition of the rally , " said an ASO statement .
606 : DEBATE
This is unexpected and will have serious consequences on the future of the rally
Chacor " Based on the current international political tension and the murder of four French tourists but also and mainly the direct threats launched directly against the race by terrorist organisations , no other decision but the cancellation could be taken .
" The ASO 's first responsibility is to guarantee the safety of all .
The ASO reaffirms that the choice of security is not , has never been and will never be a subject of compromise at the heart of the Dakar Rally .
" The Dakar is a symbol and nothing can destroy symbols .
The cancellation of the 2008 edition does not endanger the future of the Dakar . "
Daniel Bilalian , head of sport for event broadcasters France Televisions , added that " wisdom had prevailed " .
" If the slightest incident had happened , it would have been the credibility of the ASO that would have been at stake , " he said .
The Dakar Rally has been held uninterrupted since 1979 although in the past , stages have been cancelled .
Stephane Peterhansel claimed his ninth Dakar Rally title when he won the car event last year .

What are these ?
Consider the ultimate gift in a homeland security country : the iTaser , a weapon with its own MP3 player and earphones that can deliver a 50,000 volt electrical charge while you catch your favorite tunes .
This new Taser , on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , will be available , reports Richard Wray of the British Guardian , in “ red , pink and even leopard print designs . ”
Anyone carrying the iTaser will be able to make what may be the first homeland - security fashion statement in any one of the 43 states where Tasers are legal .
The company that makes the weapon , Taser International , has already sold 160,000 less - stylish versions to private individuals .
According to founder and company CEO Rick Smith , “ Personal protection can be both fashionable and functionable . ”
In November 2006 , the Taser infamously broke into the news on campus when a student at the University of Florida , questioning Senator John Kerry harshly , was dragged off , Tased , and subdued by campus police .
His plea , “ Do n’t Tase me , Bro ! , ” is now the stuff of bumper stickers , T - shirts , and cell phone ring tones .
Thanks largely to him and the publicity the incident got , the New Oxford Dictionary made “ Tase ” one of its 2007 words of the year , the Yale Book of Quotations put it at the top of its yearly list of most memorable quotes , and the rest of us got a hint that something new might be happening in America ’s “ ivory towers . ”
As Michael Gould - Wartofsky indicates below , that incident was just the tip of an enormous homeland - security presence on campus .
Gould - Wartofsky ’s remarkable report  a piece that the Nation magazine and Tomdispatch.com are sharing  offers real news about just how deeply the new homeland security state is settling into every aspect of our world .

Welcome to the new homeland security campus
From Harvard to UCLA , the ivory tower is fast becoming the latest watchtower in Fortress America .
The terror warriors , having turned their attention to “ violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism ”  as it was recently dubbed in a House of Representatives bill of the same name  have set out to reconquer that traditional hotbed of radicalization , the university .
Building a homeland - security campus and bringing the university to heel is a seven - step mission :
1. Target dissidents :
As the warfare state has triggered dissent , the campus has increasingly become a target gallery  with student protesters in the crosshairs .
The government ’s number one target ?
Peace and justice organizations .
From 2003 to 2007 , an unknown number of them made it into the Pentagon ’s “ Threat and Local Observation Notice ” system ( TALON ) , a secretive domestic spying program ostensibly designed to track direct “ potential terrorist threats ” to the Department of Defense itself .
Last year , via Freedom of Information
Act requests , the ACLU uncovered at least 186 specific TALON reports on “ anti-military protests ” in the U.S.  some listed as “ credible threats ”  from student groups at the University of California - Santa Cruz , State University of New York , Georgia State University , and New Mexico State University , among other campuses .
At more than a dozen universities and colleges , police officers now double as full - time FBI agents and , according to the Campus Law Enforcement Journal , serve on many of the nation ’s 100 Joint Terrorism Task Forces .
These dual - purpose officer - agents have knocked on student activists ’ doors from North Carolina State to the University of Colorado and , in one case , interrogated an Iraqi - born professor at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst about his antiwar views .
FBI agents , or their campus stand - ins , do n’t have to do all the work themselves .
Administrators often do it for them , setting up “ free speech zones , ” which actually constrain speech , and punishing those who step outside them .
Last year , protests were typically forced into “ free assembly areas ” at the University of Central Florida and Clemson University ; while students at Hampton and Pace Universities faced expulsion for handing out antiwar flyers , aka “ unauthorized materials . ”
2. Lock and load :
Many campus police departments are morphing into heavily armed garrisons , equipped with a wide array of weaponry from Taser stun guns and pepper guns to shotguns and semiautomatic rifles .
Lock - and - load policies that began in the 1990s under the rubric of “ the war on crime ” only escalated with the President ’s Global War on Terror .
Each school shooting  most recently the massacre at Virginia Tech  just adds fuel to the armament flames .
Two - thirds of universities now arm their police , according to the Justice Department .
Many of the guns being purchased were previously in the province of military units and SWAT teams .
For instance , AR - 15 rifles ( similar to M - 16s ) are now in the arsenal of the University of Texas campus police .
Last April , City University of New York bought dozens of semiautomatic handguns .
Now , states like Nevada are even considering plans to allow university staff to pack heat in a “ special reserve officer corps . ”
Most of the force used on campus these days , though , comes in “ less lethal ” form , such as the rubber bullets and pepper pellets increasingly used to contain student demonstrations .
Then there is the ubiquitous Taser , the electroshock weapon recently ruled a “ form of torture ” by the UN .
A Taser was used by UCLA police in November 2006 to deliver shock after shock to an Iranian - American student for failing to produce his ID at the Powell Library .
Last September , a University of Florida student was Tased after asking pointed questions of Senator John Kerry at a public forum , his plea of “ Do n’t Tase me , bro ” becoming the stuff of pop folklore .
3 . Keep an eye ( or hundreds of them ) focused on campus : Surveillance has become a boom industry nationally  one that now reaches deep into the heart of the American campus .
In fact , universities have witnessed explosive growth in the electronic surveillance of students , faculty , and campus workers .
On ever more campuses , closed - circuit security cameras can track people ’s every move , often from hidden or undisclosed locations , sometimes even into classrooms .
The International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators reports that surveillance cameras have now found their way onto at least half of all colleges , their numbers on any given campus doubling , tripling , and in a few cases , rising tenfold since September 11 , 2001 .
Such cameras have proliferated by the hundreds on private campuses , in particular .
The University of Pennsylvania , for instance , has more than 400 watching over it , while Harvard and Brown have about 200 each .
Elsewhere , it can be tricky just to find out where the cameras are and what they ’re meant to be viewing .
The University of Texas , for example , battled student journalists over disclosure and ultimately kept its cameras hidden .
Sometimes , though , a camera ’s purpose seems obvious .
Take the case of Hussein Hussein , a professor in the Department of Animal Biotechnology at the University of Nevada , Reno .
In January 2005 , the widely respected professor found a hidden camera redirected to monitor his office .
4 . Mine student records : Student records have , in recent years , been opened up to all manner of data mining for purposes of investigation , recruitment , or just all - purpose tracking .
From 2001 to 2006 , in an operation code - named “ Project Strike Back , ” the Department of Education teamed up with the FBI to scour the records of the 14 million students who applied for federal financial aid each year .
The objective ?
“ To identify potential people of interest , ” explained an FBI spokesperson cryptically , especially those linked to “ potential terrorist activity . ”
Strike Back was quietly discontinued in June 2006 , days after students at Northwestern University blew its cover .
But just one month later , the Education Department ’s Commission on the Future of Higher Education , in a much - criticized preliminary report , recommended the creation of a federal “ unit record ” database that would track the activities and studies of college students nationwide .
The Department ’s Institute of Education Sciences has developed a prototype for such a national database .
It ’s not a secret that the Pentagon , for its part , hopes to turn campuses into recruitment centers for its overstretched , overstressed forces .
In fact , the Department of Defense ( DoD ) has built its own database for just this purpose .
Known as Joint Advertising Market Research and Studies , this program now tracks 30 million young people , ages 16 to 25 .
According to a Pentagon spokesperson , the DoD has partnered with private marketing and data mining firms , which , in turn , sell the government reams of information on students and other potential recruits .
5 . Track foreign - born students , keep the undocumented out : Under the auspices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) , the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) has been keeping close tabs on foreign students and their dependents through the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System ( SEVIS ) .
As of October 2007 , ICE reported that it was actively following 713,000 internationals on campuses , while keeping more than 4.7 million names in its database .
The database aims to amass and record information on foreign students throughout their stay inside the United States .
SEVIS requires thick files on the students from the sponsoring schools , constantly updated with all academic , biographical , and employment records  all of which will be shared with other government agencies .
If students fall out of “ status ” at school  or if the database thinks they have  the Compliance Enforcement Unit of ICE goes into action .
ICE has also done its part to keep the homeland security campus purified of those not born in the homeland .
The American Immigration Law Foundation estimates that only one in 20 undocumented immigrants who graduate high school goes on to enroll in a college .
Many do n’t go because they cannot afford the tuition , but also because they have good reason to be afraid : ICE has deported a number of those who did make it to college , some before they could graduate .
6 . Take over the curriculum , the classroom , and the laboratory : Needless to say , not every student is considered a homeland security threat .
Quite the opposite .
Many students and faculty members are seen as potential assets .
To exploit these assets , the Department of Homeland Security has launched its own curriculum under its Office of University Programs ( OUP ) , intended , it says , to “ foster a homeland security culture within the academic community . ”
The record so far is impressive : DHS has doled out 439 federal fellowships and scholarships since 2003 , providing full tuition to students who fit “ within the homeland security research enterprise . ”
Two hundred twenty - seven schools now offer degree or certificate programs in “ homeland security , ” a curriculum that encompasses over 1,800 courses .
Along with OUP , some of the key players in creating the homeland security classroom are the U.S. Northern Command ( Northcom ) and the Aerospace Defense Command , co-founders of the Homeland Security and Defense Education Consortium .
OUP has also partnered with researchers and laboratories to “ align scientific results with homeland security priorities . ”
In Fiscal Year 2008 alone , $ 4.9 billion in federal funding will go to homeland security - related research .
Grants correspond with 16 research topics selected by DHS , based on presidential directives , legislation , and a smattering of scientific advice .
But wait , there ’s more : DHS has founded and funded six of its very own “ Centers of Excellence , ” research facilities that span dozens of universities from coast to coast .
The latest is a Center of Excellence for the Study of Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism , the funding for which cleared the House in October .
The Center is mandated to assist a National Commission in combating those “ adopting or promoting an extremist belief system ? to advance political , religious or social change . ”
7. Privatize , privatize , privatize :
Of course , homeland security is not just a department , nor is it simply a new network of surveillance and data mining  it ’s big business .
( According to USA Today , global homeland - security - style spending had already reached $ 59 billion a year in 2006 , a six - fold increase over 2000 . )
Not surprisingly , then , universities have , in recent years , established unprecedented private - sector partnerships with the corporations that have the most to gain from their research .
The Department of Homeland Security ’s on - campus National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism ( START ) , for instance , features Lockheed Martin on its advisory board .
The Center for Food Protection and Defense relies on an industry working group that includes Wal - Mart and McDonald ’s offering “ guidance and direction , ” according to its chair .
While vast sums of money are flowing in from these corporate sponsors , huge payments are also flowing out into “ strategic supplier contracts ” with private contractors , as universities permanently outsource security operations to big corporations like Securitas and AlliedBarton .
Little of this money actually goes to those guarding the properties , who are often among the most underpaid workers at universities .
Instead , it fills the corporate coffers of those with little accountability for conditions on campus .
Meanwhile , some universities have developed intimate relationships with private - security outfits like the notorious Blackwater .
Last May , for example , the University of Illinois and its police training institute cut a deal with the firm to share their facilities and training programs with Blackwater operatives .
Local journalists later revealed that the director of the campus program at the time was on the Blackwater payroll .
In the age of hired education , such collaboration is apparently par for the course .
Following these seven steps over the past six years , the homeland security state and its constituents have come a long way in their drive to remake the American campus in the image of a compound on lockdown .
Somewhere , inside the growing homeland security state that is our country , the next seven steps in the process are undoubtedly already being planned out .
Still , the rise of Repress U is not inevitable .
The new homeland security campus has proven itself unable to shut out public scrutiny or stamp out resistance to its latest Orwellian advances .
Sometimes , such opposition even yields a free - speech zone dismantled , or the Pentagon ’s TALON de-clawed , or a Project Strike Back struck down .
A rising tide of student protest , led by groups like the new Students for a Democratic Society , has won free - speech victories and reined in repression from Pace and Hampton , where the University dropped its threats of expulsion , to UCLA , where Tasers will no longer be wielded against passive resisters .
Yet , if the tightening grip of the homeland security complex is n’t loosened , the latest towers of higher education will be built not of ivory , but of Kevlar for the over - armored , over - armed campuses of America .

Rice not ' that self - reflective ' about Iraq mistakes Jason Rhyne
Published : Friday November 9 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Security problems currently plaguing US - occupied Iraq are due to in part to a mistake in strategy made prior to the invasion , according to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who says local Iraqi leaders should have played a larger role in US planning .
Rice describes herself in an interview with Newsweek 's Michael Hirsch as not " that self - reflective . "
" I 'm sure there are lots of things we might have done better , " she said .
" I 'll give you one with Iraq .
If I had to do it all over again , we would have had the balance between center , local and provincial better .
But that 's the kind of thing you learn over time . "
Hirsch writes that although Rice has conceded previously that " tactical " mistakes have been made in Iraq , specifics have been scant .
While still maintaining that the creation of a democratic central government in Iraq was " going to be judged very well " over time , Rice said the process could have been significantly aided with a more localized approach : " I think we did n't identify a lot of the kind of provincial and local leaders that might have been able to deliver services as well as politics on a more localized level early on , " she said .
But Paul Bremer , the Coalition Provisional Authority 's administrator in Iraq through 2004 , told Newsweek that he'd done all he could -- with the resources he had -- to reach out to local leaders .
" It 's important to remember that we had what we called governance support teams in all of the provincial capitals by the fall of 2003 , " Bremer remarked .
" We certainly had the concept there .
Could we have done more ?
We were chronically understaffed throughout the CPA .
We never had enough in the provinces .
So I do n't really know . "
Bremer lays a portion of the blame on Sunni leaders reluctant to give up their power in Iraqi provinces -- but even Bremer acknowledges that the US could have increased its efforts to bring them to the negotiating table .
" Could they have come to that solution in 2004 ? " he asked .
" I devoutly wished they had .
That 's not to say we could n't have done more . " "
But Bush administration critics say Rice 's acknowledgment of error is too little too late .
" The overarching comment you can make about administration policy in Iraq is not that they have n't learned , it 's that they 've always been behind the curve , " Larry Diamond , a scholar from the Hoover Institution and a one - time advisor to the Coalition Provisional Authority , told Newsweek .
" And that at every historical moment they 've been racing to catch up with reality . "
Another Iraq expert , Judith Yaphe of the National Defense University , voiced similar criticisms to the magazine .
" If you look at Saddam 's rule , he knew very well how important local and tribal leaders were , " Yaphe said .
" It seems to me anybody in that area understands that full well .
That 's how that system has operated there for a long time . "
Rice , however , said that the need for such a plan was n't necessarily known at the time of the invasion .
" I would like to go back and find out who gave that [ advice ] , " she said , responding to the suggestion that experts had predicted such a localized strategy would be required " Arab states can be very centralized .
This is actually a fairly new model of local and provincial responsibility .
I do n't think it was self - evident that this was the case . "
The towers and offices of mobile phone operators in Afghanistan are being pressured to shut down operations at night by the Taliban .
The former rulers of Afghanistan and current insurgent group held " talks " with the four major mobile companies in Afghanistan today , and gave them three days to go dark for 14 hours per day — or else .
The reason for the threat is the Taliban 's belief that American soldiers and rebels within Afghanistan are using mobile phones to track down remaining Taliban members .
" Since the occupying forces stationed in Afghanistan usually at night use mobile phones for espionage to track down the mujahideen , the Islamic Emirate gave a three - day ultimatum to all mobile phone firms to switch off their phones from five in the afternoon until seven in the morning , " Taliban spokesperson Qari Mohammad Yousuf told Reuters , ironically via mobile phone ( and presumably during daylight ) .
Three of the four companies receiving the ultimatum — Roshan , Areeba , and Etisalat — are not based in Afghanistan , with the fourth being the Afghan Wireless Communication Company .
They are considered major investors in the country 's economy , as there are still almost no other means of outside communication since the Taliban 's fall in 2001 .
If they give in to the Taliban 's threat , communications within the country would be severely disrupted due to the lack of landlines .
This is n't the first time the Taliban has challenged mobile operators in Afghanistan .
In the past , the group has accused the phone companies of actively working with US troops as well as NATO , although not much has happened as a result of those threats .
Still , it 's no doubt unsettling to the mobile operators to know that they may be targeted for continuing with business as usual — especially since the US is reportedly using satellites and not mobile phone operators for tracking .
Venus ’s atmosphere , taken by the Venus Monitoring Camera ( VMC ) during Venus Express orbit number 459 on 24 July 2007 .
The view shows the southern hemisphere of the planet .
Brighthazes that mysteriously appear and then disappear on Venus in a matter of dayshave revealed a new dynamic feature of the planet ?s cloudy atmosphere that isunlike anything on Earth .
The EuropeanSpace Agency 's Venus Monitoring Camera ( VMC ) captured a series of imagesshowing the development of a bright haze over the southern latitudes of theplanet in July 2007 .
Over a period of days , the high - altitude veil continuallybrightened and dimmed , moving towards equatorial latitudes and then backtowards the south pole .
Thesetransient dark and bright markings indicate regions on the cloud - covered world wheresolar ultraviolet radiation is being absorbed and reflected by sulfuric acid particles , mission scientists said this week .
Gaseoussulfur dioxide and small amounts of water vapor are usually found belowaltitudes of about 43 miles ( 70 kilometers ) in Venus ' carbon - dioxide richatmosphere .
These molecules are usually shrouded from view by cloudlayers above that block our view to the surface at visible wavelengths .
ESAscientists think the sulfuric acid particles that make up the bright haze arecreated when some atmospheric process lifts the gaseous sulfur dioxide andwater vapor high up above the cloud tops where they are exposed to ultravioletradiation from the sun .
The UVradiation breaks up the molecules , making them highly reactive .
The fragmentsof the molecules eagerly seek each other out and combine to form the sulfuricacid particles .
" Theprocess is a bit similar to what happens with urban smog over cities , " said mission team member Dmitri Titov of the Max Planck Institute for SolarSystem Research in Germany .
Exactlywhat causes the sulfur dioxide and water vapor to well up is not known , butTitov says it is likely some internal process of Venus 'atmosphere .
The transientdark markings on the VMC images are even more of a mystery .
They are caused bysomething that absorbs UV radiation , but scientists do n't yet know what thechemical is .
The blast happened in a region not known for suicide attacks
The scene of the attack in the province of Baghlan was left littered with bodies and splattered with blood in one of the worst attacks in recent times .
The attack was condemned by the Afghan president , the White House and the UN .
Analysts say suicide attacks are rare in this area , and the bombing shows the reach of the insurgency is growing .
The Taleban , al - Qaeda and other militant groups are fighting thousands of Afghan and foreign troops in Afghanistan .
Bodies
The bomb exploded at a sugar factory in a town in Baghlan province while a delegation of parliamentarians was visiting - at least six of whom died .
Prominent opposition MP Mustafa Kazimi was among the dead
Among the MPs killed was Mustafa Kazimi , a former mujahideen fighter and prominent opposition figure .
Schoolchildren who had gathered to welcome the politicians were also killed .
" I saw bodies lying in the streets and some of the people were stealing the weapons of the dead soldiers , " local resident Mohammad Rahim told Reuters news agency .
" Children are screaming for help .
It 's like a nightmare , " said Mr Rahim , who said the blast had killed his two cousins , both schoolgirls .
The deputy mayor of Baghlan province said that two disembodied legs were all that remained of the bomber following the attack .
The bomber 's identity is unknown .
The head of hospitals in Baghlan , Yousuf Faiz , told AFP news agency 40 dead and 120 wounded had been registered at four hospitals .
Meanwhile provincial security chief Abdurrahman Sayedkhail told Reuters he was aware of 50 dead , though some relatives had taken bodies away themselves .
Taleban denial
President Karzai condemned the " heinous " attack - one of the worst since the ousting of the Taleban in 2001 - " in the strongest possible terms " , he said in a statement .

Deadliest bomb attacks
" It is the work of the enemies of peace and security in Afghanistan , " he said .
The attack was " a despicable act of cowardice and it reminds us who the enemy is " , said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon expressed " his continuing anxiety regarding the unstable security situation throughout Afghanistan " .
A Taleban spokesman condemned the attack and denied the Taleban were behind it .
However , suicide bombs in Afghanistan have until now been exclusively the work of the Taleban and al - Qaeda , our correspondent says .
In separate developments :
Canadian Defence Minister Peter Mackay narrowly avoided being injured by a rocket fired by insurgents at a Canadian military outpost in Kandahar province .
Four Canadian soldiers were lightly wounded
Taleban militants on motorbikes and in pick - up trucks captured an important district in the province of Day Kundi - the third district captured in a week .
Violence
Until now , most suicide attacks have taken place in the south and east of Afghanistan or , less frequently , in Kabul .
But the UN says the number of suicide attacks is rising sharply .
Insurgent attacks have also been on the increase in areas of central and even northern Afghanistan - where violence had tended to take the form of common crime rather than political attacks , says our correspondent .
Fighters loyal to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar - a former mujahideen leader who is battling the Kabul government independently from the Taleban - are known to be active in Baghlan , says BBC analyst Pam O'Toole .
Civilians have often been the victims of the violence in Afghanistan - not only in attacks by insurgents , but also in strikes by the foreign Nato and US forces in the country .
Janet Moses , a mother of two , was held under water in an attempt to drive away a makutu or Maori curse .
Containers holding an " extensive amount " of water had been brought into the lounge of the house in Wellington for the ceremony .
The woman was dead for nine hours before her family contacted police .
She had been placed on a bed and was found with grazes to her upper arms , forearms and torso .
Police initially treated it as an unexplained death until a postmortem examination ruled out natural causes and revealed that she had drowned .
The head of the inquiry , Detective Sergeant Ross Levy confirmed that a " cultural ceremony " had taken place and said police were treating the death as a homicide .
The exorcism took place on October 12 .
Moses , who had two daughters aged one and three , stayed at her relative 's house in the week leading up the exorcism .
A woman living next door said she heard loud noises on the night of the ceremony " like banging on a wall " and that a large number of people had been entering and leaving the house .
In addressing the supply side of oil and gas depletion , much hope has been put into the scaling of ' biofuels ' , by applying new ( and old ) technologies to annual crops to create ethanol or biodiesel , thus providing chemically viable alternatives to the transportation liquids derived from crude oil .
Much of the biofuels debate thus far has focused on their lower energy balance , vis -a - vis crude oil .
While this is important , analysis of the impacts on non-energy inputs and impacts should a massive scaling of biofuels occur , urgently needs to be discussed .
The National Academy of Sciences recently published a report titled " Water Implications of Biofuel Production in the United States " .
The paper outlines impacts and limitations on both water availability and water quality that would follow the pursuit of a national strategy to replace liquid fossil fuels with those made from biomass .
Some long time readers of theoildrum.com think we have beaten the corn ethanol horse to death .
While this may appear true to certain camps ( especially ethanol stock investors ! ) , the fact remains that corn ethanol technology is still at the forefront of our nations mitigation responses to ' energy security ' and Peak Oil .
Production is slated to increase from 5 billion gallons last year to 35 billion gallons in a decade .
The DOE projects that biofuels can provide us with 30 % of our liquid fuel needs by 2030 .
However , given that we have limited amounts of high quality resources : crude oil , gasoline , fresh water , breathable air , healthy soil , productive ecosystems , etc. , one of the highest policy priorities ( in conjunction with attempts to change our conspicuous consumption paradigm ) should be to establish the best use of these scarce resources to secure future energy flows .
Two of the most precious of these are energy and water , and are the subject of todays post .
This post is a summary of an excellent recent report commissioned by the Natural Resource Council via the National Academy of Sciences , titled " The Implications of Biofuel Production for United States Water Supplies "
It can be purchased in book form or downloaded as a pdf here .
( Editors note :
As I 've discussed here recently , two University of Vermont colleagues and I have written a related paper highlighting the critical and limiting role that water will play in future energy production , particularly from bioenergy .
" Burning Water - EROWI - The Energy Return on Water Invested " , is currently ( still ) in the review / rejection / resubmittal process so I 've been unable to post it here , even though it was written over a year ago ) .
Since corn ethanol looks to still be a key policy issue in the upcoming Presidential primaries in Iowa , I thought a brief overview of this important NAS paper would be informative to our readers .

ABOUT BIOMASS , BIOFUELS AND WATER
Because of a strong U.S. national interest in greater energy independence , biofuels have become important liquid transportation fuels and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future .
Currently , the main biofuel in the United States is ethanol derived from corn kernels , with a very small fraction made from sorghum .
Biodiesel from soybeans also comprises a small fraction of U.S. biofuels .
Ethanol from “ cellulosic ” plant sources ( such as corn stalks and wheat straw , native grasses , and forest trimmings ) is expected to begin commercially within the next decade .
US Production of Biofuels from Various Feedstocks 2006 Click to enlarge .
Recent increases in oil prices in conjunction with subsidy policies have led to a dramatic expansion in corn ethanol production and high interest in further expansion over the next decade .
President Bush has called for production of 35 billion gallons of ethanol annually by 2017 , which , if achieved , would comprise about 15 percent of U.S. liquid transportation fuels .
This goal is almost certain to result in a major increase in corn production , at least until marketable future alternatives are developed .
Among the possible challenges to biofuel development that may not have received appropriate attention are its effects on water and related land resources .
The central questions are how water use and water quality are expected to change as the U.S. agricultural portfolio shifts to include more energy crops and as overall agricultural production potentially increases .
Such questions need to be considered within the context of U.S. policy and also the expected advances in technology and agricultural practices that could help reduce water impacts .
To help illuminate these issues , the Water Science and Technology Board ( WSTB ) of the National Research Council held a colloquium on “ Water Implications of Biofuels Production in the United States ” in Washington , D.C. , on July 12 , 2007 , which was attended by more than 130 people from federal and state government , non-governmental organizations , academia , and industry .
WSTB established a committee to organize and host the colloquium and to develop this report ( see Box 1 - 1 ) .
This report draws some conclusions about the water implications of biofuels productions based on discussions at the colloquium , written submissions of participants , the peer - reviewed literature , and the best professional judgments of the committee .
Water is an increasingly precious resource used for many purposes including drinking and other municipal uses , hydropower , cooling thermoelectric plants , manufacturing , recreation , habitat for fish and wildlife , and agriculture .
The ways in which a shift to growing more energy crops will affect the availability and quality of water is a complex issue that is difficult to monitor and will vary greatly by region .
In some areas of the country , water resources already are significantly stressed .
For example , large portions of the Ogallala ( or High Plains ) aquifer , which extends from west Texas up into South Dakota and Wyoming , show water table declines of over 100 feet .
Deterioration in water quality may further reduce available supplies .
Increased biofuels production adds pressure to the water management challenges the nation already faces .
Some of the water needed to grow biofuel crops will come from rainfall , but the rest will come from irrigation from groundwater or surface water sources .
The primary concern with regard to water availability is how much irrigation will be required — either new or reallocated — that might compete with water used for other purposes .
Irrigation accounts for the majority of the nation ’s “ consumptive use ” of water — that is the water lost through evaporation and through plant leaves that does not become available for reuse .
FIGURE 1 - 1 The agricultural water cycle .
Inputs to a crop include rainfall and irrigation from surface
water and groundwater .
Some water is “ consumed ” ( that is , incorporated in the crop or evapotranspired ) ,
some returns to surface waterbodies for human or ecological use downstream , and some infiltrates into
the ground .
Click to enlarge .
Figure 1 - 1 makes it clear that crop water may originate from one source , such as rain or groundwater , and be discharged to another , such as surface water .
Precipitation , groundwater , and surface water sources — and groundwater and surface water discharges — are not only viewed differently in water law and policy , but also have different consequences for long - term sustainable use of the resource base .
Since groundwater accounts for almost all of the long - term storage of water on the continents , extracting groundwater for irrigation that is subsequently discharged to streams may decrease the water available for future users of the aquifer .
The question of whether more or less water will be applied to biofuel crops depends on what crop is being substituted and where it is being grown .
For example , in much of the country , the crop substitution to produce biofuel will be from soybeans to corn .
Corn generally uses less water than soybeans and cotton in the Pacific and Mountain regions , but the reverse is true in the Northern and Southern Plains , and the crops use about the same amount of water in the North Central and Eastern regions .

Understanding water quantity impacts is dependent on understanding the agricultural water cycle depicted in Figure 1 - 1 .
Crops can be either rainfed or irrigated ( see Figure 1 - 2 ) .
Irrigation water can come from groundwater or surface water , and groundwater can be withdrawn from either a surficial aquifer ( connected directly to the surface ) or a confined aquifer ( overlain by a low permeability layer , or aquitard , such as clay ) .
Some of the applied water is incorporated into the crop , but most of it leaves the fields as ( 1 ) evaporation from the soil and transpiration from plants ( called evapotranspiration or ET ) , ( 2 ) runoff to rivers and streams ( sometimes called “ return flow ” ) , and ( 3 ) infiltration to the surficial aquifer .
The water that is incorporated into the crops or lost to evapotranspiration is referred to as “ consumptive use , ” because it cannot be reused for another purpose in the immediate vicinity .
Rates of ET vary greatly by the type of crop .
During a growing season , a leaf will transpire many times more water than its own weight .
An acre of corn gives off about 3,000 - 4,000 gallons of water each day while a large oak tree can transpire 40,000 gallons per year ( USGS , 2007 ) .
Grasses that might be in cellulosic production have a slightly higher ET rate than corn , but considerably a lower ET rate than trees .

begins in 2015 .
Dedicated energy crops refer to those grown solely for energy production .

There are many uncertainties in estimating consumptive water use of the biofuel feedstocks of the future .
Water data are less available for some of the proposed cellulosic feedstocks — for example , native grasses on marginal lands — than for widespread and common crops such as corn , soybeans , sorghum , and others .
Neither the current consumptive water use of the marginal lands nor the potential water demand of the native grasses is well known .
Further , while irrigation of native grass today would be unusual , this could easily change as production of cellulosic ethanol gets underway .
CROP WATER AVAILABILITY AND USE

Shifting land from an existing crop ( or noncrop plant species ) to a crop used in biofuel production has the potential to change irrigation water use , and thus the local water availability .
Conversion to the different type of biomass will result in increased water use in some cases , in other cases a decrease .
As an example , in much of the country , the crop substitution is from soy to corn .
The regional effects of this can be seen in Figure 2 - 1 .
Corn generally uses less water than soybeansand cotton in the Pacific and Mountain regions .
The reverse is true in the Northern and Southern Plains , and the crops use about the same amount of water in the North Central and Eastern regions .
Changes in agricultural water use would generally parallel these trends .
Another example is in Northern Texas , where annual evapotranspiration ( ET ) rates per year for alfalfa , corn , cotton , and sorghum are estimated to be about 1,600 , 760 , 640 , and 580 mm ( 63 , 30 , 25 , and 23 inches ) , respectively .
Therefore , regional water loss to ET will likely decrease if alfalfa acreage is converted to corn , but increase if cotton or sorghum is converted .

Given the regional differences in rainfall and groundwater storage , the feasibility and sustainability of biofuel crop production as a function of water availability may vary significantly by region .
Figure 2 - 2 shows the state - by - state water requirement of irrigated corn in the continental United States .
It demonstrates that the amount of rainfall and other hydroclimate conditions in a given area causes significant ( 10 - fold ) variations in the water requirement for the same crop .
Clearly there will be geographic limits on certain kinds of biofuels feedstock simply based on their water requirements .
In the next 5 to 10 years , increased agricultural production for biofuels will probably not alter the national - aggregate view of water use .
However , there are likely to be significant regional and local impacts where water resources are already stressed .
Water Quality Impacts

Biomass feedstocks such as corn grain , soybeans , and mixed - species grassland biomass differ in current or proposed application rates of fertilizers and of pesticides .
Of these three potential feedstocks , the greatest application rates of both fertilizer and pesticides per hectare are for corn ( Figure 3 - 1 ) .
Phosphorus application rates are somewhat lower for soybeans than for corn .
Nitrogen application rates are much lower for soybeans than for corn because soybeans , which are legumes , fix their own nitrogen from the atmosphere .
Pesticide application rates for soybean are about half those for corn .
The native grasses compare highly favorably to corn and soy for both fertilizers and pesticides , with order - of - magnitude lower application rates .

The impacts of these differences in inputs can be visualized nationally by comparing N inputs ( such as fertilizer and manure ) and the concentrations of nitrate in stream water ( Figure 3 - 2 , left ) .
There are similar patterns for stream concentrations of atrazine , a major herbicide used in corn cultivation ( Figure 3 - 2 , right ) , although the environmental effects of pesticides in current use are difficult to decipher .
Both of these maps show that regionally the highest stream concentrations occur where the rates of application are highest , and that these rates are highest in the U.S. “ Corn Belt . ”

The effects of biomass production on the nation ’s coastal and offshore waters may be considerable .
Nitrogen in the Mississippi River system is known to be the major cause of an oxygen - starved “ dead zone ” in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure 3 - 3 ) , which in 2007 was the third largest ever mapped ( http://www.gulfhypoxia.net).
The condition known as hypoxia ( low dissolved oxygen ) occurs because elevated N ( and , to a lesser extent , P ) loading into the Gulf leads to algal blooms over a large area .
Upon the death of these algae , they fall to the bottom and their decomposition consumes nearly all of the oxygen in the bottom water .
This is lethal for most fish and other species that live there .

There are many possible metrics , but an index that builds on the work shown in Figure 3 - 1 is inputs of fertilizers and pesticides per unit of the net energy gain captured in a biofuel .
To estimate this first requires calculation of a biofuel ’s net energy balance ( NEB ) , that is , the energy content of the biofuel divided by the total fossil energy used throughout the full lifecycle of the production of the feedstock , its conversion to biofuel , and transport .
U.S. corn ethanol is most commonly estimated to have a NEB of 1.25 to 1.3 , that is , to return about 25 - 30 percent more energy , as ethanol , than the total fossil energy used throughout its production lifecycle .
The NEB estimated for U.S. soybean biodiesel is about 1.8 to 2.0 , or about a 100 percent net energy gain .
Switchgrass ethanol via fermentation is projected to be much higher — between 4 and 15 .
Similarly high are the estimates for ( a ) cellulosic ethanol and ( b ) synthetic gasoline and diesel from certain mixtures of perennial prairie grasses , forbs , and legumes ( NEB=5.5 and 8.1 , respectively ) .
Per unit of energy gained , corn ethanol and soybean biodiesel have dramatically different impacts on water quality .
When fertilizer and pesticide application rates ( Figure 3 - 1 ) are scaled relative to the NEB values of these two biofuels , they are seen to differ dramatically ( Figure 3 - 5 ) .
Per unit of energy gained , biodiesel requires just 2 percent of the N and 8 percent of the P needed for corn ethanol .
Pesticide use per NEB differs similarly .
Low input high - diversity prairie biomass and other native species would also compare favorably relative to corn using this metric .
This is just one possible metric of biofuels ’ impact on water quality .
Other measures might incorporate land requirements per unit of biofuel , soil erosion , or impacts of the associated biorefinery
Fertilizers applied to increase agriculture yields can result in excess nutrients ( nitrogen [ N ] and to a lesser extent , phosphorous [ P ] ) flowing into waterways via surface runoff and infiltration to groundwater .
Nutrient pollution can have significant impacts on water quality .
Excess nitrogen in the Mississippi River system is known to be a major cause of the oxygen starved “ dead zone ” in the Gulf of Mexico , in which many forms of marine life cannot survive .
The Chesapeake Bay and other coastal waterbodies also suffer from hypoxia ( low dissolved oxygen levels ) caused by nutrient pollution .
Over the past 40 years , the volume of the Chesapeake Bay ’s hypoxic zone has more than tripled .
Many inland lakes also are oxygen starved , more typically due to excess levels of phosphorous .
Corn , soybeans , and other biomass feedstocks differ in current or proposed rates of application of fertilizers and pesticides .
One metric that can be used to compare water quality impacts of various crops are the inputs of fertilizers and pesticides per unit of the net energy gain captured in a biofuel .
Of the potential feedstocks , the greatest application rates of both fertilizer and pesticides per hectare are for corn .
Per unit of energy gained , biodiesel requires just 2 percent of the N and 8 percent of the P needed for corn ethanol .
Pesticide use differs similarly .
Low - input , high - diversity prairie biomass and other native species would also compare favorably relative to corn using this metric .
Another concern with regard to water quality is soil erosion from the tillage of crops .
Soil erosion moves both sediments and agricultural pollutants into waterways .
There are various farming methods that can help reduce soil erosion .
However , if biofuel production increases overall agricultural production , especially on marginal lands that are more prone to soil erosion , erosion problems could increase .
An exception would be native grasses such as switchgrass , which can reduce erosion on marginal lands .
All else being equal , the conversion of other crops or non-crop plants to corn will likely lead to much higher application rates of N , which could increase the severity of the nutrient pollution in the Gulf of Mexico and other waterways .
However , it should be noted that recent advances in biotechnology have increased grain yields of corn per unit of applied N and P .
REDUCING WATER IMPACT THROUGH AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES
There are many agricultural practices and technologies that , if employed , can increase yield while reducing the impact of crops on water resources .
Many of these technologies have already been developed and applied to various crops , especially corn , and they could be applied to cellulosic feedstocks .
Technologies include a variety of water - conserving irrigation techniques , soil erosion prevention techniques , fertilizer efficiency techniques , and precision agriculture tools that take into account site - specific soil pH ( acidity , alkalinity ) , soil moisture , soil depth , and other measures .
Best Management Practices ( BMPs ) are a set of established methods that can be employed to reduce the negative environmental impacts of farming .
Such practices can make a large , positive environmental impact .
For example , in 1985 , incentives were put in place to encourage adoption of conservation tillage practices .
According to data from the National Resources Inventory ( NRI ) , maintained by the Natural Resources Conservation Service , overall annual cropland erosion fell from 3.06 billion tons in 1982 to about 1.75 billion tons in 2003 , a reduction of over 40 percent ( http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/TECHNICAL/NRI/).
In addition , biotechnologies are being pursued that optimize grain production when the grain is used for biofuel .
These technologies could help reduce water impacts by significantly increasing the plants ’ efficiency in using nitrogen , drought and water - logging tolerance , and other desirable characteristics .
WATER IMPACTS OF BIOREFINERIES

ethanol production facility .

Assuming the common figure of about 2.7 gallons of ethanol from one bushel of corn , 2,100 gallons of water / bushel * 1 bushel / 2.7 gallon of ethanol = about 780 gallons of water per gallon of ethanol .
( Additionally ) , current estimates of the consumptive water use from biorefinery facilities are in the range of 4 gallons of water per gallon of ethanol produced ( gal / gal ) ( Pate et al. , 2007 ) .
For perspective , consumptive water use in petroleum refining is about 1.5 gal / gal .
Overall water use in biorefineries may be as high as 7 gal / gal , but this number has been consistently decreasing over time and as of 2005 was only slightly over 4 gal / gal in 2005 .
Thus for a 100 million gallon per year plant , a little over 400 million gallons of water per year would be withdrawn from aquifers or surface water sources ( 1.1 million gallons per day ) .
The total water requirements for ethanol from cellulose are thought to be large — about 9.5 gal / gal , but this likely will decline as efficiency increases with experience at cellulosic - ethanol plants .
Existing and planned ethanol facilities ( 2007 ) and their estimated total water use mapped
with the principal bedrock aquifers of the United States and total water use in year 2000 .

Siting of some ethanol plants is occurring where the water resource is already under duress .
Figure 5 - 3 shows , for example , that many bioethanol plants that each require 0.1 - 1.0 million gallons per day are located on the High Plains aquifer .
This aquifer is currently being pumped at a rate of more than 1.5 billion gallons per day for agriculture , municipalities , industry , and private citizens .
Thus , 15 million gallons per day for bioethanol would represent only 1 % of total withdrawals .
But it is an incremental withdrawal from an already unsustainable resource .
Current water withdrawals are much greater than the aquifer ’s recharge rate 0.02 to 0.05 foot per year in south - central Nebraska , resulting in up to 190 - foot decline in the water table over the past 50 years .
It is equivalent to “ mining ” the water resource , and the loss of the resource is essentially irreversible .
All biofuel facilities require process water to convert biomass to fuel .
Water used in the biorefining process is modest in absolute terms compared to the water applied and consumed in growing the plants used to produce ethanol .
However , because this water use is concentrated into a smaller area , its effects can be substantial locally .
A biorefinery that produces 100 million gallons of ethanol per year would use the equivalent of the water supply for a town of about 5,000 people .
Consumptive use of water in biorefineries is largely due to evaporation losses from cooling towers and evaporators during the distillation of ethanol following fermentation .
However , consumptive use of water is declining as ethanol producers increasingly incorporate water recycling and develop new methods of converting feedstocks to fuels that increase energy yields while reducing water use .
Water Quality of Waste Streams from Two Existing Ethanol Facilities in Iowa
Click to enlarge .
Ethanol plants have various waste streams .
First , salts build up in cooling towers and boilers due to evaporation and scaling , and must be periodically discharged ( “ blowdown ” ) .
Second , the technologies used to make the pure water needed for various parts of the process ( e.g. , reverse osmosis [ RO ] , ion exchange , iron removal ; not shown in Figure 5 - 1 ) result in a brine effluent .
Under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ( NPDES ) permits are required from the states to discharge this effluent .
These permits often cover total dissolve solids ( TDS ) , acidity , iron , residual chlorine , and total suspended solids .
Table 5 - 1 gives chemical characteristics of waste water from the RO operation and from the cooling tower blowdown for two plants in Iowa .
Some violations of NPDES permits have been reported in Iowa and Minnesota from ethanol facilities , primarily for TDS .
KEY POLICY IMPLICATIONS
Subsidy policies for corn ethanol production coupled with low corn prices and high oil prices have driven the dramatic expansion of corn ethanol production over the past several years .
These policies have been largely motivated to improve energy security and provide a cleanburning additive for gasoline .
As biofuel production expands , and particularly as new cellulosic alternatives are developed , there is a real opportunity to shape policies to also meet objectives related to water use and quality impacts .
As total biofuels production expands to meet national goals , the long - term sustainability of the groundwater and surface water resources used for biofuel feedstocks and production facilities will be key issues to consider .
From a water quality perspective , it is vitally important to pursue policies that prevent an increase in total loadings of nutrients , pesticides , and sediments to waterways .
It may even be possible to design policies in such a way to reduce loadings across the agricultural sector , for example , those that support the production of feedstocks with lower inputs of nutrients .
Cellulosic feedstocks , which have a lower expected impact on water quality in most cases ( with the exception of the excessive removal of corn stover from fields without conservation tillage ) , could be an important alternative to pursue , keeping in mind that there are many uncertainties regarding the large - scale production of these crops .
There may be creative alternatives to a simple subsidy per gallon produced that could help protect water quality .
Performance subsidies could be designed to be paid when specific objectives such as energy conversion efficiency and reducing the environmental impacts of feedstock production — especially water quality — are met .
Biofuels production is developing within the context of shifting options and goals related to U.S. energy production .
There are several factors to be considered with regard to biofuels production that are outside the scope of this report but warrant consideration .
Those factors include : energy return on energy invested including consideration of production of pesticides and fertilizer , running farm machinery and irrigating , harvesting and transporting the crop ; the overall “ carbon footprint ” of biofuels from when the seed is planted to when the fuel is produced ; and the “ food vs. fuel ” concern with the possibility that increased economic incentives could prompt farmers worldwide to grow crops for biofuel production instead of food production .
CONCLUSIONS
Currently , biofuels are a marginal additional stress on water supplies at the regional to local scale .
However , significant acceleration of biofuels production could cause much greater water quantity problems depending on where the crops are grown .
Growing biofuel crops in areas requiring additional irrigation water from already depleted aquifers is a major concern .
The growth of biofuels in the United States has probably already affected water quality because of the large amount of N and P required to produce corn .
The extent of Gulf hypoxia in 2007 is among the three largest mapped to date , and the amount of N applied to the land is also at or near its highest level .
If not addressed through policy and technology development , this effect could accelerate as biofuels expand to 15 percent of domestic usage to meet President Bush ’s 2017 goal , or to 30 percent of domestic fuel usage as proposed by President Bush as the ultimate goal .
If projected future increases in the use of corn for ethanol production do occur , the increase in harm to water quality could be considerable .
Expansion of corn on marginal lands or soils that do not hold nutrients can increase loads of both nutrients and sediments .
To avoid deleterious effects , future expansions of biofuels may need to look to perennial crops , like switchgrass , poplars / willows , or prairie polyculture , which will hold the soil and nutrients in place .
To move toward a goal of reducing water impacts of biofuels , a policy bridge will likely be needed to encourage development of new technologies that support cellulosic fuel production and develop both traditional and cellulosic feedstocks that require less water and fertilizer and are optimized for fuel production .
Policies that better support agricultural best practices could help maintain or even reduce water quality impacts .
Policies which conserve water and prevent the unsustainable withdrawal of water from depleted aquifers could also be formulated .

THE BOTTOM LINE
As discussed often here in the past , biofuels not only have a much lower energy return vis-a - vis conventional crude , but have between one and two orders of magnitude lower in power density , ( or how much energy we get per unit of land ) .
Furthermore , in our ' Burning Water ' paper , ( and alluded to here in this NAS report ) , biofuels also require significantly more water than even the least efficient fossil fuel systems .
There are also concerns about pesticides , nitrate and other environmental impacts .
So when replacing energy with a ' substitute ' , all other things do not usually remain equal .
I commend the National Academy scientists for highlighting what will be a central issue in upcoming natural resource science - that of systems , and tradeoffs .
It is highly likely we will have liquid fuel shortages in the not too distant future , either via higher prices , or through actual unavailability or rationing .
The chart below ( thanks Khebab ) shows the progression of year over year declines , in different colored lines , of United States oil production .
The trend is reasonably clear .
We have found the cheap and easy oil .
Energy and water are but 2 of the central inputs that power our modern society .
Many of the key resources are either not currently valued by the market system , or may give too late a market signal of scarcity for effective mitigation .
The figure above ( not from the NAS report .. ;) gives a conceptual example of potential tradeoffs that a concerted efforts to increase liquid fuel production ( or any limiting variable that has linkages to other limiting inputs ) might engender .
The columns on the left in blue ( and red ) are when we are in a perceived liquid fuels shortfall .
The columns in purple are hypothetical amounts of resources remaining after a portion has been devoted to an ' increase liquid fuel policy ' .
Focusing on the limiting input du-jour risks pulling in more resources from the periphery which are currently non-limiters .
As can be visualized , successful addition of the variable in shortage may come at a cost , which might not be immediately visible or financially recognized , but a cost nonetheless .
We CAN increase our internal production of transportation liquids .
In addition to ethanol and biodiesel , we can use coal - to - liquids via Fischer Tropsch ; we can drill the Arctic or Alaska Wildlife Refuge ; we can expand land to dedicated energy crops , etc .
A joint study of the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of Agriculture concludes that the United States could produce 60 billion gallons of ethanol by 2030 through a combination of grain and cellulosic feedstocks , enough to replace 30 % of projected U.S. gasoline demand .
Scientists and policymakers should be asking them 'at what cost ' ?
When they reply XX billions , the comeback should be 'we did n't mean in $ terms - what are the costs in other scarce inputs needed by society ? '.
In robbing Peter to pay Paul , we have to realize that Paul is pretty insatiable .
Who will we rob after Peter ?
The subject of the origins of exponential growth , habituation and " Pauls " addiction to oil will be the subject of next weeks post .
A rights group 's attempt to find out whether the nation 's telecommunications companies were lobbying the nation 's top intelligence office to win immunity for the companies ' participation originally turned up empty .
All the Electronic Frontier Foundation pried free in November and December via its open government lawsuit were a few previously unseen letters from Congress to the Director of National Intelligence .
The government also said it was withholding a few pages from classified briefings to Congress and a telephone message slip .
The government is arguing it fulfilled its Freedom of Information Act responsibilities , but its latest filings show that that message slip is very interesting indeed .
The slip was created by an administrative assistant at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , and contains the name and phone number of a phone company representative , according to government filings .
The slip was then passed to an ODNI lawyer , who returned the call .
The lawyer also made notes on the front and the back of the slip about the conversation which touched on the FISA ' modernization ' bill ( which includes immunity for telecoms ) , and the Protect America Act .
According to a filing ( .pdf ) by Lt. General Ronald Burgess , Jr. , the ODNI 's intelligence staff director , the conversation :
[ R]related to the various options that may ber available to address the litigation facing the telecommunications carriers [...]
The ODNI attorney and the caller discussed such options as court order and legislation . [...]
[ A[ ny further details about the contents of the message would confirm the existence or non-existence of a relationship with a telecommunications carrier , which is currently and properly classified .
The name of the telecom representative is also being protected because releasing it would be a " clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy , " the government argues .
The government furthermore argues the slip is Top Secret , a attorney - work product and not an agency record .
Revealing which company called would help the terrorists , the government argues , though its public record which telecoms are being sued – AT&T , Verizon , Sprint and others – and which are not – Qwest , for one .
To highlight the fact it was not an official document , the government reveals that the attorney who wrote on the slip left it on his desk for several weeks and then just filed it in an " unofficial " FISA folder .
It 's unclear if that 's official policy for handling Top Secret documents or not .
The EFF is also trying to win release of two briefings given to Congress using PowerPoint slides .
The DNI 's filings say the document include descriptions of the methods by which the countries spies intercept communications and that revealing that information would compromise national security .
The EFF will respond to the government 's filing , and the two sides will argue their cases on March 7 before a federal judge .

As good as it gets
WHILE THE Bush administration , the media and nearly all the Democrats still refuse to explain the war in Iraq in terms of oil , the ever - pragmatic members of the Iraq Study Group share no such reticence .
Page 1 , Chapter 1 of the Iraq Study Group report lays out Iraq ’s importance to its region , the U.S. and the world with this reminder : “ It has the world ’s second - largest known oil reserves . ”
The group then proceeds to give very specific and radical recommendations as to what the United States should do to secure those reserves .
If the proposals are followed , Iraq ’s national oil industry will be commercialized and opened to foreign firms .
The report makes visible to everyone the elephant in the room : that we are fighting , killing and dying in a war for oil .
It states in plain language that the U.S. government should use every tool at its disposal to ensure that American oil interests and those of its corporations are met .
It ’s spelled out in Recommendation No. 63 , which calls on the U.S. to “ assist Iraqi leaders to reorganize the national oil industry as a commercial enterprise ” and to “ encourage investment in Iraq ’s oil sector by the international community and by international energy companies . ”
This recommendation would turn Iraq ’s nationalized oil industry into a commercial entity that could be partly or fully privatized by foreign firms .
This is an echo of calls made before and immediately after the invasion of Iraq .
The U.S. State Department ’s Oil and Energy Working Group , meeting between December 2002 and April 2003 , also said that Iraq “ should be opened to international oil companies as quickly as possible after the war . ”
Its preferred method of privatization was a form of oil contract called a production - sharing agreement .
These agreements are preferred by the oil industry but rejected by all the top oil producers in the Middle East because they grant greater control and more profits to the companies than the governments .
The Heritage Foundation also released a report in March 2003 calling for the full privatization of Iraq ’s oil sector .
One representative of the foundation , Edwin Meese III , is a member of the Iraq Study Group .
Another , James J. Carafano , assisted in the study group ’s work .
For any degree of oil privatization to take place , and for it to apply to all the country ’s oil fields , Iraq has to amend its constitution and pass a new national oil law .
The constitution is ambiguous as to whether control over future revenues from as - yet - undeveloped oil fields should be shared among its provinces or held and distributed by the central government .
This is a crucial issue , with trillions of dollars at stake , because only 17 of Iraq ’s 80 known oil fields have been developed .
Recommendation No. 26 of the Iraq Study Group calls for a review of the constitution to be “ pursued on an urgent basis . ”
Recommendation No. 28 calls for putting control of Iraq ’s oil revenues in the hands of the central government .
Recommendation No. 63 also calls on the U.S. government to “ provide technical assistance to the Iraqi government to prepare a draft oil law . ”
This last step is already underway .
The Bush administration hired the consultancy firm Bearing Point more than a year ago to advise the Iraqi Oil Ministry on drafting and passing a new national oil law .
Plans for this new law were first made public at a news conference in late 2004 in Washington .
Flanked by State Department officials , Iraqi Finance Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi ( who is now vice president ) explained how this law would open Iraq ’s oil industry to private foreign investment .
This , in turn , would be “ very promising to the American investors and to American enterprise , certainly to oil companies . ”
The law would implement production - sharing agreements .
Much to the deep frustration of the U.S. government and American oil companies , that law has still not been passed .
In July , U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman announced in Baghdad that oil executives told him that their companies would not enter Iraq without passage of the new oil law .
Petroleum Economist magazine later reported that U.S. oil companies considered passage of the new oil law more important than increased security when deciding whether to go into business in Iraq .
The Iraq Study Group report states that continuing military , political and economic support is contingent upon Iraq ’s government meeting certain undefined “ milestones . ”
It ’s apparent that these milestones are embedded in the report itself .
Further , the Iraq Study Group would commit U.S. troops to Iraq for several more years to , among other duties , provide security for Iraq ’s oil infrastructure .
Finally , the report unequivocally declares that the 79 total recommendations “ are comprehensive and need to be implemented in a coordinated fashion .
They should not be separated or carried out in isolation . ”
All told , the Iraq Study Group has simply made the case for extending the war until foreign oil companies — presumably American ones — have guaranteed legal access to all of Iraq ’s oil fields and until they are assured the best legal and financial terms possible .
We can thank the Iraq Study Group for making its case publicly .
It is now our turn to decide if we wish to spill more blood for oil .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
When it comes to religion , more and more U.S. adults either have none or do not identify with a particular church , although the country remains highly religious , a survey said on Monday .

The report from the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life found a constantly shifting landscape of religious loyalties , with the Roman Catholic Church losing more adherents than any other single U.S. religious group .
One in 10 Americans now describes himself as a former Catholic , it found , although that church ’s membership is constantly being replenished by immigrants , particularly Latinos .
Despite predictions that the United States would follow Europe ’s path toward secularization , the U.S. population “ remains highly religious in its beliefs and practices , ” the survey concluded .
But John Green , a senior researcher with the Pew Forum , told reporters American religion appears headed for more diversity , with the likelihood the country will be “ less Protestant and less Christian ” in the future than it is now .
The survey , based on interviews with more than 36,000 U.S. adults , found 78.4 percent of the population identify themselves as Christian .
Of U.S. adults in general , it said 51.3 percent were Protestant , 23.9 percent Catholic , 1.7 percent Mormon , 0.7 percent Jehovah ’s Witness and less than 0.3 percent each Greek or Russian Orthodox .
“ The biggest gains due to changes in religious affiliation have been among those who say they are not affiliated with any particular religious group or tradition , ” the survey found .
“ Overall 7.3 percent of the adult population says they were unaffiliated with any particular religion as a child .
Today , however , 16.1 percent of adults say they are unaffiliated ... sizable numbers of those raised in all religions -- from Catholicism to Protestantism to Judaism -- are currently unaffiliated with any particular religion , ” it added .
The survey did not seek to try to find why people abandon churches or join new ones .
Greg Smith , a researcher at the forum , said it may be that younger generations are not reconnecting with religion as they age as previous generations did , a trend that if continued could have a profound impact on American religion .
IMMIGRANTS REPLENISH CATHOLIC RANKS
Evangelicals constitute the largest Protestant segment at 26.3 percent of the adult population , while 18.1 percent of adults belong to mainstream faiths such as Methodists or Presbyterians and 6.9 percent to historically black churches .
Jews were 1.7 percent of the population , including Reform at 0.7 percent , Conservative 0.5 percent and Orthodox 0.3 percent .
Buddhists were estimated at 0.7 percent , Muslims at 0.6 , Hindus at 0.4 , other world religions 0.3 , Unitarians and other liberal faiths 0.7 , New Age 0.4 and native American faiths 0.3 .
Even though this and other surveys have found the U.S. Catholic population fairly stable over the years , that masks the fact that “ in total the Catholic Church has lost more adherents than any other single religious group in the United States , ” the report said .
Immigrants keep replenishing their ranks , it said .
There were about 225 million U.S. adults when the surveys were conducted in 2007 .
The survey said it had an error margin of plus or minus 0.6 percent .
Georgia has survived New York City ’s subway system .
This black seven - month - old kitten escaped into the subway and was found 25 days later by two track workers .
And now she has been returned to her happy owner .
The cat was a bit thinner and had a scratch on her nose from her subway ordeal .
After hearing about the story of missing Georgia , track flagman Mark Dalessio and track inspector Efrain LaPorte had been diligently checking the area where Georgia had been spotted by a Con Ed worker on Wednesday .
Dalessio said , “ As I was walking down the track , I was making cat sounds , meowing .
I heard a ‘ meow ’ back and I thought it was LaPorte .
I thought , ‘ Wow , LaPorte is inspired . ’
Then I heard it again .
I looked down , and said , ‘ It ’s Georgia ! ’ ”
Georgia had been taking shelter in a foot - deep metal drain between two tracks when she was spotted .
The little kitten gave Dalessio a lick as he reached for her .
They called the police and in minutes , NYPD transit cops Sgt. Daniel Green and Police Officer Ilker Ozuk climbed down and rescued the cat .
Georgia went missing after she escaped from her travel carrier when her owner set the carrier on the subway platform .
After a checkup by the veterinarian , it was discovered that Georgia suffered a fractured back leg during her subway adventure .
She went through surgery earlier this week and is recovering .

For three decades Santa Cruz authorities have used The Nighttime Sleeping Ban to selectively harass and drive away homeless people .
The ordinance MC 6.36.010a is a law against sleeping on any public property , or in a vehicle and most private property between the hours of 11 PM to 8:30 AM .
In a town with emergency walk - in shelter for less than 60 - 160 people and an estimated homeless population of 1500 - 2000 , this law is unconscionable , unconstitutional and immoral .
The Blanket Ban makes it illegal to cover up with blankets or bedding outside during the same nighttime hours .
After the Jones decision of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and the subsequent Jones Settlement , nighttime camping bans in Los Angeles , Fresno , Richmond and San Diego were eliminated .
Activists in Santa Cruz took heart and began preparing for a legal challenge here .
We hope to challenge not only the Santa Cruz 's infamous Sleeping Ban , criminalizing the very act of sleeping at night , but also any and all police practices that abusively and selectively target homeless people for necessary survival behavior such as sleeping .
Given the city - acknowledged shelter emergency , the city has done little to resolve in spite of its " progressive " pretensions .
Attorneys from Berkeley , Santa Cruz , and Washington , D.C. are putting together the pleadings .
Attor­neys from San Francisco , Los Angeles , San Diego and Sacramento are helping .
The City Attorney and Mayor Ryan Coonerty has resisted any and all efforts to reform the Sleeping Ban so that it conforms with the 9th Circuit decision .
We are fund - raising and gathering plaintiffs to take the course directly to federal court
and expect to have an action filed in February .
Five years ago this week most readers of this newspaper were making plans to go on a demonstration .
More surprisingly , just as many Daily Telegraph readers were getting ready for the same event .
For most of those who marched against the Iraq war on February 15 2003 it was the first time they had ever demonstrated for or against anything in their lives .
It was a protest such as Britain had never seen before , all - embracing in its diversity and imposing in its unity of purpose .
While there are always arguments over the size of demonstrations ( the 2 million - or - so figure we claim is supported by considerable polling and photographic evidence ) , there is no dispute that this was not merely the country 's biggest political protest , but the biggest by a substantial order of magnitude .
Two things are obvious about the demonstration to " stop the war " .
First , the millions on the march were right .
Not just right on balance , but right on every single aspect of the question .
There were no weapons of mass destruction , Iraq did turn into a bloodbath , the invasion did not help resolve the crisis in the Middle East , and it did damage the cohesion of our own society and imperil our civil liberties while not making us one whit safer from terrorism .
So the people were smarter than the politicians .
Second the demonstration did not stop the war .
Our hope had been that mass protest could drive the British government out of its aggressive alliance with Bush and that the latter , isolated internationally as a result , would come under intensified domestic pressure .
We came very close , as Donald Rumsfeld made clear .
In the wake of February 15 , Washington told Blair he could stand down our army if he wanted to .
The prime minister ignored that offer and the people he represents alike .
However , failing is not the same thing as making no difference .
February 15 has cast a long shadow over British politics since , and contributed to Blair 's departure from office under circumstances - in public odium and with an exasperated party - scarcely of his choosing .
What war have we stopped ?
The next one , perhaps .
The demonstration was the apex of a broader movement which touched almost every part of society in 2003 .
This included the greatest - ever engagement of British Muslims in active politics , thousands of school student walkouts , peaceful civil disruption in towns across the country , local authorities coming out against the war , and train drivers declining to move munitions for the invasion .
It was a movement entirely outside the established structures which normally mediate the relationship between people and power .
It was organised by the Stop the War Coalition ( with CND and the Muslim Association of Britain as our partners ) , a campaign not 18 months old and run on a shoestring .
Hundreds of thousands of trade unionists joined the demonstration , while the TUC - its eyes on its ministerial connections , not its members - maintained a frigid indifference .
Labour and Tory party members protested against their leaders , while Liberal Democrats dragged their hierarchy to the demonstration behind them .
Marching at the head of the demonstration , I missed what may have been the most telling sight of the day - Piccadilly blocked by people without a single banner among them .
This was the march of the unmobilised .
It was also a march against Murdoch and his mendacious press , exploding the myth of his political omnipotence .
Rupert said war , the people said no .
All Alastair Campbell 's strategy of controlling opinion through appeasing the Sun in vain !
The demonstration , and the movement around it , exploded the notion that society is slumped in a consumer - sodden apathy , and incapable of political engagement .
The country 's biggest mass movement followed a general election with the lowest turnout in modern times , and preceded one in which participation was scarcely improved .
The problem is the system , not the people .
So perhaps the biggest lesson of February 15 is that it embodied the failure of representative democracy .
It highlighted a gap between the electorate and the elected , a gap several hundred thousand lives have slipped down as a result .
The anti-war movement has lived under the shadow of that immense mobilisation too .
But it was followed the next month by the biggest demonstration against a war British troops were actually fighting , by the biggest - ever weekday march ( against the Bush visit to London later in 2003 ) , by an unprecedented movement of military families against the war , and by a dozen further marches - including one which will mark the fifth anniversary of the war itself , on March 15 .
Opposition to empire has been put at the heart of politics as never before .
Emily Churchill , a Birmingham school student at the time , described the experience as " trying to steer the course of our country with our own hands " .
Of course in 2003 other , American , hands were on the wheel .
But the lesson of February 15 is that we can and we will .

Last night , Mr. Stewart ’s vexation was keener than his wit .
He likened the “ Speechless ” ads , a series of bleak , self - righteous black and white video spots on the guild ’s Web site , to an anti-AIDS public service message .
He noted that late - night talk shows stayed dark for just one week after the terror attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , whereas the current strike  a dispute over Internet revenues  had lasted nine weeks .
And he joked , somewhat sourly , that by that calculation , “ the writers ’ strike is nine times worse than 9/11 . ”
His sole interview for the night was with Ron Seeber , a professor of labor relations at Cornell University , who failed to clarify why the strike was going on so long .
Mr. Stewart had funny moments .
But overall , the show was a jarring display of solipsism from a performer famous for expertly tweaking the vanity and self - importance of politicians and conventional news organizations .
Mr. Stewart is just as merciless when it comes to the self - serving compromises and moral ambiguities of other institutions .
And his position was certainly ambiguous : he was resentful of the producers and angry at the writers ’ representatives , who so far have failed either to reach an agreement or to grant Comedy Central a special exemption for “ The Daily Show . ”
Mr. Colbert also returned , but with less angst .
He opened his show by sitting at his desk feeding script pages into a paper shredder , as if destroying incriminating evidence .
When Mr. Stewart asked him if he was violating the rules , Mr. Colbert teasingly accused Mr. Stewart of having relied on prepared material .
“ I ’m very alarmed by how prepared you seem , ” Mr. Colbert said , adding that he would denounce him to “ The Writers ’ Guild People ’s Council for the Preservation of the Written Word . ”
His task was easier , of course .
“ The Colbert Report ” is a parody of Fox News - style cable opinion shows , and he plays the part of an obtuse , pompous arch - conservative ; much of his show consisted of clips from past episodes in which Mr. Colbert ranted against the tyranny of unions .
( “ You know what prevents childhood obesity ? ” he said .
“ A 19 - hour shift at the mill . ” )
But Mr. Colbert kept his sense of humor trained on the campaign trail , joking about Sen. Barack Obama ’s rise and interviewing Mike Huckabee .
Illumination is really a requirement , however there is n’t any cause this can not be stunning or even uncommon or even fascinating , with respect to the environment .
Here are a few fascinating as well as affordable illumination programs .
Very first , within our situation , had been an extended look for appropriate , fascinating as well as useful illumination for that current growth associated with my personal customer ’s within the small home within Pasadena .
Among the difficulties we ’d in order to conquer had been the actual lengthy path in the yard as well as storage with the support patio , looking forward to the actual transporting associated with ladders or even additional power items with the room ; and also the elevation associated with any kind of illumination besides recessed , needed to be regarded as .
The initial gentle within the support patio had been an average light bulb included in the cup planet from the 1930s , that strung lower regarding 6 to 8 in . in the roof .
Using the brand new add - on , the actual service provider set up the recessed gentle , therefore the internal operation from the 2 roof lighting had been very various .
It was no problem to have an electrical installer or perhaps a useful spouse .
The correct modifications for that “ find ” from the day time some time ago in the Flower Dish , had been 2 aged , along with a little bit rusted , fluted channel dessert cookware .
These types of aged cookware will be a jerk in order to age the home within the brand new room , therefore it would n’t really feel therefore completely new .
The actual dessert cookware price 3 bucks each , as well as all of us had been particularly delighted using the concept as well as price .
Unfamiliar in order to all of us till recently , the identical concept in the HIGH DEFINITION Buttercup display room about the western aspect associated with La .
The cost had been considerably more - to the actual melody associated with $ 175 every !
Whilst all of us had been a little let down to locate “ our ” concept utilized , all of us had been thrilled within the “ savings ” .
The actual gentle over your kitchen kitchen sink had been built from the a regular kitchen area colander , adorable , simple and never especially unique , however it seems correct within the room .
The following unique discover , originated from a good property purchase , exactly where all of us situated 3 big chess items ; from the 3 my personal child desired the actual dark night , therefore good looking together with his ugly hair ; following had been the actual full who had been especially good looking , as well as all of us made the decision he ’d remain high on the fire place layer or even fireplace .
The 3rd as well as last item had been the actual rook .
We instantly recognized him or her like a ideal light bottom .
We understood my personal smart spouse might have not a problem drilling the pit within the best as well as away along side it to operate the wire , however it had been as much as me personally to locate all of the numerous pieces - and Used to do .
The actual light is the greatest of 3 items , beginning since the the majority of basic as well as humble , it ’s used it ’s host to recognition about the evening remain , absolutely no pun meant .
The gentle could be designed from virtually any kind of charter boat or even pot , based on just how much gentle is required .
The actual necklace illumination within the backyard is a fantastic strike and thus useful , because the tones do n’t have to end up being introduced within inclement climate .
The following outside task is to include a few really moderate as well as dull jello container lighting on the outside of of the home .
The master plan would be to style handles within the jello jars in order to cover up their own power as well as then add curiosity with increased from the punched container which was utilized in the actual outside necklace illumination within the outdoor patio .
Whilst all of us looked for some thing appropriate , all of us resolved about the moderate jello jars therefore we ’re able to fulfill the town and obtain your final examination finished .
All of us understood we ’re able to usually alter all of them , plus they had been under 10 bucks every .
Including the actual handles may conceal all of them adequately as well as increase the outside style .

Mukasey refuses to address waterboarding , defends telecom immunity Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday January 30 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Top Judiciary Republican accuses Cheney of ' going behind my back ' to stop warrantless wiretap oversight Appearing before Congress for the first time since his confirmation hearings , Attorney General Michael Mukasey continued to duck and wave on the hot subject of waterboarding .
He refused to make a straightforward judgement on the legality of the simulated - drowning technique , even in cases where it would involve US citizens .
Mukasey also continued the Bush administration 's arguments to block oversight of its warrantless surveillance program , pushing for legal immunity to be given to telecommunications companies as part of an expected spy -law update .
Back in October , Mukasey refused to answer pointed questions from Senators about waterboarding 's legality , saying he had not been " read into " the CIA 's previous interrogation program that is alleged to have included the practice .
Appearing Wednesday , nearly three months into his tenure , Mukasey did not budge much from that position .
The attorney general told the Senate Judiciary Committee that waterboarding was not currently used by US interrogators , but he said it would be inappropriate for him to make a hard - and - fast pronouncement about waterboarding 's legality absent " concrete facts and circumstances " in which it would be used again .
" There are some circumstances where current law would appear clearly to prohibit the use of waterboarding .
Other circumstances would present a far closer question , " Mukasey said , echoing comments from a letter he sent the committee Tuesday .
Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy referenced comments from Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell , who said it " would be torture " if he were waterboarded , and former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge , who said the simmulated drowning " was , is  and will always be  torture " .
Leahy , a Vermont Democrat , asked Mukasey if " waterboarding an American citizen , anywhere is illegal and torture , " but the nation 's top law enforcement officer punted .
" I understood what they said to have expressed their personal view .
The one thing that separates me from them , is that I 'm the Attorney General , and they 're not , " Mukasey said .
" When I pronounce on the reach of general legal principals , that is taken as a statement of how far those principals go . "
Mukasey also used Wednesday 's hearing to continue pressuring the Senate to pass a long - term expansion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and intervene in pending litigation against telephone and Internet providers .
On Tuesday , Congress passed a 15 - day extension to a temporary FISA update ( the Protect America Act ) as lawmakers work out differences over whether to grant legal immunity to telecommunications companies .
Mukasey said some 40 pending lawsuits against companies that handed over reams of data on Americans to US intelligence agencies , in apparent contravention of the law , would harm national security if they were allowed to proceed .
" It would continue to put the conduct of companies front and center , " Mukasey said .
His answer did not satisfy the panel 's ranking Republican , Pennsylvania Sen .
Arlen Specter , who has said the lawsuits should be allowed to proceed with the government as defendant to spare companies potential financial ruin .
" Why should n't that conduct be front and center ?
Why should n't it be subject to the challenge of an unlawful invasion of privacy ?
Why should the courts be foreclosed from making that decision ? "
Specter asked , noting that Congress 's oversight authority has been virtually castrated by Bush administration efforts to keep the details of its warrantless wiretapping program hidden .
" When this committee , under my chairmanship , tried to get the records of the telephone companies , " Specter explained , " Vice President Cheney went behind my back , contacted the members of the committee , Republican side , never even saw me , first or last .
What 's wrong with having that issue front - and - center and having a judicial inquiry and a judicial determination when this committee can't get that information ? "
Mukasey said the government needs to assure telecom companies that they would not put themselves in legal jeopardy by complying with " good faith " requests from the government to assist in surveillance ; that cooperation becomes even more important as technology increases , he said .
Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) , one of the harshest critics of the administration 's warrantless wiretapping , said he was disappointed that Mukasey seemed unwilling to establish more independence from the White House since assuming the role of attorney general in November .
" Another commitment you made at your confirmation hearing was that you would not be a ' yes man ' for the president .
...
On every issue you 've discussed ... you 've embraced the president 's or previous DoJ positions , apparently without reservation , " Feingold charged .
" I was hoping to see a little more evidence of independent judgment . "
DEVELOPING ...
This video is from C - SPAN , broadcast January 30 , 2008 .
Aldous Huxley 's inspired 1956 essay detailed the vivid , mind - expanding , multisensory insights of his mescaline adventures .
By altering his brain chemistry with natural psychotropics , Huxley tapped into a rich and fluid world of shimmering , indescribable beauty and power .
With his neurosensory input thus triggered , Huxley was able to enter that parallel universe described by every mystic and space captain in recorded history .
Whether by hallucination or epiphany , Huxley sought to remove all controls , all filters , all cultural conditioning from his perceptions and to confront Nature or the World or Reality first - hand - in its unpasteurized , unedited , unretouched , infinite rawness .
Those bonds are much harder to break today , half a century later .
We are the most conditioned , programmed beings the world has ever known .
Not only are our thoughts and attitudes continually being shaped and molded ; our very awareness of the whole design seems like it is being subtly and inexorably erased .
The doors of our perception are carefully and precisely regulated .
Who cares , right ?
It is an exhausting and endless task to keep explaining to people how most issues of conventional wisdom are scientifically implanted in the public consciousness by a thousand media clips per day .
In an effort to save time , I would like to provide just a little background on the handling of information in this country .
Once the basic principles are illustrated about how our current system of media control arose historically , the reader might be more apt to question any given popular opinion .
If everybody believes something , it 's probably wrong .
We call that Conventional Wisdom .
In America , conventional wisdom that has mass acceptance is usually contrived : somebody paid for it .
Examples : * Pharmaceuticals restore health * Vaccination brings immunity *
The cure for cancer is just around the corner * Menopause is a disease condition *
When a child is sick , he needs immediate antibiotics *
When a child has a fever he needs Tylenol * Hospitals are safe and clean .
* America has the best health care in the world .
* Americans have the best health in the world .
* Milk is a good source of calcium .
*
You never outgrow your need for milk .
* Vitamin C is ascorbic acid .
* Aspirin prevents heart attacks .
* Heart drugs improve the heart .
* Back and neck pain are the only reasons for spinal adjustment .
*
No child can get into school without being vaccinated .
*
The FDA thoroughly tests all drugs before they go on the market .
* Back and neck pain are the only reason for spinal adjustment .
* Pregnancy is a serious medical condition * Chemotherapy and radiation are effective cures for cancer *
When your child is diagnosed with an ear infection , antibiotics should be given immediately ' just in case ' *
Ear tubes are for the good of the child .
* Estrogen drugs prevent osteoporosis after menopause .
* Pediatricians are the most highly trained of al medical specialists .
*
The purpose of the health care industry is health .
* HIV is the cause of AIDS .
* AZT is the cure .
* Without vaccines , infectious diseases will return * Fluoride in the city water protects your teeth *
Flu shots prevent the flu .
* Vaccines are thoroughly tested before being placed on the Mandated Schedule .
* Doctors are certain that the benefits of vaccines far outweigh any possible risks .
*
There is a power shortage in California . *
There is a meningitis epidemic in California . *
The NASDAQ is a natural market controlled only by supply and demand .
* Chronic pain is a natural consequence of aging .
*
Soy is your healthiest source of protein .
* Insulin shots cure diabetes .
*
After we take out your gall bladder you can eat anything you want * Allergy medicine will cure allergies .
This is a list of illusions , that have cost billions and billions to conjure up .
Did you ever wonder why you never see the President speaking publicly unless he is reading ?
Or why most people in this country think generally the same about most of the above issues ?
HOW THIS WHOLE SET -UP GOT STARTED
In Trust Us We 're Experts , Stauber and Rampton pull together some compelling data describing the science of creating public opinion in America .
They trace modern public influence back to the early part of the last century , highlighting the work of guys like Edward L. Bernays , the Father of Spin .
From his own amazing chronicle Propaganda , we learn how Edward L. Bernays took the ideas of his famous uncle Sigmund Freud himself and applied them to the emerging science of mass persuasion .
The only difference was that instead of using these principles to uncover hidden themes in the human unconscious , the way Freudian psychology does , Bernays used these same ideas to mask agendas and to create illusions that deceive and misrepresent , for marketing purposes .
THE FATHER OF SPIN Bernays dominated the PR industry until the 1940s , and was a significant force for another 40 years after that .
( Tye ) During all that time , Bernays took on hundreds of diverse assignments to create a public perception about some idea or product .
A few examples :
As a neophyte with the Committee on Public Information , one of Bernays ' first assignments was to help sell the First World War to the American public with the idea to " Make the World Safe for Democracy . " ( Ewen ) A few years later , Bernays set up a stunt to popularize the notion of women smoking cigarettes .
In organizing the 1929 Easter Parade in New York City , Bernays showed himself as a force to be reckoned with .
He organized the Torches of Liberty Brigade in which suffragettes marched in the parade smoking cigarettes as a mark of women 's liberation .
Such publicity followed from that one event that from then on women have felt secure about destroying their own lungs in public , the same way that men have always done .
Bernays popularized the idea of bacon for breakfast .
Not one to turn down a challenge , he set up the advertising format along with the AMA that lasted for nearly 50 years proving that cigarettes are beneficial to health .
Just look at ads in issues of Life or Time from the 40s and 50s .
During the next several decades Bernays and his colleagues evolved the principles by which masses of people could be generally swayed through messages repeated over and over hundreds of times .
One the value of media became apparent , other countries of the world tried to follow our lead .
But Bernays really was the gold standard .
Josef Goebbels , who was Hitler 's minister of propaganda , studied the principles of Edward Bernays when Goebbels was developing the popular rationale he would use to convince the Germans that they had to purify their race .
( Stauber ) SMOKE AND MIRRORS Bernay 's job was to reframe an issue ; to create a desired image that would put a particular product or concept in a desirable light .
Bernays described the public as a ' herd that needed to be led . '
And this herdlike thinking makes people " susceptible to leadership . "
Bernays never deviated from his fundamental axiom to " control the masses without their knowing it . "
The best PR happens with the people unaware that they are being manipulated .
Stauber describes Bernays ' rationale like this : " the scientific manipulation of public opinion was necessary to overcome chaos and conflict in a democratic society . "
Trust Us p 42
These early mass persuaders postured themselves as performing a moral service for humanity in general - democracy was too good for people ; they needed to be told what to think , because they were incapable of rational thought by themselves .
Here 's a paragraph from Bernays ' Propaganda : " Those who manipulate the unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country .
We are governed , our minds molded , our tastes formed , our ideas suggested largely by men we have never heard of .
This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized .
Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society .
In almost every act of our lives whether in the sphere of politics or business in our social conduct or our ethical thinking , we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses .
It is they who pull the wires that control the public mind . "
A tad different from Thomas Jefferson 's view on the subject : " I know of no safe depository of the ultimate power of the society but the people themselves ; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise that control with a wholesome discretion , the remedy is not take it from them , but to inform their discretion . "
Inform their discretion .
Bernays believed that only a few possessed the necessary insight into the Big Picture to be entrusted with this sacred task .
And luckily , he saw himself as one of that few .
HERE COMES THE MONEY
Once the possibilities of applying Freudian psychology to mass media were glimpsed , Bernays soon had more corporate clients than he could handle .
Global corporations fell all over themselves courting the new Image Makers .
There were dozens of goods and services and ideas to be sold to a susceptible public .
Over the years , these players have had the money to make their images happen .
A few examples : Philip Morris Pfizer Union Carbide Allstate Monsanto Eli Lilly tobacco industry Ciba Geigy lead industry Coors DuPont Chlorox Shell Oil Standard Oil Procter & Gamble Boeing General Motors Dow Chemical General Mills Goodyear THE PLAYERS
Dozens of PR firms have emerged to answer that demand .
Among them : Burson - Marsteller Edelman Hill & Knowlton Kamer - Singer Ketchum Mongovin , Biscoe , and Duchin BSMG Buder - Finn
Though world - famous within the PR industry , these are names we do n't know , and for good reason .
The best PR goes unnoticed .
For decades they have created the opinions that most of us were raised with , on virtually any issue which has the remotest commercial value , including : pharmaceutical drugs vaccines medicine as a profession alternative medicine fluoridation of city water chlorine household cleaning products tobacco dioxin global warming leaded gasoline cancer research and treatment pollution of the oceans forests and lumber images of celebrities , including damage control crisis and disaster management genetically modified foods aspartame food additives ; processed foods dental amalgams LESSON # 1 Bernays learned early on that the most effective way to create credibility for a product or an image was by " independent third - party " endorsement .
For example , if General Motors were to come out and say that global warming is a hoax thought up by some liberal tree - huggers , people would suspect GM 's motives , since GM 's fortune is made by selling automobiles .
If however some independent research institute with a very credible sounding name like the Global Climate Coalition comes out with a scientific report that says global warming is really a fiction , people begin to get confused and to have doubts about the original issue .
So that 's exactly what Bernays did .
With a policy inspired by genius , he set up " more institutes and foundations than Rockefeller and Carnegie combined . "
( Stauber p 45 ) Quietly financed by the industries whose products were being evaluated , these " independent " research agencies would churn out " scientific " studies and press materials that could create any image their handlers wanted .
Such front groups are given high - sounding names like : Temperature Research Foundation International Food Information Council Consumer Alert The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition Air Hygiene Foundation Industrial Health Federation International Food Information Council Manhattan Institute Center for Produce Quality Tobacco Institute Research Council Cato Institute American Council on Science and Health Global Climate Coalition Alliance for Better Foods Sound pretty legit do n't they ?
CANNED NEWS RELEASES
As Stauber explains , these organizations and hundreds of others like them are front groups whose sole mission is to advance the image of the global corporations who fund them , like those listed on page 2 above .
This is accomplished in part by an endless stream of ' press releases ' announcing " breakthrough " research to every radio station and newspaper in the country .
( Robbins )
Many of these canned reports read like straight news , and indeed are purposely molded in the news format .
This saves journalists the trouble of researching the subjects on their own , especially on topics aboutwhich they know very little .
Entire sections of the release or in the case of video news releases , the whole thing can be just lifted intact , with no editing , given the byline of the reporter or newspaper or TV station - and voilá !
Instant news - copy and paste .
Written by corporate PR firms .
Does this really happen ?
Every single day , since the 1920s when the idea of the News Release was first invented by Ivy Lee. ( Stauber , p 22 ) Sometimes as many as half the stories appearing in an issue of the Wall St. Journal are based solely on such PR press releases .. ( 22 ) These types of stories are mixed right in with legitimately researched stories .
Unless you have done the research yourself , you wo n't be able to tell the difference .
THE LANGUAGE OF SPIN
As 1920s spin pioneers like Ivy Lee and Edward Bernays gained more experience , they began to formulate rules and guidelines for creating public opinion .
They learned quickly that mob psychology must focus on emotion , not facts .
Since the mob is incapable of rational thought , motivation must be based not on logic but on presentation .
Here are some of the axioms of the new science of PR : * technology is a religion unto itself * if people are incapable of rational thought , real democracy is dangerous * important decisions should be left to experts * when reframing issues , stay away from substance ; create images * never state a clearly demonstrable lie Words are very carefully chosen for their emotional impact .
Here 's an example .
A front group called the International Food Information Council handles the public 's natural aversion to genetically modified foods .
Trigger words are repeated all through the text .
Now in the case of GM foods , the public is instinctively afraid of these experimental new creations which have suddenly popped up on our grocery shelves which are said to have DNA alterations .
The IFIC wants to reassure the public of the safety of GM foods , so it avoids words like : Frankenfoods Hitler biotech chemical DNA experiments manipulate money safety scientists radiation roulette gene - splicing gene gun random Instead , good PR for GM foods contains words like : hybrids natural order beauty choice bounty cross- breeding diversity earth farmer organic wholesome .
It 's basic Freudian / Tony Robbins word association .
The fact that GM foods are not hybrids that have been subjected to the slow and careful scientific methods of real cross - breeding does n't really matter .
This is pseudoscience , not science .
Form is everything and substance just a passing myth .
( Trevanian )
Who do you think funds the International Food Information Council ?
Take a wild guess .
Right - Monsanto , DuPont , Frito - Lay , Coca Cola , Nutrasweet - those in a position to make fortunes from GM foods .
( Stauber p 20 ) CHARACTERISTICS
OF GOOD PROPAGANDA
As the science of mass control evolved , PR firms developed further guidelines for effective copy .
Here are some of the gems : - dehumanize the attacked party by labeling and name calling - speak in glittering generalities using emotionally positive words - when covering something up , do n't use plain English ; stall for time ; distract - get endorsements from celebrities , churches , sports figures , street people ... anyone who has no expertise in the subject at hand - the ' plain folks ' ruse : us billionaires are just like you - when minimizing outrage , do n't say anything memorable - when minimizing outrage , point out the benefits of what just happened - when minimizing outrage , avoid moral issues Keep this list .
Start watching for these techniques .
Not hard to find - look at today 's paper or tonight 's TV news .
See what they 're doing ; these guys are good !
SCIENCE FOR HIRE PR firms have become very sophisticated in the preparation of news releases .
They have learned how to attach the names of famous scientists to research that those scientists have not even looked at .
( Stauber , p 201 ) This is a common occurrence .
In this way the editors of newspapers and TV news shows are often not even aware that an individual release is a total PR fabrication .
Or at least they have " deniability , " right ?
Stauber tells the amazing story of how leaded gas came into the picture .
In 1922 , General Motors discovered that adding lead to gasoline gave cars more horsepower .
When there was some concern about safety , GM paid the Bureau of Mines to do some fake " testing " and publish spurious research that ' proved ' that inhalation of lead was harmless .
Enter Charles Kettering .
Founder of the world famous Sloan - Kettering Memorial Institute for medical research , Charles Kettering also happened to be an executive with General Motors .
By some strange coincidence , we soon have the Sloan Kettering institute issuing reports stating that lead occurs naturally in the body and that the body has a way of eliminating low level exposure .
Through its association with The Industrial Hygiene Foundation and PR giant Hill & Knowlton , Sloane Kettering opposed all anti-lead research for years .
( Stauber p 92 ) .
Without organized scientific opposition , for the next 60 years more and more gasoline became leaded , until by the 1970s , 90 % or our gasoline was leaded .
Finally it became too obvious to hide that lead was a major carcinogen , and leaded gas was phased out in the late 1980s .
But during those 60 years , it is estimated that some 30 million tons of lead were released in vapor form onto American streets and highways .
30 million tons .
That is PR , my friends .
JUNK SCIENCE
In 1993 a guy named Peter Huber wrote a new book and coined a new term .
The book was Galileo 's Revenge and the term was junk science .
Huber 's shallow thesis was that real science supports technology , industry , and progress .
Anything else was suddenly junk science .
Not surprisingly , Stauber explains how Huber 's book was supported by the industry - backed Manhattan Institute .
Huber 's book was generally dismissed not only because it was so poorly written , but because it failed to realize one fact : true scientific research begins with no conclusions .
Real scientists are seeking the truth because they do not yet know what the truth is .
True scientific method goes like this : 1 . form a hypothesis 2 . make predictions for that hypothesis 3 . test the predictions 4 . reject or revise the hypothesis based on the research findings Boston University scientist Dr. David Ozonoff explains that ideas in science are themselves like " living organisms , that must be nourished , supported , and cultivated with resources for making them grow and flourish . "
( Stauber p 205 ) Great ideas that do n't get this financial support because the commercial angles are not immediately obvious - these ideas wither and die .
Another way you can often distinguish real science from phony is that real science points out flaws in its own research .
Phony science pretends there were no flaws .
THE REAL JUNK SCIENCE Contrast this with modern PR and its constant pretensions to sound science .
Corporate sponsored research , whether it's in the area of drugs , GM foods , or chemistry begins with predetermined conclusions .
It is the job of the scientists then to prove that these conclusions are true , because of the economic upside that proof will bring to the industries paying for that research .
This invidious approach to science has shifted the entire focus of research in America during the past 50 years , as any true scientist is likely to admit .
Stauber documents the increasing amount of corporate sponsorship of university research .
( 206 ) This has nothing to do with the pursuit of knowledge .
Scientists lament that research has become just another commodity , something bought and sold .
( Crossen ) THE TWO MAIN TARGETS OF " SOUND SCIENCE "
It is shocking when Stauber shows how the vast majority of corporate PR today opposes any research that seeks to protect : Public Health and The Environment It 's a funny thing that most of the time when we see the phrase " junk science , " it is in a context of defending something that may threaten either the environment or our health .
This makes sense when one realizes that money changes hands only by selling the illusion of health and the illusion of environmental protection .
True public health and real preservation of the earth 's environment have very low market value .
Stauber thinks it ironic that industry 's self - proclaimed debunkers of junk science are usually non-scientists themselves .
( 255 ) Here again they can do this because the issue is not science , but the creation of images .
THE LANGUAGE OF ATTACK
When PR firms attack legitimate environmental groups and alternative medicine people , they again use special words which will carry an emotional punch : outraged sound science junk science sensible scaremongering responsible phobia hoax alarmist hysteria
The next time you are reading a newspaper article about an environmental or health issue , note how the author shows bias by using the above terms .
This is the result of very specialized training .
Another standard PR tactic is to use the rhetoric of the environmentalists themselves to defend a dangerous and untested product that poses an actual threat to the environment .
This we see constantly in the PR smokescreen that surrounds genetically modified foods .
They talk about how GM foods are necessary to grow more food and to end world hunger , when the reality is that GM foods actually have lower yields per acre than natural crops .
( Stauber p 173 )
The grand design sort of comes into focus once you realize that almost all GM foods have been created by the sellers of herbicides and pesticides so that those plants can withstand greater amounts of herbicides and pesticides .
( The Magic Bean ) THE MIRAGE OF PEER REVIEW Publish or perish is the classic dilemma of every research scientist .
That means whoever expects funding for the next research project had better get the current research paper published in the best scientific journals .
And we all know that the best scientific journals , like JAMA , New England Journal , British Medical Journal , etc. are peer - reviewed .
Peer review means that any articles which actually get published , between all those full color drug ads and pharmaceutical centerfolds , have been reviewed and accepted by some really smart guys with a lot of credentials .
The assumption is , if the article made it past peer review , the data and the conclusions of the research study have been thoroughly checked out and bear some resemblance to physical reality .
But there are a few problems with this hot little set up .
First off , money .
Even though prestigious venerable medical journals pretend to be so objective and scientific and incorruptible , the reality is that they face the same type of being called to account that all glossy magazines must confront : do n't antagonize your advertisers .
Those full - page drug ads in the best journals cost millions , Jack .
How long will a pharmaceutical company pay for ad space in a magazine that prints some very sound scientific research paper that attacks the safety of the drug in the centerfold ?
Think about it .
The editors are n't that stupid .
Another problem is the conflict of interest thing .
There 's a formal requirement for all medical journals that any financial ties between an author and a product manufacturer be disclosed in the article .
In practice , it never happens .
A study done in 1997 of 142 medical journals did not find even one such disclosure .
( Wall St. Journal , 2 Feb 99 )
While CNN et al. were busy going ga - ga over Mike Huckabee ’s trouncing of Mitt Romney et al. on the GOP side , Barack Obama was steadily putting a similar distance between himself and the rest of the Democrats in a state that is almost 95 % white .
Hopefully this at last provides a definitive answer to the dumbest question still being asked by corporate media : “ Is America ready for a black president ? ” Yes , America is ready .
Are the media ?
Are the other Democrats in the race ?
And for that matter , is the black Democratic establishment ?
You ’ll all be left behind .
Get with the times .
Here is Obama ’s compelling Iowa victory speech .
And while the caucus thingie was going on , GOP contender John McCain , who about tied for third among Republicans in Iowa , had something quite startling to say about Iraq while campaigning in New Hampshire today .
He interrupted someone recalling that President Bush envisions U.S. forces in Iraq for 50 more years with , “ Maybe a hundred [ years ] . ”
He continued , “ That ’s fine with me , I hope that would be fine with you , if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al - Qaeda is training and equipping and recruiting and motivating people every single day . ”
Video below .
Notice that “ Independent Democrat ” Sen .
Joe Lieberman is standing behind him .
David Corn asked McCain about his assertion afterward and says McCain told him American troops “ could be in Iraq for ‘ a thousand years ’ or ‘ a million years , ’ as far as he was concerned . ”
Hey , why not shoot for a googolplex , Senator ?
You gotta think big .
UPDATE 04 JAN 2008 : It ’s up to ten million years now , per the AP .
ADD’L ADD’L 04 JAN 2008 : McCain ’s also hip to having Lieberman “ play a part ” in his cabinet , “ particularly in national security issues . ”
The Macroeconomics of Love : A Valentine ’s Day Analysis
Who says there ’s no romance in macroeconomics ?
Betsey Stevenson and I are currently working on a paper for a forthcoming Brookings Panel , assessing the relationship between levels of economic development and various measures of subjective well - being .
We are working with an absolutely fabulous data set : the Gallup World Poll .
The good folks at Gallup are now surveying people in more than 130 countries every year .
And they are asking all sorts of interesting questions about subjective well - being .
In honor of Valentine ’s Day , let me give you a sneak peek of our findings on love and economic development .
It turns out that love is incredibly democratic , and is as common in poor countries as it is in rich countries .
And , encouragingly , about 70 percent of us report feeling a lot of love on any given day .
This is n’t as obvious as it may sound , as love ’s enemy , anger , is significantly more prevalent in poor countries than in rich .
The data suggest some interesting places to look for love : the Philippines , Rwanda , and Puerto Rico top the “ love tables . ”
Meanwhile those in Armenia , Uzbekistan , and Tajikistan are feeling the least love .
( Unfortunately , the love question was n’t asked in the United States . )
While subjective data are relatively new to economics , I ’m very excited by what we can learn , and will be sure to get back to you with more results as our research continues .
Now that we can measure something about Gross National Love , you can be sure that economists will start theorizing about it , and crunching these data to test their theories .
What is your theory of love , and how might we test it in the data ?

Minneapolis School Board unanimously restricts military recruiters
by Mikael Rudolph and Ann Galloway
The Minneapolis School Board last night voted unanimously to restrict military recruiters to school Career Centers , insisting that they had to apply in advance and sign in whenever they were on campus .
The decision also included the stipulation that other career groups advocating “ Peace ” or with other perspectives on military careers would have equal access .
Last night was supposed to be for the vote only because there were two previous meetings that involved testimony .
Unfortunately Recruiters in attendance had misunderstood that the board was voting to completely ban military recruiters from Minneapolis campuses .
One of the three Recruiters that showed up came forward to give testimony of how he was upset that the school board was banning recruiters .
The board stopped him and made clear that is not what is happening , explained the meaning of the resolution and how the process worked .
The board then re-opened the issue to discussion .
Two veterans spoke out strongly against the measure but they were greatly outnumbered by the many students present as well as two members of Veterans for Peace all of whom spoke passionately in favor of the restrictions .
Six of the board members gave their thoughts on the resolution and spoke of how impressed they were with the organizing and words of the students .
All seven members of the board voted in favor .
Here is the resolution as ratified :

designated location for such announcements in the school .
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED :

• Wing Suit Business :
At least a half - dozen groups in five countries are seriously engaged in the quest to show that man can fly through the air and land without a parachute , according to a December New York Times report .
" All of this is technically possible , " said a physics professor , referring to the wing suits fliers are testing .
" The thing I 'm not sure of is ... safety . "
Some wing suits have slowed vertical descent , briefly , to about 30 miles an hour , though the fliers were still moving horizontally at about 75 mph , which is why all testing is done with parachute backup .
American Jeb Corliss believes he could land , even at 120 mph , provided that his neck were protected by a sturdy - enough frame on the wing suit .

After Downing Street , David Swanson —
There ’s a new rule on Capitol Hill : the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee can remove impeachment from the Constitution , but cannot also use telephones , Email , or fax machines , because the flood of pro-impeachment communications from outraged citizens is overwhelming each of those devices .
Do n’t believe me ?
Try phoning , Emailing , or faxing John Conyers ’ office .
Congressman John Conyers ’ telephone , by many reports , rang endlessly on Monday , approximately 60 times per minute , or as fast as people could get through .
The same thing appears to be happening today ( Tuesday ) .
If you try to get through at 202- 225- 5126 , chances are you ’ll hear a busy signal .
Other times it will simply ring forever until a recorded voice tells you “ Your party is not answering , please try your call later . ”
Some people have had better luck by calling the Capitol Hill switchboard at 202-224-3121 or through one of the toll - free numbers that activist groups use , and asking to be connected to John Conyers ’ office .
Others have just run into busy signals that way too .
If you are lucky , you will get through to a staffer , and by all reports they are very , very cheerful staffers glad that you called , no matter where in the country you live .
Emailing the Congressman is out , because he has stopped accepting Emails , at least at this address [ email protected ]
I could tell you some of his staff members ’
Email addresses , but then they would n’t be able to work for a week .
Faxing the Congressman is very much in , but you have to set your fax machine to repeatedly redial until it gets through .
The fax number is 202-225-0072 .
You can also try these alternatives .
Call Conyers ’ Judiciary Committee office at 202-225-3951 .
Or call his Detroit , Mich. , office at 313-961-5670 or his Trenton , Mich. , office at 734-675-4084 .
If you do get through , be prepared to hear that impeachment hearings are not happening , but hearings into impeachable offenses are .
Even though these non-impeachment hearings will not make it onto television , and Conyers is not even announcing them ahead of time , and even though witnesses will refuse to show up , Conyers ’ staffers will try to tell you that hearings of the sort they ’ve done for the past 13 months are all that ’s needed .
Hmm .
If that were true , would the phone be ringing the way it is ?
Over 20 people are refusing to eat until Conyers begins impeachment hearings for Dick Cheney : http://afterdowningstreet.org/fasting
Nine members of the Judiciary Committee and dozens of members of Congress agree with the public that Conyers should perform his constitutional duty and begin impeachment hearings .
On Friday Congressman and Committee Member Robert Wexler will deliver a sign - on letter to Conyers urging him to begin Cheney impeachment hearings .
Tuesday evening Conyers has agreed to meet with Leslie Angeline to discuss the possibility .
Angeline is a member of Code Pink .
Her father was a rider on the original Freedom Ride bus that was fire bombed in Alabama in 1961 .
She is fasting for impeachment .
For her sake , if nothing else , set your phone on redial and have faith that you will get through .
Consider making it a daily routine .
Russia 's Top Traffic Cop Runs Over Woman
Viktor Kiryanov : " Hey , it happens everyday . "
As head of Russia 's Department of Transport Safety in the Interior Ministry , Viktor Kiryanov is the country 's top traffic cop , or " Glavnii Gaishnik . "
Given his title , it should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with Russia that yesterday afternoon , Kiryanov 's Mercedes ran over a woman while she was crossing the street in central Moscow .
It should also come as no surprise that according to the official account , it was all the pedestrian 's fault for getting in the way of Kiryanov 's Mercedes .
The head Gaishnik flattened the woman on Ulitsa Solyanka , just down the road from my house in a one - way street ( wonder which way Kiryanov was going ? ) .
Ambulances were immediately called to the scene , but the woman 's condition , or whereabouts , or is - she - alive - abouts , are still unknown .
What is known is the statement released by the Department of Transport Safety 's press secretary : " We 're all participants in road travel and no one is immune to events taking place on the road , not even the head of the GIBDD [ acronym for the traffic police department ] . "
According to gazeta.ru , a witness on the scene said that Kiryanov 's Mercedes ran a red and slammed right into the woman , who was walking in the crosswalk on a green light .
The witness said that Kiryanov 's car was traveling the wrong way down the one - way , a lane reserved only for trolleybuses , and that her body was tangled up in the rear of the Mercedes when he ran up to see what had happened .
He described the woman as " seriously injured " and said her forehead was covered in blood .
In reply , the GIBDD 's press spokeswoman , Alena Yaroschenko , shot back , " Why ca n't you consider the possibility that the pedestrian caused the accident ? "
That 's right , so the next time you 're forced to cough up a bribe to the GAIshnik , just remember , they 're only human , just like …well , not like you and me , but like other high - flying bureaucrats to whom the law does n't apply ( such as Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov 's son Alexander , who did a few donuts on a 68 - year - old babushka 's body as she crossed the street , but as it turned out , legally it was her fault for dying in his axles ! ) .
Sure , it may be true that they 're never at fault for any car accident , but just because a humble bureaucrat like Mr. Kiryanov is n't ever at fault for flat - caking some hapless pedestrian , it does n't mean he 's immune from the hassle of having to wash said babushka's blood off of his Mercedes grill , or picking her brains out from his U - joint .
O , the humanity !

AN APOLOGY :
Cracked.com contributor Tim Cameron , with the help of Betty Gluckin and a large chunk of the Cracked forum produced the song and video for " Scientology Is ... Nice " , based on what Tim claimed was a six month - long investigation into the organization .
We gladly accepted the work based on the title alone .
Now , having actually listened to it , there has erupted a bitter debate among Cracked .com staff .
One side described it as " disgusting " and " juvenile , " and stated it should never see the light of day on the site .
The other side believed that it should not only never see the light of day , but that it was in fact a " cancerous blight on the very face of civilization " that , if not obliterated , " would render all previous human cultural achievement into a corrupted filth equivalent to the scrapings from the scrotum of Satan himself . "
Indeed , in the wake of our release of the song and video ( and we cannot do otherwise , due to contractual obligation with Mr. Cameron ) we expect a rich discourse about just how much disgust should be heaped upon it .
We welcome this discussion , and offer our apologies .
Oh , and in case you missed anything , here are the lyrics .
I must say , I love this day and age where information flows freely .
I remember back ( what , ten years ago ? ) when I took magazine and / or newspaper subscriptions seriously .
There were ( are ) so many , and they all cost money .
Which ones should I subscribe to ?
Which are worth the time of sifting through pages to find what I really want ?
But now , finding information to stay up - to - date on your news or hobbies ?
Who spends time actually searching for information they used to get in a magazine or newspaper ?
I know I do n’t .
It ’s almost in front of me before I ’m ready for it ; I ’m still catching up with what ’s considered olds news because it ’s been a couple days .
Sites like Techmeme or Google News aggregate it for me .
Combine that with my favorite RSS feeds via Google Reader ( all of which are free daily updates of what I used to pay for via magazines or newspapers ) and I have some good , quality information that interests me .
But when was the last time I read a book ?
I ca n’t remember ; I ’m too busy reading magazines and newspapers ( or the Internet , which sounds worse ?
It ’s really the same thing ) .
I used to love reading books , but now I feel like they ’re extremely long , time consuming , and lack variety ( remember that most of what I read now is by a different author every page or two ) .
I ’m not saying this with pride .
In fact , it ’s a little embarrassing .
Not enough to keep me from posting it publicly , though .
I ’m curious to know if others have experienced this or a flavor of it .
Does the Internet cause you to read books less ?

Being fit helps you live longer - even when you 're fat , an American study has found .
Striking findings show the fittest fat men and women aged 60 and over are more likely to live to a ripe old age than their averagely weighted or slim - and less fit - peers .
The message seems to contradict current anxieties about an obesity epidemic and constant messages to lose weight .
But U.S. researchers led by Dr Steven Blair claim all older people , including those who are obese , can benefit from increasing their activity levels .
Their study , published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , assessed the fitness of 2,600 adults aged 60 or older and measured their Body Mass Index - an obesity indicator - and percentage body fat .
Over 12 years , 450 died and researchers found they had lower fitness levels than the survivors , regardless of BMI .
Dr Blair said : " We observed that fit obese individuals had a lower risk of all - cause mortality than did unfit , normalweight or lean individuals .
" It may be possible to reduce all - cause death rates among older adults by promoting regular physical activity - such as brisk walking for 30 minutes or more most days . "
Intel czar admits new surveillance law did not foil terror plot Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday September 12 , 2007
Print This Email This Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell has withdrawn his claim that Congress 's recent authorization of expanded electronic surveillance had helped foil a terror plot in Germany .
According to Newsweek 's Michael Isikoff and Mark Hosenball , McConnell testified to Sen .
Joe Lieberman on Monday that the new law " helped ' facilitate ' the arrest of three suspects believed to be planning massive car bombings against American targets in Germany . "
Intelligence officials quickly raised questions about McConnell 's testimony , indicating that the US military had provided the information to the Germans 10 months ago , long before the new law was passed .
Democrats then challenged McConnell 's statement , with House Judiciary Chair John Conyers requesting a clarification and House Intelligence Committee Chair Silvestre Reyes sending McConnell a letter asking for a public correction .
The letter read , in part , " While revising FISA may provide a tool that could enhance future operations , it was not in play in the Germany case .
In fact , FISA , which you repeatedly claim is ' outdated , ' was precisely the tool that helped disrupt this plot . "
McConnell has now issued a statement adjusting his testimony , and Democrats , who had already complained about being stampeded into passing the new law just before their August recess , are charging him with playing politics on behalf of the White House .
The surveillance law was passed on an emergency basis and is due to expire after six months , and McConnell 's testimony had been seen as a strong argument for its continued authorization .
Letter : GOP Whip Roy Blunt assails House Democrats over FISA RAW STORY
Published : Saturday February 16 , 2008
|
Print This Email This ALSO SEE : Democratic Rep. Silvestre Reyes ' refusal to acquiesce Today , House Minority Whip Roy Blunt ( R - MO ) has released the following letter in regards to the sunset of the Protect America Act : ####
At midnight tonight , a critical national security law will expire .
It is set to expire , because House Democratic leaders blatantly refused to take up bipartisan , Senate legislation that would have closed a dangerous terrorist loophole .
The consequence is that our intelligence community will lose its ability to affectively and quickly listen to terrorist communications .
This is no exaggeration .
The Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General of the United States , in a letter to the Senate Majority Leader earlier this year , wrote that if the Congress failed to act our ability to obtain intelligence information would be weakened .
This same message was sent by the Democratic Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee who said on the Senate floor Thursday ' that the quality of the intelligence we are going to be receiving is going to be degraded . '
The issue at hand is over legal protection for telecommunications companies that helped our government in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks intercept foreign terrorist communications .
This lack of protection has already hurt our ability to gather intelligence  and it will only get worse .
As companies fear being dragged into the court room , they will stop their activities in support of tracking terrorists .
I am angry that the House did not consider this bill .
And House Democrats should be angry as well .
The Democratic leadership allowed our intelligence gathering to be compromised , because they failed to pass a bill by a deadline that they themselves set .
Some allege that there is no urgency .
I wholeheartedly disagree .
With each passing day , our intelligence capacity grows dimmer and dimmer and the less able we are to track a call or intercept an email into the United States from someone like Osama Bin Laden .
Our nation should not be in this situation .
The Houses failure to act is a gross dereliction of our constitutional duty to stand for the nations defense . #
The Pentagon insists the three vessels were in international waters Five Iranian speedboats harassed three US navy ships at the weekend , approaching them and radioing a threat to blow them up , US officials say .
The incident happened in the Strait of Hormuz , a major oil shipping route .
The US said their ships were about to open fire when the Iranian boats withdrew .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called the Iranian action " provocative and dangerous " .
Iran played down the event , describing it as an " ordinary occurrence " .
Iranian TV coverage of the incident " This ... happens for the two sides every once in a while and , after the identification of the two sides , the issue is resolved , " foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said .
Official media also reported the US statement about Iran 's allegedly threatening behaviour with scepticism , implying that Washington was exaggerating the incident .
' Serious provocation '
The speedboats , believed to belong to Iran 's Revolutionary Guards , came within about 200m of the US vessels , Pentagon officials said .
" I am coming at you .
You will explode in a couple of minutes , " the Iranians said in a radio transmission , according to US officials .
The Iranian boats were operating at " distances and speeds that showed reckless , dangerous and potentially hostile intent , " said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman .
He said at least some of the boats were visibly armed .
At one point the speedboats dropped floating " box - like objects " , the US navy commander in the region , Vice Adm Kevin Cosgriff said .
US sailors assumed battle stations and the captain on one of the ships was about to order an attack when the Iranian boats turned away , US officials said .
The confrontation , which occurred at about 0400 local time on Sunday or late on Saturday in Washington , lasted about 20 minutes , according to the US .
The Pentagon has insisted that the three US vessels - identified as navy cruiser USS Port Royal , destroyer USS Hopper and frigate USS Ingraham - were in international waters .
INCIDENT TIMELINE
Five Iranian speedboats " swarm " US ships at about 0400 GMT US ships receive radio call threatening to blow them up US ships radio Iranian speedboats and sound ships ' whistles Speedboats approach within 200 metres of US ships US ships ready their guns Speedboats depart , no shots fired Source : Pentagon and US Navy officials Although Tehran dismissed the incident as routine , Ms Rice told the BBC's Arabic service in an interview there was nothing normal about it .
" At least I hope that 's not what the Iranians consider to be normal behaviour , because it was provocative , and that kind of provocation is dangerous and I would sincerely hope that the Iranians would refrain from any such activity . "
The incident follows a row that erupted last March when Iranian Revolutionary Guards captured 15 British sailors and held them for nearly two weeks .
Iran said the crew had strayed into Iranian waters , a claim which Britain disputed .
The Revolutionary Guards , set up in 1979 to defend the country 's Islamic system , has been designated by the US as a " proliferator of weapons of mass destruction " .
Ready to respond
The latest confrontation comes as US President George Bush is to begin a tour of the Middle East on Wednesday .
Long - standing US - Iranian tensions remain over Iran 's nuclear programme , although these have been somewhat reduced since the US intelligence community released a report in late 2007 that said Iran had stopped its nuclear weapons programme in 2003 .
The BBC's Paul Reynolds says the key question is whether this is a one - off incident or whether it heralds a more aggressive stance by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards .
The latter policy would be unexpected , given the lowering of tension over the nuclear issue , he says , but as the incident of the captured British naval personnel showed , tensions are always high .
There is no doubt that the US is ready to respond , our correspondent adds .

A group of American firefighters opposed to Rudy Giuliani , the Republican front - runner in the 2008 presidential race , are planning to run damaging adverts expressing scepticism about his 9/11 leadership .
The deputy New York fire chief , Jim Riches , whose son , also a firefighter , was killed in the Twin Towers ' collapse , said : " TV made him a hero , and we 'll use TV to take him down . "
Riches and other New York firefighters have been voicing opposition to Giuliani , mayor of the city on 9/11 , since he launched his campaign for the Republican nomination earlier this year .
But they are now seeking to set up an official organisation that will fund television adverts in a campaign similar to the one that undermined John Kerry in 2004 , the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , which challenged his Vietnam record .
The organisation would also include the families of 9/11 victims .
Giuliani is running his campaign on the back of the largely favourable media he received at the time , with his leadership in New York contrasting with President George Bush 's hesitancy .
But the firefighters and victims ' families complain that Giuliani failed to heed the warning of an attack on the World Trade Centre almost a decade earlier .
The firefighters also say the crews had poor radios and , as a result , some did not hear calls to evacuate the site .
Families accuse Giuliani of rushing the clear - up of Ground Zero , denying them the chance to exhaust the search for bodies .
There is unease , too , that Giuliani is using 9/11 as a political platform .
Riches told ABC News : " We do n't want him running on 9/11 or the bodies of all these dead people or my dead son saying that he did a great job that day . "
The group is planning trips to Iowa and other key states voting in caucuses and primaries in January to campaign against Giuliani .
The former mayor , who has a clear poll lead over his Republican rivals nationally , had initially decided to concentrate on big states such as California .
But fearful of his main rivals gaining unstoppable momentum by wins in Iowa and other key places , Giuliani 's team has been building up a network in the state .
PRIVACY is a thorny issue .
And the level of intrusion by the state in the private lives of its citizens differs from country to country .
In recent years terrorist threats have driven many governments to enact laws that erode privacy .
Technological advances have made this job all the easier .
Countries with fewer enemies , or less cash , tend to afford their citizens more privacy .
The result is that the world is becoming a less private place , though not necessarily any safer .
Comments are welcome on The Economist 's online security v privacy debate , the first of a series on digital freedom .

The Liberty Team * A hallmark , is a mark struck on precious metal items to identify its distinguishing characteristic .
Historically , hallmarks were applied by a trusted party such as the assay office to guarantee a certain weight or fineness of the metal .
From ancient Byzantine hallmarks to the Vienna Hallmark Convention in 1973 , hallmark have been used to mark the fineness and unique characteristics on precious metal items .
Such is the case with the hallmarked 2008 Liberty Dollar and the " Arrest Dollar " with the " Handcuffs " hallmark .
Near the summit of Cerro Galera in Panama lives a golden beetle that can turn itself brick red in under two minutes .
While other bugs may change color due to external circumstances like temperature , the Panamanian tortoise beetle is one of the few creatures known to control its own color changing .
The beetle ’s secret ?
It can alter the flow of fluid in its exoskeleton , scientists recently revealed .
The key lies in the way light reflects off the beetle ’s exoskeleton , which consists of 20 to 40 layers .
When light of different wavelengths bounces off the multiple layers , the beetle displays its normal golden sheen — but only when the porous patches within the layers are wet .
When the beetle dries out its exoskeleton , the light no longer bounces off evenly , foiling the shiny , golden , mirrorlike effect .
Instead , light reflects off the layers in such a way that the shell becomes translucent , revealing red pigment beneath .
Researchers do not know the purpose of the color change but they suspect it might scare off predators by mimicking a poisonous insect .
Jean - Pol Vigneron , a physicist from the University of Namur in Belgium who is studying the beetle , says , “ The beetle teaches us that there is a possibility to develop materials that dramatically change color with humidity . ”
Among them : flowerpots whose color warns when the soil is drying out , blackboards using water instead of chalk that could be erased by a pulse of heat , and even cars that change color in the rain .
During the CNN Debate tonight , as in other debates , Ron Paul continued to assert that America is going bankrupt .
Another issue he mentions often is monetary policy .
Most voters have no idea how important these issues are to them because they understand monetary policy about as well as they understand our million page tax code .
Just as the misunderstanding of that tax code can cost a citizen some money on tax day , a misunderstanding of monetary policy could cost us all of our money some day soon which is what Ron Paul means when he talks about America going bankrupt .
Below is a reposting of the majority of an article I published earlier called “ Ron Paul : A Man Among Boys ” that several thousand people have found useful in understanding this issue .
I decided to republish it today because of the debate .
This issue of monetary policy is n't discussed openly because it does n't resonate with voters the way issues like “ free health care ” or “ securing our borders ” , “ protecting us from terrorists ” , “ mortgage crisis ” , or “ national healthcare ” do .
How many Americans even realize that the U.S. dollar is worth less than a Canadian Dollar ?
Using the Canadian Dollar as the benchmark , how many people know that after the terrorist attacks on 9/11 the dollar was stronger than it was in 2000 ?
How many people realize that in 2002 , when the war in Iraq began , the value of our dollar began to decrease ?
It has n't stopped its decline since , and is now reaching historical lows .
As the data in the chart below indicates , it was n't the attacks of 9/11 that destroyed our dollar , it was our response to them coupled with our monetary policy in general which make things like an “ Economic Stimulus Package ” seem like a good idea .
Historic Exchange Rates
How many Americans fail to see the connection ?
How many people in our country do n't seem to understand why this matters ?
And most imporantly , how many presidential candidates are even discussing this issue ?
Ron Paul 's economic and monetary ideology are typically a punchline at best among political pundits with the level of sophistication along these lines :
“ Ron Paul wants to go back to the gold standard .
What 's next ?
Reducing dependency on foreign oil by getting rid or our cars and riding horses ? ”
These pundits are also starting to claim that Ron Paul offers a lot of ideology , but no practical real world solutions to the problems facing America .
These blanket statements influence common voters tremendously in a time when “ practical real world solution ” has become synonomous with “ government entitlement program . ”
These very real solutions RonPaul supports are hard to grasp for the typical American who has little understanding of economic theory , monetary policy , or interest of anything foreign outside of why Europeans insist on calling soccer “ football . ”
They were probably watching football when the ABC debate was on a few weeks ago when Ron Paul was discussing gas prices remaining flat vs. gold but increasing drastically vs. the dollar .
These same people are depending on Social Security for retirement and are scared to death that when they hear these political experts tell them that “ Ron Paul wants to end Social Security . ”
Below is my humble attempt at explaining this complicated issue in a way the person I just described can easily understand .
Once understood , this person will also be able to see that the sky may indeed be falling , and that contrary to public opinion Ron Paul is the only candidate running on a platform that would SAVE Social Security until our country was healthy and prosperous enough that it was no longer needed ( which very likely would not be during Paul 's administration even if he were to become a two term president ) .
Monetary Policy and Consequences For Dummies ( like me )
Let 's assume that everyone in America could print their own money .
Or to make it easier , they could just go online to their personal checking account , type in whatever dollar amount they wanted , and that would be how much money had in the bank .
How much would a dollar then be worth ?
This is easy .
It would be worth next to nothing because what $ 1 once bought , it would now take millions to purchase the same good or service because there would be so many dollars .
But let 's change the scenario a little .
Let 's say that this creating of money out of thin air was introduced state by state in alphabetical order .
In other words , only residents of Alabama could print money for the first month , then Alaskans could join in a month later , then Arizona residents and so forth .
Who would benefit the most ?
The Alabamans would .
By the time Wyoming got into the mix , it probably would n't even be worth the bother .
In other words , the people who benefit under a system like this are the people who get to use the newly created money first .
Individuals in our country can't print their own money , but there is a private bank that can .
It 's called the Federal Reserve .
And they do .
And then they lend it to our government with interest .
There are nearly 26 dollars in circulation now for every 1 dollar in circulation in 1959 .
And the rate of printing this money is increasing .
In 2007 alone we printed more dollars than the total amount that existed in 1963 .
While the number of dollars has increased 26 fold , the population has n't even doubled over that same period .
Of course this works out fine for the government .
They get to spend the money first .
And it works out well for the special interest contractors who receive the money .
They are like Alaskans in our example .
The people are Wyoming .
To bring this down to simpler terms which also illustrates the long term consequences of this issue , when many families receive a new credit card in the mail , they feel as if they have “ free money . ”
So they spend it .
And then get another credit card .
Then they max out that card too .
And so it goes until they can no longer meet the minimum payments or get a new card .
When the creditors come calling , there are three ways they can pay off the debt .
One is to raise income .
But that is very difficult for an individual to do .
Another is to borrow money from grandma .
The third is to cut spending on things that the kids really loved and that may have seemed “ necessary ” when the “ free money ” was rolling in , but suddenly does n't seem as much so when the family is facing losing its car or home .
If they can't get more money , get it from grandma , or cut enough spending to pay the debt , they are forced to go bankrupt and then lose everything that really was important to them .
What is the connection here ?
The government has a never ending stream of “ free money ” printed by the Federal Reserve .
As you hopefully now understand , this “ free money ” hurts the individual citizen by devaluing his dollar .
Eventually this debt has to be repaid .
How can this happen ?
Unlike the individual citizen , the government can raise its income rather easily .
This is accomplished by raising taxes .
The second is to borrow from Granny .
The name of the Federal Government 's most benevolent Grandmother is China .
Although Granny may claim she expects the money back , China actually does –with interest .
What happens when Granny cuts us offand wants her money back ?
Well , the individual 's granny does n't have a Nuclear Option to help her collect like our Government 's Granny does .
The third is to cut spending on things we just can't afford .
No matter how much the “ kids ” may like things like supporting foreign countries , propping up dictators to make us “ safe from terrorists ” , testing children annually to make sure they are n't left behind , providing Federal grants to send people to college , or the idea of free health care ; if we do n't give those things up we wo n't even be able to afford the things we really need –like a way to defend ourselves should Granny China decides to use a nuclear option , of either sort , to collect what she 's owed .
Ron Paul is the only candidate to offer a solution to this problem .
The first step is to stop activating all of those new credit cards .
This is why he would end the Federal Reserve ( or at least make its actions more transparent by having their now secret meeting televised ) and offers radical ideas like making sure our dollar is actually worth something .
The second is to cut out spending no matter how unpopular it is or how much the kids may cry about it .
None of this may seem like a major issue right now .
In fact , it does n't seem bad at all .
We are living the high life .
The “ leading ” GOP candidates are like the dads who earn 60,000 ( fiat pre-tax ) dollars who live in the suburbs , live in a house with an interest only adjustable rate mortgage , and “ own ” two import SUV's while mom stays at home because it's “ best for the kids . ”
There is nothing that they can't afford for their family as long as the credit cards keep rolling in .
They just smile and nod and keep promising more .
This does n't seem like a big deal either .
They are living the high life .
At least until the cards are all maxed ; the collection agencies start calling ; their credit score goes down ; the interest rate gets adjusted upward ; they can't afford the mortgage ; the bank forecloses ; and mom leaves with the kids to go live with grandma and grandpa in the house they paid off in 7 years because they did n't believe in being a mooch , borrowing money , or being in debt .
Can you say “ mortgage crisis ” ?
Ron Paul is that wise old grandpappy who kept getting laughed at and called an old - timer who did n't understand how the modern world worked when herepeatedly toldhis daughter her family needed to learn to live below its means .
The best way to prevent foreclosure is foresight .
Ron Paul 's foresight would not only help us get lower gas prices by restoring the dollar 's value , it would help us stave off bankruptcy or a nuclear attack by China .
When you grow up and understand this issue , it kinda makes the “ major issues ” like national healthcare and terrorism seem about as significant as that pimple you had on prom night does n't it ?
Update : Today when the Fed lowered rates ( printed more money ) for the second time in barely a week , the dollar 's value fell a half a percent .
In ONE day .
And the Price of Gold “ increased ” $ 15 dollars .
In other words , it took $ 15 more dollars to buy the same amount of gold today than it did yesterday–not because gold is worth more , but because your dollar is worth less .
Comforting , huh ?
Your fellow American ,
John Armstrong

Dr. Robert Jarvik is best known for the artificial heart he pioneered more than a quarter - century ago .
Since then he had toiled in relative obscurity  until he began appearing in television ads two years ago for the Pfizer cholesterol drug Lipitor .
The ads have depicted him , among other outdoorsy pursuits , rowing a one - man racing shell swiftly across a mountain lake .
“ When diet and exercise are n’t enough , adding Lipitor significantly lowers cholesterol , ” Dr. Jarvik says in the ad .
Celebrity advertising endorsements are nothing new , of course .
But the Lipitor campaign is a rare instance of a well - known doctor ’s endorsing a drug in advertising  and it has helped rekindle a smoldering debate over whether it is appropriate to aim ads for prescription drugs directly at consumers .
A Congressional committee , concerned that the Lipitor ads could be misleading , has said it wants to interview Dr. Jarvik about his role as the drug ’s pitchman .
Top Movies Never to Reach Number One at the Domestic Box Office Chart

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A liberal Democrat ’s attempt to impose quick U.S. troop withdrawals from Iraq collapsed in the U.S. Senate , as expected , but leaders on Thursday insisted they will retool legislation and force votes in coming months .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
The Senate spent much of this week debating a plan by Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin to begin withdrawing most American troops from Iraq by July .
His effort , like one last December , faced deep opposition in the chamber , where members have repeatedly blocked steps to impose timetables for winding down a war that is entering its sixth year .
Senate leaders pulled the bill from debate when it was obvious there was not support for passage .
“ We ’ll be back .
There are a number of things we ’re considering , ” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat , told reporters in acknowledging Feingold ’s measure was doomed .
In a month or so , Congress is expected to begin debating President George W. Bush ’s request for more money for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars .
In the past , Democrats have tried to tie conditions to the funds , including withdrawal timetables .
The next congressional debate on the Iraq war could come in April or May as the U.S. presidential campaigns intensify .
By then , Sen. John McCain of Arizona , an Iraq war advocate , likely will have nailed down his spot as the Republican Party ’s presidential nominee .
And Democrats may have decided whether Illinois Sen. Barack Obama , an opponent of the war , or New York Sen. Hillary Clinton , who voted for the war but now opposes it , will be their presidential nominee .
Republicans used this week ’s Senate floor debate to highlight progress of Bush ’s troop surge , which has quelled violence even as Iraq ’s political leaders continue to face difficult challenges .
The White House warned it would veto the troop - withdrawal legislation , sticking with its argument that Congress should not impose any artificial timetables on the war , which has resulted in the deaths of nearly 4,000 U.S. troops .
The White House also threatened to veto another Feingold bill pending in the Senate that would require the administration to craft , within 60 days , a new plan for defeating al Qaeda , which is accused of the September 11 attacks on the United States .
The administration said the measure could impose constraints on the U.S. military “ hindering the flexibility of our commanders . ”
Reid also said a Senate panel will investigate fraud and waste in contracts awarded to private firms working in Iraq .
He added that senators are looking at other measures to rein in the war and the huge debt it has placed on the U.S. treasury .
Democrats , who control the Senate , increasingly are tying the war to domestic economic problems , which are high on voters ’ minds this year .
Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz , a Columbia University economics professor and former advisor to President Bill Clinton , told a congressional panel on Thursday that the war has contributed to substantially higher oil prices and required more foreign borrowing by the United States since Bush and the Congress have not raised taxes or cut spending to pay for the combat .
Rackspace , known for its 100 % uptime guarantee , had problems last night when servers in their Dallas data center had to be taken offline for a couple of hours .
The reason for the outage was a car accident where a truck drove into a power transformer , which exploded .
This caused a major power disruption .
When Rackspace ’s backup power kicked in , two chillers failed to start .
To prevent overheating , Rackspace took a number of servers offline , including servers for 37signals , GigaOM , WebmasterWorld and LaughingSquid .
Om Malik , editor of GigaOM , one of the affected sites , made the following observation :
Everything seems to be back to normal , but it leaves me with one simple observation : our Internet infrastructure despite all the talk is fragile as a fine porcelain cup on the roof of a car zipping across a pot - holed goat track .
A single truck driver can take out sites like 37 Signals out in a snap .
In other words : Murphy ’s Law in action .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N , the largest U.S. consumer electronics chain , said on Monday it will recommend that consumers choose Sony Corp 's 6758 .
T Blu-ray high - definition video format .
The decision gives Sony yet another victory in the battle with Toshiba Corp 's 6502 .
T HD DVD to be the high - definition DVD format of choice .
Earlier on Monday , online video rental company Netflix Inc NFLX.
O said it would exclusively stock Blu-ray DVDs after some of the world 's biggest movie studios decided in favor of that format .
Best Buy said it believes consumers will benefit from the choice of one HD DVD format .
“ Because we believe that Blu-ray is fast emerging as that single format , we have decided to focus on Blu-ray products , ” Brian Dunn , Best Buy ’s president and chief operating officer , said in a statement .
Best Buy will prominently feature Blu-ray hardware and software beginning in March , but will also carry an assortment of HD DVD products for customers who want those , Best Buy said .
First came direct marketing , then focus groups .
Now , advertisers , with the help of neuroscientists , are closing in on the holy grail : mind reading .
At least , that ’s what is suggested in a paper published today in the journal Human Brain Mapping authored by a group of professors in advertising and communication and neuroscience at the University of Florida .
The seven researchers used sophisticated brain - scanning technology to record how subjects ’ brains responded to television advertisements , while simultaneously collecting the subjects ’ reported impressions of the ads .
By comparing the two resulting data sets , they say , they pinned down specific locations in the brain as the seat of many familiar emotions that ripple throughout it .
The feat is another step toward gauging how people feel directly through functional magnetic resonance imaging , or fMRI , and other brain - scanning technology — without relying on what they claim to be feeling , the researchers say .
“ We are getting to the heart of the matter by really showing this process in the brain , and how it works , ” said Jon Morris , a professor of advertising and communications and lead author of the article .
“ We feel that this can be used to find out what people really feel about something , whether an advertisement or any other stimulus . ”
Using MRI or fMRI – the former creates internal images of the brain , while the latter tracks blood flow within the brain — to test consumers ’ responses to advertisements or other stimuli is not new .
But according to the study , much of the previous research has found that , for example , responses to pleasant or unpleasant stimuli occurred throughout many regions of the brain , rather than in one specific location .
As a result , the technique seemed of limited usefulness : Analysts could gauge only general response activity , not specific emotions .
“ There was no real key happiness center , no key sad center , no key love center , ” Morris said .
“ What you got was brain activity , in general . ”
The UF team used an elaborate experimental system , currently under consideration for a patent , to try to narrow the search .
Because metallic or magnetic material can cause fMRI machines to malfunction , no television or sound equipment was allowed in the cylinder - like fMRI machines into which people are inserted .
As a result , the researchers deployed a series of projections and mirrors to allow subjects to watch commercials .
Sound reached them via tiny plastic pipes , similar to headphones once common on airplanes , rather than wires .
The 12 subjects also had hand - held devices that enabled them to report their feelings via a system called “ Attitude Self Assessment Manikins ” a version of the UF - developed Self - Assessment Manikin , or “ SAM . ”
The “ AdSAM ” system lets viewers describe how they are feeling and the strength of those feelings by clicking on projections of people - like icons , a process that Morris characterized as more direct than translating feelings into words .
Morris uses the AdSAM system in his work as a consultant to advertisers .
Researchers showed the subjects three television commercials advertising Coke , Evian and Gatorade , respectively , as well as an anti-fur commercial and an ad promoting teaching .
To guard against preconditioned response , all the ads were at least 10 years old .
The researchers compared the activity in the subjects ’ brains as recorded by the fMRI machines to their reported responses on the AdSAM system .
With several of the ads , they found the fMRI data and response converged on two of three measures — pleasure - displeasure and excitement - calm .
Under the AdSAM system , these “ bipolar dimensions ” — as well as a third , dominance - submissiveness — form the foundation for more specific emotions .
Where the researchers compared the AdSAM data on pleasure - displeasure and excitement - calm to the fMRI data , they found simultaneous spikes in four different and highly localized areas of the brain .
According to the article , the findings suggest “ that human emotions are multidimensional , and that self - report techniques … correspond to a specific task but different functional regions of the brain . ”
Morris said the results are preliminary , but that follow - up studies could allow researchers to hone in on people ’s feelings with great specificity .
That would be attractive to advertisers for obvious reasons , but psychologists might also find the techniques useful .
“ Back in the 1950s , three psychologists found that all emotions could be measured in three dimensions , ” Morris said .
” Now we have learned that this may be more than a method for reporting emotion .
It may actually reflect the way creatures on this planet function – possibly exposing a direct link to predicting behavior . ”
It ’s looking like Arizona is getting ready to join Washington and Maine and strike yet another blow against the ill - conceived REAL ID Act :
The state Senate is poised to approve a bill to bar Arizona from participating in a federal program that would create a standardized national identification card .
The move comes as the federal Real ID
Act is getting strong resistance from states nationwide .
Earlier this week , the Washington state Senate voted to delay participation in the program pending more - specific guidelines , and last week , the federal Homeland Security Department announced it would delay its effective date for two years , to the end of 2009 .
In Arizona , Senate Bill 1152 would prevent the state from taking part in the national standards for state - issued driver ’s licenses and identification cards .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks tanked Tuesday , after a report showing a big slowdown in the services sector of the economy and cautionary comments from a Fed governor amplified fears that a recession is underway or imminent .
According to early tallies , the Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) lost about 370 points , seeing its worst single session on a point basis in over three months .
The decline equaled a drop of 2.9 % .
The broader Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index lost 44 points , its worst single - day point loss since last August .
The decline equaled a drop of 2.9 % .
The Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) fell 73 points and saw its worst single - day point loss since mid-October .
The decline equaled a drop of 2.6 % .
" The pebble in the pond this morning was the ISM report and then the comments from [ Fed governor ]
Lacker came out and that kind of pushed people over the edge , " said Kim Caughey , senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Partners .
Stocks tumbled in January , with the Nasdaq seeing its worst start to the year ever , on fears that the credit and housing market crises will send the economy into recession , if it is n't there already .
After such a steep decline , stocks managed to bounce back for a few days last week as investors scooped up battered shares .
But the rally was short - lived , with stocks tumbling anew this week .
" This is a very volatile time , everyone is nervous and the volatility shows the degree of nervousness , " Caughey added .
More hints of a recession .
The ISM services index , a survey of services sector executives , showed business activity falling in January for the first time in five years .
The report was released nearly an hour ahead of schedule , unnerving investors at the start of trade .
The report countered last week 's reading on the manufacturing sector , which showed expansion .
( Full Story ) .
" This is the most unequivocal sign we 've had that the economy is weakening , " said Stephen Stanley , chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital .
" We 've had data pointing in that direction , but they 've been all over the map and it always seemed like there was a silver lining in the weak reports . "
" There is nothing in this report that was redeeming , " he added .
" It 's simply terrible . "
Looking to the Federal Reserve .
Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker , in a speech Tuesday , said that the report raises the risks of a recession , Briefing .com reported .
However , he said that inflationary pressures are also rising , which could limit further interest rate cuts .
Lacker is an alternate member of the Fed 's policy committee this year .
His comments seemed to suggest the threat of " stagflation , " the combination of slowing growth paired with higher inflation , a miserable economic development investors are hoping to avoid .
Last week 's monthly jobless claims report and fourth - quarter GDP growth report suggested an acceleration of the economic slowdown .
Investors will next look to Wednesday 's fourth - quarter productivity report to see if it shows a rise in unit labor costs , i.e. wage inflation , and next week 's Jan. retail sales report , amid fears about a consumer spending recession .
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates twice in late January , leaving the fed funds rate , a key short - term interest rate that affects consumer loans , at 3 % .
The fed also cut the discount rate , which affects bank loans .
The Fed has also injected billions into the financial system through a series of auctions .
The Fed actions have already started to have an impact , but it typically takes a good six to 12 months for rate cuts to work their way through the economy .
Stocks on the move .
The stock selloff was decisive , with all 30 Dow components sliding , led by financial stocks Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , American Express ( AXP , Fortune 500 ) , AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) and JP Morgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) .
Economically sensitive shares such as Alcoa ( AA , Fortune 500 ) and Caterpillar ( CAT , Fortune 500 ) slumped too .
In other corporate news , News Corp. ( NWS , Fortune 500 ) reported higher quarterly earnings that met estimates late Monday .
Shares were little changed Tuesday .
KB Home ( KBH , Fortune 500 ) and a few other homebuilders were among the few gainers on the session , thanks to a Banc of America Securities upgrade , Briefing.com reported .
Market breadth was negative .
On the New York Stock Exchange , losers trounced winners over four to one on volume of 1.65 billion shares .
On the Nasdaq , losers beat winners by over three to one on volume of 2.48 billion shares .
Other markets .
Treasury prices rallied , as investors sought safety in government debt , lowering the yield on the benchmark 10 - year note to 3.56 % from 3.64 % late Monday .
Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions .
In currency trading , the dollar gained versus the yen and the euro .
U.S. light crude oil for March delivery fell $ 1.32 to $ 88.70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
COMEX gold for April delivery plunged $ 19.10 to $ 890.30 an ounce .

clear warnings that it was going to happen
Working At WAL - MART
Concerned about WAL - MART 's impact on our world , I decided to infiltrate my local Supercenter in an effort to better understand the company and especially the conditions faced by its workers .
In the months since I have truly learned what it is like to be a low - wage associate inside this retailing goliath ( hint : it 's not particularly pleasant ... )
This is the story of the working poor , which hopefully will inspire us as consumers to seek change by boycotting WAL - MART .
Just think for one moment , okay ?
Do n't just spit out what you were taught to believe , which is what you do .
What did God lack before creation that made him want to create in the first place ?
Take a moment to truly reflect on that question .
I 'll repeat it again so you do .
I know your answer .
The answer is that God lacked nothing , as in NOTHING .
So what reason would cause God to want to create anything ?
There was no lack , no want , and no need .
That which causes a reasonable person to act is a lack , either his own , or someone else 's lack .
And even given that God wanted to create something , anything , why did he create this particular world ?
These are significant questions if you 'll take a moment to reflect on them , rather than spitting out proof texts and the blind faith results of your proof - texting .
Your God is supposedly a God of reason .
Everything he does is reasonable .
Well then , what 's his reason for creating something , anything ?
There can be no good reason for doing so , not even with an omniscient God , for an omniscient God must still act according to reason .
Unless by his logic he can do what is illogical , or by his reason he can do that which is unreasonable , there is no reason for God to have done so .
Even if we grant that God wanted to create something , anything , ?
It is a huge mess .
And it is likewise a non-answer to say it ’s Adam and Eve ’s fault If Godthis world would become a mess when he had no good reason to create anything in the first place , then why create this particular one ?
What kind of world is this one ?
It 's a world where most people wind up in hell .
Why create a world like this when most people in it will be punished for an eternity ?
Consider what Ivan Karamazov , Fyodor Dostoyevsky ’s character , said : “ Tell me yourself — I challenge you : let ’s assume that you were called upon to build the edifice of destiny so that men would finally be happy and would find peace and tranquility .
If you knew that , in order to attain this , you would have to torture just one single creature , let ’s say a little girl who beat her chest so desperately in the outhouse , and that on her unavenged tears you could build that edifice , would you agree to do it ?
Tell me and do n’t lie !
” If there was no need to create anything , none , and if you foreknew people would suffer in this world and eventually do so for an eternity , would you create this particular world for your own glory , which is what Biblical theism asserts ?
Would you do so for YOUR OWN GLORY , especially when you already had all glory and there was no need to do so in the first place ?
Only a sadistic egotistic monster would even consider doing so .-----------------------Other types of similar arguments can be found in my book

Is that before or after lying about the reason for invasion , the invasion , lying about the reason for occupation , the occupation , lying about how many years " it will take " , taking 100 - 1,000,000 years , and the wonderous Walmart purple ink fickle finger of fate " elections " ?
Just asking ... but puleezzee preznit blush ... do n't answer ... your lies are boring and smell like shit .

I like his comments about " go out and buy a house " some time back , and more recently " the economy is strong " .
Now let us listen to someone who is conscious :
Not since the Depression has a larger share of Americans owed more on their homes than they are worth .
With the collapse of the housing boom , nearly 8.8 million homeowners , or 10.3 percent of the total , are underwater .
That is more than double the percentage just a year ago , according to a new estimate of the damage by Moody ’s Economy.com .
Administration officials say they still oppose any taxpayer bailout for either people who borrowed more than they could afford or banks that made foolish loans during the height of the speculative bubble in housing .
( NYT ) .
Damn those republicans like preznit blush and Saint McCain have an experienced handle on everthing from the 100 year war to the 100 year recession .

I started laughing as the phrase free and fair elections rolling off of Bush 's lying lips !
It sounded wrong coming from out of his mouth .
I would like to see a remix of that statement ~ the Bush brothers needs to replace the Castro brothers .
Then it would sound more like a reality moment on television .

Maher has jumped the shark .
Watch this episode - about ten minutes in to the group grope , the GOP flack ( nimrod from Florida ? ) makes a claim that Michelle Obama had n't " apologized " for her poorly worded comments about being proud of America .
He repeats this false claim several times , and neither Bill nor the " liberal " guest calls him on it .
Too bad Maher does n't prepare for the show - he would have known Michelle Obama clarified what she meant several times and that the GOP flack was lying .
As I said ... Bill has jumped the shark .

If Cuba 's Supreme Court has 5 republican Supreme Delegates on it , who can decide who the preznit is , then they too can have " free and fair elections " just like here in preznit blush 's Amurka .
Then they can suffer along with the rest of us .
American flag waived , Amurkan flag waved ...

If there is a downside to the pace of innovation at Apple Inc. , the Fox comedy show " MADtv " captured it recently in a spoof of an iPod advertising campaign featuring the musician Feist .
In the segment , a look - alike for the Canadian singer croons about her unhappiness after a $ 400 iPod purchase at an Apple store .
( See video clip . )
" And just after my purchase was done , " she sings , " those Apple b- introduced a new one . "

Plans to use fingerprint scanners to control access to the House of Commons have been abandoned " over fears that terrorists could cut off an MP 's finger to get inside , " claims the Mail on Sunday , citing a recent episode of Spooks and " Commons security experts . "
The Register is however not entirely convinced that there were ever any serious plans to use fingerprints in this generation of Commons security .
Why , the notion is patently ridiculous - as absurd as the idea of using fingerprints to secure the country 's borders ...
And consider - say you 're an MP , a terrorist has got you , and he 's holding a chopper .
You 're just worried about your fingers , are you ?
In any event , if the experts did advise against using fingerprints , they must have advised some time ago , as new Commons security passes have begun to be distributed to MPs relatively recently .
These use a PIN , presumably checked against data stored on the card , and are only needed for the " external perimeter " , so once you 're in you 're in , and it seems unlikely that there 's any kind of audit trail of accesses and users .
Commons security came under the spotlight a few years ago , when two bags of purple flour panicked MPs into installing a huge screen between themselves and the public gallery .
A security review was conducted then , but although large concrete blocks and crashproof barriers have figured high among subsequent measures , the Parliamentary pass is one of the most glaring security holes .
Large numbers of people need to have access to Parliament , and MPs and Lords dish out passes to researchers and support staff liberally .
For years nobody has had more than a vague idea of how many passes there are out there , and who 's got them - and significantly , when pro-hunt demonstrators penetrated the Commons chamber , they breached perimeter ( that word again ) defences by nipping through a door used by workmen .
The new PIN - protected system is unlikely to be significantly better at protecting MPs from passing terrorists than the old one was , given that it will be equally vulnerable to the human factor and that passes will be equally impossible to keep track of .
It will however produce some temporary improvement simply by allowing all of the old , unidentifiable passes to be written off , and giving Commons security a couple of years breathing space before it degenerates back into chaos .
Would biometrics have been any better ?
Almost certainly not , but if MPs really are seriously concerned that terrorists might want to penetrate the Commons and bump them off , they really ought to implement a sensible security system that can be properly monitored and audited .
And maybe they ought n't to worry about their fingers too much , if they did decide to go for biometrics .
The smart terrorist , surely , is going to chop a researcher 's finger off , not an MP's - it'd take them a lot longer to spot a missing researcher , matter of fact they probably never would . ®
NASHVILLE , Tennessee ( Reuters ) - Tornadoes and thunderstorms flattened the land and shattered lives across the U.S. South on Tuesday and Wednesday , killing at least 52 people and injuring more than 150 in the deadliest such storms in nine years .
In Tennessee ’s Sumner County , northeast of Nashville , a tornado sucked an 11 - month - old boy and his mother from their home .
They were found later in a field .
The child survived in good condition , but his mother was dead .
Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen said he was shocked by the intensity and scope of a storm that “ just literally sat on the ground in wide areas ” along a track that was as much as 400 miles wide .
At Vanderbilt Hospital in Nashville , Ferina Ferrington told a local TV reporter : “ My husband and I got into the bathtub with our little girl .
I remember flying through the air .
It was very scary .
Then it was real quiet and we saw our house was gone .
Our baby was unhurt . ”
In Arkansas where almost 500 homes and businesses were destroyed or heavily damaged in four counties , Johnny Martin , 65 , gathered belongings from his brick and wood home which lay shattered beneath massive oak trees in the town of Atkins , west of Little Rock .
“ We all huddled in the bathroom , ” Martin said of his wife , mother - in - law and other family members .
“ I was standing at first at the front door when I heard it ...
The Lord was with us . ”
Hardest hit were Tennessee -- where 28 people died -- Arkansas , Kentucky , Mississippi and Alabama .
There were unconfirmed reports of 69 tornadoes swirling across those states and northward into Indiana , according to the National Storm Prediction Center in Norman , Oklahoma .
The death toll rivaled that of a series of tornadoes in May 1999 in Oklahoma , Texas and other states , when about 50 people were killed , the center said .
Tornadoes typically kill about 70 people in the United States each year .
TRAIL OF DEVASTATION
The weather service and state officials said that in addition to the 28 killed in Tennessee , there were 13 dead in Arkansas , seven in Kentucky and four in Alabama .
Injuries were widespread , with 149 people hurt in Tennessee alone .
“ We know of eight dead and are still looking , ” said Shelvy Linville , mayor of Lafayette , Tennessee .
“ There ’s a lot of devastation . ”
Power outages were widespread .
One tornado struck the Columbia Gulf Transmission company in Hartsville , Tennessee , and set off a natural gas fire that lit up the early morning sky , officials said .
Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear described to CNN a trail of devastation in his state seen from the air .

“ In the path of it there is nothing left and on either side of it things are standing just like nothing has happened .
It ’s an amazing picture to see . ”
Inspection of the damage began mid-morning Wednesday , with the last tornado reported a few hours earlier in Jackson County , northeastern Alabama , the weather service said .
Late in the day forecasters said there was no longer a threat of severe weather across the region .
In Alabama , Tina Johnson , 41 , of Pinhook , said she watched from her house as a tornado tore apart her barn .

“ The lightning and rain started back up suddenly and then we could see the funnel cloud through the lightning , ” she said .
“ The preacher ’s brick house across the street was destroyed and a mobile home nearby was nothing but a few pieces of tin . ”
Kentucky National Guard spokesman David Altom said about 50 soldiers were deployed and others on stand - by .
“ The mission right now is to protect the damaged homes from looting , ” he said .
The White House said President George W. Bush had called the governors of the affected states offering them consolation and support .
Mississippi reported no deaths but about 11 injuries after two tornadoes ripped across an industrial park , seriously damaging a Caterpillar factory , and farm communities north of the University of Mississippi campus in Oxford .
In Jackson , Tennessee , a tornado damaged most of the student housing at Union University , injuring more than 50 students , though none of the injuries was life threatening .
A consensus is building that America 's economy is sliding – perhaps plummeting – into recession .
In December the unemployment rate jumped to 5.0 percent , up 3/10 ths of 1 percent from its November level .
And of course investors are now growlingly bearish .
To no one 's surprise , politicians are rushing in with various plans for helping the economy .
Most of these plans involve " stimulus . "
The calls are loud to put more money into the hands of ordinary Americans in hopes that they will spend – not save – it , thereby boosting the overall economy .
Such stimulus , however , is futile .
Government cannot create genuine spending power ; the most it can do is to transfer it from Smith to Jones .
If the Treasury sends a stimulus check to Jones , the money comes from taxes , from borrowing , or is newly created .
If it comes from taxes , the value of Jones 's stimulus check is offset by the greater taxes paid by Smith , who will then have fewer dollars to spend or invest .
If Uncle Sam borrows to pay for the stimulus checks , this borrowing takes money out of the private sector .
Any dollars borrowed – whether from foreigners or fellow Americans – for purposes of stimulus would have been spent or invested in other ways were they not loaned to the government .
The only other means of paying for such stimulus is for the Federal Reserve to create new money .
Unfortunately , this option leads inevitably to inflation .
All Americans wind up with more dollars in their wallets but also paying higher prices in the stores .
Prosperity is not created by raining down upon the populace more monochrome pictures of dead statesmen .
Stimulus funded with newly created money is especially harmful .
Most obviously , the inflation it causes prompts investors to flee the dollar .
But because inflation can take time to show up , injecting new money into the economy can create a temporary sense that consumers and investors are wealthier than they really are .
Such a false sense dangerously delays the necessary pruning of unfruitful investments .
A bad economy is prolonged .
" It 's only when the tide goes out that you learn who 's been swimming naked . "
That saying , credited to Warren Buffett , points to the important – if painful – role that recessions play : moving money from bad investments to sound ones .
Delaying this adjustment with the hallucinogen of easy money does no one any favors over the long - run .
Spending power is not so much the fuel for economic growth as it is its reward .
And the key to economic growth is investment that raises worker productivity .
The best way for policymakers to foster such growth is to avoid panicking over any current economic downswing .
Instead , they should focus on getting the economic fundamentals right .
Such emphasis might not make things better – or even make things appear to be better – today , but it will make our tomorrows as bright as possible .
The good news :
These fundamentals really are fundamental .
President Bush can take action tomorrow .
The bad news :
All of these steps require a lame duck to swim against the political current .
First , Mr. Bush should call for a substantial and permanent cut in both capital - gains and personal - income tax rates .
Next , he should insist on a large reduction in federal spending , including elimination of all agricultural subsidies .
While he 's showing such courage , he might as well unconditionally endorse free trade .
Cutting taxes is , of course , a good thing , but it 's important to know why .
The goal would not be to increase consumer spending .
Instead , it would be to raise the returns on investment and work .
By letting investors and workers keep more of the fruits of their risk - taking , creativity , and efforts , the economy will enjoy more risk - taking , creativity , and effort .
Businesses that would otherwise not be started would be created .
Likewise with machinery and training that increases worker productivity .
Investors worldwide would flock to take advantage of these lower tax rates , further increasing productive investments .
Cutting government spending would result in more of the economy 's resources being used by wealth - creating businesses rather than being siphoned away to special - interest groups and boondoggles such as bridges - to - nowhere and Woodstock museums .
Committing to free trade would assure global investors that Americans refuse to turn inward – that producers in America will not be stymied in their efforts to buy inputs from low - cost foreign suppliers and that investments and entrepreneurial ideas from abroad will continue to be welcomed .
Finally , Bush should assure the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve that he neither expects nor wants them to use monetary policy politically .
Reminding them of the wisdom of Milton Friedman , he should strongly urge them to keep a tight rein on the money supply .
Sound money , low taxes , and free trade might not " stimulate " the economy today , but this combination will surely increase its vigor over the long - run .
• Donald J. Boudreaux is chairman of the economics department at George Mason University .
Google Inc. announced Friday that it will apply to bid for wireless spectrum in a January Federal Communications Commission auction .
The Mountain View , Calif. , Internet company had previously said it would probably bid for spectrum , a chunk of the airwaves that can be used to provide mobile phone and Internet services .
But some analysts had questioned whether such statements were just a negotiating tactic in Google 's discussions with wireless carriers .
The FCC has a Dec. 3 deadline for any parties to declare their intent to bid .
" We believe it 's important to put our money where our principles are , " Chairman and Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said in a press release .
" Consumers deserve more competition and innovation than they have in today 's wireless world .
No matter which bidder ultimately prevails , the real winners of this auction are American consumers who likely will see more choices than ever before in how they access the Internet . "
If it wins a wireless license , Google would be in a position to become a provider of mobile phone and Internet services , to partner with others interested in doing so or to lease the spectrum to them .
The company has said it wants to make mobile networks more open , so that consumers can use any Internet service and application and move their handsets between carriers without onerous restrictions .
Google will likely square off at the auction against large U.S. wireless carriers such as AT&T Inc. and Verizon Wireless , a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group PLC , that are looking for more spectrum .
It ’s the news that is guaranteed to change everything : you ’re going to be a parent .
It ’s funny how extremely different the reaction to this news will be depending on the person hearing it .
For some , this is fantastic news and caps off months , even years , of “ trying ” .
For others , this is the news they dread .
They have big plans for their life , and it certainly does n’t involve kids ( at least not for the next few years ) .
I was given the unexpected news that I was to become a father on my 24th birthday ( what a present ! ) .
My reaction was that of the person filled with dread – this was not what I wanted !
It ’s amazing , though , how perspectives can change with time .
It is now 19 months since I heard the big news , 11 months since my son was born , and 2 months since I discovered our second child is due in July 2008 .
During this time I have gone from dreading fatherhood to considering it to be one of the greatest things I will do with my life .
The reason I dreaded being a young parent was that I had always pictured myself as being financially secure and well traveled before taking the big step into fatherhood .
I also believed that parental responsibilities would be a huge obstacle in the way of having fun .
What I have come to believe , though , is that there are certain myths surrounding parenthood .
Sure , you can play the victim and believe them if you want .
But it is far more enjoyable to smash them into pieces .
Myth # 1 : “ I ca n’t afford to have kids ”
It ’s true that a baby brings with it an assortment of expenses you once would have never considered .
The funny thing is , though , you will find a way to make things work .
You have to .
Now that I am a parent I am more motivated to succeed than I once could have ever imagined .
This motivation has led me to sort out my finances , simplify my life , attain a higher paying job and , perhaps most importantly , establish multiple streams of income .
Expenses will inevitably rise when you have kids , but use this as motivation to increase your income and simplify your life .
Myth # 2 : “ I wo n’t be able to travel ”
Ok , so if you have a grand vision of traveling solo across the globe you will need to adjust this after becoming a parent .
But there is no reason why kids should stop you from exploring what the world has to offer .
For example , when my son was 5 months old we relocated from Australia to Canada .
And this is barely scratching the surface of what is possible .
Two of my personal heroes are Tony and Maureen Wheeler , the founders of the Lonely Planet guidebooks .
In their autobiography Unlikely Destinations : The Lonely Planet Story , they recount stories of trekking in Nepal and relocating from Melbourne to San Francisco for a year with their two young children .
Rather than letting kids kill their love of travel , they simply found a way to include them .
For more inspiration relating to traveling with kids , see Tim Ferriss ’ recent article New Year , New You ; How to Travel the World With ( or Without ) Kids in 2008 .
Myth # 3 : “ I wo n’t be able to have fun ”
Have you ever looked back on your younger self and shook your head at what you once considered to be fun ?
Most of us have , and I make this point because it proves one thing : our idea of what constitutes fun can change .
I live a quieter life now that I am a parent , but it is no less enjoyable .
I still have a lot of fun , and it is now filled with a richness that only a parent can truly understand .
Of course there are certain types of fun that do n’t change and which do n’t involve kids .
I admit it can be tricky to create free time by yourself or with your partner , but where there is a will there is a way .
What is my number one tip for finding time away from the kids ?
Be good to your parents .
One day they will be grandparents and you will appreciate their help .

PARANOIA over electronic voting is the new American consensus .
The Democrats who will vote in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday are n’t worried that Hillary Clinton will steal the election from Barack Obama or John Edwards , but a good chunk of them would probably confess to dark fears about a Republican plot in November , even if Karl Rove wo n’t be involved .
Last month , Colorado ’s secretary of state , Mike Coffman , a Republican , decertified the state ’s electronic voting machines , after the alarming finding that one model could be disabled with a magnet and others were scandalously inaccurate .
He left voters to draw their own conclusions about what this meant for the state ’s most recent elections .
The California secretary of state , Debra Bowen , a Democrat , took office last year after running on a don’t - trust - electronic - voting platform , and in August she pulled the plug on the state ’s voting machines .
But what other options are there ?
Paper ballots are n’t perfect .
Ballot boxes can be stuffed or lost .
Indeed , because of Florida ’s paper - ballot mess in 2000 , electronic voting is probably here to stay .
Fortunately , there is an elegant solution that lets us use modern technology while assuaging the growing fears about voter fraud .
Ronald L. Rivest , a Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer scientist , and Warren D. Smith , a mathematician and voting reform advocate , have proposed an ingenious method that would combine paper ballots and a Web site to achieve greater ballot security than is possible with paper or software alone .
Mr De is proud of his handlebar moustache
Victor Joynath
De was grounded by Indian - formerly called Indian Airlines - in 2001 for refusing to shave off his handlebar moustache .
He had earlier lost a case in a lower court which ruled that the airline was within its rights to sack him .
According to Indian rules , all crew members should be clean shaven .
A moustache , if worn , should not extend beyond the upper lip , says the rule book .
The guidelines do not apply to Sikh employees who are allowed to keep moustaches .
' Health risk '
" How can somebody be removed from a job because of the size of his moustache ? " the Supreme Court bench comprising Justice HK Sema and Justice Markanday Katju asked on Monday .
The airline has been given four weeks to respond .
The airline 's rules say crew members should be clean shaven
Mr De 's brush with his employers began in 2001 when the airline argued that his prized asset was a health risk , especially with him frequently handling food .
A spokesman for the airline said at the time of Mr De 's grounding its personal conduct code did not allow the display of moustaches which could be unhygienic .
The spokesman said that some passengers could be unnerved by such a striking facial feature .
At the time of his grounding , Mr De said he was proud of his moustache which had taken 25 years to grow and now stretches prominently across both cheekbones .
" I never dreamed of trimming it .
All the time I worked for the airline , my moustache attracted many adoring eyes inside the plane and on the ground , " he said .
Mr De has worked for the state - run airline for over 20 years .
He is a member of London 's famous Handlebar Club , which has campaigned against his sacking .
Senator Edwards ’s and Senator Obama ’s videos , both of which run longer than an hour , have not been up as long and have still fewer viewers .
The biggest draw has turned out to be Representative Ron Paul , whose July visit has been viewed , or at least started , more than 350,000 times .
For perspective , consider the numbers that short - form videos of a less serious nature draw .
Search for “ Barack Obama ” on YouTube and you will find that the most - viewed video is titled “ I Got a Crush ... on Obama . ”
It lacks narrative , content and anything other than a young woman with large breasts lip - synching , but it has tallied more than four million views .
The most - viewed video that turns up for a “ Hillary Clinton ” search is “ Vote Different , ” a dark parody of Apple ’s “ 1984 ” commercial that portrays the senator most unflatteringly , as a giant TV image that is shattered .
It is also approaching four million views .
YouTube has a separate section , “ You Choose ’ 08 , ” that gives each candidate a protected space for more serious discourse , similar to the way the broadcast networks give Sunday mornings over to civic uplift .
You Choose also provides access to last Wednesday ’s CNN / YouTube debate with the Republican candidates , and the earlier one in July with the Democrats .

YouTube with broadening the range of questions in the debates , making them more memorable by having users submit the questions in the form of personal videos , and making everything searchable afterward .
In the past , she said , “ if you missed a debate , you missed it . ”
The ability to select for playback any question in the debate and the candidates ’ responses provides easy , precise access to the contents , sliced and diced , that was never possible before .
But it also contributes to a shortening of our collective attention span .
THIS is hardly new — we ’ve already come a long way from the Lincoln - Douglas debates of 1858 for a Senate seat , which held the audience rapt , on one occasion , for three hours — then everyone dispersed for dinner and came back for the four - hour rebuttal .
The contrast with the public ’s attenuated attention in the age of television , which Neil Postman pointed out in his 1985 book “ Amusing Ourselves to Death : Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business , ” was great .
The contrast is all the greater today , with the advent of the short , nonlinear clips of YouTube .
It is easy to forget that this is YouTube ’s first presidential campaign : the company was founded in only 2005 and acquired by Google in 2006 .
By the time the next campaign cycle rolls around in 2011 , YouTube ’s influence on the culture may be so complete that a 45 - minute linear video of a question - answer session will seem to most people to be about 43 minutes too long .
A midcampaign trek to Google headquarters in Silicon Valley may soon seem no less quaint than one to a G.M. plant in Flint , Mich .
The candidates need not seek out the cameras — from now on , the cameras will always find them .
UPDATE : Here ’s what the moguls have to say :
This is a day of relief and optimism for everyone in the entertainment industry .
We can now all get back to work , with the assurance that we have concluded two groundbreaking labor agreements – with our directors and our writers — that establish a partnership through which our business can grow and prosper in the new digital age .
The strike has been extraordinarily difficult for all of us , but the hardest hit of all have been the many thousands of businesses , workers and families that are economically dependent on our industry .
We hope now to focus our collective efforts on what this industry does best – writers , directors , actors , production crews , and entertainment companies working together to deliver great content to our worldwide audiences .

Here ’s the official WGA announcement to striking writers :
On Tuesday , members of the Writers Guilds East and West voted by a 92.5 % margin to lift the restraining order that was invoked on November 5th .
The strike is over .
Writing can resume immediately .
If you were employed when the strike began , you should plan to report to work on Wednesday .
If you ’re not employed at an office or other work site , call or e-mail your employer that you are resuming work .
If you have been told not to report to work or resume your services , we recommend that you still notify your employer in writing of your availability to do so .
Questions concerning return - to - work issues should be directed to the WGAW legal department or the WGAE ’s assistant executive director .
The decision to begin this strike was not taken lightly and was only made after no other reasonable alternative was possible .
We are profoundly aware of the economic loss these fourteen weeks have created not only for our members but so many other colleagues who work in the television and motion picture industries .
Nonetheless , with the establishment of the WGA jurisdiction over new media and residual formulas based on distributor ’s gross revenue ( among other gains ) we are confident that the results are a significant achievement not only for ourselves but the entire creative community , now and in the future .
We hope to build upon the extraordinary energy , ingenuity , and solidarity that were generated by your hard work during the strike .
Over the next weeks and months , we will be in touch with you to discuss and develop ways we can use our unprecedented unity to make our two guilds stronger and more effective than ever .
Now that the strike has ended , there remains the vote to ratify the new contract .
Ballots and information on the new deal , both pro and con , will be mailed to you shortly .
You will be able to return those ballots via mail or at a membership meeting to be held Monday , February 25th , 2008 , at times and locations to be determined .
Thank you for making it possible .
As ever , we are all in this together .
Best ,
Patric M. Verrone

for those that are curious about how this works , I looked this up when I first saw a couple of these clips cause I was going to make one .
Turns out the theory behind it is pretty simple .
The tesla coil shoots out lightning , whatever .
the humming of the electricity is ALWAYS at 120hz , the frequency of the juice coming out of the wall its plugged into .
The ELECTRICITY is always at 120hz .
BUT :
They turn the coil on / off at a high sample rate .
This takes the sound coming from the coil to the high amplitude , and low amplitude alternating obviously , faster than 120hz .
this means that they can effectively change the frequency of the sound that we hear .
If any of you are electrically inclined , its like trying to turn the 120hz into a series of impulse functions to change the frequency domain .

Troubled actress Lindsay Lohan has entered the Hollywood record books after her latest film has won a staggering EIGHT Golden Raspberry Awards .
Her campy horror film , I Know Who Killed Me , which has never been released here , surpassed the record seven wins previously held by Battleship Earth and Showgirls .
Eddie Murphy also set a new record , as the first performer ever to win three of the four Worst Acting trophies in the same year .
Scroll down for more ...
And the winner for worst film goes to ... I Know Who Killed Me
I Know Who Killed Me , shot around Lohan 's first of three stints in rehab last year , was named Worst Film of the year .
She picked up two wins as Worst Actress for playing two characters who may or may not have been twins .
Her dual roles also got Razzied for a scene in which the two characters appear together , as Worst Screen Couple .
The film was also named Worst Remake or Rip - off , for paying dubious homage to Hostel , Saw and The Patty Duke Show .

Chris Silverstone was named Worst Director and Jeffrey Hammond won his Razzie in the Worst Screenplay category .
The film , which cost an estimated £ 6.1 million to make but earned less than £ 3.75 million at the American box - office , also spawned a new category , which it won for Worst Excuse for a Horror Movie .
Eddie Murphy also scored three hits for the comedy Norbit , which starred Thandie Newton .
Murphy took out the Worst Actor , Worst Supporting Actress ( for playing his own wife ) and Worst Supporting Actor categories .
The one winner not connected to either of the big- winning films was a sequel to an Eddie Murphy movie , Daddy Day Camp , which was named Worst Prequel or Sequel .
The Golden Raspberry , or Razzie Awards , are presented each year on the eve of the Oscars , to poke fun at the film industry 's failures .
Unlike the Academy Awards and other prestigious events , there is no red carpet or borrowed posh frocks and jewellery .

Big winner : Eddie Murphy received three Golden Raspberry awards for Norbit , which he co-starred in with Thandie Newton
This year 's awards , determined by 750 voters in the United States and 18 other countries , were held at the Abracadabra Theatre in Santa Monica , with none of the winners showing up .
In fact , only two winners have ever turned up to collect the tacky , gold spray - painted £ 2.49 pounds trophies - Halle Berry , when she " won " for Catwoman three years ago , and Tom Green , for Freddy Got Fingered in 2002 .
Sylvester Stallone is the all - time biggest male loser , with 30 nominations and 10 wins , and Madonna leads the field for women , with 15 nominations and nine wins .
The Razzies were founded in 1980 by John Wilson , author of Everything I Know I Learned at the Movies .

On November 2 , 2007 the US House passed a new mining law that mandates a 4 % gross royalty on existing mines and an 8 % royalty on future mines on public lands .
The royalty , if imposed , represents expropriation over and above the corporate income tax mining companies presently have to pay .
It also represents the common view that the proceeds from mining — or any other endeavor for that matter — if carried out on public lands are the property of the general population .
In other words if a miner goes to the effort of looking for , finding , developing , and producing copper in Utah , everyone in Florida is entitled to the fruits of his labor just because people in Florida happen to live within a political area that also encompasses the mine .
This argument sounds awfully like slavery to me , although it represents a belief system that is generally left unquestioned .
It is a strong emotional argument largely emanating from the government proposing the bill , which would undoubtedly benefit politically by dispensing the proceeds of the royalty .
The problem with the argument is that it discounts the benefit that Americans and indeed all humans are receiving from mining operations and the risk undertaken by the mining industry that allowed for the benefit .
The royalty is more than the average return on invested capital for mining and will effectively kill mining in the United States because exploration for new mines will be conducted elsewhere in the world where the climate is less onerous .
Adding 8 % to the cost of copper will only hurt the consumers of copper who , as it turns out , include those same folks in Florida .
AN OVERVIEW OF MINERAL EXPLORATION AND MINE DEVELOPMENT
Metal production and use is not new to modern times .
Civilizations have been measured by the metals that they produced and used ( e.g. , the Iron Age ) .
After more than five thousand years of recorded mining and metal use , prospectors have scoured the earth and discovered practically all exposed concentrations of metal in an effort to fill demand .
Today , finding a site to evaluate for mineral potential means having to go to some of the remotest areas of the planet , or using more advanced technology to evaluate an area for unexposed mineralization .
Over the last 40 years , in response to rising demand and a dearth of easy - to - find mineral deposits , various technologies have been developed to guide the geologist in exploring areas where mineralization is not exposed .
This includes the science of geology itself , where a wealth of information has evolved from the study of mineral deposits and how they form .
This massive investment in knowledge now allows geologists to predict where mineralization might occur beneath the surface .
Mineral exploration is perhaps the riskiest of business ventures , based simply on the complexities of nature and the rarity of zones of concentrated metal .
Mineral value cannot be quantified until core samples are taken through a process called drilling , which enables mineral content to be evaluated in three dimensions .
Today geologists spend their efforts interpreting layers of expensively acquired scientific data and geologic observations , evaluating hundreds of potential targets just to find an area prospective enough to risk the expense of drilling .
Several studies conducted over the past 30 years indicate that for every 500 to 1,000 mineral showings drilled , one mineral deposit with sufficient value to mine is discovered .
[ 1 ]
This means that most mineral exploration companies never find a mine with the venture capital money they raise and spend .
The risk does not end with discovery , however .
Subsequent to the identification of a mineral resource many other factors are considered .
A feasibility study is conducted which determines the costs of construction , including roads , power and water supply .
Often the metallurgy or the ability to extract the metal from the rock render a mineral deposit uneconomic to mine due to the chemical complexity of the surrounding rock .
There are the costs of mining , milling , and refining the ore and transporting the metal to the consumer .
There may be a cost in removing rock that is barren in order to access the mineral - bearing rock .
These costs often depend on the remoteness of the proposed mine and the access to preexisting infrastructure .
If the deposit still appears to be economic to mine , political risks and environmental costs need to be considered .
Many well - financed NGO's are committed to stopping mining development and become active opponents to a proposed mine .
Often a significant investment in public relations is required to combat negative public opinion .
Environmental regulations require that companies spend large amounts of money in the feasibility stage to determine environmental impact and to put significant money aside to rehabilitate the mine when production ceases .
Finally metal prices need to be considered and predicted over the life of the proposed mine .
Many mines have been rendered uneconomic by an unforeseen change in the price of metals .
Should the proposed mine pass these obstacles , the money to undertake the venture needs to be raised from investors .
Few of the largest mining companies in the world have the funds to construct a mine and , as a result , they finance with large banks .
As an example , the Antamina copper-zinc mine in Peru was recently put into production by a consortium of companies at cost of US $ 2.2 billion , US $ 1.3 billion of which was financed by loans .
[ 2 ]
This money went towards construction costs as well as new infrastructure such as a port facility , 76 kilometers of new road , a new pipeline , 58 kilometers of new power line , and a switching station .
Costs also included environmental studies required to acquire over 300 government permits .
The mine is currently in operation and has a labor force of over 1,400 people , only 28 of which are foreign staff .
Estimates of the time needed to pay back the entire investment vary , but go up to 10 years of the projected 19 - year mine life .
These estimates depend on metal prices and assume that a hurricane wo n't destroy any infrastructure and the government does n't decide to nationalize the mine .
In the meantime , the new infrastructure and jobs benefits many Peruvians in immeasurable ways , including increased access to electricity , healthcare , education , and trade .
The infrastructure will also stimulate further mineral exploration and possible mining development in the area and may make other business ventures viable that might otherwise have been uneconomic .
Sentiments in the countries of origin of the mining companies , as well as their shareholders , demand that the companies invest in the local communities , in the form of humanitarian aid including the construction of schools and drilling of water wells .
Over the last 25 years mining companies have had profits of about 5 % on average , which are net of costs and payments on loans .
[ 3 ]
As with Antamina , these profits are really returns on large investments to put the mines in production , or debts the companies have not yet been recovered .
A profit margin of 5 % means that to get the metal out of the ground it costs on average 95 % of the value of the metal produced .
By far the largest shares of the costs are labor , power , and services .
The goods and services needed by a new mine are immense in scale and encompass the labor of mechanics , computer technicians , drivers , engineers , and cooks , all representing new economies created by the mine .
It should be noted that once the debts are repaid the profit is subject to the corporate income tax .
BHP Billiton Ltd. , one of the largest mining companies in the world operating mines in Chile , paid US $ 1.5 billion in taxes to the Chilean government over the past 15 years .
[ 4 ]
Any profits that remain , the owners of the company keep .
In 2001 the company paid US $ 751 million in dividends to the owners , 298,000 shareholders , including pension funds that represent innumerable people . [ 5 ]
Despite the huge investment required and the financial risk it bears , the mining industry is miniscule compared to the industries that depend upon the metal that mining produces .
The copper from the Antamina mine may be turned into wiring for electric motors , copper pipe for water or into the circuit board of a personal computer .
In each of these cases the copper is sold at many times its value in raw form .
The term sustainability is often bandied about in intellectual discussion , but with respect to mining , it never accounts for the fact that the cost of finding , mining , and refining metal dictates that it is cheaper to recycle metal than start from scratch .
When one considers that practically all the copper ever mined is still in use , mining can be considered infinitely sustainable .
People with antidevelopment notions should also consider that over 50 % of the copper produced today goes to developing nations , owing to the fact that rich , already - developed countries recycle much of what they need ; nearly half of the copper consumed each year in the United States is recycled . [ 6 ]
Preventing a mine from being developed in Chile may mean that people in China do n't get copper pipes to transport clean drinking water .
MINING IN THE UNITED STATES
US legislators are trying to implement this new and very onerous royalty by claiming that American are n't receiving enough benefit from the production of metals on public lands in the United States .
The royalty proposes to rectify this manufactured grievance by exacting by force every American 's share of the proceeds of mining operations on their behalf .
Presumably the intended result is that their government will have more money to spend ( hardly a positive outcome ) but the net effect to the American citizen can hardly be considered positive .
If copper and other metals are to be produced without loss , their prices will have to be 8 % higher to offset the royalty .
While most Americans will never see the money the government takes they will have to bear the cost of the higher metal prices that result .
Since prospectors and miners will go elsewhere , the greatest and perhaps intended effect of the royalty will be to render prospecting and mining losing activities in the United States .
All the mines that are easy to find have been found .
New mines will be increasingly expensive and difficult to locate .
If the United States Senate passes this mining royalty , it is highly unlikely that anyone will want to undertake the risk to find more mines in the United States for the benefit of humanity .
Making prospecting in the United States unprofitable reduces the portion of the earth prospectors have to work with , thereby raising the costs of living for all people , regardless of where they live .
The only beneficiaries of such a royalty would be the state and the privileged groups to whom it decides to dispense the proceeds .

If I were Old Harry , I 'd now be preparing the very special place in hell for the following people ...
1 . The heartless bastards in the immigration service who deported a woman who was on dialysis , and is certain to die without treatment .
They deported her because they said treatment was ' available ' in her country of origin .
It 's just not available to _her_ .
http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/article3331288.ece
At the same time , the same immigration department decided not to deport a professional footballer from Sierra Leone because it would wreck his career .
http://itn.co.uk/news/31bd7fabc1f4e647eb77e5c3bb1e4681.html
So you 're happy to sentence a woman who 's not even 40 to death , but not wreck a professional footballer 's career ?
This is breathtakingly cruel .
If the woman dies , I hope those involved in her deportation - every single person involved in it - cannot sleep soundly ever again .
Heartless bastards .
The second group I would reserve that very special place in hell are the idiots who investigated and forced to resign the coast guard who saved a girl from certain death .
He was interviewed on the PM programme on BBC Radio 4 .
The girl was about 5 minutes away from falling to her death , and it would have taken him far longer to get his equipment from his vehicle , so he took the calculated risk to make the rescue attempt because to not do so would have condemned the girl to die .
For his troubles , he was going to be disciplined .

Arseholes .
The lot of them .
By the end of this year , the contents of all 1,800 courses taught at one of the world 's most prestigious universities will be available online to anyone in the world , anywhere in the world .
Learners wo n't have to register for the classes , and everyone is accepted .
The cost ?
It 's all free of charge .
The OpenCourseWare movement , begun at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in 2002 and now spread to some 120 other universities worldwide , aims to disperse knowledge far beyond the ivy - clad walls of elite campuses to anyone who has an Internet connection and a desire to learn .
Intended as an act of " intellectual philanthropy , " OpenCourseWare ( OCW ) provides free access to course materials such as syllabi , video or audio lectures , notes , homework assignments , illustrations , and so on .
So far , by giving away their content , the universities are n't discouraging students from enrolling as students .
Instead , the online materials appear to be only whetting appetites for more .
" We believe strongly that education can be best advanced when knowledge is shared openly and freely , " says Anne Margulies , executive director of the OCW program at MIT .
" MIT is using the power of the Internet to give away all of the educational materials created here . "
The MIT site ( ocw.mit.edu ) , along with companion sites that translate the material into other languages , now average about 1.4 million visits per month from learners " in every single country on the planet , " Ms. Margulies says .
Those include Iraq , Darfur , " even Antarctica , " she says .
" We hear from [ the online students ] all the time with inspirational stories about how they are using these materials to change their lives .
They 're really , really motivated . "
So -called " distance learning " over the Internet is n't new .
Students have been able to pay for online courses at many institutions , either to receive credit or simply as a noncredit adult - learning experience .
Many universities also offer free podcasts ( audio or sometimes video material delivered via the Internet ) .
But the sheer volume and variety of the educational materials being released by MIT and its OCW collaborators is nothing less than stunning .
For example , each of the 29 courses that Tufts University in Medford , Mass. , has put online so far is " literally the size of a textbook , " says Mary Lee , associate provost and point person for the OCW effort there .
The material provides much more than " a skeleton of a course , " she says .
Visitors to Tufts ' OCW course on " Wildlife Medicine " call it is the most comprehensive website on that topic in the world , Dr. Lee says .
What OCW is not , its supporters agree , is a substitute for attending a university .
For one thing , OCW learners are n't able to receive feedback from a professor – or to discuss the course with fellow students .
A college education is " really the total package of students interacting with other students , forming networks , interacting with faculty , and that whole environment of being associated with the school , " says James Yager , a senior associate dean at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore .
He oversees the OCW program there .
His school of public health now offers nearly 40 of its most popular courses for free via OCW .
The school 's goal is to put 90 to 100 of its 200 or so core courses online within the next year or so .
In November , learners from places such as Taiwan , Britain , Australia , Singapore , Germany , Japan , and the Netherlands logged some 80,000 page views of OCW course material , Dr. Yager says .
MIT 's initiative began with the idea of giving faculty at other universities access to how professors at MIT approached teaching a subject .
But after the OCW project went online , the school quickly realized it had two other huge constituencies : students at other colleges , who wanted to augment what they were learning , and " self learners , " those not pursuing a formal education but interested in increasing their knowledge .
Along with course content , MIT also wanted to showcase its teaching methods .
Many schools follow a traditional model , teaching the theory first , then allowing students to practice what they 've learned .
MIT has a " practice , theory , practice " way of teaching , Margulies says , that aims to get students engaged and energized immediately – before delving much into theory .
Younes Attaourti , a physics professor in Marrakesh , Morocco , stumbled upon MIT 's OCW site while surfing the Net .
He 's used the materials as the basis for courses he 's taught on statistical physics and quantum theory of fields .
And for his own learning , he 's downloaded theoretical physics courses and one on ultrafast optics .
" I do n't think there is another university elsewhere in the world that is more generous , " he writes in an e-mail : " [ T ] his is the first time that many people around the world are able to have access to top- quality courses . "
Phillipa Williams is an adult ( 40 - something ) student at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch , New Zealand , studying mathematics ( " do n't groan , I love it ! " she writes in an e-mail ) .
She 's worked her way through many of the OCW undergraduate mathematics courses , she says , because they provide " a different viewpoint , another explanation of material , " as well as different practice questions .
MIT 's OCW website features even more glowing feedback from learners .
" [ B] ecause of money , many good students with great talent and [ who are ] diligent do not have the chance to learn the newest knowledge and understanding of the universe , " says Chen Zhiying , a student in the People 's Republic of China .
" But now , due to the OCW , the knowledge will spread to more and more people , and it will benefit the whole [ world of ] human - beings . "
" The MIT OCW program is a generous and far - sighted initiative that will do more to change the world for the better than a thousand Iraq - style invasions , " the MIT site quotes Leigh Pascoe , a self - learner in Paris , as saying .
" It does much to restore my faith in the enlightenment of the American people and their great experiment in democracy .
This program should be emulated by every university worthy of the name . "
Besides MIT , Tufts , and Johns Hopkins , the OCW consortium ( ocwconsor tium.org ) in the United States includes among its members Michigan State , Michigan , Notre Dame , and Utah State .
Internationally , members include groups of universities in China , Japan , and Spain .
So far MIT has published 1,550 of its courses for OCW and plans to get the rest online by the end of this year .
The materials for each course vary .
Full videos of lectures , one of the most popular features , are available for only 26 courses , about 1,000 hours of video in all .
" We 'd like to do more video because it 's really quite popular and our users love it , " Marguiles says .
" But it 's quite expensive . "
The program relies on " generous support " from foundations , individuals , and MIT itself for funding , she says .
Schools like Tufts and Johns Hopkins were able to jump - start their OCW programs quickly because the schools had already committed themselves for many years to putting all their classroom materials online for use by their own students .
The biggest job has been to vet the materials for copyright issues , so - called " copyright scrubbing , " Lee and Yager say .
If permission cannot be obtained for a specific photo or chart , it must be left out of the OCW version or a substitute found .
The OCW effort is part of a wide range of dynamic educational content emerging on the Internet , says Dan Colman , associate dean and director of Stanford University 's continuing studies program and host of the website oculture.com , which highlights what 's happening in Web - based education , with an emphasis on podcasts .
Full - fledged online courses " might eventually offer a viable alternative to the classroom , but right now we have a ways to go , " he writes via e-mail .
Podcasts , for example , let learners hear a lecture , but they do n't require that the listener write a critical essay or take part in a classroom discussion – activities that are a key element of the learning process , Mr. Colman says .
And technology still needs to advance a bit more too .
" We 'll need a very fast fiber network and communication tools that give courses a greater degree of immediacy and sociability before this [ online ] model will become a real option educationally and economically , " he says .
" In the meantime , the traditional classroom is fairly safe . "
For example , lab work , which usually requires close hands - on collaboration between an instructor and students , remains problematic online , Yager points out .
The losers in putting free content online are n't likely to be universities , which will continue to attract young students , Colman says .
But free podcasts and OCW courses may pull adult learners away from other leisure activities , he says , such as reading books , watching educational television shows , or buying recordings of books or lectures .
" All of these entities could suffer as users find free high - quality information on the Web , " Colman says .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain has “ some concerns ” about whether the trial of the alleged mastermind of the September 11 attacks will respect his legal rights , Foreign Secretary David Miliband said on Tuesday .
The Pentagon on Monday announced charges against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and five other detainees imprisoned at the U.S. detention centre at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The charges include conspiring with al Qaeda to attack and murder civilians and 2,973 counts of murder for those killed .
The Pentagon is seeking the death penalty .
Asked on a BBC Radio phone - in show if he believed the trial of Mohammed , a Pakistani national , would respect his legal rights , Miliband said : “ We have some concerns about that . ”
“ There are still some cases in front of the American Supreme Court , because , of course , the great thing about America ... is that the independent legal system provides a check and a balance on the operation of the legal system itself , ” he said .
Miliband said the Supreme Court had already ruled against some of the tribunals that have been set up to try Guantanamo detainees .
“ There are some cases in respect of what ’s called the Military Commissions Act , which is the basis on which he’d be tried , that are being discussed in front of the Supreme Court at the moment , ” he said on BBC2 ’s Jeremy Vine show .
Mohammed is reported to have admitted planning every aspect of the September 11 attacks , but there could be a problem if such a confession were used as evidence because the CIA has admitted it subjected him to “ waterboarding ” -- an interrogation technique simulating drowning that has been widely criticized as torture .
The rules of the court on the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , prohibit the use of evidence gained through torture , as does an international treaty the United States has signed .
Miliband said there was “ absolutely no question ” torture was illegal .
Britain defines water - boarding as torture , he added .
“ We do n’t ... we would never use water - boarding ” .
“ There ’s absolutely no question about the UK government ’s commitments in respect of torture , which is illegal , and our definition of what torture is , ” he added .
“ And I think it ’s very , very important that we always assert that our system of values is different from those who attacked the U.S. and killed British citizens on 11 September , and that ’s something we ’d always want to stand up for . ”
Former prime minister Tony Blair came under fire from members of his own Labour Party for not being critical enough of U.S. President George W. Bush over the Guantanamo Bay detention centre .

It ’s not a theological or scientific triumph to point out when Ray Comfort is wrong about something .
But sometimes it ’s fun to shoot fish in a barrel .
Like in this case .
First , someone asked Ray a question :
>
Then , Ray responded like this :
Munjaros ,
An atheist is a person who pretends that there is no God .
Best wishes , Ray
Ha .
We ’re all cracking up here .
Then a commenter ( Martin James ) offered up another definition :
This is mine : A person who refuses to believe the facts .
I think the facts support the creation account , and not fairy tales .
The original questioner , Munjaros , questioned this definition ( though , oddly enough , not Ray ’s definition ) :
martin james :
I was unable to find your definition of atheist in the dictionary .
Did you make it up ?
If we ’re redefining words here we ’re going to run into problems communicating .
Then , Ray , unable to understand how commenting works on these crazy , newfangled “ blogs , ” thought Martin was questioning his infinite wisdom and decided to respond .
He not only misunderstood the unintelligent conversation taking place , he took the question out of context and changed the question - being - referenced ( in other words , he lied ) :
>
Ok , maybe it was just an honest mistake .
What was Ray ’s response ?
Martin , I find it interesting that you appeal to the absolute authority of the dictionary .
Was n’t it written by men ?
Do n’t men make mistakes ?
Are n’t there all sorts of different versions ?
Which one is right ?
Has n’t it changed down through the ages ?
Besides , who are they ( whoever “ they ” are ) to say what ’s right and what ’s wrong when it comes to word definitions ?
There are no verbal absolutes .
Everyone to his own .
However , I think we can still communicate .
Oh my god , Ray Comfort does n’t believe in dictionaries .
He also says all that without the least bit of irony .
All an atheist has to do is replace the word “ dictionary ” with “ Bible ” in that whole rant to make an easy argument against taking the Bible literally .

Opinion Shariah
Is for Everyone !
The archbishop of Canterbury has proposed a partial introduction of Islamic Shariah law in Great Britain .
This is yet another step on the part of the Western world to subjugate itself to a Muslim immigrant minority unwilling to integrate .

Jan. 8 , 2008  --
The Defense Department 's top watchdog has declined to investigate allegations that an American woman working under an Army contract in Iraq was raped by her co-workers .
The case of former Halliburton / KBR employee Jamie Leigh Jones gained national attention last month .
An ABC News investigation revealed how an earlier investigation into Jones ' alleged gang - rape in 2005 had not resulted in any prosecution , and that neither Jones nor Democratic and Republican lawmakers have been able to get answers from the Bush administration on the state of her case .
In letters to lawmakers , DoD Inspector General Claude Kicklighter said that because the Justice Department still considers the investigation into Jones ' case open , there is no need for him to look into the matter .
" [ T ]he U.S. Justice Department has issued a statement that they are investigating the allegations , " wrote Kicklighter 's office to Sen.
Bill Nelson , D - Fla. , who had requested he look into the matter .
" No further investigation by this agency into the allegations made by [ Jones ] is warranted . "
" We 're not satisfied with that , " a Nelson spokesman said .
Jones ' lawyers also professed disappointment .
" How could the Department of Defense refuse to help [ Jones ] ? ' " asked attorney Stephanie Morris , who noted that the criminal investigation into Jones ' allegations has been going on for more than two and a half years , without apparent results .
Despite deferring to the Justice Department , Kicklighter 's office told Nelson it was willing to pursue other questions Nelson raised about Jones ' case .
Kicklighter agreed to explore " whether and why " a U.S.
Army doctor handed to KBR security officials the results of Jones ' medical examination , a so - called " rape kit , " which would have contained evidence of the crime if it had occurred .
In a separate letter , Kicklighter 's office said that the State Department had said its security officials had Jones ' rape kit in their possession at one point .
The State Department 's Bureau of Diplomatic Security told Kicklighter " evidence in the rape kit was collected by a U.S. Army doctor and was later provided to [ the Bureau of Diplomatic Security ] , " the IG 's office wrote to Sen.
Daniel Akaka , D - Alaska , who had asked about Jones ' case .
An Army spokesman referred questions about the rape kit to the State Department , which declined to provide new information on the case .
Halliburton / KBR , a Houston , Texas - based government contractor once led by Vice President Dick Cheney , employed Jones until shortly after her alleged assault .
Halliburton spun off KBR last year .
Jones has since filed suit against KBR and Halliburton .
Halliburton says they have been wrongly named in the suit ; KBR has maintained that " the safety and security of all employees remains KBR 's top priority , " it said in a statement .
" Our commitment in this regard is unwavering . "
Nelson and other lawmakers have also requested information on rape allegations by Jones and others from the Department of State , which initially investigated Jones ' allegations , and the Department of Justice .
To date , none have reported receiving information .

One of the grand challenges in the study of the brain and neurons is to try and understand what is being computed .
To put this in perspective , a digital computer is made up from a bunch of analog circuit elements that are driven in such away that their output can be interpreted as a digital signal .
Furthermore , we understand the dynamics of both individual and groups of transistors pretty well , so given an electric current and a bunch of transistors in a circuit , we can predict the output of the circuit quite accurately .
We can also understand what the circuit is computing either as a digital computer or an analog computer .
In contrast , the dynamics of neurons are understood very well .
That is , given a bunch of wired up neurons , we can simulate their behavior very well using models .
But we have no clue as to what they are computing .
This is n't because we do n't , in some sense , understand the " language , " it is far more fundamental than that — if neurons were logic gates , we would n't be able to distinguish AND gates from OR gates .
On further examination , this is even stranger because , like transistors , we have a pretty good idea about how synapses fire and what triggers them .
True , we can't build neurons like we build transistors , but we still understand the mechanics of the computational end of the neuron pretty well .
Put simply , we understand how they work , we can predict their behavior , but we have no clue what they actually do .
Now researchers have shown that they are able to relate computational concepts to the dynamical properties of neurons .
The result is limited to a class of neurons that exhibit a constant spiking rate but have a varying interval between spikes .
The dynamical behavior of such a neuron is described by how the time interval between two pulses is modified by an input stimuli .
This is called the phase - resetting curve .
Computationally , we are more interested in what features in a stimuli result in spiking .
This is called the spike triggered average .
What the researchers have shown is that the spike triggered average and the phase - resetting curve are mathematically related .
The spike triggered average is proportional to the derivative of the phase - resetting curve , which relates a dynamical property of the neuron to a computational property of the neuron .
The researchers showed that this is analytically true for a particular class of neurons , provided that the stimulation is not too big .
Furthermore , measurements on real neurons have confirmed the finding .
This step does n't yet answer the question of what a neuron , or circuit of neurons is calculating , but it is a step that may make answering that question easier .

Police officers in Daytona Beach are swabbing the mouths of persons of interests during traffic stops with special DNA kits in the hunt for an elusive serial killer , sources close to the investigation told Local 6 .
A profiler said the serial killer is likely clean cut and probably has a wife or girlfriend .
And , the Daytona Beach police Chief , Mike Chitwood , said detectives have the killer ’s DNA .
“ Genetically , we know who he is , ” Chitwood said .
“ We have DNA evidence from the murder scenes — so , we got that .
That is never going to go away .
And , sooner or later , we will match the DNA to the physical person and bring closure to everything that is going on . ”
Agents are using the DNA kits to collect as much DNA as possible during traffic stops and special operations in hopes on making a match .
Local 6 showed agents stopping a person of interest from Canada , who gave his DNA to officers on the street using the DNA kit .
The DNA kits are also being used in prostitution stings in the area .
Chitwood said over time , modern technology will lead to the killer .
“ I can tell you that we are working really , really hard , ” Chitwood said .
“ I can tell you that there are a lot of things going on behind the scenes . ”

In the world of commercial materials , lighter and cheaper is usually better , especially when those attributes are coupled with superior strength and special properties , such as a material 's ability to remember its original shape after it's been deformed by a physical or magnetic force .
A new class of materials known as " magnetic shape - memory foams " has been developed by two research teams headed by Peter Müllner at Boise State University and David Dunand at Northwestern University .
The foam consists of a nickel - manganese - gallium alloy whose structure resembles a piece of Swiss cheese with small voids of space between thin , curvy " struts " of material .
The struts have a bamboo - like grain structure that can lengthen , or strain , up to 10 percent when a magnetic field is applied .
Strain is the degree to which a material deforms under load .
In this instance , the force came from a magnetic field rather a physical load .
Force from magnetic fields can be exerted over long range , making them advantageous for many applications .
The alloy material retains its new shape when the field is turned off , but the magnetically sensitive atomic structure returns to its original structure if the field is rotated 90 degrees -- a phenomenon called " magnetic shape - memory . "
Making large single crystals of the alloy material is too slow and expensive to be commercially viable -- one of the reasons why gems are so costly -- so the researchers make polycrystalline alloys , which contain many small crystals or grains .
Traditional polycrystalline materials are not porous and exhibit near zero strains due to mechanical constraints at the boundaries between each grain .
In contrast , a single crystal exhibits a large strain as there are no internal boundaries .
By introducing voids into the polycrystalline alloy , the researchers have made a porous material that has less internal mechanical constraint and exhibits a reasonably large degree of strain .
The researchers created the new material by pouring molten alloy into a piece of porous sodium aluminate salt .
Once the material cooled , they leached out the salt with acid , leaving behind large voids .
The researchers then exposed the porous alloy to a rotating magnetic field .
The level of strain achieved after each of the over 10 million rotations is consistent with the best currently used magnetic actuators , and Müllner and Dunand expect to significantly improve the strain when they have further optimized the foam 's architecture .
" The base alloy material was previously known , but it was n't very effective for shape - memory applications , " Dunand said .
" The porous nature of the material amplifies the shape - change effect , making it a good candidate for tiny motion control devices or biomedical pumps without moving parts . "
NSF Program Director Harsh Deep Chopra agrees .
" It 's the first foam to exhibit magnetic shape memory - it has great potential for uses that require a large strain and light weight such as space applications and automobiles .
These materials are able to do more with less material given their foamy structure and provide a sustainable approach to materials development . "

Mankind ’s relationship with the universe is best described by Buzz Lightyear ’s catchphrase , “ To infinity and beyond ! ”
In the age of innovation , each day brings us closer to what is beyond .
Locating and studying exoplanets is one of the most recent efforts in space travel .
Learn more about their properties and potential through these facts .
It might make you feel like a speck in the universe – but perhaps in a good way .
Quick Facts Essential Facts Interesting Facts Scientists have discovered 4,187 exoplanets .
These exoplanets are grouped into 3,105 systems ( like our Solar system ) .
1 out of 5 sun - like stars have an exoplanet orbiting around it .
In the Milky way alone , there could be 40 million exoplanets .
The most recent exoplanet discovery was 6 new planets .
16th century philosopher Giordano Bruno first proposed the idea that other stars can have planets orbiting around them like the sun .
Astronomers rejected the existence of exoplanets in the 19th century .
Exoplanets orbit around stars outside the solar system .
Because of this , they are also called extrasolar planets .
Science defines planets as astronomical bodies that orbit around a star .
To be considered a planet , a celestial body must be big enough to clear out its surroundings of any particulates .
The first confirmed exoplanet sighting was made in 1992 .
Exoplanets form around tens to millions of years after a star ’s birth .
Exoplanetology or exoplanetary science dedicates its study to locating and identifying exoplanets .
NASA identified 97 % of all confirmed exoplanets through indirect techniques .
Exoplanets can be as small as the moon or as large as Jupiter .
Most exoplanets are hard to spot due to the glare of the star they are orbiting .
The bigger an exoplanet , the easier it is to identify .
The first exoplanets were called “ hot Jupiters . ”
Some stars can have more than one planet orbiting it .

Earth - like exoplanets could support alien life .
It might sound crazy to us , but believers of the extraterrestrial are n’t exactly wrong .
In fact , a handful of the confirmed exoplanets lie within the habitable zone .
Also called the Goldilocks zone , this refers to the range where a planet ’s distance from a star can still support life .
Exoplanets within a star ’s habitable zone have the potential to carry life under the right atmospheric pressure .
Scientists estimate that the nearest Earth - like exoplanet could be 12 lightyears away from Earth .
The darkest planet in the known universe is an exoplanet .
For one , the darkest planet known to man is the TrES - 2b exoplanet .
This exoplanet reflects less than 1 % of its host star ’s light .
As a result , TrES - 2b reflects less light than coal or black acrylic paint .
Hot Jupiter exoplanets typically have a lot of sodium and potassium in their atmosphere , hence the dark color .
However , the exact chemical compound that makes TrES - 2b darker than the rest remains undiscovered .
Astronomers identified the color of an exoplanet for the first time in 2013 .
People might have started studying extrasolar planets in the 1990s , but it was n’t until 2013 that an exoplanet ’s color was properly identified for the first time .
Astronomers measured the albedo of HD 189733 b to find that it was a deep , dark blue .
From there , they were also able to identify the colors of other exoplanets .
GJ 504 b was calculated to have a magenta color , while Kappa Andromedae b would appear reddish up - close .
Astronomers believe that helium planets are either white or grey .

10 billion Earth - like planets could exist within the Milky Way .
If we ’re talking about the rest of the universe , this number expands tenfold .
Kepler 22 b made history in 2011 as the first exoplanet found within the habitable zone .
When the news broke out , people were quick to label it as a “ super Earth ” that we could possibly live in .
However , with a distance of 587 light - years from Earth , it would take eons to reach this exoplanet .
Currently , it is still under observation .
NASA ’s Kepler Space Telescope discovered most of the exoplanets we know now .
First launched in 2009 , NASA launched Kepler to locate extrasolar planets .
Initially , the Kepler mission was supposed to last only 3.5 years .
However , it was n’t until 2018 that NASA retired the Kepler project after the telescope got incapacitated .
All in all , Kepler observed 530,506 stars and located 2,662 exoplanets .
Now , NASA ’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ( TEES ) continues the search for exoplanets , discovering 1730 candidates and 41 confirmed exoplanets so far .
Stars with higher metallicity are more likely to host exoplanets .
Most physical matter in the universe consists of hydrogen and helium .
Metallicity is the term astronomers use to describe all elements other than hydrogen and helium .
According to data gathered from the Kepler telescope , stars with more varied elements are more likely to have extrasolar planets orbiting around them .
Gravitational microlensing uses other stars to spot an exoplanet .
Gravitational microlensing is similar to radial velocity , except this method involves another star aside from the exoplanet ’s host .
When one star passes in front of another star , its gravity acts like a lens that magnifies the other star ’s light .
If the “ lens ” star has a planet orbiting it , the exoplanet ’s mass increases the magnifying effect .
This is what astronomers used to locate over 20 exoplanets .
Most exoplanets were discovered through radial velocity .
The general rule of thumb for identifying exoplanets is to observe the star ’s motion .
Also called the Doppler ’s wobble , this method is the most successful one yet with almost 400 exoplanets discovered .
A star ’s radial velocity changes when it has an exoplanet exerting gravitational pull around it .
As such , the star will look like it ’s “ wobbling , ” hence the name .
The transit method is the simplest method to find exoplanets .
The transit method is one you can see for yourself .
Twinkle Twinkle , Little Star takes on a new meaning in terms of the transit method .
Observed from the Earth , astronomers estimate the orbits and masses of extrasolar planets through the amount and frequency of a star ’s “ twinkling . ”

The Giant Pacific octopus is the world 's largest species of octopus
Louis regularly plays with the Mr Potato Head figure which was given to him as part of an enrichment project at Newquay 's Blue Reef Aquarium .
" We wanted an octopus - friendly toy which had a compartment to hide food in , " said the aquarium 's Matt Slater .
He says Louis gets very excited when sees the toy , which he plays with for an hour at a time .
" Its bright colours , strange shape and moveable parts make it fascinating for Louis , " said Mr Slater .
" The secret space within Mr Potato Head allows us to hide tasty treats like fresh crab inside and that perhaps more than anything has resulted in him becoming such a hit . "
In the past , keepers have used everything from perspex boxes to rubber toys and even fishing floats to keep Louis , who came from Vancouver about nine months ago , mentally active .
Mr Potato Head is definitely his favourite at the moment
Matt Slater , curator Blue Reef Aquarium
The giant Pacific octopus is the world 's largest species of octopus and are found from Japan to Southern California .
The biggest recorded specimen had a span of 10 m ( 33 ft ) and weighed 270 kgs ( 600lbs ) .
Louis , who is 18 months old , stretches about 1.5 m from tip to tip .
As well as being the largest , the giant Pacifics are also among the cleverest members of the cephalopod family .
" Louis is well known for his curiosity and intelligence , " said Mr Slater .
" We 've devised a series of puzzles , games and toys to ensure he 's getting the mental stimulation he needs , but Mr Potato Head is definitely his favourite at the moment . "
A European Union commissioner issued an official statement about the legality of printer tracking dot systems last month in response to a query from a member of the European Parliament .
The commissioner states that no laws presently address the issue , but notes that it could possibly constitute a violation of the right to privacy guaranteed by the European Union 's Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
Privacy advocates have been aware for years that many color printers and photocopiers sold in the United States use patterns of nearly - invisible yellow dots to encode identifying information about the originating printer in every printed page .
Although few details are available regarding the ultimate function of the watermark or the manner in which the information is used , it is generally characterized as a means through which law enforcement agencies can identify counterfeiters .
There is no way to know , however , whether the government 's use of the watermarks extends beyond that function .
The watermark could easily be used by the government to perform identification without any kind of judicial oversight .
Some believe that the information could be potentially be used to identify and harass political dissidents .
Critics argue that the system threatens to undermine the practice of anonymous pamphleteering — a time - honored vehicle for political dissent that has been used in America since before the Revolutionary War .
" The Commission is not aware of any specific laws either at national or at Community level governing tracking mechanisms in colour laser printers and photocopiers , " wrote Commissioner Franco Frattini in an official statement ( .DOC ) .
" To the extent that individuals may be identified through material printed or copied using certain equipment , such processing may give rise to the violation of fundamental human rights , namely the right to privacy and private life .
It also might violate the right to protection of personal data . "
In the United States , the Electronic Frontier Foundation is leading a campaign to increase awareness of potential abuses associated with the watermarking .
The organization hopes to eventually amass enough information about it to be able to challenge the practice in court .
If the European Union decides to pursue the matter itself , it could potentially pressure U.S. printer manufacturers into providing more specific details that illuminate the extent to which watermarking threatens individual privacy .

Some Western European countries are getting serious about transporting consumer goods through automated subterranean networks – introducing a fifth transport mode next to road , rail , air and water .
This rare combination of low - tech sense and high - tech knowledge could lead to a further economic growth without destroying the environment and the quality of life .
Super fast underground cargo transport is a favourite subject of futurologists .
Yet , the key to the feasibility of the proposed systems is their very low but constant speed .
If water , sewage , gas and oil can be transported through underground pipelines , why not consumer goods as well ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
" You could order something on the internet and pick it up in your cellar the next morning "
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sending cargo goods through underground pipelines is anything but new .
As early as the second half of the 19th century , systems for the transport of mail and small packages became quite common in most world cities .
In these pneumatic post networks ( they are still in use in some shops and large buildings today ) , little capsules are propelled by means of air pressure through tubes , reaching a speed of around 35 km/h ( 25 mph ) .
Paris and Berlin had more than 400 kilometres of extensive citywide networks that were in use until the end of the 20th century – in Prague , the pneumatic system was even operating until 2002 when it was damaged by a flood .
In the United States , the technique was already abandoned in the 50s , in favour of trucks and new communication technology .
Especially in Paris the system ( which was mainly located in the sewers ) became very sophisticated , with upgrades to larger diameters and the introduction of two - way traffic and automatic navigation .
( map : pneumatic post network of Paris , click to enlarge )
Note that pneumatic systems could deliver physical objects , which is hard to do with email or any other automatic technology in use today .
Revival
Since the 60s several attempts were made to transport goods by pneumatic networks with a much larger diameter ( picture below : capsule system in Ontario ) .
Lines were built in the US , the UK , Canada , Russia , Japan and Germany .
However , they never became much of a success .
Also today , several inventors and companies try to revive the technique .
It ’s not hard to find out why : due to traffic congestion , a courier in a truck today needs considerably more time to deliver a package than the pneumatic post systems of the 19th century .
However , even though the concept clearly works , simply copying the two centuries old technology is not the way forward .
Pneumatic driven systems consume quite some energy and they are not suited for longer distances ( which are , by the way , also the problems of compressed air cars ) .
Some try to eliminate these drawbacks by designing tubular systems based on an electromagnetic drive , a technique that in the future could be used to reach very high speeds .

A courier in a truck today needs considerably more time to deliver a package than the pneumatic post systems of the 19th century
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most viable techniques , however , adopt just the concept of automated underground transport : they make use of well - known electric propulsion instead of compressed air or electromagnetic forces , and they envision extreme low speeds of 7 to 35 kilometres per hour ( 4 to 22 mph ) .
In fact , they mix the concept of pneumatic transport with that of an automated subway line or a conveyor belt .
Container traffic
Germany , Holland and Belgium are closest to implementing an underground logistic network .
That ’s no coincidence .
In spite of their extensive road networks , these countries face an enormous traffic overload .
Three of the top ten ports in the world – Hamburg , Rotterdam and Antwerp – are situated at just a few hundred kilometres away from each other .
A massive amount of goods has to be transported from the ports to the hinterland .
And things will become much worse , since the ports keep expanding their container handling capacity .
In all three countries , road cargo transport is expected at least to double in 2020 , which would completely clog the existing ( and planned ) road infrastructure .
Underground conveyor belt
In Belgium , the University of Antwerp designed and proposed an underground logistic system that would transport large 40 - ft containers from the newly built container dock in the harbour to an existing marshalling yard and a planned inland navigation hub on the other bank of the river .
The project , called “ Underground Container Mover ” would consist of an electric driven conveyor belt of nearly 21 kilometres that would transport 5,500 shipping containers each day ( and night ) .
More than 20 computer - controlled perpendicular shafts would drop the containers from the wharf to the underground , 22 to 28 metres below .
The slow moving conveyor belt ( travelling at a speed of just 7 kilometres per hour ) will not even be stopped while loading and unloading the containers .
According to the construction firm Denys , who is candidate to build the system , it could be ready in 4 years .
Electric vehicles
In Germany , the Ruhr University of Bochum is working on a rather different concept , called the CargoCap project .
The German system is designed for much smaller loads and makes use of unmanned electric vehicles on rails that travel through pipelines with a diameter of only 1.6 metres .
Each vehicle , called a ‘ Cap ’ , is designed for the transportation of two European standard pallets .
The German system is designed for use on a regional scale ( up to 150 kilometres ) in a much more finely woven network .
Each vehicle is programmed to follow a certain path to its destination .
While the Belgian system is still only on the drawing board , the German engineers are already conducting experiments with a large - scale model .
There is a distance of 2 meters between two vehicles , which enables a branching system to unload the single caps out of a collective without speed reduction .
To prevent blockages , each vehicle is equipped with several motors , so that in case of a breakdown the vehicle does not stop the flow of traffic and can reach the next station
The German system resembles research that was conducted in Holland almost ten years ago .
The Dutch then investigated the possibility of an underground logistic network that spanned the whole country .
Email for things
The ambitious plan consisted of a finely - woven network with one hub for every 1,000 to 5,000 homes , which boiled down to a maximum walking distance of 750 meters to pick up goods ( the information is not on the internet , data and illustration taken from paper brochure ) .
These concepts offer exciting possibilities .
Goods can be transported from factories to stores , from factories to factories or even from stores to consumers - in the long run , the infrastructure could become so intricate that goods can be delivered to individual homes .
You could order something on the internet and pick it up through a trapdoor in your cellar the next morning .
In the Dutch plan , the city hubs would also offer the possibility to send goods to other cities , which would effectively turn them into a democratized courier service .
It might also become possible to send goods from one home to another : email for things .
A constant flow of goods
But even without a trapdoor in the cellar the advantages are surprisingly large .
Trucks are an important cause of noise and air pollution , they bring about severe traffic accidents , they consume a lot of fuel and they demand a lot of space .
An automated , underground transport system erases all these problems .
Thanks to the automated control , the low speed and the higher efficiency of the electric drive , the energy consumption of the system is much lower than that of any other form of transport .
Moreover , harmful batteries are not needed since the vehicles receive electricity from the rails .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
" Thanks to the automated control , the low speed and the higher efficiency of the electric drive , the energy consumption of the system is much lower than that of any other form of transport "
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The economical advantages are as important as the ecological ones , but less obvious .
Firstly , goods can be delivered much faster , in spite of the much lower speed .
It ’s the constant flow of movement that makes an underground automated system fast .
Trucks have to wait at traffic lights and they can get stuck for hours because of traffic jams or weather conditions .
The driver also has to sleep , and accidents can happen .
Even more important than the higher delivery speed , is the fact that a separate , automated infrastructure makes it possible to predict very accurately when goods will arrive .
That makes it possible for companies to lower the amount of warehouses .
In fact , in such a system , supply chains become physically connected to each other : the conveyor belts actually leave the factories and connect several production facilities as if they were one large , regional or even global production facility .
Last but not least , automated transport is cheaper – not only because of the more reliable delivery of the goods , but also because there are no drivers to pay and because energy use is much lower .
Buried in silence
The most important problem of an underground logistics infrastructure is the initial cost .
The Dutch calculated that their nationwide network would cost them around 60 billion Euros – and that ’s ten years ago .
The plan was buried in silence .
Nevertheless , the researchers also calculated that an extension of the road infrastructure would cost almost as much .
That ’s because the maintenance costs ( paying the truck drivers , repairing the roads ) and the external costs ( economical losses due to traffic jams , accidents and pollution - related diseases ) are much higher with a road network .
But extending the road network has one , important benefit : it concerns the extension of an already existing infrastructure , which means that it immediately yields results .
Developing a new ( inter ) national underground transport system , on the other hand , asks an enormous initial investment and the results are only visible after some decennia .
It ’s long term thinking versus short term thinking , and humans ( especially politicians ) invariably prefer the latter .

With water fast becoming a hot commodity , especially in drought - prone regions with burgeoning populations , an obvious solution is to take the salt out of seawater .
Desalination technology has been around for thousands of years , after all .
Even Aristotle worked on the problem .
Tantalizing as desalinated water might sound , the energy costs have made it rather unpalatable .
" Until recently , seawater desalination was a very expensive water source solution , " said Gary Crisp , an engineer for the Water Corporation of Western Australia .
Drinking seawater straight is a bad idea because your body must expel the salt by urinating more water than it actually gains .
Seawater contains roughly 130 grams of salt per gallon .
Desalination can reduce salt levels to below 2 grams per gallon , which is the limit for safe human consumption .
Currently , between 10 and 13 billion gallons of water are desalinated worldwide per day .
That 's only about 0.2 percent of global water consumption , but the number is increasing .
" There is significant growth in desalination capacity throughout the world , and it is anticipated to continue for sometime , " says Stephen Gray of Victoria University .
Gray has been chosen to lead a new research program in Australia — where many regions lack fresh water supplies — to improve the efficiency of desalination plants .
Aristotle 's efforts
Back in the 4th century B.C. , Aristotle imagined using successive filters to remove the salt from seawater .
But the first actual practice of desalination involved collecting the freshwater steam from boiling saltwater .
Around 200 A.D. , sailors began desalinating seawater with simple boilers on their ships .
The energy required for this distillation process today makes it prohibitively expensive on a large scale .
A lot of the current market for so - called " thermal desalination " has therefore been in oil - rich , water - poor countries in the Middle East .
Since the 1950s , researchers have been developing membranes that could filter out salt , similar to what Aristotle originally envisioned .
Presently , this membrane technique , sometimes called " reverse osmosis , " requires one - fourth of the energy and costs half of the price of distilling saltwater .
" In the last ten years , seawater reverse - osmosis has matured into a viable alternative to thermal desalination , " Crisp says .
Energy is key
But even with membranes , large amounts of energy are needed to generate the high pressure that forces the water through the filter .
Current methods require about 14 kilowatt - hours of energy to produce 1,000 gallons of desalinated seawater .
A typical American uses 80 to 100 gallons of water a day , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
The entire country consumes about 323 billion gallons per day of surface water and another 84.5 billion gallons of ground water .
If half of this water came from desalination , the United States would need more than 100 extra electric power plants , each with a gigawatt of capacity .
Depending on local energy prices , 1,000 gallons of desalinated seawater can cost around $ 3 or $ 4 .
Although that might not seem like much , it is still cheaper in many places to pump water out of the ground or import it from somewhere else .
But the price difference will undoubtedly narrow , especially in regions that could experience more intense droughts owing to climate change .
Water use has been growing twice as fast as population growth , causing more and more communities to suffer water shortages .
The demand for freshwater supplies will drive prices higher , making desalination increasingly attractive .
Brainstorming on membranes
The number of desalination plants worldwide has grown to more than 15,000 , and efforts continue to make them more affordable .
Last month , Australia 's largest scientific research agency joined with nine major universities in a membrane research program to reduce desalination energy costs , as well as maintenance costs associated with gunk sticking to membranes and fouling them up .
" Lowering the energy required for desalination and the fouling propensity of membranes are the two biggest challenges facing desalination , " Gray says .
A team of diverse researchers will try to tackle these problems by developing new types of membrane materials .
The goal is to cut in half the energy required for desalination .
" We would hope to have something available within the next 10 years , " Gray said .
CAMBRIDGE , Mass .
The head of the Federal Communications Commission and other senior officials said on Monday that they were considering taking steps to discourage cable and telephone companies from discriminating against content providers as the broadband companies go about managing heavy Internet traffic that they say is clogging their networks .
The agency is considering new rules and enforcement decisions that would force the cable and telephone companies to more clearly disclose to consumers the circumstances in which they might delay some traffic .
Comcast recently disclosed that the heavy use of video sharing applications has forced them to slow down some broadband traffic .
Consumer groups have replied that such packet discrimination is both unnecessary and potentially threatens to undermine the freewheeling nature of the Internet .
“ They must be conducted in an open and transparent way , ” said Kevin J. Martin , chairman of the Federal Communications Commission , at a hearing on network neutrality and network management here Monday .
“ While networks may have reasonable practices , they obviously cannot operate without taking some reasonable steps but that does not mean they can arbitrarily block access to certain services . ”
Michael J. Copps , a Democratic commissioner , said that until recently , the cable companies had been decided “ in a black box that the American public could not peek into . ”
He expressed alarm that any cable companies might be degrading or slowing down network traffic .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Columbia University said Thursday it has sanctioned for plagiarism the African - American professor on whose office door a noose was found last fall .
Madonna Constantine says she 's innocent of plagiarism , but Columbia University defends its sanctions .
Madonna Constantine , professor of psychology and education at the university 's Teachers College , was not dismissed , the university said .
Thursday 's announcement came after an 18 - month investigation , conducted by the law firm of Hughes Hubbard and Reed , said Marcia Horowitz , a Teachers College spokeswoman .
In a report presented in December to Teachers College administrators , the firm concluded that in two dozen cases , Constantine 's published works contained language similar to passages in papers written by others , including a former teacher at the school and two of Constantine 's former students .
In a statement addressed to the Teachers College community , the 44 - year - old professor said she is innocent and called the action " premature , vindictive , and mean - spirited . "
" It is my opinion that this investigation , along with other incidents that have happened to me at Teachers College in recent months , point to a conspiracy and witch hunt by certain current and former members of the Teachers College community , " she wrote .
Constantine also accused college administrators of not following due process , a charge the college denied .
" She was given a full and fair opportunity to respond to the allegations against her , " Horowitz said .
" She was provided with copies of the journal works where similarities were found and was given an opportunity to explain them .
All appropriate legal processes were followed . "
Constantine co-wrote the book , " Addressing Racism : Facilitating Cultural Competence in Mental Health and Educational Settings . "

e Bay earnings have been hurt recently by its Skype purchase
She will step down on 31 March and is set to be replaced by John Donahoe , who is currently in charge of the firm 's main auction business , eBay said .
The news came as the US firm posted a market - beating 53 % rise in profits for the three months to December .
Ms Whitman has been lauded for turning eBay into a powerhouse in e-commerce .
She will remain a director at the firm .
There had been speculation about her departure earlier this week so it did not come as a shock , while it was also known that Mr Donahoe was being groomed to take over the top job .
Analyst Martin Pykkonen at Global Crown Capital , called the appointment " no big surprise " .
" It 's more a question of what he 's going to do ... about fundamentally regenerating their revenue growth rate with sustainable margins , " he said .
Under pressure
When Ms Whitman joined the company in 1998 , eBay said it had $ 4 m in revenue and 30 employees .
It has since grown into a multi-billion dollar firm with 15,000 employees and has expanded into a variety of businesses , including buying online payments service PayPal and internet telephone service provider Skype .
But growth in its core listings business has stagnated and analysts are keenly anticipating a new strategy to deal with increasing competition .
e Bay 's guidance on earnings for the coming year fell short of expectations and it is expected that its shares will fall when trading opens in New York on Thursday .

McLaren no longer have a February hearing hanging over them
F1's governing body , the FIA , has cancelled a hearing into the legality of McLaren 's 2008 car after the team issued an apology last week .
McLaren admitted leaked Ferrari data was more " widely disseminated " within their camp than previously suspected .
The FIA 's response came after McLaren said they would freeze any development of their 2008 car derived from Ferrari .
McLaren were fined £ 50 m and lost their constructors ' points in September for possessing a 780 - page document of confidential Ferrari technical information .
But last week was the first time they had admitted the data went further into the company than to chief designer Mike Coughlan , and drivers Fernando Alonso and Pedro de la Rosa .
In the light of McLaren 's admission , apology and actions , FIA president Max Mosley last week asked the body 's world council " for their consent to cancel the hearing scheduled for 14 February 2008 and , in the interests of the sport , to consider this matter closed . "
Mosley 's request to the WMSC has been accepted , meaning McLaren can race next year without fear of additional penalties and the F1 " spy- gate " can be brought to a close .
The FIA 's response came after McLaren said they would freeze development of three aspects of their 2008 design which may have been derived from the Ferrari document .
The FIA 's investigation into the design of the 2008 McLaren concluded that the team were planning to use systems which " appear to have been developed by McLaren as a result of the receipt of confidential Ferrari information " .
Ferrari have concurred with Mosley 's approach but are still to pursue the matter through the courts , both in Italy and England .
A Ferrari statement said : " In the light of McLaren 's apology , and the guarantees it has presented , Ferrari respects the proposal of the FIA president to cancel the extraordinary general meeting of the WMSC , thus bringing this incident to a close from a sporting point of view .
" However , it is confirmed that criminal actions are under way in Italy , and civil ones in England are still continuing . "
In a statement , McLaren confirmed that the concerns of the sport 's governing body , the FIA , over the use of the Ferrari data were legitimate .
" It has become clear that Ferrari information was more widely disseminated within McLaren than was previously communicated , " the team said on its website .
" McLaren has written to the WMSC to apologise that it has taken an FIA investigation to find this information and have expressed our deep regret that our understanding of the facts was improved as a result of the FIA inspection rather than our own investigations . "

Both Mr Rudd and Indigenous Affairs Minister Jenny Macklin received a standing ovation as they entered the Great Hall before the Prime Minister delivered the speech .
The reading of the 361 - word apology was completed by 9.30 am and was watched by hundreds of parliamentarians , former prime ministers and representatives of the indigenous community .
Former prime ministers Paul Keating , Bob Hawke , Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser and Sir William Deane were all seated on the floor of the Parliament as well as 17 people representing the stolen generation .
Removing a stain from the soul of Australia
In another address directly after reading the apology , Mr Rudd spoke of removing a " stain from the soul of Australia " .
" The time has come , well and truly come ... for all Australians , those who are indigenous and those who are not to come together , truly reconcile and together build a truly great nation . "
The Prime Minister also discussed the first - hand accounts in the Keating government - sponsored report Bringing Them Home .
" There is something terribly primal about these first - hand accounts .
The pain is searing , it screams from the pages - the hurt , the humiliation , the degradation and the sheer brutality of the act of physically separating a mother from her children is a deep assault on our senses and on our most elemental sense of humanity .
" These stories cry out to be heard , they cry out for an apology .
" Instead from the nation 's Parliament there has been a stony and stubborn and deafening silence for more than a decade .
" A view that somehow we the Parliament should suspend our most basic instincts of what is right and what is wrong .
" A view that instead we should look for any pretext to push this great wrong to one side .
" To leave it languishing with the historians , the academics and the cultural warriors as if the stolen generations are little more than an interesting sociological phenomenon .
" But the stolen generations are not intellectual curiosities , they are human beings , human beings who have been damaged deeply by the decisions of parliaments and governments .
Time for denial is at an end " But as of today the time for denial , the time for delay , has at last come to an end . "
At 9.28 pm Mr Rudd finished his address , and was greeted by loud and lasting applause by both sides of the house .
He reached across the house 's table and shook the hand of Opposition Leader Brendan Nelson before returning to the front bench , where he himself applauded .
Brendan Nelson
Dr Nelson then stood and delivered a speech in support of the apology .
" We will be at our best today , and every day , if we call to place ourselves in the shoes of others , " he said , " imbued with the imaginative capacity to see this issue through their eyes with decency and respect .
" We cannot from the comfort of the 21st century begin to imagine what they overcame , indigenous and non-indigenous to give us what we have and make us who we are .
" We do know that language , disease , ignorance , good intentions , basic human prejudices and a cultural and technological chasm combined to create a harshness exceed only by the land .
" In saying we are sorry , and deeply sorry , we remind ourselves that each generation lives in ignorance of the long - term consequences of its actions . "
At the end of Mr Rudds 's speech , all MPs stood except for the Liberal MP Chris Pearce .
Mr Pearce did stand after Dr Nelson 's speech .
Liberal MPs Wilson Tuckey and Don Randall were not in the chamber .
People watching in the Great Hall turned their backs during Dr Nelson 's speech .
Paul Keating : words more important than money Mr Keating told ABC TV : " This is a day of open hearts .
" A country has always got to look for its golden threads and when we start looking for the black threads you lose your way , " he said .
" We lost our way for a decade looking for black threads .
" What is important is that when policy cut across the human spirit we are always in for misery and as a consequence the stolen generation was a cut right across the spirit of those people and the soul of the country . "
Mr Keating 's government was responsible for commissioning a report into the stolen generations which focused on possible processes of compensation .
However today , Mr Keating said words were more important than money .
" It is true the report does in some respects focus on compensation , " he said .
" The most important thing is the sorry .
The most important thing is the national emotional response .
I do n't believe that these separations or that sadness will ever be settled in a monetary sense .
" It can never be settled in a monetary sense .
Far more important in my term was to settle it in an emotional sense and that 's what the prime minister and government have done today . ''
Redfern
Mr Rudd 's speech received a standing ovation at the Redfern Community Centre , where hundreds gathered .
Residents , workers , families , students and Sydney 's Lord Mayor Clover Moore braved the rain to watch the speech via a large outdoor screen .
David Page , composer with the indigenous dance group Bangarra Dance Theatre , said he liked the fact that Mr Rudd made a personal apology .
" It was very moving to see a prime minister with a bit of heart .
I loved it when he said he was sorry .
There was just something personal about it .
It 's very hard for a prime minister to be personal , " he said .
Enid Williams , 72 , who was brought up on a mission in north Queensland after her father was forcibly removed from his family , said she was happy with Mr Rudd 's speech , but said it was now important to look to the future .
" I'm 72 .
The main thing is the young people , to give them a better future . "
Martin Place
At Martin Place in Sydney , hundreds of Sydneysiders from all walks of life gathered to watch the Sorry Day celebrations holding Australian , Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags .
Men and women in business suits , schoolchildren and other passers - by of all different backgrounds cried , smiled and stood in respect as they listened to Mr Rudd apologise .
Lawn at Parliament House
Many thousands more assembled on a lawn in front of Parliament House to watch the apology on a big screen .
As Mr Rudd delivered the first of three sorrys , loud applause and cheering rang out .
Aboriginal flags and Australian flags coloured the air and as Mr Rudd closed his address , the crowd rose to their feet in applause .
It was a standing ovation .
Many were crying , most were smiling and others just quietly said yes .
As Dr Nelson took the microphone , booing was heard .
One woman said he should n't have been allowed to speak .
Helen Ford , 70 , from Beacon Hill said Mr Rudd 's speech was magnificent .
" Mr Rudd 's speech was just magnificent .
It 's a wonderful day .
Pity about the Opposition speech . "
Ray Finn , 52 , from Oodnadatta , South Australia , said : " My family had been affected directly and I felt like the chain had finally broke from us .
" There 's still racism to deal with but hopefully from this day we 'll go forward together . "
Torres Straits Islander Lydia George , from Erub Island , said : " The first speech was very symbolic .
The second speaker tarnished it .
I was thinking of my granddaughter and her future is now , not tomorrow .
She 'll face a new future that will be bright .
The healing process has began . "
Wilson Tuckey
Mr Rudd 's speech was not greeted with unanimous approval , however , with Mr Tuckey telling Sky News shortly before 9 am he doubted the speech - which has bipartisan support - would change anything .
" So the Prime Minister reads a speech , apparently some people stand up and sit down and then a miracle happens over night , there 'll be no petrol sniffing ... and girls can sleep safely in the family bed at night , " he said .
When asked by Sky News if he supported the apology , a technical error occurred , with Mr Tuckey telling the camera he was unable to hear the question .

Following ground - breaking research showing that neurons in the human brain respond in an abstract manner to particular individuals or objects , University of Leicester researchers have now discovered that , from the firing of this type of neuron , they can tell what a person is actually seeing .
The original research by Dr R Quian Quiroga , of the University ’s Department of Engineering , showed that one neuron fired to , for instance , Jennifer Aniston , another one to Halle Berry , another one to the Sydney Opera House , etc .
The responses were abstract .
For example , the neuron firing to Halle Berry responded to several different pictures of her and even to the letters of her name , but not to other people or names .
This result , published in Nature in 2005 came from data from patients suffering from epilepsy .
As candidates for epilepsy surgery , they are implanted with intracranial electrodes to determine as accurately as possible the area where the seizures originate .
From that , clinicians can evaluate the potential outcome of curative surgery .
Dr Quian Quiroga ’s latest research , which has appeared in the Journal of Neurophysiology , follows on from this .
Dr Quian Quiroga explained : “ For example , if the ' Jennifer Aniston neuron ' increases its firing then we can predict that the subject is seeing Jennifer Aniston .
If the ' Halle Berry neuron ' fires , then we can predict that the subject is seeing Halle Berry , and so on .
“ To do this , we used and optimised a ' decoding algorithms ' , which is a mathematical method to infer the stimulus from the neuronal firing .
We also needed to optimise our recording and data processing tools to record simultaneously from as many neurons as possible .
Currently we are able to record simultaneously from up to 100 neurons in the human brain .

“ In these experiments we presented a large database of pictures , and discovered that we can predict what picture the subject is seeing far above chance .
So , in simple words , we can read the human thought from the neuronal activity .
“ Once we reached this point , we then asked what are the most fundamental features of the neuronal firing that allowed us to make this predictions .
This gave us the chance of studying basic principles of neural coding ; i.e. how information is stored by neurons in the brain .
“ For example , we found that there is a very limited time window in the neuronal firing that contains most of the information used for such predictions .
Interestingly , neurons fired only 4 spikes in average during this time window .
So , in another words , only 4 spikes of a few neurons are already telling us what the patient is seeing . ”
Potential applications of this discovery include the development of Neural Prosthetic devices to be used by paralysed patients or amputees .
A patient with a lesion in the spinal cord ( as with the late Christopher Reeves ) , can still think about reaching a cup of tea with his arm , but this order is not transmitted to the muscles .
The idea of Neural Prostheses is to read these commands directly from the brain and transmit them to bionic devices such as a robotic arm that the patient could control directly from the brain .
Dr Quian Quiroga ’s work showing that it is possible to read signals from the brain is a good step forward in this direction .
But there are still clinical and ethical issues that have to be resolved before Neural Prosthetic devices can be applied in humans .
In particular , these would involve invasive surgery , which would have to be justified by a clear improvement for the patient before it could be undertaken .
Being entirely honest with oneself is a good exercise .
Psychoanalysis ... should find a place among the methods whose aim is to bring about the highest ethical and intellectual development of the individual .

Letter to Wilhelm Fliess ( 25 March 1898 )
In the following pages , I shall demonstrate that there exists a psychological technique by which dreams may be interpreted and that upon the application of this method every dream will show itself to be a senseful psychological structure which may be introduced into an assignable place in the psychic activity of the waking state .
I shall furthermore endeavor to explain the processes which give rise to the strangeness and obscurity of the dream , and to discover through them the psychic forces , which operate whether in combination or opposition , to produce the dream .
This accomplished by investigation will terminate as it will reach the point where the problem of the dream meets broader problems , the solution of which must be attempted through other material .

Cruel though it may sound , we must see to it that the patient 's suffering , to a degree that is in some way or other effective , does not come to an end prematurely .
If , owing to the symptoms having been taken apart and having lost their value , his suffering becomes mitigated , we must re-instate it elsewhere in the form of some appreciable privation ; otherwise we run the danger of never achieving any improvements except quite insignificant and transitory ones Freud ( 1919 ) Lines of Advance in Psycho - Analytic Therapy .

Beyond the Pleasure Principle ( 1920 )
The unconscious is the larger circle which includes within itself the smaller circle of the conscious ; everything conscious has its preliminary step in the unconscious , whereas the unconscious may stop with this step and still claim full value as a psychic activity .
Properly speaking , the unconscious is the real psychic ; its inner nature is just as unknown to us as the reality of the external world , and it is just as imperfectly reported to us through the data of consciousness as is the external world through the indications of our sensory organs .
Dream Psychology : Psychoanalysis For Beginners ( 1920 ) as translated by M. D. Eder
The common characteristic of all perversions , on the other hand , is that they have abandoned reproduction as their aim .
We term sexual activity perverse when it has renounced the aim of reproduction and follows the pursuit of pleasure as an independent goal .
And so you realize that the turning point in the development of sexual life lies in its subjugation to the purpose of reproduction .
Everything this side of the turning point , everything that has given up this purpose and serves the pursuit of pleasure alone , must carry the term " perverse " and as such be regarded with contempt .

On his seventieth birthday ( 1926 ) ; as quoted in The Liberal Imagination ( 1950 ) by Lionel Trilling
The ego represents what we call reason and sanity , in contrast to the id which contains the passions .
It is easy to see that the ego is that part of the id which has been modified by the direct influence of the external world .
The ego represents what we call reason and sanity , in contrast to the id which contains the passions .
The sexual wishes in regard to the mother become more intense and the father is perceived as an obstacle to the mother ; this gives rise to the Oedipus complex .
We obtain our concept of the unconscious , therefore , from the theory of repression …
We see , however that we have two kinds of unconscious — that which is latent but capable of becoming conscious , and that which is repressed and not capable of becoming conscious in the ordinary way .
Die Zukunft einer Illusion
Religious doctrines … are all illusions , they do not admit of proof , and no one can be compelled to consider them as true or to believe in them .
If the truth of religious doctrines is dependent on an inner experience that bears witness to the truth , what is one to make of the many people who do not have that experience ?
The voice of the intellect is a soft one , but it does not rest until it has gained a hearing .
Ultimately , after endlessly repeated rebuffs , it succeeds .
This is one of the few points in which it may be optimistic about the future of mankind , but in itself it signifies not a little .
Es braucht nicht gesagt zu werden , daß eine Kultur , welche eine so große Zahl von Teilnehmern unbefriedigt läßt und zur Auflehnung treibt , weder Aussicht hat , sich dauernd zu erhalten , noch es verdient .
It goes without saying that a civilization which leaves so large a number of its participants unsatisfied and drives them into revolt neither has nor deserves the prospect of a lasting existence .
Religious ideas have sprung from the same need as all the other achievements of culture : from the necessity for defending itself against the crushing supremacy of nature .

Ch. 7
Our knowledge of the historical worth of certain religious doctrines increases our respect for them , but does not invalidate our proposal that they should cease to be put forward as the reasons for the precepts of civilization .
On the contrary !
Those historical residues have helped us to view religious teachings , as it were , as neurotic relics , and we may now argue that the time has probably come , as it does in an analytic treatment , for replacing the effects of repression by the results of the rational operation of the intellect .

Religion is a system of wishful illusions together with a disavowal of reality , such as we find nowhere else but in a state of blissful hallucinatory confusion .
Religion 's eleventh commandment is " Thou shalt not question . "
But man 's helplessness remains and along with it his longing for his father , and the gods .
The gods retain their threefold task : they must exorcise the terrors of nature , they must reconcile men to the cruelty of Fate , particularly as it is shown in death , and they must compensate them for the sufferings and privations which a civilized life in common has imposed on them .

It is impossible to escape the impression that people commonly use false standards of measurement — that they seek power , success and wealth for themselves and admire them in others , and that they underestimate what is of true value in life .
Ch. 1 , as translated by James Strachey , p.25
Towards the outside , at any rate , the ego seems to maintain clear and sharp lines of demarcation .
There is only one state — admittedly an unusual state , but not one that can be stigmatized as pathological — in which it does not do this .
At the height of being in love the boundary between ego and object threatens to melt away .
Against all the evidence of his senses , a man who is in love declares that " I " and " you " are one , and is prepared to behave as if it were a fact .

The first requisite of civilization , therefore , is that of justice — that is , the assurance that a law once made will not be broken in favour of an individual .
Ch. 3 , as translated by James Strachey , p.81
I cannot inquire into whether the abolition of private property is expedient or advantageous .
But I am able to recognize that the psychological premisses on which the [ system ] ] is based are an untenable illusion .
In abolishing private property we deprive the human love of aggression of one of its instruments , certainly a strong one , though certainly not the strongest , but we have not altered the differences in power and influence which are misused by aggressiveness , nor have we altered anything in its nature .
Aggressiveness was not created by property .
It reigned almost without limit in primitive times , when property was still very scanty , and it already shows itself in the nursery almost before property has given up its primal , anal form ; it forms the basis of every relation of affection and love among people ( with the single exception , perhaps , of the mother 's relations to her male child ) .

It is always possible to bind together a considerable number of people in love , so long as there are other people left over to receive manifestations of their aggressiveness .

Moses and Monotheism ( 1938 )
Man found that he was faced with the acceptance of " spiritual " forces , that is to say such forces as cannot be comprehended by the senses , particularly not by sight , and yet having undoubted , even extremely strong , effects .
If we may trust to language , it was the movement of the air that provided the image of spirituality , since the spirit borrows its name from the breath of wind ( animus , spiritus , Hebrew : ruach = smoke ) .
The idea of the soul was thus born as the spiritual principle in the individual .
Observation found the breath of air again in the human breath , which ceases with death ; even today we talk of a dying man breathing his last .
Now the realm of spirits had opened for man , and he was ready to endow everything in nature with the soul he had discovered in himself .

Lecture 31 , " The Dissection of the Psychical Personality ' ( 1933 ) .
One might compare the relation of the ego to the id with that between a rider and his horse .
The horse provides the locomotor energy , and the rider has the prerogative of determining the goal and of guiding the movements of his powerful mount towards it .
But all too often in the relations between the ego and the id we find a picture of the less ideal situation in which the rider is obliged to guide his horse in the direction in which it itself wants to go .

But all too often in the relations between the ego and the id we find a picture of the less ideal situation in which the rider is obliged to guide his horse in the direction in which it itself wants to go .

Thinking is an experimental dealing with small quantities of energy , just as a general moves miniature figures over a map before setting his troops in action .
Anxiety and Instinctual Life ( Lecture 32 )
If one wishes to form a true estimate of the full grandeur of religion , one must keep in mind what it undertakes to do for men .
It gives them information about the source and origin of the universe , it assures them of protection and final happiness amid the changing vicissitudes of life , and it guides their thoughts and motions by means of precepts which are backed by the whole force of its authority .
A Philosophy of Life ( Lecture 35 )

Religion is an illusion and it derives its strength from the fact that it falls in with our instinctual desires .
A Philosophy of Life ( Lecture 35 )
The expectation that every neurotic phenomenon can be cured may , I suspect , be derived from the layman 's belief that the neuroses are something quite unnecessary which have no right whatever to exist .
Whereas in fact they are severe , constitutionally fixed illnesses , which rarely restrict themselves to only a few attacks but persist as a rule over long periods throughout life .

A fear of weapons is a sign of retarded sexual and emotional maturity .
This is not a statement that has been found in any translation of any of Freud 's known works .
It is a paraphrase of a statement from the essay " Guns , Murders , and the Constitution " ( February 1990 ) by Don B. Kates , Jr. where Kates summarizes his views of passages in Dreams in Folklore ( 1958 ) by Freud and David E. Oppenheim , while disputing statements by Emmanuel Tanay in " Neurotic Attachment to Guns " in a 1976 edition of The Fifty Minute Hour : A Collection of True Psychoanalytic Tales ( 1955 ) by Robert Mitchell Lindner :
Dr. Tanay is perhaps unaware of — in any event , he does not cite — other passages more relevant to his argument .
In these other passages Freud associates retarded sexual and emotional development not with gun ownership , but with fear and loathing of weapons .
The probative importance that ought to be attached to the views of Freud is , of course , a matter of opinion .
The point here is only that those views provide no support for the penis theory of gun ownership .
After reading of this essay and its citations , this paraphrase of an opinion about Freud 's ideas has been attributed to Freud himself , and specifically to his 10th Lecture " Symbolism in Dreams " in General Introduction to Psychoanalysis on some internet forum pages : alt.quotations , uk.politics.guns , talk.politics.guns , can.talk.guns , etc .
One of the statements by Freud which Kates summarized from in Dreams in Folklore ( 1958 ) , p. 33 , reads : " The representation of the penis as a weapon , cutting knife , dagger etc. , is familiar to us from the anxiety dreams of abstinent women in particular and also lies at the root of numerous phobias in neurotic people .

The idea of a God was not a lie but a device of the unconscious which needed to be decoded by psychology .
A personal god was nothing more than an exalted father - figure : desire for such a deity sprang from infantile yearnings for a powerful , protective father , for justice and fairness and for life to go on forever .
God is simply a projection of these desires , feared and worshiped by human beings out of an abiding sense of helplessness .
Religion belonged to the infancy of the human race ; it had been a necessary stage in the transition from childhood to maturity .
It had promoted ethical values which were essential to society .
Now that humanity had come of age , however , it should be left behind .

When Freud turned his searing eye to socialism he saw a delusional philosophy [ … ]
To Freud , the communists of the twentieth century were engaged in a perfectionist political project [… ]
The central flaw Freud identified in socialist doctrine was the idea that private property is the primary , if not the sole , source of man ’s depravity .
With this foundational idea , socialists were able to say that man could be redeemed if , and only if , the institution of private property were abolished and replaced by a kinder , more humane system .
[ To Freud , ] Man’s “ depravity ” is rooted much deeper in his nature and the abolition of private property would do little or nothing to change his basic constitution .
[ Freud argued that ] socialism has its roots not in love and fraternity , as the socialists themselves would have us believe , but rather in revenge and aggression .
According to Freud , “ It is always possible to bind together a considerable number of people in love , so long as there are other people left over to receive the manifestations of their aggressiveness ” ( Freud 1961 , 72 ) .
Freud pointed to nascent Soviet Russia as evidence of this phenomenon : “ it is intelligible that the attempt to establish a new , communist civilization in Russia should find its psychological support in the persecution of the bourgeois .
One only wonders , with concern , what the Soviets will do after they have wiped out their bourgeois . ”

At the core of Freud ’s initial theory of psychoanalysis was his proposal of the instinctual system , which included two fundamental classes of instincts .
The first were the life - preservative instincts .
These included the needs for air , food , water , and shelter and the fears of snakes , heights , and dangerous humans .
These instincts served the function of survival .
Freud ’s second major class of motivators consisted of the sexual instincts .
“ Mature sexuality ” for Freud culminated in the final stage of adult development — the genital stage , which led directly to reproduction , the essential feature of Freud ’s mature sexuality .
Astute readers might sense an eerie familiarity .
Freud ’s two major classes of instincts correspond almost precisely to Darwin ’s two major theories of evolution .
Freud ’s life - preservative instincts correspond to Darwin ’s theory of natural selection , which many refer to as “ survival selection . ”
And his theory of the sexual instincts corresponds closely to Darwin ’s theory of sexual selection .
Freud eventually changed his theory by combining the life and sexual instincts into one group called the “ life instincts ” and adding a second instinct known as the “ death instinct . ”
He sought to establish psychology as an autonomous discipline , and his thinking moved away from its initial Darwinian anchoring .

I have become increasingly convinced that some of the popular methods presumed to discover what is in the unconscious cannot be counted upon as reliable methods of obtaining evidence .
They often involve the use of symbolism and analogy in such a way that the interpreter can find virtually anything that he is looking for .
Freud , for instance , from a simple dream reported by a man in his middle twenties [ i.e. , Sergei Pankejeff ] as having occurred at 4 years of age drew remarkable conclusions .
The 4 - year - old boy dreamed of seeing six or seven white wolves sitting in a tree .
Freud interpreted the dream in such a way as to convince himself that the patient at 18 months of age had been shocked by seeing his parents have intercourse three times in succession and that this played a major part in the extreme fear of being castrated by his father which Freud ascribed to him at 4 years of age .
No objective evidence was ever offered to support this conclusion .
Nor was actual fear of castration ever made to emerge into the light of consciousness despite years of analysis .

In the early twentieth century the concepts of the preconscious and unconscious were made widely popular , especially in literary circles , by Freud , Jung , and their associates , mainly because of the sexual flavor they gave to them .
By modern standards , Freud can hardly be regarded as a scientist but rather as a physician who had many novel ideas and who wrote persuasively and unusually well .
He became the main founder of the new cult of psychoanalysis .
Francis Crick , The Astonishing Hypothesis : The Scientific Search for the Soul ( 1994 )
A few professional alienists understood his importance , but to most of the public he appeared as some kind of German sexologist , an exponent of free love who used big words to talk about dirty things .
At least a decade would have to pass before Freud would have his revenge and see his ideas begin to destroy sex in America forever .
E. L. Doctorow , in Ragtime : A Novel ( 1976 )

The seventeenth - century Iroquois , as described by the Jesuit missionaries , practiced a dream psychotherapy that was remarkably similar to Freud 's discoveries two hundred years later .
The Iroquois recognized the existence of an unconscious , the force of unconscious desires , the way in which the conscious mind attempts to repress unpleasant thoughts , the emergence of unpleasant thoughts in dreams , and the mental and physical ( psychosomatic ) illnesses that may be caused by the frustration of unconscious desires .
The Iroquois knew that their dreams did not deal in facts but rather in symbols .
... And one of the techniques employed by the Iroquois seers to uncover the latent meanings behind a dream was free association ...
The Iroquois faith in dreams ... is only somewhat diminished after more than three hundred years .
... The conclusions are inevitable : Had Freud not discovered psychotherapy , then someone else would have .
Peter Farb , Man's Rise to Civilization ( 1968 )
That human nature and society can have conflicting demands , and hence that a whole society can be sick , is an assumption which was made very explicitly by Freud , most extensively in his Civilization and Its Discontent .
... he arrives at the concept of " social neurosis . "
" If the evolution of civilization , " he writes , " has such a far - reaching similarity with the development of an individual , and if the same methods are employed in both , would not the diagnosis be justified that many systems of civilization — or epics of it — possibly even the whole of humanity — have become ' neurotic ' under the pressure of the civilizing trends ?

Freud was one of the last representatives of Enlightenment philosophy .

While the implications of Darwin ’s views were threatening and unsettling , they were not quite so directly abrasive , not quite so unrespectable , as Freud ’s views on infantile sexuality , the ubiquity of perversions , and the dynamic power of unconscious urges .

While Darwin was satisfied with revising his work after further reflection and absorbing palpable hits by rational critics , while he trusted the passage of time and the weight of his argumentation , Freud orchestrated his wooing of the public mind through a loyal cadre of adherents , founded periodicals and wrote popularizations that would spread the authorized word , dominated international congresses of analysis until he felt too frail to attend them and after that through surrogates like his daughter Anna .

" But [ William ] Glen [ a distinguished geologist and historian of science at the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park , CA ...] reminded me of the famous statement by Freud that I have often quoted in these essays :

The founder of modern religious existentialism and the founder of psychoanalysis could not have known one another .
Kierkegaard died one half year before the birth of Freud , and it is very unlikely that Freud ever read any of Kierkegaard 's works .
Yet the two have much more in common than their lifelong preoccupation with the phenomenon of anxiety .
The elucidation and treatment of the problem of anxiety in the works of both thinkers — who knew nothing of each other ’s work — leads to most surprising results .
They confirm each other in their conclusions ; they criticize each other in their limitations ; and they match each other perfectly .

I differ from Freud in that I think that most dreams are neither obscure nor bowdlerized , but rather that they are transparent and unedited .
They reveal clearly meaningful undisguised and often highly conflictual themes worthy of note by the dreamer ( and any interpretive assistant ) .
My position echoes Jung 's notion of dreams as transparently meaningful and does away with any distinction between manifest and latent content .

Your technique of treating your pupils like patients is a blunder .
In that way you produce either slavish sons or impudent puppies ...
I am objective enough to see through your little trick Carl Jung ( McGuire , 1974 ) .
The idea that different aspects of visual perception might be handled in separate areas of the brain was predicted by Freud ... when he proposed that the inability of certain patients to recognize certain features of the visual world was due not to a sensory deficit , but to a cortical defect that affected their ability to combine aspects of vision into a meaningful pattern .
These defects , which Freud called agnosias ( loss of knowledge ) , can be quite specific .
Eric Kandel , In Search of Memory ( 2006 )
( loss of knowledge ) , can be quite specific .
The third great revolution , the Freudian revolution of Vienna 1900 , revealed that we do not consciously control our own actions but are instead driven by unconscious motives .
This ... later led to the idea that human creativity ... stems from conscious access to underlying , unconscious forces .
Eric Kandel , The Age of Insight ( 2012 )
The realization that our mental functioning is largely irrational was arrived at by several thinkers at the same time , including Friedrich Nietzsche ...
Freud , who was much influenced by both Darwin and Nietzsche ... was its most profound and articulate exponent .
... Schnitzler , Klimpt , Kokoschka , and Schiele also discovered and explored new aspects of our unconscious mental life .
They understood women better than Freud ... and they saw more clearly than Freud the importance of an infant 's bonding to its mother .
They even realized the significance of the aggressive instinct earlier than Freud did .
... Plato discussed unconscious knowledge ... pointing out that much of our knowledge is inherent in the psyche in latent form .
... Hermann von Helmholtz ... advanced the idea that the unconscious plays a critical role in human visual perception .

Vladimir Nabokov said the two great evils of the 20th century were Marx and Freud .
He was absolutely correct .
Freud has saturated our culture .
People operate on Freudian theory in almost everything they do and they 're completely unaware of it .
I 'm really sensitive to how Freudian theory seized the day , because as a novelist I once wrote characters with complete Freudian backgrounds .
The basic assumption of Freud is that none of us is responsible for what we are :
What we are is a consequence of what our parents did to us , what our culture did to us , what society did to us , the injustices we 've suffered .
So , in essence , we 're victims .
What we do as a society is seek simple answers .
Freudianism is a simple answer :
If what everybody does is simply a result of what was done to them as a child by their parents , or their culture , then they 're not really responsible .
All we have to do is put them through a 12 - step program and they 'll cease being a serial killer or whatever .
That 's so grossly simplistic .
And yet it has dominated the thinking of our century , especially our legal system .
Dean Koontz , as quoted in Nick Gillespie & Lisa Snell , Contemplating Evil : Novelist Dean Koontz on Freud , fraud , and the Great Society , Reason magazine , 1996

For Freud the ultimate psychological reality is the system of attractions and tensions which attaches the child to parental images , and then through these to all other persons .
Maurice Merleau - Ponty , as quoted in The Essential Writings of Merleau - Ponty ( 1969 ) edited by A. L. Fisher
There is no longer any risk that Freudian research will shock us by recalling what there is of the " barbarian " in us ; the risk is rather that the findings will be too easily accepted in an " idealist " form .
Maurice Merleau - Ponty , as quoted in The Essential Writings of Merleau - Ponty ( 1969 ) edited by A. L. Fisher
At one time , many philosophers held that faultless " laws of thought " were somehow inherent , a priori , in the very nature of mind .
This belief was twice shaken in the past century ; first when Russell and his successors showed how the logic men employ can be defective , and later when Freud and Piaget started to reveal the tortuous ways in which our minds actually develop .
Marvin Minsky , " Jokes and their Relation to the Cognitive Unconscious " ( 1980 )
Each child makes " internal models " that help them predict their Imprimers ' reactions ... as an " internalized " system of values — and this could be how people develop what we call ethics , conscience , or moral sense .
Perhaps Sigmund Freud had such a process in mind when he suggested that children can " introject " some of their parents ' attitudes .

Perhaps Sigmund Freud had such a process in mind when he suggested that children can " introject " some of their parents ' attitudes .
Much research in psychology has been more concerned with how large groups of people behave than about the particular ways in which each individual person thinks ... too statistical .
I find this disappointing because , in my view of the history of psychology , far more was learned , for example , when Jean Piaget spent several years observing the ways that three children developed , or when Sigmund Freud took several years to examine the thinking of a rather small number of patients .
Marvin Minsky , The Emotion Machine ( 2006 )
How much of a person 's competence is based on knowing which actions not to take ?
We usually think of a person 's abilities in positive terms ...
But one could take the opposite view that " An expert is someone who rarely slips up — because of knowing what not to do . "
However , this subject was rarely discussed in the twentieth - century — except , perhaps most notably , in Sigmund Freud 's analysis .

As Dr. Sigmund Freud has observed , it can not even be said that the State has ever shown any disposition to suppress crime , but only to safeguard its own monopoly of crime .
Albert Jay Nock , in Our Enemy , The State ( 1935 )

Doctor Freud not only used cocaine himself , but he also prescribed it to his patients .
And then he drew his generalizations .
Cocaine is a strong sexual arouser .
That 's why everything Freud invented — all those oedipuses , sphinxes and sphincters — is relevant only to a mental dimension of a patient , whose brain is turned to fried - eggs by cocaine .
In such a state , one really has only one problem left — what to do first , to screw his mother or to do away with his father .
Of course , until his cocaine runs out .
And in those times , there were no problems with supplies .
But so long as your daily dose is less than three grams , you do n't have to fear either the Oedipus complex , nor other things discovered by Freud .
Victor Pelevin , in The Sacred Book of the Werewolf : A Novel ( 2004 )
Babies are … obviously narcissistic , but not in the way adults are , not even Spinoza 's God , and I am a little afraid that Freud sometimes forgets that the narcissistic baby has no sense of self .

Perhaps the last cultural fad one could still argue against was Karl Marx .
But Freud — or Rawls ?
To argue against such persons is to grant them a premise they spend all of their effort disproving : that reason is involved in their theories .
Ayn Rand as quoted in The Ayn Rand Letter Vol. IV , No. 2 ( November - December 1975 )
Freud … agreed in principle to the importance of sexual health .
But he did not want what sexual health entailed , the attack on certain institutions which opposed it .
Wilhelm Reich , as quoted in Reich Speaks of Freud ( 1967 ) edited by Mary Higgins and Chester M. Raphael
Analytic therapy is thus a form of re-education ; Freud specifically called it that .
It is re-education so far as it eliminates those symptoms through which the patient has tried , mistakenly , to resolve the contradictions in his life .
Philip Rieff , The Triumph of the Therapeutic ( 1966 )
What hope there is derives from Freud ’s assumption that human nature is not so much a hierarchy of high - low , and good - bad , as his predecessors believed , but rather a jostling democracy of contending predispositions , deposited in every nature in roughly equal intensities .
…
Psychoanalysis is full of such mad logic ; it is convincing only if the student of his own life accepts Freud ’s egalitarian revision of the traditional idea of a hierarchical human nature .
Philip Rieff , The Triumph of the Therapeutic ( 1966 )
Man is essentially a dreamer , wakened sometimes for a moment by some peculiarly obtrusive element in the outer world , but lapsing again quickly into the happy somnolence of imagination .
Freud has shown how largely our dreams at night are the pictured fulfilment of our wishes ; he has , with an equal measure of truth , said the same of day - dreams ; and he might have included the day - dreams which we call beliefs .

We all grow up in a land of giants when we are very small ... within us , surely , is some part of our childhood that has n't disappeared and has n't grown up .
... In your formative years , you learn from direct experience , absolutely incontrovertible , that there are much larger , much wiser , and much more powerful creatures in the universe than you .
And your strongest emotional bonds are to them .
... and you must propitiate them .
... Is n't it ... likely that there remains a part of us that is still in the practice of this ...?
Could that have something to do with prayer specifically and with religious beliefs in general ?

Freud 's view was that " at bottom God is nothing more than an exalted father . " ...
The view here is that we start out with a sense that our parents are omnipotent and omniscient ...
There 's a part of us that has been inducted into a dominance hierarchy and does n't like the uncertainty of having to deal with things for ourselves .
... one of the many reasons that are given for the advantages of military life and other powerfully hierarchical societies is that it's not required to think for oneself very much .
There 's something calming about that .
... according to Freud , we then foist upon the cosmos our own emotional predispositions .

Probably no theory evolved by man is as absurd as Sigmund Freud 's theory of penis envy .
To a woman , the penis and scrotum seem superfluous to man 's otherwise neatly constructed body .
They are almost untidy .
She cannot understand that after use the penis is not retractable like an aerial on a portable radio .
And as for envy — it would never occur , even to a little girl .
Not in her deepest unconscious would she wish to possess a penis ; and as to being at a disadvantage compared to a little boy , that is nonsense , for she gets preferential treatment anyway .
Freud was merely the victim of training by woman 's self - abasement techniques — thanks to his mother , wife , and probably his daughters as well .
He confused cause and effect ; a woman only says she is worth less than a man .
She does n't really think it .
If anyone ought to feel a sense of envy , it is men .
They should be jealous of women 's power .
But , of course , they never are , for they glory in their powerlessness .

Many aspects of Freudian theory are indeed out of date , and they should be : Freud died in 1939 , and he has been slow to undertake further revisions .
His critics , however , are equally behind the times , attacking Freudian views of the 1920s as if they continue to have some currency in their original form .

The scientific debate on reports and recollections of child sexual abuse goes back to at least 1896 , when Freud argued that repression of early childhood seduction ( sexual molestation ) had etiological significance for adult hysteria [… ] .
He later recanted , saying that he was wrong about the repression of actual experiences of child sexual abuse and that it was fantasies ( of sexual contact with parents or other adults ) that drove the hysteria [.. ] .
The research [ in peer - reviewed publications in the 1980s and ‘ 90s ] revisited the issue of repression of child sexual abuse and suggest that a large proportion of women sexually abused in childhood have no recall of the abuse .
These studies support Freud 's originally hypothesized connection between child sexual abuse , no recall of the abuse , and high levels of psychological symptoms in adulthood , at least in clinical samples .

Freud is an interesting case in the history of psychology .
To many he is the embodiment of cultural relativism , with the great emphasis he placed on the role of the parents and family in the shaping of an individual ’s personality .
However , Freud deserves mention for two reasons .
First , unlike many subsequent psychologists
Freud was interested in ultimate questions ; he was preoccupied by finding out why people behaved as they did , not simply how .
Second , although many of these accounts were distinctly non-Darwinian ( e.g. the Oedipus complex in which a male child desires to kill his father ) , some of his ideas are much more in line with recent Darwinian psychology .

A 1950 photo of the electric chair is shown at the Raiford Prison in Raiford , Fla .
When introduced in 1922 , the electric chair was seen as a humane means of execution .
( AP Photo / Florida Photographic Collection )
From crucifixions and beheadings to firing squads and lethal injections , public executions have long been a part of the justice system .
Now , one sociologist suggests that the audience has helped shape the recent evolution of these executions .
Relatives of the victim may want a swift execution to bring closure to a tragic chapter of their lives .
Parties concerned with the convicted criminal 's pain call for quick and painless executions .
In a study by University of Cincinnati sociologist Annulla Linders , evidence indicates that execution witnesses have affected the method , procedure , and publicity of executions .
" Viewed as a mirror held up to the execution , the audience is a constitutive element of the execution and , in this sense , not only carries the potential to grant ( or deny ) legitimacy to the execution event , but also provides capital punishment with a set of cultural meanings that reaches far beyond any particular execution , " Linders writes .
Most recently , the practice of allowing the victim 's family to witness the execution has resulted in the personalization of capital punishment .
This contradicts the efforts made in the 19th century to prevent executions from becoming a public spectacle .
Early results from Linders ' study suggest that there are three large cultural issues that are currently affecting public executions – pressure from the victim 's rights movement , associating the death of the convict with the worth of the victim , and modern society 's general intolerance of premature and unnatural deaths .
In her paper " The Return of the Spectacle ?
The Modern Execution in the United States , " Linder details four general ways that the execution audiences have influenced contemporary executions :
Pain and technology :
In the United States , most states have turned to more humane and painless forms of execution .
While a few states still approve of execution by hanging , the electric chair , firing squads , and gas chambers , public outrage over these methods of execution has made lethal injection – by comparison quicker and less painful – the most common form of execution today .
Witness and psychological closure : Involving relatives of the victim to witness the execution is relatively new – it began in the 1990's .
Linders writes that the call for emotional closure has influenced the execution to be quick and efficient .
Publicity and public Access : Although public viewings of executions came to an end in the 19th Century , demand for publicized executions is on the rise .
Linders says this issue has cropped up several times over the last few decades , particularly when high publicity convicts – such as Timothy McVeigh , who was executed for the Oklahoma City bombing – are put to death .
Procedures and professionals : Involving an audience and meeting the emotional demands of victim family members has complicated the precision and efficiency of executions that prison officials prefer .
Linders presented her reserach today at the 100th annual meeting of the American Sociological Association in Philadelphia .

Their fashion items range in size from small to XXL .
But it seems that the bosses at Next would prefer their store staff to conform to a much narrower range of dimensions .
Thousands of employees of the high street chain have been handed a style guide which appears to demand that they look as slim as possible while at work .
Female staff who do not have the same slender features of its catalogue models are encouraged to " try out magic pants to hide lumps and bumps " .
Scroll down for more ...
They are advised to wear neck scarves to draw attention " away from those body parts you want to hide " .
Employees with rounder midriffs are specifically targeted by the chain 's style police .
The guide suggests they should avoid tight - fitting clothes , but also excessively baggy tops and dresses , which , it says , could make them look bigger .
On the other side of the style leaflet , male workers are given similar guidance .
They are encouraged to wear bright shirts and ties to take attention away from " love handles " .
It also suggests the use of pinstripes to look taller and slimmer .
The leaflet caused anger and bemusement when it was handed out to more than 200 staff at a Next branch in Lakeside shopping centre in Essex .
They were given the leaflet by security staff as they finished work .
The following day they were given team talks by managers who stressed the importance of the campaign .
One male shop assistant described the move as " an insult " .
" Everyone 's really upset , especially the women , " he said .
" OK , tell us about the sort of things they 'd like us to wear if they must but to refer to love handles and double chins and magic pants to cover bumps was way over the top .
" It 's demeaning and it has made a lot of people feel very self - conscious .
What they 're going to end up with is mutton dressed as lamb .
" Also , it 's not as if anyone here can afford a fantastic wardrobe .
I 'm on £ 5.50 an hour which is just above the minimum wage and even an assistant manager gets only £ 6.80 . "
The style guide was quickly condemned by the Beat , an organisation that helps people with eating disorders .
Chief executive Susan Ring said : " What Next is saying here is that it wants the people who work in its stores to look as slim as possible so that the customers see the clothes on the staff and want to buy them .
" Stylists should be trying to show people the best ways to show off their figure and not imply that everyone has to conform to this skinny image .
" The company is entitled to expect people in its stores to dress smartly and with a certain amount of style .
After all , it is selling clothes .
" But I do n't agree with extending this to telling staff they must dress along these set guidelines .
If you are the type of person who needs magic knickers this style guide might add to your insecurities . "
A spokesman for Next said : " On reflection , we 've made a rather thoughtless mistake .
What was intended as magazine - style fashion tips has caused offence which was never intended .
We have withdrawn the leaflet and apologised for the error . "
Syrians are preparing to sue the United States for supplying weapons to Israel that later killed Syrians during the Second Lebanon War , said Syria 's foreign minister , a day after Washington announced new sanctions against Damascus .
Hopeful Message Brazilian minister : Assad ready for dialogue with Israel Aviram Zino Brazil 's foreign minister meets President Peres , says Damascus open to peace negotiations .
One cannot overlook Assad 's support of terror , says Peres Brazilian minister : Assad ready for dialogue with Israel
Speaking at a press conference with his Iranian counterpart , Manouchehr Mottaki , Walid Moallem promised that Syria would punish the US for its decision to impose fresh sanctions against Syrian officials .
" This time I tell you we will punish the United States ...
There are scores of Syrians who became victims during the Israeli war against Lebanon , they will file lawsuits against America , " which provided Israel with the weapons , he said .
' No country more corrupt than US '
On Wednesday , US President George W. Bush , in an executive order , said he was expanding sanctions against senior government officials in Syria and their associates deemed responsible for or to have benefited from public corruption .
The order named no specific officials .
A high ranking Syrian official on Thursday ridiculed Bush 's decision , saying that a country occupying the land of others has no right to hurl accusations .
" The ones who steal the resources of other countries through occupation and corruption have no right to accuse others , " said a high - ranking Syrian official to the Associated Press .
" The Bush administration is not matched by any government in the world when it comes to corruption , " he said .

The inventory lists CO2 emissions from more than 4,000 companies
Australians were found to be the world 's worst polluters per capita , producing five times as much CO2 from generating power as China .
The US came second with eight tonnes of the greenhouse gas per head - 16 times more than that produced by India .
The US also produced the most CO2 in total , followed by China .
The Carbon Monitoring for Action ( Carma ) website is the first global inventory of emissions and looks at 50,000 power stations .
Its data was compiled by the Center for Global Development , a US think - tank .
Least efficient stations
Carma points out that while US power plants emit the most CO2 , releasing 2.5 bn tonnes into the atmosphere each year , Australian power stations are the least efficient on a per capita basis , with emissions of 10 tonnes , compared with the US 's 8.2 tonnes .
TOP 10 EMITTERS National power sector emissions ( in tonnes of CO2 ) : US - 2,530 million China - 2,430 million Russia - 600 million India - 529 million Japan - 363 million Germany - 323 million Australia - 205 million South Africa - 201 million UK - 192 million South Korea - 168 million ( Source : Carma / CGD )
China 's power sector emits the second - highest total amount of carbon dioxide , pumping 2.4bn tonnes of the gas into the atmosphere annually .
However , its emissions are only one fifth of Australia 's when measured on a per capita basis .
The UK's 192 million tonnes make it the ninth highest emitter , with per capita CO2 emissions of 3.2 tonnes .
The nation 's largest power station , the coal - fired Drax plant , is deemed to be the 23rd most polluting power station in the world .
Powering change
Kevin Ummel , a research assistant at the Center for Global Development , hoped the online inventory would help the push towards a low carbon future .
" The experience of people in the environmental field has been that supplying the public and markets with information that they did not have has often led to improvements in environmental quality , " he told BBC News .
CO2 EMISSIONS PER CAPITA Australia - 10.0 tonnes US - 8.2 tonnes UK - 3.2 tonnes China - 1.8 tonnes India - 0.5 tonnes ( Source : Carma / CGD )
" There is no reason why this could not happen for carbon emissions . "
He said that the data for power stations in the US , Canada , Europe and India came from official , verified reports .
For the power plants that did not have robust reports , Mr Ummel said a model was used to calculate the volume of emissions .
The figure is derived by taking factors such as fuel type , size , age and various other technical specifications in account .
" It turns out that if you have this information then you can predict emissions from the plants with a high degree of certainty , " he said .
" Carma is built from a massive database provided by private sector ( organisations ) .
It includes every type of fuel and it includes power plants of almost any size .
" Not only do we have the massive plants , like Drax in the UK , but everything down to the solar panels on the local high school .
" We feel quite confident that no - one else has information in such detail . "
The philosophy behind the website is to provide people with information that they currently do not have .
" In this website , we do not push a particular agenda or outcome , " explained Mr Ummel .
" In fact , we are very interested to see how people choose to use the data . "

The disastrous presidency of George W. Bush is to the cause of government reform what the sinking of the Titanic must have been to lifeboat manufacturers : a colossal case - in - point .
But as much as Bush , Cheney , and the whole motley executive branch crew have rankled our sensibilities , I think we give them too much credit .
The truth of the matter is that Congress bears far more responsibility for the overthrow of our constitutional Republic than George W. Bush , or even the worst of our former presidents .
It is Congress that has passed the laws and created the meddlesome agencies that the friends of freedom so despise .
Congress gave us the Federal Reserve , the 16th Amendment and the IRS , the Department of Education , the PATRIOT ACT , the REAL ID Act , the Military Commissions Act , and so forth .
It is Congress that has steadily built our national debt into a financial Tower of Babel .
It is Congress that has allowed George W. Bush to get away with waging undeclared wars , ignoring the laws , and trampling the Constitution , just as it has allowed past presidents to get away with various acts of usurpation ( bear in mind that George W. Bush is basing his actions on the examples of men like Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt ) .
Congress also approved the Supreme Court and lower federal court judges that are providing the pseudo - constitutional authority for these excesses and abuses of power .
Presidents have considerable power and influence , and sending Ron Paul to the Oval Office could certainly do much to put the brakes on our runaway federal system ; but make no mistake : there will be no real or lasting revolution unless we send the authoritarian establishment in Congress on a permanent vacation .
For one thing , they ’ve richly earned their pink slips ( I ’m being overly polite here  actually they ’ve earned a one - way trip into deep space ) ; for another , they could , and I believe would , present an enormous obstruction to Ron Paul ’s agenda .
President Paul will be able to accomplish much , I ’m sure , especially during his first 100 days , and by virtue of the powerful statement that his election will send ; but big government Democrats and Republicans , ably assisted by powerful media and special interest friends , are not going to stand idly by while he tears down their treehouse .
They understand that the American public is fickle , and they are nothing if not masters of the political dark arts .
Like wounded animals , they will bide their time in the aftermath of a Ron Paul victory , but rest assured that they will do their best to hamstring and humiliate him at the first available opportunity .
And after that first round , it will be open season on the Paul Administration and the ideals it champions .
This may sound rather doom - and - gloomy in these heady days where America is discovering Ron Paul and re-discovering the traditional ideals for which he stands ; but if we are serious in our intention to turn America around , we are going to have to take on the legislative branch in addition to the executive .
We are going to have to give Ron Paul a Congress that he can work with .
And with both the legislative and executive branches in our corner , we will be able to reform the judiciary as well ( via impeachment , if by no other means ) .
In short , throw the bums out !
Let the word go out through the Ron Paul revolution camp : vote for no congressman or senator who has supported the neoconservative big government , police - state agenda .
Support only those candidates who will pledge ( in writing , preferably ) to support constitutional liberty at home and non-intervention abroad .
And if there are no suitable candidates currently running in your area , work with other Ron Paul revolutionaries to recruit them .
We can help one another with filing fees and publicity , just as surely as we have helped the Paul campaign to raise millions of dollars and to get the word out , and we do n’t have to hurt the Paul campaign in the process .
Also , bear in mind that , while it would be ideal to see all of the bums thrown out , we do n’t necessarily have to achieve that in order to be effective .
Even a few congressmen or one or two senators could block the passage of harmful legislation , or help ensure the passage of helpful legislation .
At the very least we could bring the sort of pressure to bear on Congress that we have been so effectively exerting against those who have been ridiculing Ron Paul and trying to exclude him from the process .
A good place to start with this would be pressuring the United States Senate to reject the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act ( S. 1959 ) , which , if passed , will pave the way for the federal government to intimidate and ultimately silence pro-freedom organizations .
Let ’s not let that happen .
Let ’s band together to defeat this legislation , to repeal the PATRIOT ACT and other harmful laws that have already been passed , and to rein in George W. Bush before he starts posing for the cameras with his hand in his shirt .
Let ’s bring the full weight of this movement ’s energy to bear on the enemies of freedom .
If we can do this , we can not only begin to halt the march toward fascism , but we can convince many fence - sitters that Ron Paul and his revolution are for real , that we are not going away , that we are a force to be reckoned with , that we will not surrender our Republic without a struggle , and that we can win this election .
It ’s a great day to be a Ron Paul revolutionary , and there ’s nothing wrong with celebrating the successes we ’ve seen lately .
But let ’s not overlook the larger picture .
Putting a good president in the White House is not enough to restore the Republic .
Firing the captain of a mutinous ship is not going to turn it around if the crew is as mutinous as the captain .
We need both a new captain and a new crew if we ’re going to plot a new course .
Let ’s not settle for a partial victory next November .
Let ’s take this revolution all the way , starting now .

The Best of Robert F. Hawes Jr.
THE American constitution gives Congress the power to collect taxes .
The 16th amendment to it elaborates that Congress may tax incomes .
That is enough to make most Americans pony up .
But Ed and Elaine Brown of New Hampshire are unconvinced .
In 1996 they decided to stop paying federal income taxes because , they said , they saw no law authorising such an imposition .
And in January of this year , when they were convicted on charges of tax evasion , they resisted .
EPA
Paul wants to set you free
Mr Brown retreated to his home and vowed to fight anyone who tried to arrest him .
Mrs Brown , a dentist in quieter times , joined him a bit later .
Their home made a good fort .
It sprawls over more than 100 acres ( 40 hectares ) of forest and was equipped with generators , weapons and booby traps .
Thus holed up , the couple gave interviews .
News of their stand spread over the internet .
Supporters brought food and supplies .
The situation was at an impasse until federal marshals had a clever idea .
On October 4th , they tricked the Browns by posing as supporters .
The Browns welcomed them onto the property and were arrested on the front porch .
The Browns , it has to be admitted , are at the far end of the spectrum .
But thousands of reasonable Americans are deeply committed to a candidate whose platform might appeal to such scofflaws .
Abolishing the federal income tax is a priority for supporters of Ron Paul , a congressman from Texas who is running for the Republican presidential nomination on a libertarian platform .
Mr Paul reckons it would be possible to accomplish this ; fiscal rigour is central to his campaign .
He also wants to dismantle the Federal Reserve and return to gold - backed currency .
He has always opposed the war in Iraq .
He wants America out of the UN , the WTO , and any other international arrangement .
He strongly supports home - schooling and , of course , gun ownership .
These stances are agreeable to people who distrust government , and political watchers have been surprised by Mr Paul 's success thus far .
According to an October 4th Gallup poll , he is still wallowing with around 2 % of the Republican vote .
However , in the third quarter of this year he raised more than $ 5 m — quite respectable compared , say , with the $ 9 m raised by Fred Thompson .
It is probably the intensity of Mr Paul 's convictions that commends him to his supporters .
Republican voters are still not sure whether to believe the conservative credentials of leading candidates like Mitt Romney or Mr Thompson .
Mr Paul plainly believes what he says .
Perhaps the other candidates should adopt a bit of his libertarian fervour .
JERUSALEM 
The Israeli Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected an appeal to block Israel from further reducing supplies of fuel and electricity to the Gaza Strip .
The Israeli government had argued that the more limited amount of fuel it intended to allow through met the basic needs of Gaza ’s population while exacting a widely felt price among Gazans for the continual firing of rockets and mortars into Israel by Palestinian militants .
Israel hopes such a policy will create popular pressure to force the Hamas rulers of Gaza and other militant groups to stop the rocket fire .
A group of 10 human rights groups had together petitioned the court to prevent the fuel cuts , arguing that Israel had a legal obligation under international law to supply the citizens of Gaza .
The group contended that the cuts “ deliberately violate the rights of civilians in Gaza ” and constituted “ collective punishment ” in violation of international law by “ deliberately targeting civilians . ”

Blackwater security contractors employed in Iraq dropped a blinding riot - control gas on Iraqi civilians and US military personnel on a busy Baghdad street in May 2005 , according to the reporter who first broke the NSA wiretapping scandal in the New York Times .
“ The copter dropped CS gas , a riot - control substance the American military in Iraq can use only under the strictest conditions and with the approval of top military commanders , ” James Risen writes .
“ An armored vehicle on the ground also released the gas , temporarily blinding drivers , passers - by and at least 10 American soldiers operating the checkpoint . ”
CS gas — 2 - chlorobenzalmalononitrile — is among the most common tear gases used by law enforcement and militaries in conflict zones .
… The revelation raises new questions about the purview of private security contractors in Iraq and how much authority they have to exercise military - like action without following the rules of engagement or international treaties that the Pentagon requires its troops to follow .

Kayak fishing is generally a serene endeavor , similar to float - tube fishing .
But when you attach a marlin to the end of your line , it becomes more of a sleigh ride , during which you hold on for dear life and hope the beast you ’ve hooked does n’t take it personally .
“ I never took up water skiing , but it must be a little like that , ” says Jon Schwartz , who last week off Cabo San Lucas caught and released eight marlin from aboard a rented yellow kayak .
“ Because when the marlin turns in one direction , you pull your rod in the other and that points your kayak toward the line .
So you ’re actually steering . ”

Some might regard the Carlsbad schoolteacher , a husband and father of three , as irresponsible .
Or just plain crazy .
Hooked marlin have turned on their pursuers , attacking and even leaping into boats .
But “ Bluewater Jon , ” as he refers to himself , says there are far more dangerous activities and acknowledges only being “ a bit of a goofball . ”
Schwartz had received reports of dense marlin concentrations at the Golden Gate and Finger Bank north of Cabo San Lucas at Baja California ’s tip .

So he chartered a Pisces Sportfishing cruiser and was deposited at the less - crowded Finger Bank .
A big - game specialist , he uses a short , stand - up - style rod because it ’s easier to handle aboard a kayak .
He also uses circle hooks , which can be set merely by tightening the lever drag as the tough - mouthed billfish make their run .
Plus , circle hooks usually set in the corner of a fish ’s mouth , making for easier releases .
The cruiser ’s crew and a videographer -- check out bluewaterjon.com -- were kept entertained as Schwartz streaked across the Pacific , powered by greyhounds of the sea .

He battled each marlin for about 30 minutes , and with a gloved hand he held their bills while using pliers to free the hook .
“ Some towed me several miles , and some much less than that because they jumped so much , ” Schwartz recalls .
“ One must have jumped 12 times in a circle around me , no more than 20 feet away . ”
Asked if he had to check his body for holes afterward , he replied , “ I have n’t been skewered yet . ”
Bass anglers ‘ in arms ’

The Casitas Municipal Water District is considering banning private boats from Lake Casitas in an attempt to thwart an invasion of quagga mussels .
The tiny mussels multiply rapidly , compete with native critters for food and can be devastating to water systems and fisheries .
They ’ve been detected recently at other Southland reservoirs and are known to hitch rides on boat hulls and motors .
Anglers are “ up in arms , kicking and screaming ” over prospects of a ban , says Randy King , concession manager at the Ventura County reservoir , which is one of the West ’s premier largemouth bass fisheries .

Rental boats would still be allowed , but they lack adequate platforms and trolling motors necessary to maneuver around a shoreline .
A vote is expected by month ’s end .
Extreme adventure
Adventurer Doug Stoop and Richard Dunwoody , his client , have been dragging 250 - pound sleds across Antarctica since Dec. 1 and are a week from reaching the South Pole .

Their route is the same one Ernest Shackleton planned to attempt during his ill - fated expedition in 1915 , when his ship , Endurance , became trapped by ice and sank , forcing his crew to endure 22 months in the frozen region .
Reached via satellite phone , Stoop said he and Dunwoody were dining on freeze - dried chicken fettuccine .
The temperature was minus 21 , which is warm for the Polar Plateau , Stoop said .
Theirs is an unsupported adventure , the first on a grueling route fraught with ice ridges and dangerous crevasse fields .
Advertisement
Stoop fell into a deep crevasse but caught a small ledge with a ski tip and used his poles to climb to safety .
They pack plenty of food but burn more calories than they consume and both have lost at least 20 pounds , making it difficult to keep warm .
Their routine is the same each day : cover all skin and ski with sleds in tow for an average of 10 miles a day .
White - out conditions are so severe , at times , that they cannot discern up from down so they lose equilibrium and stumble like drunks .
“ That happens a lot and it ’s quite funny , ” Stoop said .
Advertisement
It is a surrealistically beautiful landscape , but they ’re weary and long for better food and things that ordinary people take for granted .
“ I miss the smells of trees and grass and that kind of thing , ” Stoop said .
“ I also miss color .
I have n’t seen color in a while .
All I see is white . ”

Last Saturday four surfers embarked to Cortes Bank , 105 miles off Orange County , and found peaks measuring 80 feet breaking over the high spot .
Mike Parsons , Brad Gerlach , Greg Long and Grant Baker used Jet Skis to tow each other onto the massive shoulders , whereupon they “ rode the biggest waves of our lives by far , ” said Long , of San Clemente .
The voyage was planned after Surfline.com forecaster Sean Collins pinpointed a narrow window of opportunity between the weekend storms .

Rudy Giuliani appears to be pondering an end to his long pursuit of the Republican presidential nomination .
In a meeting in the back of his chartered plane en route to St. Petersburg , Fla. , a short while ago , the onetime , longtime GOP front - runner told a small group of reporters , including The Times ' Louise Roug : " The winner of Florida will win the nomination . "
He then went on to predict he would win .
And his spokeswoman , Maria Comella , said later he was speaking with confidence .
But that 's an unusually categorical statement suggesting that only a total first - place upset by Giuliani , who trails both Mitt Romney and John McCain in all major polls for Florida 's Republican primary tomorrow , will keep him in the competition , despite previous repeated vows to continue .
Giuliani's campaign , which led in national polls when it began and stayed there for many months , is showing signs of serious financial fatigue .
This month his top staffers are foregoing their paychecks so the maximum amount of money can be invested to salvage his political fortunes in the Sunshine State , which was where Giuliani 's late - state strategy was to kick into high gear .
So far , he 's yet to finish first anywhere and ended up behind Rep. Ron Paul in Iowa and Nevada .
In his meeting with reporters today , Giuliani added that , no matter what happens Tuesday , he definitely would participate in the Republican debate co-sponsored by The Times on Wednesday at the Reagan Library .

It comes but once every four years and this 29 February some workers are being given the extra day as holiday .
Employers wo n't like the idea , but we tend to look at additional time as a gift .
Imagine that to adjust our timekeeping , 10 minutes had to be added to one day each year .
You would expect them to be 10 minutes of free time , yours to spend as you will .
You'd be miffed if they were added to one of your working hours , getting 10 minutes more work out of you for no extra money .
But is this what leap year does to us ?
If you 're on an annual salary , you will get the same pay as normal this year , while working one extra day .
Is 29 February just another working Friday , or a sneaky bonus for your employer ?
Who does 29 February belong to ?
He gets the day off
If you 're starting to feel like a holiday today , you might be interested to hear that the National Trust has granted its whole workforce the day off .
Calling it the Great Green Leap Day , they are asking staff to use it for the environment .
" We 're giving them this opportunity to look at steps to green their own lives at home , " explains Mike Holland of the Trust .
" Anything from converting to greener energy to starting a compost heap . "
Just how many will be converting , composting and otherwise greening and how many will be shopping is hard to say , but Holland hopes most of the workforce have caught the vision .
He says it would be good to see other workplaces catch it , so if you can just wait till 2012 there might be one for you too .
The National Trust does not want anyone to feel short - changed by their own employer .
But if you do feel that way , then according to Steve Taylor , the author of Making Time : Why Time Seems to Pass at Different Speeds and How to Control It , there may be something in it .
Time as a ' gift '
The book argues that the way we perceive time is more real than the way we measure it .
How else does time pass , except in our consciousness - sometimes faster , sometimes slower ?
When it comes to the extra day , like the extra hour when the clocks go back , he says , " We look on that time as a gift - just as in other ways we try to subtract time , like when we 're on a long journey and immerse attention in a book " .
' LEAP YEARS ' THAT WEREN'T
Every fourth year is a leap year , unless it is divisible by 100 and not by 400 So 2000 was a leap year , as was , for those who can't remember it , 1600 1700 , 1800 and 1900 were not leap years
The next such non-leap year is 2100 Perhaps , he agrees , employers may be getting an extra unpaid day out of us .
" But then in a sense , " he adds , " they own us already .
We give half our waking hours to them , voluntarily , and our time is our lives - we 're literally giving ourselves away . "
A thought which makes you want to hold on to any disputed days tighter than ever .
Where did this extra day come from in the first place ?
We need the leap day because of the deplorable untidiness of our solar system .
One of our earth years ( a complete orbit around the sun ) does not take an exact number of whole days ( one complete spin of the earth on its axis ) .
In fact , it takes 365.2422 days , give or take .
The leap year was introduced by Julius Caesar in 46BC , to make the calendar tidier .
The extra day every fourth year made the average year 365.25 days long .
Time stealer
This was still about 12 minutes longer than the solar year , which you can get away with on the short term , but in 1267 a monk called Roger Bacon noticed that the calendar had slipped nine days in the 13 intervening centuries .
Gregory XIII : Said to have provoked protests after ' stealing ' 10 days
It then took the church until 1582 to accept that it was celebrating Easter on the wrong week .
That year Pope Gregory XIII adjusted the calendar , introducing the system we go by today : every fourth year is a leap year , unless it is divisible by 100 and not by 400 .
This makes the year 365.2425 days , which is still a little under 26 seconds too long , but nothing to fret about .
As a one off , Gregory 's reform also skipped the 10 days they had gained since Caesar 's time , jumping from 4 to 15 October 1582 .
It is said that this provoked demonstrations from people demanding their stolen days back .
So how about demos today , to reclaim the working day pinched from employees by their employers ?
Go for it , brothers and sisters , but the TUC will not be organising it .
A spokesperson says : " Salaried workers usually receive their annual salary in twelve monthly payments and know when they accept a job that some months are longer than others and that leap years come round once every so often .
Indeed , leap years have been with us 1582 , so the UK workforce has had a while to get used to the idea of an extra day every four years . "
OK , off you go then , back to work .
Add your comments on this story , using the form below .
Why is everyone always looking for something free ?
Those of us who get paid monthly get the same amount each month whether that month contains 30 or 31 days or in February just 28 days - I never hear anyone say oh are n't I lucky that I get extra pay every day in February and just one year in four this is slightly less than the others or one year in four I get slightly less pay for each day but three out of the four I could look at it as getting slightly more .
It is about time people counted " their blessings " and stpooed this constant moaning and joing the ME ME ME society we are developing into !

It is my fiancee 's birthday today !

Well one should this handle individually .
When concluding the working contract a worker on his demand should be granted an additional holiday every four years .
That gives the employer the additional information that the worker intends to stay in the firm at last up to the next 29th of February .
Dr. Glücksmann , Berlin , Germany
My wife and I celebrate St Oswald 's Day every four years by deciding how we want to spend the day and then doing it .
Sometimes it involves presents , sometimes it involves family .
This year we 're going to spend the day making a meal to remember ( if she ever gets out of bed ) .
I like St Oswald 's day , it 's not bogged down in traditions set by the Coca - Cola corp .
Unfortunataly as soon as everyone starts doing it it 'll become Tesco 's - day or something similar .
Graham Bell , Braunton , Devon Although the Catholic Church all changed together , other countries changed in their own time , the British Empire ( and hence the US ) waited until Sep 1752 .
Russia waited until after the revolution in 1918 .
Type " cal 9 1752 " on a " unix " style system and you will get :- September 1752

The issue of workers pay was a * very * serious issue - although in the case of lost days the issue was not wanting to pay tax for 12 months when you only got paid for 11.5 month .
The start of the calendar & tax year had traditionally been Lady Day ( the day Mary was told she was carrying Jesus ) the Feast of the Annunciation - 25th March .
However , the workers did n't want to be diddled so the start of the year was shifted about 2 weeks later to the 4th April - which is why we still use that as the start of the tax year to this day .
James Stevens , Windsor Given that all months ( except Feb ) contain 30/31 days the 28 or 29 days in Feb suggest that employers are being short changed .
Perhaps for this shorter month salaries should be reduced accordingly .
Alex , Diss I think it should be given as a bank holiday with pay , we get little enough holiday as it is compared to other countries .

It took more than 1300 years from Julius Caesar 's introduction of the leap year before Francis Bacon noticed our times were slipping away by seconds in 1267 .
Now 426 years after Gregory XIII , we must have lost time with no - one noticing .
Therefore let 's bring out the calendar and the calculator to do the maths once more ; there might be something in it for everyone especially those who have worked for the same company for that long .

What are these ?
The modern Surveillance State
February 5 , 2008 at 2:00 am thinkingshift
I came across an interesting article by Jack M. Balkin , a Professor at Yale University Law School .
I ’ve been pondering , as I ’ve mentioned on a couple of occasions now , what the link might be between surveillance and democracy ( a train of thought sparked by Dave Snowden , which will lead soon to a post of my current thoughts about surveillance through the lens of complexity ) .
I do think that to a large extent surveillance tools have become democratized .
So for example , we can take a photo using our camera phone of police roughing up someone and we can distribute videos on YouTube .
But I also believe that the notion of the modern security state has morphed into the surveillance state .
So I found Balkin ’s article very interesting .
He and his co-authors isolate three types of surveillance :
democratic ( or participatory ) surveillance
distributed surveillance
metasurveillance
Let ’s look at each in turn .
Democratic surveillance is about having the tools of surveillance in the hands of citizens who can control not only what to watch but also watching government and officials who might be misbehaving .
So having a camera phone and recording a police arrest would fall into this category .
A CCTV camera that actually captures a suspect ’s image or confirms that someone was really at an ATM at the time they were accused of committing a crime would also fall into this category .
Of course , a camera phone can also record someone ’s private moments , which end up on YouTube , against the wishes of a person .
This is not democratic surveillance .
Distributed surveillance is about having the tools of surveillance distributed widely in many different locations , for different purposes and using different applications .
So street cams , CCTV in buildings , hidden spyware that reports on what people are downloading are examples of distributed surveillance at national or local levels .
The average citizen does not participate in this sort of surveillance .
It ’s about control not democratizing .
Metasurveillance is watching the watchers .
Surveilling the act of surveillance or information gathering .
So reporting requirements that make businesses accountable for the data they are collecting and how it is used is an example of metasurveillance .
I do n’t think there ’s any doubt that democratic surveillance goes towards protecting or securing civil liberties but there is a dark side to this type of surveillance as I ’ve blogged about many times .
A world in which personal data and your image is freely available could see you the victim of identity theft .
We only have to recall to mind the recent fiasco of TV presenter , Jeremy Clarkson ( what a goose ) .
The Top Gear host rubbished the story about the loss of 25 million people ’s personal details on some computer discs that went AWOL in the post .
So he published his Barclay ’s bank account details in his newspaper column to prove that nothing would happen other than people being able to put money into his account .
Wrong .
Turns out a canny dude set up a direct debit which fleeced his account of £ 500 , which ended up in the coffers of a charity .
And to add insult to injury , the UK’s Data Protection
Act stops Clarkson and his bank from finding out who the culprit was .
Distributed surveillance , particularly spyware , has its dangers .
It can watch everything you search for on the internet ; it can slow your computer to a dead crawl ; and spyware can leave a backdoor open for hackers to waltz through .
And this is why governments must regulate in this area and hold businesses publicly accountable .
Metasurveillance is where I think there is the best chance for the modern surveillance state ( and we are already in the grip of the modern surveillance state ) .
We need to ensure that those surveilling us are themselves monitored or regulated .
Balkin suggests an ombudsman or trusted agents who would make use of distributed surveillance techniques to watch those who engage in surveillance .

A lot of us in the programming community have been looking forward to the first release of Paul Graham and Robert Morris ’s “ Arc ” language , which Graham has been talking about for a long time on his widely - read site , paulgraham.com .
On January 29th , they finally released a first - draft implemention .
Although billed as experimental and subject to change , it ’s still something a lot of people will want to play with .
Those of us who for whom programming in Lisp is a cherished memory , a kind of long - lost Eden to which we hope one day to return , are interested to see if Arc can become what we ’ve been hoping for : a Lisp - like language that ’s caught up to the modern world and that gathers enough developer momentum to flourish .
Unfortunately , the Arc web site , arclanguage.org , does n’t answer the very first question most potential downloaders would ask : is it open source ? , or as we used to say , is it free software ?
The site not only does n’t say what license the software is released under , it does n’t even state clearly that the software is open source !
I finally downloaded the package itself and poke around inside to find out :
This software is copyright ( c ) Paul Graham and Robert Morris .
Permission to use it is granted under the Perl Foundations 's Artistic License 2.0 .
Okay .
So it ’s open source , albeit under the least open - source of all the open source licenses .
Sigh .
I normally would n’t even go to the trouble of downloading the software to find that out , I only bothered because I was already quite interested in Arc .
I ’d post on their mailing list a comment about the hidden license problem , but they apparently do n’t have a mailing list .
Instead , they have low - functionality web forums , and it looks like the only way you can interact with the community is through that forum interface .
This is a pity : the thread is the fundamental unit of information on the Internet , and there ’s no reason to force people to use one particular interface to access a set of threads .
Perhaps some people like web forums , but others would prefer to access the threads via their mailreaders .
If I have to use a web interface just to talk to a community , it makes me less likely to join that community , because I ’ll start to associate participation with wrist pain .
Let me choose my own interface , please .
Speaking of which , how about a bug tracker ?
Or any of the other tools that are now standard for open source projects ?
Some of the forum posts indicate that there ’s a version control repository somewhere ( using git ) , but the web pages do n’t point to it , at least not as far as I could see .
So those looking to follow development in real time will have to hunt around .
Given that the web site says “ we ’d like to encourage a sense of community among Arc users ” , this is all a bit disappointing , and puzzling .
It ’s like they do n’t actually want to build a community , which would be fine ( it ’s their project ) , but then why declare otherwise ?
Children with Tourette ’s syndrome may have to put up with some unwanted movement and verbal tics , but neuroscientists at Georgetown University Medical Center and the Kennedy Krieger Institute have found that they are much quicker at processing certain mental grammar skills than are children without the disorder .
They say the findings , reported in the current issue of the journal Neuropsychologia , suggest that abnormalities in the brain linked to tics in Tourette ’s syndrome may also result in a range of rapid behaviors -- and , possibly , superior skills -- than had been appreciated before .
“ These children were particularly fast , as well as largely accurate , in certain language tasks .
This tells us that their cognitive processing may be altered in ways we have only begun to explore , and moreover in a manner that may provide them with performance that is actually enhanced compared that of typically - developing children ” said the study ’s senior investigator , Michael Ullman , Ph.D. , professor of neuroscience , psychology , neurology and linguistics .
According to the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , about 200,000 Americans have the most severe form of Tourette ’s syndrome , but as many as 10 percent of Americans have a milder form .
The most common initial symptom is a facial tic , and other tics -- sudden , rapid , repeated movement or vocalization -- may follow .
Tics can include eye blinking , repeated throat clearing or sniffing , arm thrusting , kicking , shoulder shrugging , or jumping , but coprolalia , which is involuntary use of obscene words or swearing , is only rarely associated with Tourette ’s syndrome .
This nervous system disorder is linked to structural and functional abnormalities in the basal ganglia and frontal cortex area of the brain , which result in decreased inhibition of frontal activity , leading to hyperkinetic behaviors and development of tics , Ullman says .
The disorder is also associated with abnormalities in the way that chemical substances , such as hormones and neurotransmitters , help nerve cells talk to each other .
In this study , Ullman , along with first author Matthew Walenski , PhD , and Stewart Mostofsky , MD , decided to study two different aspects of language as a way to broaden understanding of this disorder .
These two basic aspects of language , “ rule governed ” and “ idiosyncratic ” knowledge , depend on distinct neurobiological processes .
Rule - governed knowledge involves the procedural memory system that depends on frontal / basal - ganglia area circuits in the brain ; in language , it is used to combine parts of words together according to the grammatical rules of the language ( for example , putting walk and ed together to form a regular past tense . )
advertisement
In contrast , idiosyncratic knowledge depends on declarative memory , and is learned and processed in the hippocampus and other temporal lobe areas in the brain .
This kind of memory allows us to learn that a word is linked to an object ( such as the word “ cat ” to its meaning “ furry animal ” ) , and also is used to learn irregular past tense word forms ( as in spring and sprang ) .
Some previous evidence suggested that aspects of procedural memory may be abnormal in Tourette ’s syndrome , whereas declarative memory remains largely spared , but the contrast between the two forms of language knowledge had not been studied before .
In this study , eight children , age 8 - 17 , with Tourette ’s syndrome and eight typically developing children of the same ages without the disorder were given tasks that included producing past tense forms .
All of the children had a normal IQ .
The investigators found that children with Tourette ’s syndrome were significantly faster than the control group in producing rule - governed past tenses ( like slip - slipped ) that depend on grammar and procedural memory but not in producing irregular or other unpredictable past tenses ( such as bring - brought ) that are stored in declarative memory .
The two groups of children were then given a picture - naming task to test motor skill and conceptual knowledge .
Those with Tourette ’s syndrome responded significantly faster than the control group in naming pictures of objects that can be manipulated ( such as hammer ) , and thus depend on motor skill knowledge , but not in naming pictures of non-manipulated objects ( like elephant ) , which depend only on conceptual knowledge .
The motor skill knowledge associated with manipulated objects also depends on procedural memory .
But unlike in the past tense task , where some accuracy was lost to the speed of the response , there was no loss of accuracy in the picture - naming test by children with the disorder .
“ This may mean that the brain abnormalities we see in Tourette ’s syndrome may lead not only to tics but also to a much wider range of unsuppressed and rapid behaviors , ” Ullman said .
The researchers are now developing new language and memory tests for patients with Tourette ’s syndrome .
The study was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health , the National Science Foundation , the Tourette Syndrome Association , and the Mabel Flory Trust .
The other author , Matthew Walenski , was a postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown while the study was carried out , and is currently assistant project scientist at the University of California - San Diego .
Stewart Mostofsky is an associate professor at the Kennedy Krieger Institute and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine .

Oakland ’s recent gun buyback was especially ridiculous .
The police offered up to $ 250 for a gun " no questions asked , no ID required . "
The first people in line ?
Two gun dealers from Reno with 60 cheap handguns .
Fortunately the buyback did manage to get some guns off the street , too bad they were turned in by a bunch of senior citizens from an assisted living facility .
Whew , the streets are safe at last .
Even putting aside the obvious nonsense , gun buybacks simply do n’t work .
In technical terms the supply of guns to Oakland is perfectly elastic so buybacks wo n’t reduce the number of guns in Oakland .
Here is an analogy from my op - ed in the Oakland Tribune .
The North Koreans opened the door to some 400 people , the largest contingent of Americans to visit this isolated , totalitarian state since the Korean War ended in 1953 .
The group includes musicians , orchestra staff , television production crews and 80 journalists , as well as patrons who paid $ 100,000 a couple .

They came bearing bows and basses rather than the arms and armor Americans carried the last time this large a contingent set foot in the North Korean capital .
The brass will issue fanfares , not orders .
Critics hold out little hope that this updated version of ping - pong diplomacy , sports and cultural exchanges that helped warm relations with Maoist China in the 1970s , will do much to transform North Korea under Kim Jong -il .
Mr. Kim has cracked open North Korea ’s door to outside businessmen , sports teams and diplomats in the past without allowing significantly more pluralism in the country ’s regimented economic and political life , and there are few signs that the arrival of the New York orchestra signals a major shift in direction .
The Bush administration has kept its distance from the event .
Condoleezza Rice , the secretary of state , visited Seoul on Monday for South Korea ’s presidential inauguration , but said she had no plans to come to Pyongyang and sought to play down the performance as a diplomatic instrument .
Even so , some proponents of engagement with North Korea say they hope that the visit will nudge North Korea to greater contact with the outside world as China , the United States , South Korea , Japan and Russia press Pyongyang to end its nuclear program .
Mr Prodi will be replaced as the centre - left 's candidate for PM
The news came hours after Italian President Giorgio Napolitano dissolved parliament , following unsuccessful talks to form an interim government .
The political crisis was triggered by last month 's resignation of centre - left Prime Minister Romano Prodi .
Mr Prodi , currently Italy 's caretaker PM , lost a Senate confidence vote .
The BBC's Christian Fraser , in Rome , says the early election paves the way for a return to power of the opposition leader and former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi , who is at least 10 points ahead in the opinion polls .
Mr Berlusconi , Italy 's richest man has already begun campaigning unofficially , our correspondent says .
The early election date was announced by outgoing Transport Minister Alessandro Bianchi .
Electoral reform
Mr Prodi's centre - left coalition was defeated in the Senate in January - soon after the small centrist Udeur party left the government .
Silvio Berlusconi hopes to beat the centre - left bloc
President Napolitano then asked the Senate Speaker , Franco Marini , to put together an interim government with a mandate to reform the electoral law that was widely blamed for the current instability .
Under the current proportional representation system , smaller parties with only a handful of seats hold the balance of power in parliament .
There are currently 39 parties in the Italian Parliament .
But after several days of intense talks Mr Marini admitted he had failed to convince the centre - right opposition .
Mr Berlusconi had insisted during the crisis talks that only early elections could end the political crisis .
Meanwhile , Walter Veltroni , the mayor of Rome , is widely expected to replace Mr Prodi as the centre - left 's candidate for prime minister .
Mr Veltroni has signalled that he wants his new Democratic Party to run alone without the support of the other centre - left parties , our correspondent says .
If this happens , analysts predict he will win a greater share of the vote .
But it would mean Mr Berlusconi 's coalition will almost certainly be assured victory , our correspondent says .
Rather than teach the cranes to stop landing on him , the trainer taught the birds something else , a behavior that would make the undesirable behavior impossible .
The birds could n’t alight on the mats and his head simultaneously .
At home , I came up with incompatible behaviors for Scott to keep him from crowding me while I cooked .
To lure him away from the stove , I piled up parsley for him to chop or cheese for him to grate at the other end of the kitchen island .
Or I ’d set out a bowl of chips and salsa across the room .
Soon I ’d done it : no more Scott hovering around me while I cooked .
I followed the students to SeaWorld San Diego , where a dolphin trainer introduced me to least reinforcing syndrome ( L.R.S. ) .
When a dolphin does something wrong , the trainer does n’t respond in any way .
He stands still for a few beats , careful not to look at the dolphin , and then returns to work .
The idea is that any response , positive or negative , fuels a behavior .
If a behavior provokes no response , it typically dies away .
In the margins of my notes I wrote , “ Try on Scott ! ”
It was only a matter of time before he was again tearing around the house searching for his keys , at which point I said nothing and kept at what I was doing .
It took a lot of discipline to maintain my calm , but results were immediate and stunning .
His temper fell far shy of its usual pitch and then waned like a fast - moving storm .
I felt as if I should throw him a mackerel .
Now he ’s at it again ; I hear him banging a closet door shut , rustling through papers on a chest in the front hall and thumping upstairs .
At the sink , I hold steady .
Then , sure enough , all goes quiet .
A moment later , he walks into the kitchen , keys in hand , and says calmly , “ Found them . ”
Without turning , I call out , “ Great , see you later . ”
Off he goes with our much - calmed pup .
After two years of exotic animal training , my marriage is far smoother , my husband much easier to love .
I used to take his faults personally ; his dirty clothes on the floor were an affront , a symbol of how he did n’t care enough about me .
But thinking of my husband as an exotic species gave me the distance I needed to consider our differences more objectively .
Hillary 's Diminishing Returns
There is dissension in the Hillary Clinton camp .
Top aides have been in arguments , shouting back and forth about differences in strategy .
Should Clinton come on strong ?
Should she go negative ?
Should she be upbeat and positive ?
Here 's my answer : Stop campaigning .
The evidence is overwhelming that since Super Tuesday , the minute Clinton steps foot in a state , her numbers start to plummet .
Of course , Barack Obama has something to do with it .
He 's a phenomenon , a political version of Roy Hobbs , " The Natural " of Bernard Malamud 's wonderful novel , whose physical repose is TV perfect and who will , when the time comes , provide a jarring visual contrast to the much older John McCain .
Obama is nearly as good as he thinks he is .
So it could be that Clinton would have lost the Democrat nomination even if she was a gifted politician .
But she has no such gift .
Her smile is strained .
She is contained .
She seems unknowable and for all but women like herself , there is that melancholy Billie Holiday air about her -- all those songs about a suffering woman .
Most of us would prefer Fleetwood Mac 's " Do n't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow , " the upbeat theme of Bill Clinton 's first presidential campaign .
It might seem surprising that Clinton has turned out to be something other than a brilliant campaigner .
But consider her record .
Back in 1999 , she entered the New York Senate race in the manner of Marie Antoinette entering France -- to be ultimately crowned queen .
When Clinton announced an interest in running , every other Democratic candidate -- Andrew Cuomo , Rep. Carolyn Maloney , even Al Sharpton -- took it as an order to vanish .
The strongest of these , Rep. Nita Lowey , graciously stepped aside , as if Clinton was the real McCoy and a six - term member of Congress was an undeserving interloper .
Back then , I wrote that there was " something wacky " about what was happening .
Clinton , you might recall , was hardly a New Yorker .
No matter .
She had never won an election in her adult life .
No matter .
She was virtually inexperienced on her own .
No matter .
She was first and foremost the wife of Bill and for party leaders and hypocritical feminists --
Lowey was a woman , too , for crying out loud -- she just had to be The One .
With the Democratic senatorial nomination in hand , Clinton was set to go up against Rudy Giuliani .
This would have been the great matchup between two suits inflated with little but name recognition , but it never came to pass .
Giuliani withdrew on account of prostate cancer and Clinton wound up facing ... can you remember ?
It was Rick Lazio .
Even so , Clinton did not win really big -- 55.3 percent of the vote .
Not a landslide .
Six years later , Clinton ran for re-election .
Once again , she had no Democratic opponent and in the general , she faced a Republican named John Spencer .
He was little known before the election , hardly known during it and so forgotten afterward that I expect a segment of the show " Lost " to be devoted to him .
Clinton won in a landslide , 67 percent of the vote .
But just two years earlier , Sen. Charles Schumer ( D ) had gotten 71 percent of the vote -- and no one ever mentions him as a presidential candidate .
In many ways , Clinton 's a remarkable woman but she is not proving to be a remarkable politician .
Big-money Democrats have been on the phone of late and their conversations have been on how to get Clinton out of the race .
Some of these Democrats were tepid Clinton backers to begin with , wishing to go with the presumed winner or responding to the soft extortion of Bill Clinton and his allies .
But others were sincerely committed and now fear that the Clintons , she and he , will not know how to lose -- and take the Democratic Party down with them .
Politics can be ugly , not to mention sad .
Broken dreams are strewn across the American landscape .
Fred Thompson resigned from " Law & Order . "
Chris Dodd moved his family from Connecticut to Iowa just for the caucuses .
Mitt Romney blew through a fortune .
John Edwards campaigned through personal pain .
The difference between a presidential candidate and a fool in love is only a matter of Secret Service protection .
For Hillary Clinton , a loss has to be particularly tough .
The presidency is not just the ultimate honor for her .
It is , as others have suggested , a justification for all she has put up with .
My cards are already on the table .
I do n't think that Clinton can win the nomination but even if she does , I do n't think she will win the general election .
That would become apparent as she starts to campaign in states that have yet to see her .
The harder she works , the worse she does .
No one can know the outcome of this years presidential election , but we do know that congressmen Ron Paul has a neo - con rival aiming to take his congressional seat .
Congressman Ron Paul must raise $ 400,000 by the 9th of February to assure he has the funds needed for victory in the Republican primary .
Once he secures the Republican nomination his congressional race will go uncontested .
Over $ 100,000 has already been raise but more is still needed .

That ’s basically what has happened between the U.S. and Iran  just substitute enriched uranium for poppies .
Now , Bush officials are trying to tell everyone : “ No , no , Iran is still dangerous .
You have to keep the coalition together to get Tehran to stop enriching uranium . ”
But in a world where everyone is looking for an excuse to do business with Iran , not to sanction it , we ’ve lost leverage .
Everyone in the neighborhood can smell it  and it worries them .
Said Gary Samore , director of studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Clinton administration expert on proliferation : “ The U.S. N.I.E. , by leading with the statement that Iran has halted its nuclear weapons program , has left the misleading impression that the danger has passed . ”
It has not passed , he noted , because Iran is still enriching uranium in violation of U.N. proliferation rules to which Iran had agreed ( and testing long - range delivery missiles ) .
Yes , it is still enriching below weapons grade .
Iran says this is to fuel nuclear reactors to generate electricity  but it has no such reactors .
And to get that uranium enriched to weapons grade , all it has to do is keep running it through its centrifuges .
“ That is the hardest part of building a nuclear weapon , and Iran is still doing it , ” said Mr. Samore .
“ Our ability to get strong international sanctions to halt that was already weak , ” but by declaring definitively that Iran ’s weapons program had been halted , the N.I.E. “ has given the Russians and Chinese a good excuse to make sanctions even weaker . ”
As I have said before , I ’d rather see Iran go nuclear , and contain it , than have the Bush team start another Middle East war over this issue .
But I ’d much prefer a negotiated end to Iran ’s enrichment .
Right now there is a silly debate : Should we negotiate with Iran “ conditionally ” or “ unconditionally ” on this issue .
Wrong question .
The right question is should we enter such negotiations with or without leverage .
If we sit down with the Iranians without the leverage of a global coalition ready to impose tighter and tighter economic sanctions  should Iran not halt enrichment  we ’ll end up holding a stuffed animal .
The peculiar ( obtuse ? ) way the N.I.E. on Iran was framed has deprived all who favor a negotiated settlement of leverage .
“ It was the C.I.A. doing its job of collecting intelligence really well and presenting it really badly , ” said Mr. Samore .
Now we have to depend on 
Oh , my God !  President Bush to persuade the world to read the whole N.I.E. and see it in a balanced perspective .
As I ’ve also said before : Some things are true even if George Bush believes them , but good luck getting anyone to buy that anymore .
We ca n’t let liberals take - over and turn America into a socialist nation .
We need to take a stand and fight back now .
We need your support .
We need you to get involved .
We need you to make an investment so we can provide President Trump and our Montana candidates at the federal , statewide , and local levels the infrastructure and resources they need to WIN in 2020 !
Let ’s Make Montana Red !

Protecting Journalistic Integrity Algorithmically
A couple years ago , when Reuters photographer Adnan Hajj got in trouble for some really bad Photoshopping , I fantasized about adapting Evolution Robotics ' object recognition technology and using it to automatically screen news photos for suspicious alterations .
It turns out you do n't need something as advanced as VIPR to detect simple cloning / stamping .
John Graham - Cumming recently posted code to detect “ copy - move forgery , ” based on a paper by Jessica Fridrich , David Soukal and Jan Lukáš .
Copymove.zip contains Graham - Cumming 's code , with a few modifications : I implemented the ( big ) speedup mentioned in this comment , and I changed it so the code only outputs the single final image containing all copied blocks , instead of multiple output images .
The algorithm is pretty good at detecting the alterations in Adnan Hajj 's photos .
On the left are Hajj 's altered photos .
On the right are the results of running the images through copymove.c , with red and blue squares showing the cloned sections .
The plume of smoke on the left side of the above photo was pretty obviously cloned , and caught by copymove .
The plume on the right has some cloning too , and supposedly some buildings have been cloned .
The jet in this photo dropped one flare , and Hajj copied it to create two more .
The bands on the top and bottom might be an artifact of the image , or its processing , or the copymove algorithm .
The image below is from a 2004 campaign ad for George Bush .
“ President Bush 's campaign acknowledged Thursday that it had doctored a photograph used in a television commercial and said the ad will be re-edited and reshipped to TV stations . ”
Copymove seems to have correctly identified the clones in the crowd .
What about this magical hovering woodchuck ?
Looks like another assault on photojournalistic integrity by someone with a stubby - little - legs - remover tool .
Unfortunately copymove is n't quite ready to be run on every AP and Reuters photo .
The program takes two parameters , a “ quality ” ( blurring ) factor and a threshold .
I used a quality of 10 and threshold of 20 for most of the images above , but those values do n't work for all images .
Some images ( especially anything with a blurry background ) are filled with false positives no matter what settings are used .
And finally , I could n't find an RSS or atom feed containing high quality news photos .
( are there any ? )
Later : I accidentally uploaded an old version of the code .
I 've updated the zip file with the right version .

TOKYO – In April , Nike erected a billboard in front of the Apple Store in Shibuya depicting a brakeless track bike and the slogan , " No Brakes , No Problem . "
Immediately , a furious discussion started up on the bicycle board of 2 - channel , Japan 's biggest and most important internet forum .
Forum members soon launched a massive phone campaign targeting Nike , the Tokyo police department and the Bureau of Economy , Trade and Industry .
Very politely , the mob lectured officials about the dangers of speeding downhill without brakes .
Less than 48 hours later , the billboard was taken down .
The 2 - channel forum is a Japanese internet phenomenon .
This single site has more influence on Japanese popular opinion than the prime minister , the emperor and the traditional media combined .
On one level , it serves as a fun , informative place for people to read product reviews , download software and compare everything from the size of their poop to quiz show answers .
But conversations hosted here have also influenced stock prices , rallied support for philanthropic causes , organized massive synchronized dance routines , prevented terrorism and driven people to their deathbeds .
" 2 - channel stirs the naked heroism that lives in every individual , " says Kensuke Suzuki , the author of several books on Japanese internet culture .
" This can be dangerous , but in a community where you can't ordinarily express your true feelings because of its restrictions , it 's really important . "
The 2 - channel community is an anonymous anarchy , and for the Japanese it is refreshing liberation from their strict , button - down lives .
The forum 's origins trace back to a college apartment in Arkansas , where founder Hiroyuki Nishimura was a student in May 1999 .
While most extant bulletin board systems were themed around certain topics of interest , Nishimura created a comprehensive forum that branches off in multiple tangential threads , making its growth exponential .
2 - channel operates without moderation ; some users simply volunteer to be " deleters , " removing posts that do n't fit the lax guidelines .
" On 2 - channel , there 's a culture of self - determination that does n't exist elsewhere , " says Daisuke Okabe , a research associate in new media technologies at Keio University .
" It 's widely acknowledged as a special place on the internet , where people can combat the mass media on a grass - roots level . "
In Japan , speaking out risks public humiliation , so many do n't .
But on 2 - channel , citizens can criticize politicians and celebrities , children can bitch about their parents and students can rat out their teachers .
" I know that if I say something stupid in class , it 'll probably be on 2 - channel later that day , " Okabe says .
" Inevitably , I sometimes find myself censoring myself because of that . "
Initially , 2 - channel was hosted on a single set of servers owned and operated by Nishimura .
Two years later , the forum had grown so big , he ran out of money .
Fearing its annihilation , a team of programmers on the Unix board saved the server by devising a read.cgi code and installing a proprietary browser .
To cover costs , Nishimura started charging an annual membership fee of $ 33 for access to the archives .
Spam filters and IP logs began a year later .
Today , with 2.5 million posts a day and about 800 active boards split into thousands of threads , 2 - channel is the biggest BBS in the world .
And while the posts on 2 - channel are often nothing more than ramblings of the average Joe , its scope is so widespread and its threads so influential that companies and authorities monitor it closely .
Dentsu , the world 's biggest ad agency , has a " buzz research " division that monitors 2 - channel constantly to see what people are talking about , and there are several consultancies that advise companies on managing their online reps .
Even government officials are stepping into 2 - channel forums to solve crime .
After a bus hijacking and murder was discussed in 2000 , police started monitoring the boards for leads and tips .
So many arrests were made in the following months that posters stopped publicizing their desire to kill their infuriating parents or destroy their school , says Suzuki .
But like most web communities , 2 - channel has its share of problems .
On occasion , the 2 - channel community behaves like a mob , turning on members who transgress with massive amounts of hate mail , the revelation of private information and stalkers monitoring their homes 24/7 .
" It 's very yakuza , in a way , " says Suzuki .
" An angry , riled up 2 - channel community has no sense of responsibility and will do anything to break its target . "
Currently , its 30 - year - old founder faces charges in more than 50 civil lawsuits in Tokyo alone and more than $ 4 million in settlements and court penalties for libel , defamation , copyright violations , privacy and personal injury .
But Nakamura is defiant .
" I do n't have any intention of paying up to a country whose laws I do n't respect , " he told Yomiuri Shimbun , a major Japanese newspaper , last month .
" As long as they 're not handing me the death sentence , I 'm not backing down . "
2 - Channel in the News :
Love :
One of the most famous 2 - channel stories is that of Train Man , a romantic tale about a socially awkward geek who finds true love with a beautiful woman by following the advice of his online friends .
Train Man's 2 - channel conversation threads were compiled into a book , which led to a manga series and ultimately a movie that premiered in the United States late last year .
Philanthropy : In October 2004 , thousands of people on one of the volunteer boards rallied help for victims of the Niigata Prefecture Chuetsu earthquake .
And when a thousand folded cranes at the Hiroshima Atomic Bomb Memorial were burned to a crisp , a single call for help on 2 - channel yielded 830,000 newly folded cranes in a matter of days .
Mass suicide : Last December , an anonymous post began a thread with this simple message : " 28 years has been enough .
I live in Hiroshima .
I plan to die within the month .
Will somebody come with me ?
I do n't have the courage to go alone . "
More than 700 messages follow .
" Take a nap , " one says .
" What 's wrong ? " another asks .
" My college girlfriend was gang - raped , and she killed herself .
Plus I have over 4 million yen in debt , " the guy responds before disappearing completely from the forum .
What happened to him is n't known , but the conversation continues among other suicidal hopefuls , self - hater - haters and gentle negotiators .
The last post , published just a few hours ago , is a goodbye note by a woman who betrayed her lover .
The conversation is one of many mass - suicide discussion threads .
Stock market : On Dec. 8 , 2005 , at 9:27 a.m. , a trader for Mizuho Securities mistakenly placed a sell order of 610,000 shares for 1 yen instead of 1 share for 610,000 yen for the recruitment agency J - Com .
Word instantly got out on 2 - channel that a mistake had been made , and two twenty - somethings became millionaires overnight .
Mizuho Securities is suing the Tokyo Stock Exchange for 40 billion yen in losses , citing a glitch in the exchange 's system that caused a delay in the cancellation order .
Crime : On May 3 , 2000 , a 17 - year - old boy who called himself Neomugicha ( " Barley Tea " ) posted a strange warning message on 2 - channel an hour before hijacking a bus in Fukuoka and killing one passenger .
2 - channel regulars who had earlier ignored Neomugicha 's claims started paying serious attention to unusual threats .
So did the police .
A copycat who called himself Neomugishu ( " Barley Wine " ) was later arrested after he boasted of a planned terrorist attack on a railway company .
Vote rigging :
When comedian Masashi Tashiro was nominated for Time magazine 's Person of the Year in 2001 , 2 - channelers hacked the voting system and placed multiple votes that propelled him to the No. 1 position over Osama bin Laden and George W. Bush , and crashed Time. com 's server .
Tashiro – who is infamous for his blatant sexual harassment and belligerent public behavior – was removed from the list .
If you prefer an alternative desktop environment such as KDE Plasma Desktop or Xfce , you can download a Fedora Spin for your preferred desktop environment and use that to install Fedora , pre-configured for the desktop environment of your choice .
If you go after the storm in this small town in Estonia , you ’ll catch yourself thinking that you ’ve got into a fairy tail .
Just look !
via orange -m
We all knew it was just a matter of time .
The almighty dollar always wins out in the end , no matter how principled an organization might seem to be .
Just look at the Catholic Encyclopedia .
It ’s one of the most well - respected sources of information in the world .
But when you open up each of their entries , what do you see ?
A big ugly Google Ad staring you right in the face .
It ’s not subtle either .
Now if you had asked me 7 years ago which organizations on the web might avoid the temptation to uglify in the name of of revenue , I probably could have only listed a handful of sites .
In December of 2006 there was really only one left on my list : Wikipedia .
But despite it ’s unwillingness to uglify thus far , I ’ve had an uneasy feeling in my stomach for some time , suspecting that eventually , Wikipedia too , would give in .
Call me jaded or whatever .
But the cancerous spread of uglification in the name of revenue has reached to the far corners of the web , and I could n’t help but suspect that Wikipedia be taken in as well .
So it came as no surprise when Jimmy Wales recently hinted at Wikipedia ’s move towards a revenue model , in the name of charity !!!
According to Reuters in an article entitled Wikipedia founder mulls revenue options :
Wikipedia … could veer from its no advertising policy in the future to raise cash for charity .
Now , we should be clear that Jimmy Wales tries to underplay this development by emphasizing “ for charity ” and by suggesting that they may first try to monetize in non-advertisement via quizzes and trivia games .
But let ’s not mince words here .
This is Wikipedia clearly setting the table for advertisement uglification .
After all , do quizzes and trivia games really have the potential to raise sizable amounts of revenue for charity ?
If Jimmy really wants to help the kids in Africa , as he says , then just plop some AdSense down and you ’ll have millions within days .
We know you ’re going to do it Wikipedia .
Everyone else has .

So you want to sleep at work .
I can't say that 's the brightest idea in the world , but who am I to judge ?
Let me help you out : if you want to sleep at your desk and also look really , really creepy while awake , all you need to do is buy some of these eye stickers .
Slap 'em on your closed eyelids , learn to sleep sitting up , and you 'll be sure to fool everyone who walks by your desk .
There is absolutely no way for this plan to fail … trust me .

Brain fMRI after six months of a subject who was allowed to sleep the night after learning the word pairs .
Correct word recall activates the mPFC and the occipital cortex , but there is no longer significant activity in the hippocampus .

As time passes , our memories are transferred to different parts of the brain in order to ideally store our past experiences .
While scientists have known that sleep plays an important role in helping consolidate memories , a new study investigates the role of sleep a step further , and shows how one night of sleep can lead to changes in brain activity six months after an event has occurred .
The group of researchers , from the University of Liege in Belgium , has published their results in a recent issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Their research shows that a good night ’s sleep after learning word pairs enhances memory processing in the hippocampus , and also induces information transfer between the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) .
This transfer serves to consolidate memories , helping new memories become stable and immune to interfering stimuli .
“ Our work shows how the development of a trace left by new memories depends on sleep , ” co-author Steffen Gais told PhysOrg.com .
“ This is the first time we could confirm in humans a number of predictions based on animal research .
In particular , we could show that the hippocampus plays only a temporary role for storing new semantic information , and that other brain regions slowly take over its function . ”
In general , memory consolidation occurs in two forms : through molecular processes at individual synapses , and through a reorganization of storing memories within different brain systems .
In the second form , memory consolidation begins in the hippocampus , and over the course of several months memories are transferred to the prefrontal cortex .
Although scientists do n’t fully understand how this reorganization works , the Belgian study shows that getting a good night ’s sleep the night after learning a new fact has a direct impact on the transfer process between the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex .
In the study , 18 subjects were given 90 word pairs , and then were immediately tested on how many word pairs they could recall while being monitored with an fMRI .
Half the subjects were then instructed to sleep normally that night , while half were required to remain awake all night in a monitored room with TVs , music , and games .
Two days after the initial learning , the subjects were again tested .
Not only did the sleep - deprived forget a significantly greater number of word pairs , but the fMRIs revealed that brain activity in the right hippocampus was significantly stronger in subjects who slept than those who did n’t .
“ This was surprising .
Our original hypothesis about the time - course of hippocampal involvement predicted an immediate decrease – not an increase – in hippocampal activity after sleep , ” Gais said .
“ Only after some studying the literature we found that we were not alone to show a similar pattern of activity . ”
Six months later , the results showed a different contrast between the two groups .
The subjects were not told they would be tested again , and had forgotten most word pairs , with those in the sleeping group remembering slightly but not significantly more word pairs than the sleep - deprived .
More significantly , however , were the brain responses in the fMRI .
This time , subjects in the sleeping group had greater brain activity in the left ventral medial prefrontal cortex ( but not the hippocampus ) compared with the sleep - deprived , who had a more active hippocampus .
“ We were very surprised to see the shift in brain activity between brain regions so clearly , ” Gais said .
“ In particular , to see an increased connectivity between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex early after learning , and then a decrease in hippocampal and increase in prefrontal activity during the later recall test was very exciting for us . ”
The researchers explained that this finding indicates that sleep deprivation after learning something new hinders the plastic changes needed for memory consolidation .
Nevertheless , sleep - deprived subjects still recalled nearly the same amount of word pairs as their rested counterparts , since the hippocampal and neocortical systems store memories in a redundant way .
However , long - term memories stored in the prefrontal cortex are more resistant to interference , whereas new memories in the hippocampus are more susceptible to interfering stimuli .
Analyzing the interplay between brain regions , memories , and post - learning sleep will hopefully help researchers further understand the intricate workings of the brain for a variety of medical applications .
“ We believe that our findings bring us a little closer to understanding how the brain stores and processes new memories , ” Gais said .
“ This understanding might prove helpful in improving memory , for example , in conditions like Alzheimer 's disease . ”

NEW YORK , Oct 22 ( Reuters ) - Traders may be fleeing the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as electronic trading becomes preeminent , but that did n’t stop Fox Business Network , the perky business channel that debuted last week , from setting up a studio on the floor despite the thinning market action .
Already nicknamed the “ Foxhole ” by some , the studio is squeezed between two floor trading booths , unlike CNBC and other rival networks that operate their studios one story above the trading floor .
FBN hopes the unique location can give it an edge over its more established rival CNBC , whose star reporter Maria Bartiromo in 1995 became the first journalist to report live daily from the NYSE floor .
But with stock market action moving almost entirely off the floor and onto computer screens , the NYSE floor is unlikely to be the battleground where the two networks fight for eyeballs , analysts said .
“ FBN may be able to give CNBC a run for its money , but it wo n’t happen on the floor of the stock exchange , ” said Robert Thompson , a professor of television and popular culture at Syracuse University .
The walls of the Foxhole , an open booth measuring no more than 70 square feet , are plastered with the yellow FBN logo .
Wires snake around desks holding an assortment of papers , laptops and FBN anchor Nicole Petallides ’s make - up bag .
A robotic camera stationed in one corner surveys the floor .
The network does n’t plan to station anyone in the studio permanently , but will send reporters and producers to the booth depending on the news , said Brian Jones , FBN ’s senior vice president of operations .
CNBC , controlled by General Electric Co GE.N , has been unrivaled in its daily coverage of the stock markets from the exchange floor , providing viewers with analysis on what is moving the market .
It has about 22 people working on and off at its NYSE studio .
‘ AN ANACHRONISM ’
FBN ’s success in placing its booth on the floor also shows how more vacant space is opening up on the floor as live traders are replaced by machines .
When Bartiromo started broadcasting from the exchange 12 years ago , the floor thronged with more than 3,300 traders .
Only about half of those traders remain today .
FBN ’s Brian Jones said having a studio on the floor puts the network in the thick of the market action -- even if the trading floor hustle and bustle is a shadow of its former self .
“ We wanted to find a way to be where the action is as far as the traders who are still there on the floor , ” Jones said .
But independent network news analyst Andrew Tyndall wondered how much of a coup FBN ’s floor studio is .
“ Reporting from the stock exchange nowadays is really an anachronism , ” he said .
“ When CNBC first went there , you still had non-electronic trading , whereas now it ’s much more a symbolic place than a place for news gathering . ”
Not surprisingly , CNBC , which together with CNN , Bloomberg and other networks is stationed in booths upstairs , argues that Fox 's positioning on the floor does n't give News Corp 's NWSa .
N Rupert Murdoch 's latest venture any additional advantage .
“ There ’s no one closer to the scene than we are , ” said Jonathan Wald , CNBC ’s senior vice president for business news .
“ We ’re down there constantly , so whether or not they ’ve got a studio on the floor , we ’re on the floor and we have these relationships that are priceless and built over 17 years , ” Wald said .
CNBC is also expanding its coverage of trading floors , although Wald said it had nothing to do with FBN ’s launch .
The network announced on Monday it has launched the CNBC Investor Network , which will take viewers live to trading floors across America to provide instant analysis of market moving news .
Traders on the Big Board ’s floor , where many TV screens switched loyalties from CNBC to FBN last week , took a wait - and - watch approach to the network , but welcomed the new addition .
“ The more channels we have , the better it is for investors , the better it is for the New York Stock Exchange , ” said Doreen Mogavero , a floor trader .
“ As trading is becoming more electronic , the ability for us to explain the changes to more sources is refreshing , whether CNBC or Fox , ” said Jeffrey Frankel , another trader .

This image clearly shows an x-ray jet launching plasma out into the solar system from the Sun 's north polar coronal hole .
This image was taken 10 January 2007 by Hinode 's X - ray telescope .
Powerfulmagnetic waves have been confirmed for the first time as major players in theprocess that makes the sun 's atmosphere strangely hundreds of times hotter thanits already superhot surface .
Themagnetic waves — called Alfven waves — can carry enough energy from the sun'sactive surface to heat its atmosphere , or corona .
" Thesurface and corona are chock full of these things , and they 're veryenergetic , " said Bart de Pontieu , a physicist at the Lockheed Martin Solarand Astrophysics Laboratory in California .
The suncontains powerful heating and magnetic forces which drive the temperature totens of thousands of degrees at the surface — yet the quieter corona wreathing the sun reaches temperatures of millions of degrees .
Scientists have speculatedthat Alfven waves act as energyconveyor belts to heat the sun ?s atmosphere , but lacked the observationalevidence to prove their theories .
De Pontieuand his colleagues changed that by using the Japanese orbiting solarobservatory Hinode to peerat the region sandwiched between the sun 's surface and corona , called the chromosphere .
Not only did they spot many Alfvenwaves , but they also estimated the waves carried more than enough energy tosustain the corona 's temperatures as well as to power the solar wind ( chargedparticles that constantly stream out from the sun ) to speeds of nearly 1 millionmph .
However , the chromosphere findings alone could not prove the waves carried their energyinto the sun ?s atmosphere .
? If youobserve waves in the chromosphere , that doesn?t mean they can get to thecorona , ?
De Pontieu told SPACE.com .
Some wavesmay get reflected back down to the sun instead of passing through thetransition region between the surface and atmosphere .
Waves that reach thecorona also become more difficult to detect using current instruments , thanksto the long line - of - sight .
De Pontieu ? sgroup turned to researchers at the University of Oslo , Norway , who had createda computersimulation representing part of the sun .
Once they knew what to look for , the researchers found magnetic waves within the simulation of the corona thatstrongly resembled the Alfven waves directly observed in the chromosphere .
Even as thesimulations helped establish Alfven waves as energy carriers for the sun ?
satmosphere and solar wind , the new observational findings will help modelerscreate improved sun simulations .
? It goesback and forth — we learn from simulations , they learn from us , ? said DePontieu .
Manymysteries remain about the sun ?s restless activities .
De Pontieu ?s groupfocused on Alfven waves generated by the sun ?s heat turbulence , but otherresearchers examined Alfven waves generated when the sun ?s magnetic field linesstress and snap back together like invisible magnets .
That reconnection forcealso creates jets of X - rays that shoot outwards from the sun , as captured by Hinode ? sinstruments .
Scientistsstill don?t know which source of Alfven waves plays a more important role inthe heating the sun ?s atmosphere , but can use the latest findings as a steppingstone .
? We need tostudy both more , to see which one dominates , ? noted De Pontieu .
?
But it ?s nicefor people to know that Alfven waves can do the job .?
The Robotex AH is a robotic killing machine .
Standing just 2 feet tall and traveling 10 mph , the Robotex can go up stairs and then shoot a 10 - inch hole through a steel door from a quarter mile away .
And most days , that 's enough to make us crap our pants .
But what 's even more interesting / scary is that this concept video was produced by ex ( or rogue ? )
Disney Imagineer Terry Izumi .
Shooting up to 300 rounds per minute and undeterred by nasty , uneven terrain , Robotex hopes to sell their ... Robotex ... for $ 30,000 per unit to the government .
And if this concept video proves in any way accurate ... let 's just say I 'll never look at Micky Mouse the same way again .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Banks in the United States have been quietly borrowing “ massive amounts ” from the U.S. Federal Reserve in recent weeks , using a new measure the Fed introduced two months ago to help ease the credit crunch , according to a report on the web site of The Financial Times .
The newspaper said the use of the Fed ’s Term Auction Facility ( TAF ) , which allows banks to borrow at relatively attractive rates against a wide range of their assets , saw borrowing of nearly $ 50 billion of one - month funds from the Fed by mid-February .
The Financial Times said the move has sparked unease among some analysts about the stress developing in opaque corners of the U.S. banking system and the banks ’ growing reliance on indirect forms of government support .

Happy Holidays 2007 ends .
People die world wide because it does n’t pay to keep them alive , to exspensive , actually they are murdered .
The secret fraternal brotherhood “ New World Order ” “ The PNAC ” Rothschilds , Rockefellers , JP Morgan , clubs cigars and brandy ( George C. Soros mercenary for the Rothschilds ) Henry Kissinger and others the PNAC , the Bilderbergers .
There are two groups of elite men and women in particular that most American people do not know about , which are a clear threat and danger to the freedom of the American people .
These are the Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) and the Trilateral Commission .
"
The most powerful clique in these elitist groups has one objective — they want to bring about the surrender of the sovereignty of the national independence of the United States .
A second clique of international members in the CFR founded in 1921 comprises the Wall Street international bankers and their key agents .
Primarily , they want the world banking monopoly and the control of global government .
" Trilateral founded Commission 1973 Right now the United States is completely under the control of those who run these two organizations ( David Rockefeller in particular ) .
It is therefore important to understand these organizations if we wish to understand what has been taking place in the United States since the early 1921 .
Unfortunately , the Council on Foreign Relations is not the only group proposing an end to the sovereignty of the United States .
In 1973 , founder Edward Madelhouse the Trilateral Commission was founded for one goal , ” world domination ” The PNAC Corporation which George Bush father , referred to as the “ New World Order ” in one of his speeches during his term in office .
The Illuminati became a fraternity of brothers , infact the illuminati blood brothers were hiding in the Free Mason Society world wide , this way they were able to move around freely , undetected , hidden in the Free Mason organization in England , France , Germany , America involving families like the Rothschilds and Rockefellers .
George Bush father , son and grand father .
Henry Kissinger , Rothschilds , Rockefellers , J.P. Morgan are literally some of the descendants of George C Soros , the former Rothschild mercenary , these men are literally related , they are PNAC members , they are the “ blood brother hood . ” Kissinger was born in Fuerth , Germany , on May 27 , 1923 , he came to the United States in 1938 , he became a United States citizen on June 19 , 1943 .
His second marriage to Nancy Maginnes produced two children , his first marriage , two as well .
Kissinger , Rothschild etc keep the PNAC well supplied with loyal followers , their propagation , spreading their seed , keep the PNAC in strong and on going members for the fraternity .
They operate in secret , set global policy through the Trilateral Commission , the Council on Foreign Relations and the World Bank .
The PNAC are Master Builders of global complex blueprints , for example the Multilateral Agreement on Investment , Free Trade agreements , and electronic fund transfer systems development or the proposed single global electronic currency this should be viewed as very suspicious .
The media and banks are guilty having helped the government gain public trust through false propaganda .
These new systems are a bag of further controlling false hoods directly and purposefully wheedled on the general public , with unprecedented means of persuasion .
The London Bullion Market Association ( LBMA ) , is controlled in the passed and present primarily by Rothschild , these are important reasons to remain suspicious and watchful , to deal with what ever happens .
More over one is well informed to “ be a critical thinker ” maintain that status and think like them .
The " new world order " the Brotherhood ( a network of secretive policy police groups ) the Council on Foreign Relations , the Trilateral Commission and other highly secretive policies formulated in highly secretive Bilderberg meetings yield unimaginable , immense financial control in global circles with far reaching tentacles deeply entrenched in the U.S. Federal Reserve , Bank of England , Bank of France , European and Swiss banks .
This organization has roots dating back to the Illuminati ( 1776 illuminati in Europe and America 18th century ) .
the Bush PNAC government spent 200 billion dollars on their Iraq Afghanistan war this year alone , in his recent speech Bush is asking yet for more and he wants additional money for the Vatican City sized embassy in Baghdad and more for Intelligence .
He is in an all out war with Congress .
Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency twice in California , a water state of emergency was also declared in Georgia last week , the bright New World Order increments are getting closer together , the illegal bill Bush signed encroaching on citizens privacy , he is now able to declare a national emergency and confiscate all bank accounts and safety deposit boxes , houses , land of all US citizens .
The Texas governor is authorized to suspend any regulatory statute related to the conduct of state business ; use all state and political subdivisions ’ resources to cope with disasters ; and temporarily reassign staff , functions , and resources to assist with emergency services .
In addition , the governor is authorized to commandeer private property ( with compensation ) ; recommendevacuation of all or part of the population from a stricken area , prescribe evacuation routes , transportation modes and destinations , and control ingress and egress ; and suspend or limit sales of alcohol , firearms , and explosives .
Bank Of America , Compass Bank managers and all other U.S. banks , have been instructing their employees in the last few weeks on how to respond to customer demands in the event of a collapse of the U.S. economy , which can be any time soon , specifically telling the employees that only agents from the “ Department Of Homeland Security ” will have authority to decide what belongings customers may have from their safe deposit boxes - and that precious metals and other valuables will not be released to U.S. citizens .
The bank employees have been strictly prohibited from revealing the banks ' new " guidelines " to anyone .
( however , employees have been talking to friends and family ) The next time you visit your bank , ask them about it - then ask yourself , why is this information being kept secret from customers and the public - what 's really going on ?
FEMA has activated and is currently staffing its vast network of empty internment camps with armed military personnel - unknown to most Americans , these large federal facilities are strategically positioned across the U.S. landscape to " manage " the population in the event of a " terrorist " attack , ( who are the terrorists ) a civilian uprising , large - scale dissent , or an insurrection against the government .
“ if you ’re not for us , you ’re against us ” Some of these razor - wired facilities have the capacity of detaining a million people .
The PNAC is clearly prepared for the uprising against their oppression .
It took FEMA 5 days to get water to the Super Dome .
A further point The Patriot Act and the US Senate 's vote to ban habeas corpus ( Nov 14th ) - along with George W. Bush having signed executive orders giving him sole authority to impose martial law , suspend habeas corpus and ignore the Posse Comitatus Act , have together pretty much destroyed any notions of freedom and justice for Americans .
The time has come to consider and reexamine your free , democratic , Novus Ordo Seclorum PNAC Corporate government . -
Take a good , hard look at itBy now we are very familiar with incremental moves from the PNAC used in deceiving maneuvers to complete their world globalization plan .
Nero fiddled while he watched his fire , Rome burned he fiddled .
Schwarzenegger fiddles any PNAC Corporation tune , Bush sat and fiddled with “ my pet goat ” and watched WTC fire .
Two in one strike , financial control and terrorist rhetoric .
Thousands were murdered there with deception .
The PNAC mobilized Turkey military , a constant military stream is rolling towards Sirnak near the Iraq border looking for the back door in to Iran and Syria .
Today Turkey bombed a northern Iraqi city With out reason or sense .
The lie goes , 12 people were killed , by some body , much like the Israeli two soldiers captured saga before they invaded Lebanon leveling Beirut without sense or reason .
the same kind of manifesto so the PNAC has a reason , the reason can very well be the careful preparation to invade Iran .
Israel claimed 2 of their soldiers were captured just before they flattened Lebanon two years ago and murdered scores of Citizens in Beirut .
This time when they bombed and raped Lebanon they took out the entire book publishing industry for the Middle East , all of it , how ’s that , and why is that The Clinton PNAC administration bombed the Al - Shifa ( Arabic for " healing " ) pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum North , Sudan which was constructed between 1992 and 1996 with components imported from the United States , Sweden , Italy , Switzerland , Germany , India , and Thailand .
The industrial complex was composed of around four buildings .
It was the largest pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum and employed over 300 workers , producing medicine both for human and veterinary use .
The factory was used primarily for the manufacture of anti-malaria medicinesClinton said oops “ as if ” he did n’t know what he did intentionally .
Zarkozy the fresh new man with the PNAC visits his friend in Washington .
He guides France but is n’t really French , but what does that matter , it does n’t as long as he fits in the pictureBush has a new best friend .
Together they make Washington deceiving head lines , Sarkozy stands shamelessly before the American Congress and people and says “ so many American lives ” lost .
How many exactly , Zarkozy does n’t say because he does n’t know , the American public does n’t even know , Bush will not inform the public of that issue he is still keeping the information secret , keeping vital information from the American public .
The coffins and body bags hidden from view .
How many , is intentionally cloaked .
Rumsfeld shook the hand of once “ friend Saddam Hussein ” in behalf of PNAC president Ronald Reagan , but then , oops they hanged Hussein he did n’t fit in to the picture any more , absolute precision .
What happened to Rumsfeld , Rove and Ashcroft ?
Imagine all the homeless US Veterans in cold streets of America , while Bush and Sarkozy enjoy a warm candle light dinner in the White House , now that ’s a grim picture , a very grim villainess war picture indeed .
Painful Hunger , death brought by a brutal invasive force from across the ocean , the West came to murder their country , their homes , rape their daughters , sons are murdered execution style , their children murdered or born freaks from DU poisoning , DU left behind and sprinkled across Iraq for all to enjoy , this is the PNAC gift laced with intense fear for Iraq , Afghanistan , the greater Middle East , the world .
There is no intent to stop the military or Contractor atrocity , on the contrary , Blackwater is certain proof that the PNAC is going forward with absolute Precision and horrifying intent .
And now the administration wants Iraq to pay for the Trilateral , CFR war .
the American public definitely need the new liar friend telling them about their dead , how many , this information is carefully cloaked , how many citizens dead in Iraq and Afghanistan including children , babies , the public is not privileged to the truth , this truth is secretly hidden with caution and purposefulness , out of sight , Americans are kept in the dark , as is the world population .
Lahore Pakistan pretty much looks , like Beirut Lebanon did before the PNAC took over there , planted PNAC protestors , Hariri assassination , chaos and deception .
Todays Negroponte emergence is significant , he does not come out often .
Why did he come out now , for what reason .
Good tidings , it ’s almost Christmas .
Negroponte in a rare TV appearance says “ Pakistan is a country vital to the US interest ” , the issue is not what Bush PNAC or Negroponte want in Pakistan , the issue is , what Pakistan wants in Pakistan and for Pakistan .
Every country is vital to US interest , that ’s perfectly clear .
The US government has been dogging and threatening Musharaf .
What does it matter what ’s vital to the PNAC , every country is vital to PNAC interest ; the PNAC has a love for other peoples property .
Every country the PNAC is interested in and that means the world , they arrogantly keep stealing .
Bush has a new little weasel in Sarkozy who will lie for him , steal for him and yes , will kill for him .
Does Zarkozy know or care how many US soldiers died .
Does Sarkozy even know that ¼ of the US homeless are Veterans ; regrettably all the dead seemingly died in vain in a war fought for PNAC greed and ambition .
Negroponte in a rare TV appearance says “ Pakistan is a country vital to US interest ” , why else would they be dogging , threatening and hunting Musharaf and they assassinated Hariri because Lebanon was of vital interest to the US .
Plainly put , every country is vital to PNAC interest .
Every country the PNAC is interested in and that means the world .
Athletes are attacked lately , poisoned , discredited , managers are murdered , Haas is n’t the only one , Stuttgart , Germany ( Nov. 7 ) - The International Tennis Federation is investigating allegations that Tommy Haas was poisoned just before Germany 's Davis Cup match against Russia , money and influence , can federations be trusted ?.
People ca n’t see through the massive blinding sand storm , Much like the sand storm used in the Middle East created by powerful Mage , helping Jesus out of the tight situation so he could safely escape the brutal Roman government centuries ago .
The Romans too thought their Empire would last for ever and of course it was for the good of the people imperialists say that the PNAC say it too .
the PNAC has achieved the following .
goalsHalf the world — nearly three billion people — live on less than two dollars a day .
The GDP ( Gross Domestic Product ) of the poorest 48 nations ( i.e. a quarter of the world ’s countries ) is less than the wealth of the world ’s three richest people combined .
Nearly a billion people entered the 21st century unable to read a book or sign their names .
Less than one per cent of what the world spent every year on weapons was needed to put every child into school by the year 2000 and yet it did n’t happen .
1 billion children live in poverty ( 1 in 2 children in the world ) .
640 million live without adequate shelter , 400 million have no access to safe water , 270 million have no access to health services .
10.6 million died in 2003 before they reached the age of 5 ( or roughly 29,000 children per day ) .
During globalization the PNAC liquidate world population in childhood stage
This is cheaper and easier .
Eliminating world population at maturity is not as cost effective and more difficult ; this was the PNAC experience during the Hitler trial era when people eliminated were mostly adult .
Clearly it is important not to repeat mistakes .
viewing world population reduction , from the belief of resources and cost effectiveness , the PNAC merely has a different take on collection of numerical data .
They have planned world wide Plague , already available in laboratories as we speak , with which at least half the world population will be whipped out .
AIDS , Bird flu , BSE have been tested ; all government lab designer bugs are ready to be used on the world population .

The above list is not complete , but it gives us some idea of what and who is envolved .9 - 11 2001 one of the PNAC accomplishments , on that day they started using Osama bin Ladin and al Qaida as villains actively , pointing the “ its them not us * finger , used for their power grab enhancement .
We remember Bush sitting stunned for 7 minutes seemingly unable to move , but in reality he was following PNAC instruction ..
We also remember Andrews air force fighter planes assigned specifically to such emergencies and Cheney , no where to be seen , Cheney , could not be found for 30 minutes .
US security first alert attack fighters were clearly ordered not to respond .
The American Nation in shock and utter disbelief , how could such a thing happen ?
Did n’t Bush promise security ?
And why would a clever enemy stop at that , stop at the financial gates , when in reality they could proceed to the heart land or at least to a near by nuclear facility ?
The PNAC saved that scenario for later .
Surely the enemy called clever and cunning by Bush himself on numerous occasions would come better prepared .
What of the leaders who lie through their teeth propagandize bogus bin Ladin TV video ?
We have no idea what they are capable of .
The American state of Georgia just announced a state of emergency ; for such an event Bush has already signed sealed and delivered a bill allowing the Government to confiscate private bank accounts and private safety deposit boxes , private mail and phone conversations , so much for privacy and freedom .
US military and doubtless the government sanctioned Blackwater group have license to occupy the homeland .
Schwarzenegger declares a second state of emergency in California ; this should be viewed with great suspicion .
When the PNAC make a constitutional change , which of course , they can when ever they want , and install Schwarzenegger as number one in the White House , he could become the first foreign born president of the United States .
It ’s certainly not a problem for the “ New World Order ” to change the Constitution some more .
The strategically placed internment camps across the US , have been built and are ready for critical thinkers and up coming mass protesters and for all those “ who are not with them , but are against them ” .
Extermination is not ruled out , this is the reality .
Actually nothing has changed since Rome burned , the fat guy is sitting in a stone building , chewing on a ham leg , collecting taxes because he has the army , spies , police and big guns on his side .
The world has been in a state of war for thousands of years , with only insignificant periodic intermissions
They control and manipulate and murder because they can .
It ’s a fine new mess the New World Order has gotten us into , or should we pause here , give serious thought and take our responsibility for the fine mess .
It is a given that the PNAC is starting to declare states of emergency across the US in order to milk new laws , bills quietly signed by Bush .
Fact , they keep the public from knowing , that internment camps have been built .
The PNAC plan , confiscation of all moneys , houses or any property what so ever from its citizens , render the citizen impotent , intern people in to the existing internment camps just like the PNAC did in Hitlers time , those who do not comply are enemies of the Reich , every thing has been carefully planned with intent of carrying out provision .
News from US friends that their house was confiscated through dishonest government manipulation , the wheels are in motion and will accelerate at a dizzying rate .
Veterans return from Iraq having exhausted their morality on fraudulent government to find their houses repossessed , now they are homeless , the American dream in reality a raging nightmare .
Interest rates jump carefully designed by the Bush administration and your house all of a sudden belongs to the Bush administration , how did that happen , for one thing it did n’t happen suddenly it was carefully planned by the pretenders ..
The FBI rated the David Copperfield ware house in Los Angeles .
What did the FEDS expect to find ?
Financial , political manipulation has for a fact squeezed people in a position of taking out second mortgages and put home owners squarely at the merci of the government .
Government controlled banks , second mortgages , lost jobs , cant pay the bills , government , government steals the house , homeowners can , if not already , find themselves out on the street with nothing and no where to go .
They ’ll join the Iraq Vets ; increase the number of homeless in the United States .
The Bush administration does n’t care , they designed the program .
Switzerland has not seen a strong move to the right since WW2 .
the much talked about poster , creating an international stir where several white sheep , kick out a black sheep clearly has significance .
Currently in Switzerland 20 % of the population are immigrants .
Does the PNAC operate in Switzerland ?
Certainly there is factual proof , WW2 the Hitler PNAC had operational freedoms in Switzerland .
Again , who controls banks , and who controls Switzerland .
Turkeys plan to invade Iraq can be viewed as an independent move , or while the PNAC put pressure on the PKK , Bush moves to invade Iran and Syria .
Israel ’s invasion of Lebanon and the destruction of Beirut had the clear and unmistakable PNAC thumb print .
Blood is indeed running in the streets , it ’s an endless money making government party .
Economic growth is purely for government , as is security .
The World Markets crash , all of us loose , the government gain .
If this all seams unlikely or unbelievable , 9 - 11 Timeline , September 11 2001.9 - 11 deserves a critical in depth look with public excess to documents which are conveniently kept from the public .
On that financial gain day the PNAC convinced with scare tactics and lies .
It was a catastrophic event not only for America but for the world , fooling the public yet again , not in a new way of course , governments have killed their own before , it was critical , advantageous , political positioning ;
So here we are at breakfast or at work , watching the morning news , suddenly a plane appears on screen heading straight for its target , the WTC North Tower .
It was n’t just a plane , it was the Boeing 767 made into a flying bomb .
Where are the fighter planes assigned to National emergency security , parked at Andrews Air Base , the pilots , playing poker .
We find the Commander in Chief of the United States , sitting transfixed on a kids chair in a Florida school room with a vacant expression on his face , Cheney the US Vice president ; could n’t be found for close to 30 minutes , how ’s that ?
Andrews Air Base fighter squad , Americas first defense line , the major security protection did not take to the air on 9 - 11 they were ordered not to , certainly it could happen , that the United States government was taken by surprise ?
And certainly the White House , the Pentagon , the CIA , FDI , the PNAC and the Air defense were all in a coma .
Or they were creating confusion and a bizarre obstructive twilight reality . , Karl Rove , George Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld obstructionists create their own reality , Bush uses words and declarations Rove prepared for him .
Why then on that particular day , 9 - 11 did they create what they now call “ obstruction ” , and further more what does obstruction mean in this particular case .
It ’s an insipid word used for situations when cover up is needed .
Its show biz in its most deceiving .
Woven through out the PNAC fabric we find hundreds of such words in use , Bush trips over them all the time , he does n’t talk or think that way , Karl Rove puts words in the Bush mouth , Rumsfeld used them to the amusement of his audience , , even danced for us at a televised White House dinner , are we amused yet ?
Secretary of state Gates has in the passed Gates said Nicaragua was a threat to the US , yes specially the nuns who were consequently thrown in the Ocean from helicopters and drowned , today Gates said that Pakistan is not doing enough about al - Qaida a curious statement since the US did n’t do any thing about al Qaida on or before 9 - 11 , the PNAC does its incremental work chipping away at Musharaf , they have taken his 40 year plus military carrier away already , next incremental step by step elimination .
him to the Haag , Gates announced that funds fighting al - Qaida in Pakistan have been stopped , for noncompliance
We did n’t know Gates was the boss of Musharaf .
Musharaf did just fine as military leader and president , and is exactly that “ Commander in Chief and president ” , its once again arrogant behavior from the Bush administration and a purposefully incremental destructive dialog “ do as I say not as I do ” Musharaf and Pakistan together were a Nation holding its own , with out interference from the Bilderberger Corporation .
How often have we heard threatening lies from the White House , and when has it not ended in horrifying invasion , mass murder , theft and death of innocent people .
So Pakistan is just one of the coups the US instigated .
They ’re not going to be happy in Washington until they have the morally depleted Bhutto in office in Pakistan .
We had a clear picture that Bush was not in the least interested in saving lives when he was governor of Texas , qualifies a person to be governor or president , one must seriously wonder what it takes , most likely a connected father , a strong lying ability and the fact that one has no conscience .
Al - Qaida brought to the front once again , lets face it they do n’t really have any thing else in Washington .
Hitler had the communists Bush has his al - Qaida .
Hitler had the Jews , Bush has his Moslems and Islam .
Notice they always have a blame subject , always its never Hitler or Bush its THEM who ever THEY may be at the time .
Next time maybe people with blue or brown eyes , God only knows what rubbish they manufacture next .
Are the Bilderbergers Danes ? perhaps the Bilderbergers are Danish openings for release to whom the world population inexplicitly bows .
In review Hitler was a nice guy comparatively speaking .
In the 1930s when Hitler had the leading part , the PNAC performance in which Bushes grand father played a big part , sported costumes , marches , music and theatrics , holding audiences spell bound , in a rock concert atmosphere .
the PNAC still put - on a blinding grand show , with music , rhetoric , bigger bombs , missiles , drones , smaller but powerful nuclear technology , big nuclear German built stealth subs waiting in the Persian Gulf for action , the show is spectacular and the people clap and sing .
September eleven 2001 and first thing in the morning for Breakfast on TV , WTC attack , fake Osama Bin Laden video , the hoax of the new millennium , which the CIA sold the public as genuine and the people bought it , “ Buyer be aware ” , if you let yourself be blinded with snake oil and little liver pills , so be it .
However there are those folks who smelled a rat from the minute the non elected Bush set foot in the White House , a bleak , dreadful day for not just America .
The invasion of Iraq followed and brutality began every where .
The government is not naked it possesses many cloaks ; it is we who are naked and blind .
Going around in circles , like the once beautiful animals kidnapped from their habitat , going around in circles in the PNAC circus , around and around , driven to insanity , controlled , and beaten in to submission by unreasonable , uncaring authoritative controllers .
The circus is in town .
Pakistan : the US press asks the question “ how much do we have to worry about nuclear threat from Pakistan ” a stupid obnoxious subterfuge .
Actually the question is “ how much do we have to worry about the US nuclear threat ” ?
Having stock piled far more nuclear weapons , with latest additions , then any other nation , taking in to consideration the latest Bush escapade transporting nukes across the US , include the DU bombs spreading radio activity every where in the Middle East since the invasion , we are looking at a horrifying reality .
The US is making smaller nuclear weapons making them more acceptable , more portable and practical never the less powerful and deadly .
The PNAC planned to vacate Musharaf that has been clear for some time .
They want to vacate every body that is not with them and is around the perimeter of Iran and Syria .
Pakistan is on the main menu .
The not elected PNAC Brown government in Britain reports 2000 scarf wearing citizens are a direct threat to national security and to the British nation , so Brown .
Besides the 2000 scarf threats , the Brown government now feigns concern for quote “ the young children , who may become terrorists ” .
Concerned for children , let alone Muslim children , Brown is just silly ?
How ever , there is no mention at all of course , that thousands of children were murdered , dead as the result of the US - UK Middle East invasion .
Literally thousands of children have been killed .
30,000 a day from social injustice and many hundreds of thousands from PNAC generated wars .
That fact is carefully brushed under the rug .
So how exactly do they have concern for children ?
So the circus is in town , ring Meister in ring number one , is holding his whip tight in his fist , swift velocity , sublime deception and creative lies .
While the children rot in their graves their culture is being absolutely and utterly erased .
9 - 11 The Boeing 767 impact , the first plane crashed in to the North Tower.9 - 11 , US citizens are detained with out charges in the first seven weeks after 9 - 11 they were mostly new freedom seeking immigrants .
John Ashcraft swept widely , people were arrested , no charges , or reason , hand cuffed driven to detention centers and detained .
A carefully planned Incremental Oppression plan in America in progress .
Congress was working on a bill first , then the anthrax scare came , they introduced and switched the bill after mid night and forced Congress to sign the PNAC 300 plus page bill by 3.00 AM .
This is the new free democratic America .
Immigrants came to the US for the freedom , obviously freedom does not exist in the US .
American people were arrested on the basis of stereo types .
This is a clear reminder of the previous Hitler PNAC administration , morally no different at all .
The American people need to know what happened ; the American people need to know the PNAC Bush Corporation actually is a terrorist organization .
They are spreading terror and fear .
Families vanished ; people who came to the US for freedom were picked up in the middle of the night , flown back to the Middle East , displaced or in some cases actually murdered .
Ashcraft said he had no regret ; he would even though unconstitutional , do it all over again .
Guantanamo because not on US soil , the PNAC Corporation avoided all rule law .
So the people no charges again , were held and tortured .
Most of them picked up by bounty hunters for cash , if they do not belong there , tuff luck .
Bounty hunters are interested in the money and the money only , more people , more money , we see increasing PNAC justice ?
Taliban , / Al - Qaida often and falsely used name for political US propaganda .
War zone victims are entirely at the merci of the US military and Corporation hunters .
We do n’t hear about the suicides in Guantanamo any more the administration keeps the information hidden .
Prisoners , people held with out right against all rule of law , have n’t seen the moon or sun light for years , no food , torture and no one to turn to or help them .
America now under the currant brutal , militant rule flagrantly ignores the rule of law .
If there are any in Guantanamo not guilty they should not be punished and held in solitary confinement and tortured
The US does not comply with the Geneva Convention .
Bush says “ the only thing I know is these are bad people ” so that is enough , him saying , these are bad people , what exactly is he and his group doing , should the public believe a man who is well known as a pathological liar ?
But there are always the 80 % .
What occurred in Abu Gareb , occurs in Guantanamo only much worse if that can be imagined .
Obviously , choosing these methods of torture and injuytice the PNAC agrees that it is OK to treat captured Americans like wise , that is understood .
It can happen to American citizens and it will , for that reason he PNAC Corporation has and continues to build internment camps in the United States .
Any body , any time , any where .
The Turkish air force still bombs Iraq , Turkey has an air force , who supplies the Planes ?
Mr Padilla currantly still in solitary confinement , his crime , Padilla converted to Islam , the Bush administration holds Padilla indefinitely under military rule as an enemy combatant which is against all rules and yes blatantly illegal , but then Rules do not apply to the Bush administration .
However they are not above Universal law .
The PNAC hide their lack of evidence .
they have been doing so for over 200 years
In WW2 American citizens of Japanese roots were hunted , shut up , shut off and falsely accused and put in concentration camps too in California , they called them internment camps , or they could call them meditation camps , but what they were and are now , they are concentration camps with out finery .
The Patriot act went too far , it allows the Government to practice total suppression and false accusations and so what .
Every thing the PNAC does is “ to far ” Gaza , Lebanon , the new British government Brown the new Middle East envoy Blair , all too far .
Bush drilling for oil in Alaska and at the same time whining about Global warming , he had 8 years where he did absolutely nothing , all of this is to far and to far gone , but all of this creates confusion , there fore diffusion , obstructionism and incramentalism ..
Banks are spying on citizens on behalf of the Government .
The justice department can break in to your home , you may think it was a petty burglar , when in fact your Government is breaking and entering our privacy using any thing and every thing to control and put us in to their newly built detention centers and on ridiculous snoop lists ..
We are giving the wrong people too much power .
Sarkozy Hungarian with Jewish roots , has created a department of Immigration and National Identity Bush has his internment camps ready in the US .
Sarkozy is lying for his friend Bush , he already evading his promisses .
Sarkozy is a new threat to the world .
Hitler , Sarkozy , hand picked PNAC men , lets say for their specific talents , their Nationality is completely immaterial .
They could be straight from Satan ’s realm that ’s OK too and clearly some of them are .. Under the PNAC Bush administration rendered the Constitution unconstitutional .
Freedom of speech and peaceful assembly , the first amendment in the Constitution , gone nonexistent following the Bush PNAC take - over .
Many of the people stopped at airports harassed and jailed are critical of Bush policies , non of them are terrorists , or national security risks , they simply do n’t agree with Bush politics .
Just thinking or saying Bush is out of control , just that , one can expect to be hand cuffed , arrested , jailed and put on a concentration camp list .
This happened in Santa Fe , New Mexico USA and it is going on every where in the United States and European Countries .
Constitutional rights to privacy in Libraries and other public places and also private homes , have been suppressed , there are no more rights , snitches and infiltrators working for the federal government are every where .
“ Achtung Feind hört mit ” .
When they come for us , it is too late to speak up .
Think of it , land of the Free ?
Condensed BS the government is our enemy .
A South American candidate for president was asked how he feels about the US base in his country replied , “ if the US lets us put a base in Florida it ’s OK .
” That ’s the way it should be “ wie Sie mir , so Ich Ihnen Herr Bush ” 9 - 11 the hoax on the American public and the world .
An Osama bin Laden bogus image sold as genuine was a hoax .
It was n’t really Osama .
The 767 the first plane to hit WTC , the North Tower , has an odd shape under its fuselage at the level of the wings .
A video taken moments before impact ( available on the net ) shows an odd asymmetrical construction under the plans fuselage .
Such tanks can be seen on many army aircraft , but have never been seen on a Boeing 767 , the 767 has no fittings .
A missile can be fixed to these pods , or hard points seen under the Boeing 767 .
There is no doubt the picture taken of the under belly shows a tank / pod was fitted under the 767 .
In any event every aspect of this matter should be thoroughly investigated ; also a thorough analysis of the extra tank / pod is in order .
A fire ball can be seen just before impact on video , the indication is that a missile was fired from the pod .
On impact the second plane seems to be on fire already which is highly abnormal , improbable and most suspicious .
When the second remotely controlled plane crashes into the WTC we can observe two abnormal things .
One , planes do n’t explode this way , unless some detonation method is used .
It seems that additional explosives were used to collapse the WTC buildings .
Two , the fire burned out side of the building and there was n’t enough fuel to melt steal beams to collapse the building .
The indication is that there were actually explosives in the building .
It was too precise , too neat and nice how both buildings came down in a short time between plane crashes causing the collapse of both the North and South Towers .
Seismic data reports indicate huge bursts of energy shook the ground before the towers collapsed .
This raises the legitimate suspicion that a controlled explosion occurred , proof that massive underground explosions took place .
Incremental Orchestration , the 9 - 11 politically motivated destructive event , Bush sitting in a Florida school room , Cheney not available for close to 30 minutes , Andrews Air Base first defense not defending , all this plus underground explosives taking place ads up to Bush PNAC Corporation collusion and deceit , underhanded secret cooperation of the New World Order organization .
It ’s nothing new , but it needs to be recognized and investigated .
PentagonThe Pentagon lawn was impeccable ; fit for the passing 4th of July parade , untouched after the 727 supposedly hit , no burning air craft , the imaginary plane crashed in to the Pentagon , the moment where the plane , as some people want us to believe , impacted the Pentagon there was no plane was in sight .
Those who try to make us believe the plane hit at a 45o angle would have to agree that that ’s impossible , seeing that the roof and the façade of the building remain intact .
According to 727 proportions and the landing gear belonging to a 757 , an other plane entirely , it is impossible , the CIA briefing was bogus , the terror attack a manifestation / manipulation , the boggy man did it .
Trick photography the government has more tricks than a 42 street hooker .
Lies vilification , imaginary terrorists , and the public got jerked off once more .
Bush receives directive from the Bilderberger Corporation , then in turn he gives other people and nations directives to do his killing for him .
Turks , murder the Kurdish population in Iraq , to whos directive .
Sarkozy doing some of the PNAC bidding , Blackwater killers murder indiscriminately in Iraq , Afghanistan , Africa , Balkans in other words where they want to posses .
The PNAC views the world population reduction from the stand point of cost effectiveness , it is merely a different take on numerical data .
A huge world wide Plague , or maybe even multiple plagues is planned , effectively useful in laboratories as we speak , where at least half the world population is wiped out .
AIDS , Bird flu , BSE , are government lab manufactured virus and are trial forerunners .
When youre dead you cant be rich or free .
ConsumerismImbalance of consumption is harsh .
Globally , the 20 % of the world ’s people in the highest - income countries account for 86 % of total private consumption expenditures — the poorest 20 % a extremely small 1.3 % .
More specifically , the richestConsume 45 % of all meat and fish , the poorest fifth 5 % Consume 58 % of total energy , the poorest fifth less than 4 % Have 74 % of all telephone lines , the poorest fifth 1.5 % Consume 84 % of all paper , the poorest fifth 1.1 % Own 87 % of the world ’s vehicle fleet , the poorest fifth less than 1 % Global PrioritiesCosmetics in the United States 8 billionIce cream in Europe 11 billionPerfumes in Europe and the United States 12 billion

The war on terror these days focuses on the wrong terrorists .
Bhutto in Pakistan again , convicted and wanted in Switzerland for money laundering and in Pakistan for fraud in the millions , just the kind of cancer the PNAC normally invite to their employone gets the feeling some thing is brewing again , like when the Bush administration promoted to the point of embarrassment the non existing WMD in Iraq followed by invasion land grab and mass murder in Iraq .
As of late , the time span when UK military quasi left and the US military in Afghanistan activity increased is obvious , Afghanistan borders Iran and of course so does Pakistan .
Listening to Bhutto one might think she is popular , when in reality she is a convicted felon and a wanted criminal .
But she fits the profile .
Her last two innings were a failure , they did n’t work .
Here is a cheep money saving scheme for you , the CNN net work asks for I – reports they save money all around
It is so absurd its laughable .
Bush owned TV Corporation has the public work and pay for video their corporation .
There is a big problem with CNN news every thing we hear every day is manipulated by Bush administration Corporation .
Spreading more negativity against the Bush administration and his superiors is actually counterproductive it would just create more of the same and honestly , we have enough of that already .
Just the facts will do nicely .
Air bus just sold 28 of their machines to two Arab countries expecting a lot of business ?
The elaborate endless tourist ads made by the Corporation even for penniless countries can be seen daily on the tube .
As long as the PNAC embrace criminal elements as they do , they them selves are in grave danger .
Credibility is very important government , credibility faltered with the Hitler template .
Deception is one thing , being cozy with criminals another entirely .
Sure they can always hang the criminals , poison them and claim suicide etc but for now it has become too obvious and too much .
Fair trade agreement , “ we trash your country and steal every thing worth taking and you agree with us ” , new envoy to the Middle East Blair is doing that right now in Gaza .
It will be extremely interesting which lies and deception Blair comes on with .
By now the Palestinians heard it all specially from the Brits .
Protests in Venezuela , Pakistan , Brazil , France , Italy , Germany USA , UK , military and police control at a higher level and visible more and more around the world , just think of recent brutality in Myanmar .
PNAC militias successfully destabilize the African Continent .
Economic development is not allowed murder and starvation is their favorite .
Compassionate humans are combing the shore line of the Black Sea , where government greed has once again dumped oil on and in the sea , the earth and precious , living creatures , compassionates free the many oil covered birds from there hideous oil prison as they humanly can many are lost and die .. Sarkozy is already stealing money for the PNAC from the people of France with the transportation strike .
It does n’t resonate with first Sakozy promises , but it does n’t have to , they never keep their promises .
The president of the United States under great plethora of praise for Al Gonzales former “ I cant remember anything ” Attorney General the man who could n’t recall , who had sudden unset Alzheimers , Bush welcomes Michael Mukasey as new Attorney GeneralHe is to Protect Americans from harm and keep them safe from new terror attacks ?
Or add some new terror attacks , were not sure yet .
As if the American people had a choice .
Mukasey was confirmed and took the oath of office , done deal period , end of storyOn the other side of the pond , Britains Gordon Brown introduces sweeping rules to combat terrorism .
These pretense maneuvers give government heightened citizen control .
Government fears increased protests and civil unrest , which clearly prompts the government to aggressively stronger , very severe control over the population , detain those critical of the government and punish any one who is against New World Order methods .
Airports , hospitals , railway stations , sporting events , churches , law schools , Universities , general buildings , malls the internet places where people gather are on Browns list , high tech surveillance is in place , but Brown wants to take it further .his Increased bigoted , racist maneuvers stir witch hunt sentiment and pick up where the Nazi PNAC left off .
Mukasey the new US Attorney General joined the PNAC Corporation and will doubtlessly follow Browns example .
Of course this will be done under the pretence of terrorism , security and the good for the people slogan .
this is the issue the administration brings to public attention ; in reality this is n’t the issue .
The issue for the PNAC is , and that is the only issue that counts , how to continue in incremental steps to reach their global goal and screw the public .
At the same time building walls in Israel on Palestinian lands is not security for the people , it is the PNAC stealing from the Palestinians ruining their lives and stealing land .
Want to build a wall , do it on your own land .
Immigrants in the US may not obtain drivers licenses .
Federal government calls for more fences between Mexico and the US .
No where in the world are we seeing loosening of nooses , on the contrary , The PNAC noose tightens , Bush and Brown with the help of Sarkizy , Merkel and the likes bring back the Hitler image , in the image of the New World Order .
We are experiencing and reliving the Hitler Passed , with major PNAC adjustments in the present , better nuclear and biological technology , the world is in a strangle hold .
Browns 500 million £ or $ , payment the lord offer for Palestine .
What exactly does Brown want in return , as is likely he wants the remaining Palestinians to walk in to the sea , keep walking and disappear .
All kidding aside , how could it be good .
From history we must understand , the British have never been good to , or for Palestine , a conotational change is not likely .
People of the near East have been mistreated and threatened by Britain since the time of Lawrence of Arabia , that poor soul was most likely murdered by the British government for being an Arab sympathizer .
Arafat got a Mausoleum , he was murdered 3 years ago , poisoned as a matter of fact and then displayed for public ridicule .
Middle East leaders murdered , Sadat , Shah , Arafat , Hariri , Hussein , Sharon , plus Castro Cuba , Milosivic the Balkans these men were liquidated .
Musharaf is on the immediate list , Charles Taylor in dubious illegal custody because Bush wanted it that way , Mugabe a thorn in the PNAC eye , Arestide Haiti forced out of office just to mention a few on the long pretender list .
The Incremental PNAC method works very well , and in that way the public forget and stay on the dark merry go round .
Hey , Afghanistan we give you a special meal in exchange for your country .
How ’s that ?
Oh , and we promise to murder your tribal leaders and citizens including babies .
Are n’t we glorious , democratic and free and wonderful ?
Surprise , Chalabi is back , 63 - year - old Chalabi , Prime Minister Nouri Maliki under pressure appointed Chalabi last month to the “ Overseer ” position overseeing the restoration of vital services to Baghdad residents such as electricity , potable water , healthcare and education .
Its got to be a joke , if not , it should be A perfect setting for a thief , Chalabi as Bhutto both so called exiles , both convicted and wanted for fraud .
How ever the US says Chalabi is crucial to cement security gains of recent months say the Bush people - and that failure could cause the country to backslide into chaos .
Backslide in to chaos , when did Iraq get out of chaos , they must mean create greater chaos or they simply mean stealing additional resources ; or poison the water supply to kill more people , hard to imagine there is any thing left in IraqBackslide in to chaos , Chaos , when did the chaos ever go away ?
We should ask What ’s in it for the PNAC to put Chalabi back to work for them .
Could it have any thing to do with the Iran invasion , has it to do with stealing , in that Chalabi is top specialist .
His assassin cousin Allawi , specialist in cold blooded murder , could be running around in a balaclava no one has seen his face for a while , who would know Things are done in secret , Rove is Bushs mouth piece , what is he doing other than putting words in the mouth of the insane misguided dysfunctional .
Interesting how they disappear for a while and then reappear .
Specifically there is no International Community it ’s just a thing the Bush administration uses invented by the humorous dancing Karl Rove .
What man is a man who does n’t make the world better ?
A better world then has ever been seen .
Take the peoples property enslave the world is not exactly what is meant by that .
A PNAC TV ad suggests banking in Africa .
Ill get on it right away .
A
Swiss bank supposedly took losses because of the US mortgage investment debacle ; shuffling money is what they ’re doing .
Banks do n’t take losses ; the public takes the losses .
people are loosing their houses because of the way banks and government set interest at high rates and over reached the peoples capacity to pay of mortgages etc .
Yes ListYes our wardens are morally wrong ; they use violence for political purposes .
We are political victims .
Yes the US controls the internet .
( Bill Gates ) .
Yes Iran is on the list , in spite of , no , no we are not invading Iran rhetoric .
Yes the public is fed up .
Yes the government knows it .
Yes they are afraid of the masses .
Yes the departments of intelligence use illegal methods to control the Masses .
Yes there are meditation ( concentration ) camps across the USYes we are living in an age of miracles .
Five years ago 9 - 11 started the global “ war on terror , ” and spying has since become one of the fastest - growing private industries in the United States .
The federal government relies on outsourcing for some of its most sensitive work , ( murder and torture ) though it has kept details about its use of private contractors a carefully guarded secret .
The US intelligence business is booming
At the May 14 2007 conference in Colorado sponsored by the Defense Intelligence Agency , the U.S. government exposed the intelligence budget and what they spend on private contractors70 % of the budget this year alone goes to private contractors .
That would be a budget of at least $ 48 billion , and that confirms at least $ 34 billion for contractors .
Terri Everett , a senior procurement executive in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , exposed that figure .
Established by Congress in 2004 oversee 16 agencies that make up the US intelligence organization .
A copy of Everett ’s unclassified presentation , titled " Procuring the Future ” dated May 25 , revealed “ We ca n’t spy … If we ca n’t buy ! ” emphasizing the dependence of US intelligence agencies on private sector contractors .
private contractors rose by more than 38 percent from the mid-1990s to 2005 .
The increase how ever has been far more intense :
Over the same period , total intelligence contracts have more than doubled , from $ 18 billion in 1995 to a staggering $ 42 billion in 2005 .
( Higher Now ) Add two years and numbers are even more staggering , you do the math .
Add big ticket items like spy satellites , and the budget climbs even higherUnder the cloak of secrecy who knows how much contractors really get and how they spend it , whom they murder and how , they are the administrations golden boys .
US intelligence budgets are classified , and all discussions about them in Congress are held in secret .
The widely CNN propagandized Bangladesh disaster does not cloak the Iraq and Afghanistan disasters .
Blackwater just one of the authorized PNAC Contractors do what they want in Iraq under protection of the lawless Bush administration .
They murder indiscriminately and capture innocent people , including journalists and teen agers who are deported to Guantanamo and other US gulags for torture and unjustified , horrifying procedures like waterboarding .
The unjust justice department , Negroponte is going to Pakistan whether he is with justice or state is unclear , every thing about what Negroponte does is Cloaked and unclear .
The Mary Poppins government keeps pretending and cloaking , the public is fed up and sick of government propaganda , false head lines and their BS pretences .
Negropontes voyage delivers new threats to the likely to become extinct Musharaf .
PNAC meddling does n’t end in Iraq , Afghanistan or Pakistan .
Contractors operate extensively in as much secret as possible the problem is world wide .
The American public pays a high price for Contractors and government corruption .
US citizens must realize by now they are not allowed to have their own opinion under the Bush PNAC regime .
Arrests , air port murder , taser deaths , telephone and bank spying , job encroachment , retirement fund theft , enforced mandatory drug programs for kids administered in schools , internet , places to congregate , not being able to take their own money out of country where and when they want to , internment camps , the list is long and extremely obvious and dangerous , the intent evil .
How much corruption does a government have to perpetrate on its citizens before its people recoil .
Separate individual administrations no longer exist , in fact this is continues single PNAC administration , the loyalists hand down from administration to administration .
Karl Rowe , Blair and Rumsfeld for example work in the wings until further instruction from above and so on and so forth etc and they have been in multiple administrations .
If you are one of the misguided who still think they care about humanity , think again ?
Honestly ,
One cant help but admire the magnitude , manipulation , deception , phenomenal weapons and technology and the careful , incremental planningthey did n’t get handed to them .
They sleazed , lied , deceived , manipulated , killed and thieved for power they stole over the decadesSuch enormous proportions , and now for the big money , the world has never seen such spectacular power - ownership before .
Yes we are in shock and awe , Bush is right , the PNAC Bilderbergers are right , shock and awe are the words .. Power and money , world domination and destruction of America , the ultimate goal is obvious .
Then there are the details ; they have to iron out the wrinkles .
Depopulation , mind control , Bio technology , spies , drug control , DNA manipulation , smaller more effective nuclear weapons , liquidating all leaders of all other countries costly details , but it has to be done .
Hire protestors , assassins , militia , supply , uniforms , posters TV propaganda , weapons , explosives , expensive items Contractors they are paid billions .
( Did Hitler know he was their Template , grand father Prescott Bush knew , at the end when they completely abandoned him , Hitler must have known he had been betrayed ) .
Why is Uzbekistan importantLocation and Resources .
Uzbekistan South to Iran , central Asia , North of Afghanistan , Afghanistan recent US interest troop increase .
0 km ( doubly landlocked ) ; note - Uzbekistan includes the southern portion of the Aral Sea with a 420 km shoreline Resources natural gas , petroleum , coal , gold , uranium , silver , copper , lead and zinc , tungsten , molybdenum
Their resources of oil and natural gas are powerful and dwarf those of the Mexican Gulf and Kuwait .
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and President Clinton laugh at Yeltsin 's joke , while the PNAC quietly make a deal with Yeltsin , Yeltsin easily persuaded , mostly in the bag , broke up the Soviet Union and handed Uzbekistan to the PNAC .
Yeltsin was paid handsomely for his contribution and retired to Riviera with his family .
One giant step for the Bilderbergers , a significant backstep for man kind .
More than a year ago US forces built and were deployed at Uzbekistan ’s Khanabad air base as part of the false deceiving campaign against terrorism and occupation of the region .
The quality of life declined for the inhabitants , farmers were disenfranchised .
US troops have caused economic dislocation – especially for the area farmers .
Uzbekistan formally part of the Soviet Union until Yeltsin made the Clinton / PNAC deal .
PNAC World Dictatorship progresses , calling Putin a czar is once again PNAC “ it ’s them , not us ” propaganda .
Pakistan through nuclear India to ChinaWhy is Pakistan a country of vital importance to the US as Negroponte said recently in his first of two TV announcements ?
And Negroponte is back again in Islamabad .. Genocide of North American natives was 10.000.000 .
Ten million , imagine the great white father came from Britain to murder nations of native people on the North American continent , under false horrific pretence .
In 1776 they came to the North American Continent , started with hate , guns , cannons and Adam Weishaupt , steal Mexican land and murder the native people .
The US is the First Nation ever , to mass murder using nuclear weapons .
The United States is a war nation , never has been a peaceful nation .
America was built on aggression , brutality and deceit ; it never has been a peaceful or a free nation .
In antiquity 2000 years passed , Greece was the warring Nation .
In contrast , Persia , now Iran found it is far more intelligent to settle with wisdom and diplomacy , imagine 2000 years ago .
They with - drew from the Greek conflict and went home to Persia .
The US resembles the Greek mentality and Persia is the way it was 2000 years ago , rather using diplomacy and reasoning .
Interesting how a mentality does n’t change that much and how some people believe they can settle every thing with arrogance , threats and force .
Afghanistan is used as threat for other countries in the region , “ ifyou do n’t do as we say this is what will happen to you ” .
Do or Die. Blair
No longer Middle East envoy , but “ international Middle East envoy ” , plans a Palestinian job project , he ’s full of dishonest practice , a Brit improve the life for Palestinians is a direct contradiction .
Anthony Blair , Britains , evil dwarf , void of even a smattering of honor .
The US and UK warring nations , traditional blood brothers in crime , two nations which have been responsible for mass murder , destruction and arrogant racist behavior , for as long as history can remember .
Feigning , “ FEEDOM AND PEACE ” louder than any other nation on earth , not taking responsibility for any of their atrocities .
We have seen everything yesterday .
“ International envoy to the Middle East ” sounds like not just PNAC decided the issue , but they did invent , the word “ international ” so the public thinks the world is involved in decision making , wrong , in reality only 5 % of the population make decisions for all of us and that of course is the Bilderberg Corporation .
International community sounds better than “ we the “ Novus Ordo Seclorum ” who , if the truth were told , screw with the world and are the only dictatorial “ decision makers ” period , end of story ; no body else has the right to make decisions or even safely voice their opinion .
The PNAC has used tiny little Sarkozy to steal from the French Nation .
Pensions of course already , pensions are an easy mark , they ’ve been stealing them for years , in America too .
The Pakistan election is vital for the US , says Negroponte .
Let us for a moment focus on what ’s important , How about the importance of self .
How about , other Countries should be well and the “ Novus Ordo Seclorum ” should mind their own extremely bad , smelly business .
Take the knife away from surgeons , they are dangerous people .
British government incompetence lost personal info of 25.000.000 citizens on two disks – gone .
Brown - PNAC corporation manipulation gains additional control over the civilian population - Name , birth date , bank account number , credit card number , addresses etc . the information got into the wrong hands , unbelievable , That would be a banana republic .
Clearly , government can not be trusted with personal info , or any thing .
Now another corporation offered to safe keep the info , are there actually once burned , twice stupid people hello .
Americans take to the road , Thanksgiving is upon us .
Not astounding , gasoline prices go up , because they can , cars are sitting in traffic for hours , let the government drink their gas .
Lets stay home make a phone call on which the government can legally spy , how ’s that New best Bush friend Sarkozy first act in office , he steals peoples pension in France the people strike , French civil Service joins the strike .
There was a case , not to long ago in the United States , where Enron employees were stripped of their pensions they worked many years for nothing or in reality the Bush government stole their pension fund and it ended abruptly when Ken Lay was murdered just before he wanted to tell all .
Bush PNAC stole millions plus peoples lives and the Lay family were dsetroyed .
Bush who was chauffeured in the Enron jet with Ken Lay , amazingly could n’t remember any of it , he actually denied every thing .
There is not much he can’t do , even steal , murder , lie and deny .
It ’s the nature of government to do bad things .
“ Novus Ordo Seclorum ” has become to powerful , bad things they do have greater destructive capacity than needed .
They set them selves in an almighty posture , with out having the slightest degree of similarity to divinity .
They are indeed just of poor moral quality .
Iran will so far not bow to the arrogant Bush PNAC language .
Iran has an atmosphere of diplomacy .
Iran has compliance with IAEA , which some countries do not have ; it is well known the PNAC stockpile nuclear weapons , Tehran vowed it wo n’t make nuclear concessions .
2000 years ago Persia had the reputation for intelligent diplomacy rather than senseless aggression and it still holds today .
In contrast the US and UK prefer arrogant forceful language .
Ironically the US and UK call others barbaric , realistically it ’s their trade mark , barbarism is their obvious intent .
Iran preferred a civilized agenda .
2000 years ago Persia Vis a Vis Greece it also took the road of diplomacy then , instead of senseless murder and destruction .
What they do in their own country should be their business .
The commonwealth of Pakistan / Musharaf in violation of not listening to the Bush - PNAC administration - Actually Musharaf has n’t been listening to them , why should he , they are not his guardians .
The Bush missile installation pretentiously called “ Defense Shield ” .
Moscow - President Vladimir Putin warned NATO against " muscle - flexing " on Russia 's border Tuesday and ordered top generals to raise the combat readiness of the country 's nuclear missiles .
"
In violation of previous agreements , certain member countries of the NATO alliance are increasing their resources next to our borders , " Putin told a meeting of defense chiefs in Moscow .
Maryland US children are given forced not beneficial for their health vaccine , this is the State ordered measure , not yet federal , parents can be sent to jail for noncompliance .
The whole circumstance .
Parents have no idea what ’s in the so called flu vaccine , parents have no information how the cocktail effect childrens health .
All that ’s really known is that the powerful government corporation is in bed with pharmaceutical companies and they ’re both money hungry and not talking ; they are only giving orders .
How ever there is information that the vaccine damaged kids who were becoming learning disabled .
The PNAC wants a stupid public that we know , start mindlessness young better than later .
The Corporation does n’t want intelligent , critical thinkers .
At least 80 % of the population is drowning in confusion brought on by the government and they ca n’t get out .
Saudi Arabia , the Kingdom in reality does n’t like the United States government , the last King who did , tip toed through the flowers hand in hand with Bush at the ranch , went bye , bye .
Israel plans to gradually reduce electricity in Gaza .
Is there one person who believes Mr. Brown ?
There has n’t been a Israel government since the PNAC got rid of Sharon .
the British spread more misery on the Palestinians .
Split the Middle East territory with US PNAC cousin Bush .
Blair is still spreading misery and lies in the Middle East .
Blasts in northern India , blasts in Iraq , turmoil in Pakistan , US troops kicking in doors , Jaap de Hoop Scheffer NATO preponderance , Karzai clinging to PNAC rules , Sarkozi the new PNAC liar , the Bush government want the people to believe Chalabi is coming in to eliminate chaos and equalize Iraq .
The Taliban an often used name for excuse and cover up their own atrocities the PNAC Keep lies going , the 80 % have no clue .
Musharaf could be declared Saint by the Pope , have a halo around his head and the PNAC still would n’t want him in charge of his country ; They have their replacement , might it be Imran Khan , Bhutto or Sharif , or some body else entirely ..
Even if the baby has no head they still want their baby to be born .
Australian PNAC selection Howard or Rudd , Rudd got it .
Lebanon is with out government like Israel since the murder of Sharon .
Pakistani bomb blast kills 15 , guess who ?
The department of misinformation nearly as diligent as the big mouth liar Department , got to admit they are hard working folks .
Cuba launched 5 day war games , combat training , where would they get tanks , helicopters , bullets , grenades .
And Bush wants to bring Cuba freedom .
Wonder if they killed Castro in Argentina or Cuba or some where in between on route or in the French military hospital .
The news does n’t fit .
Sharon disappeared in the same way , an operation , neither needed an operation but , they got one any way , one on the Brain and heart , intestinal ; sure the 80 % buy that cock and bull story .
The PNAC exchanged John Howard and Rudd in Australia and put Rudd in office at least they did n’t perform surgery on Howard .
The PNAC have a new guy actually two new guys , Rudd and Sarkozi .
Howard says Australia is the greatest country , Bush said America is the greatest country , two greatest countries congratulations ; .
In the end it will be one greatest country under the greatest PNAC dictatorship .
Since they did n’t kill him , this will not be the end of John Howard ’s carrier .
John joins the ranks of Rove , Rumsfeld , with Corporation blessings .
Lucky for him , he did n’t join ranks with Arafat , Sharon and Castro with PNAC blessings .
Rudd promises Middle East , Australian troop withdrawal , want to bet on that one ?
The 80 % have an imprint that the next one will be better , but it ai n’t necessarily so .
this social attachment has been going on for centuries .
The next PNAC one is usually worse , much worse .
Kampala Uganda bloodshed incurred by brutal military police , who hired them and paid for the uniforms , people have no food but there is a brand new control group in place , beating and intimidating as is seen world wide .
The one in Myanmar was not long ago .
Pakistan and Afghanistan are under attack from PNAC Contractors as well .
Of course there are others , of course the problem is going on world wide and of course it ’s no coincidence .
PNAC Gun incremental .
DC
Washington gun issue should n’t be an issue but is under PNAC scrutiny , the Bush government is afraid of the upcoming revolution .
Eradication of constitutional 2nd amendment , they are chipping away at the right to bare arms .
Washington DC and San Francisco are two places in the country where you do not have the right to bare arms .
That ’s the PNAC plan and they will expand it .
The PNAC owned Supreme Courts decide it ’s not an individuals right to bare arms , but the State has the right to maintain a militia .
All other states will follow suit and the individuals right to bare arms disappears .
There will not be a house to house search the government will do it quickly but carefully not to spark the revolt .
People found to have guns are likely to be shot or put in already existing internment camps .
They got the names and addresses of people who have guns already in their position .
They got the information From mandatory gun registration in the last ten years , they got the names .
When people objected to that , the government said , oh no it ’s just a little thing .
Here now we have the next little thing .
Governments do bad things by nature , trusting their motive is always a big mistake .
Declare an all State of emergency and demand a gun turn in .
Just to simplify things they ’ll shoot you .
When you are dead you are not free or rich .
Americas history has values that are self congratulating , ideals of freedom and rules of law , ” Land of the Free , Home of the Brave ” memorialized in song .
Thing of it , the American notion to be free and rule of law is a self definition of Glory .
This is no nonsensical silly notion indeed .
They can glorify them selves from now and fore ever .
The Middle East war of wars is succeeding and failing at the same time .
“ We have to be feared ” , operations have become more brutalAlthough America has n’t won , all others have lost .
What then is the moral issue ; the PNAC has overreached its power and whole cultures are mass murdered .
A plague is yet to come Viruses mutate and a plague in the Middle East or even world wide can not be ruled out .
Here is where Chalabi comes in to the picture .
More likely than not , there exists a distinct possibility the PNAC Bush Corporation put Chalabi in charge of Utilities in Iraq , which includes water .
Water is the resource easily tampered with , carry deadly virus , infect and kill .
Eventually this modality will also be used else where not only in the Middle East .
It ’s already used in testing ground Africa , Africans drink infected water daily and die from it .
The possibility also exists that New Orleans was a testing ground for the gun law and for water .
At the orders of New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin , the New Orleans Police , the National Guard , the Oklahoma National Guard , and U.S. Marshals have begun breaking into homes at gunpoint , confiscating lawfully - owned firearms , and evicting the residents .
" No one is allowed to be armed .
We 're going to take all the guns , " says P. Edwin Compass III , the superintendent of police .
ABC News video on September 8 showed National Guard troops going house - to - house , smashing down doors , searching for residents , and confiscating guns .
Many of the troops were clearly conflicted by their orders .
" It is surreal , " said one member of the Oklahoma National Guard who was going door - to - door in New Orleans .
" You never expect to do this in your own country . "
But here it is .
The City of New Orleans denied these facts for months until SAF sued them .
That is the reality , of the PNAC Corporation .
Could New Orleans really have been a natural disaster ?
Now Malibu is on fire , take the matches away from the Governor .
Oh say can you hear the audible murmur surrounding the blue planet , the PNAC overreached its power , people are fed up , the Corporation is getting really nervous .
A Conference in Annapolis should give Bush enough security .
Blair the international envoy is there too .
Anti Israel slogans , one wonders why ?
Israel treats the Palestinians so well , destroyed almost all of their lives and them .
An American President extols peace in the Middle East at a secure American fortress , peace has not been promoted before , why should this conference be any different , the self glorifying America , has brought an everlasting war to the world .
The first mistake that was made , Hamas and Hezbollah elected factions in Lebanon and Palestine were not invited .
Iran although strictly speaking not an Arab State , but clearly in the Middle East , was not invited and so the conference is not complete or legitimate .
When a man wants to promote peace , the man has to understand justice and equality .
The “ WE and THEM ” issue heard here again , encourages hypocritical anti peace sentiment and division world wide .
To understand what the US / Israel PNAC is all about , one must grasp the meaning of an immensely complicated , multi front war , why should the corporation give up control and profitable operations .
The corporation , imperialist ambition is in itself corrupt .
Bush versed in booze , not in political science is now more extortionate ; he cultivates war , where peace is a silly notion in his pigmy brain .
With Iran , they would conquer the biggest and most influential country in the Middle East and it might well be the turning point for the US PNAC .
Iran , a Nation vastly bigger than Iraq and Afghanistan thrown together , the PNAC could fail through overambition .
The pay off if it works would be spectacular - Bush still in office for one year , is not less arrogant and bullying , but when he is in his most quiet , nicest voice he is most dangerous and watch for contradictions .
PNAC threats and promises have forced Musharaf to resign his 43 year career as army chief .
The Bush administration seized his power with out right .
The Bush PNAC dangerously forced their will , meddling in Pakistanis inner politics .
Power taken from Pakistan Musharaf , is basically now in the hands of the overreaching , already powerful PNAC .
Horrific conditions in Afghanistan the contractors are very busy there Pakistan since Musharaf is a civilian and powerless vis a vis the military , the PNAC has stolen the power there too .
PNAC Contractors intend to invade Iran from multiple fronts Pakistan and Afghanistan .
From Pakistan would be from southern Pakistan in to south east Iran , from Afghanistan in to north east Iran .
Then air attacks and the 3 German built nuclear super submarines attack from southern waters , India is in the PNAC pocket , Uzbekistan directly north is technically theirs , an enormous US air base in Uzbekistan , Iran is surrounded by the aggressors , we have again Multi front aggression .
They ’re hitting Musharaf with all cannons , his future is in corrupt , bloody hands , they want him totally out .
Bush finger ready to pointBush should n’t worry about his legacy , besides his mother ; who gives a damn about his legacy , she thought citizens of New Orleans did well for them selves with Katrina .
Actually the citizens waited 5 days for water before it got to the Super Dome , Negropontes recent voyage to Islamabad ended Musharafs 43 year military career it ’s that simple .
That ’s what Negroponte was doing in Islamabad , threatened Musharaf .
What ever the deal is , it ’s highly suspicious .
Extraordinarily bleak Bush struts around Camp David , flanked by Olmert and Abbas no apparent abandonment signs of arrogance and selfglorification .
PNAC usable space for peace in their agenda zero .
Olmert and Abbas agree with Bush what else would they do ?
People who own homes are on the edge , homes are being fore closed mortgages are folding , the US government arranged the Nations nightmares .
Mortgage fore closures Americans loose twice , the Bush government owns their homes and there is nothing they can do about it .
America goes where the PNAC is pointing it , down the toilette .
US athletes are being hunted by the PNAC government for allegedly taking performance enhancing drugs , US contractors in the Middle East take these drugs daily and become the hunters and government heroes .
Monday 26 November 2007
New York -
Service members seriously wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan after they received a $ 10,000 bonus for enlisting are being asked by the Pentagon to repay portions of the incentive money , says a U.S. senator who calls the practice an example of military policy gone wrong .
According to a wide range of reports , several nuclear bombs were “ lost ” for 36 hours after taking off August 29/30 , 2007 on a “ cross- country journey ” across the U.S. , from U.S.A. F
Base Minot in North Dakota to U.S.A.F. Base Barksdale in Louisiana .
Reportedly , in total there were six W80 - 1 nuclear warheads armed on AGM - 129 Advanced Cruise Missiles ( ACMs ) that were “ lost . ”
The story was first reported by the Military Times , after military servicemen leaked the story .
A significant number of people with knowledge of the intended secret coup Bush missile attack were murdered they died under extremely sumptuous circumstances .
Those missiles were n’t lost , after it blew up in his face Bush replaced the people , paperwork , computer tracking system , This was Planned from the top down , Bush was going to use them on Iran , it was “ THEM not US ” and the pilots never would have made it back , they would have killed them too .
We have no idea what the administration is capable of and how morally corrupt they really are .
We could all be melted now if honest decent people had n’t died for what they thought right .
The PNAC was ready for meltdown , what sane person aspires to this ?
Next time the melt down comes by sea , the Persian Gulf Sea , from the brand new stealth ready to act , nuclear German built submarines .
Or perhaps next time people are n’t willing to die for decency and their fellow human beings and the amoral administration wins .
Next time and there will be a next time , the Bush administration might still be in office or not , a new worse administration is planned , we can count on that , unless balance is restored and void and baffled are Bush , Blair , Brown , Bilderbergers , “ Novus Ordo Seclorum . ”
May the villains be banished .
We wish for governments which do n’t take the cowards way out and hide behind cause and effect , merry Holidays .
See you next timePietin

" NY Election Boards Vote YES for Paper Ballots , NO to Touch - Screen Voting ! "

AVANTE just like to correct some simple mistakes that keep on making by Mr. Bo Lipari .
1. AVANTE submitted to NY State with two patented solutions of “ Ballot Marking Device ” BMD not DRE as keep repeating by Mr. Lipari .
2 . The first system is a 15 - inch touch - screen with full accessibility binary switches and / or voice assistance .
It prints and marks paper ballots as large as 11” x17 ” in duplex full - face format as required by New York Election Codes for paper ballots .
This predecessor model that print and mark ballots in 8.5” x11 ” BMD have been used with great success for 31 counties in NY for the HAVA compliance in the last two years .
Mr. Lipari is well aware of and have examined both models .
3 . The second system is a 42 - inch touch - screen with full accessibility binary switches and / or voice assistance .
It also prints and marks paper ballots as large as 11” x17 ” in duplex full - face format as required by New York Election Codes for paper ballots .
In addition , it also allows sighted voters with other disability to make selections in full - face presentation as New York Election Codes asked for rather than being treated like a blind voter in using voice - assisted voting or other difficult navigation technique .
4. AVANTE also presented its patented “ ballot picture capturing ” optical scan system that is based on the first system ever to truly meet the EAC 2002 VVS accuracy standard of less than 1 error in 1,500,000 marks in reading paper ballots .
5. Both BMD systems provide two different means of independent verifications :
a .
The first method is to read back to the blind voters immediately as to their selections in each contest upon casting their ballot and while the ballot is marked and printed .
This method has been deemed adequate by DOJ for HAVA compliance .
HAVA has the same language of independent verification as stated in New York State Election Codes .
b. AVANTE BMD solutions are the only systems providing an option to print a 2 - D PDF 417 of all of the voted data on a separate sheet to allow “ system ” or “ software independent ” verification in greater privacy ( blind voter only need to ask the election official to place the machine - readable only 2 - D barcode into scanner system ) .
That is , any third party scanner and software can perform the read back verification to the blind voters including write -ins .
c. Unlike all of the other systems preferred by Mr. Lipari that require the blind voters to ask others to submit their paper ballot ( high potential to lose privacy ) into the SAME system to read back using the “ electronic template ” as to where the marks have been made .
Besides being not “ system ” or “ software ” independent in terms of verifications , they are also unable to read back the “ write - in ” votes made by the voters .

Perfect time to get off to a wonderful start by doing professional chain of custody with the paper ballots .
Not much pain , lots of gain !

Dredd , setting up a legitimate chain of custody would make it harder to stuff the unaccounted for extra ballots into the boxes when they are needed .
Are you trying to prevent the manipulation of the vote count or something ?
Besides , chain of custody does n't mean anything if you 've been forced from the polls by a 5 - 10 hour wait or not allowed to vote on a " real " ballot because you were scrubbed by a Rethuglican Data company .

Hillary seems to raise possibility of nuking terrorist ' safe havens ' Nick Juliano
Published : Saturday January 5 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Clinton promises ' heavy retaliation ' for terrorist - harboring nations New York Sen. Hillary Clinton , finding herself in an unexpectedly close race with freshman Sen.
Barack Obama , flexed her national security muscles in Saturday night 's Democratic debate , raising the possibility of loosing nuclear weapons on countries that harbor terrorists who plot a nuclear attack on the US .
Clinton , answering a hypothetical question about the possibility of a nuclear weapon being detonated in the US , said she would immediately target terrorist " safe havens . "
The former First Lady warned " every state in the world must know we will retaliate , " and she invoked deterrence aimed at the Soviet Union during the Cold War -- predicated on mutually assured destruction resulting from a US nuclear counter - strike -- as a successful strategy for averting a nuclear catastrophe .
ABC News anchor Charles Gibson , who was moderating Saturday night 's Facebook - cosponsored debate , asked the candidates to imagine questions they would face the day after a nuclear weapon was detonated in a major US citiy .
What will we wish we had done , and what will you as president do ?
Gibson asked the candidates .
Although she did not deliberately say she would launch nuclear weapons at countries where terrorists were believed to have found safe haven , her answer left it as a clear probability .
" If we can demonstrate that the people responsible for planning the nuclear attack on our country may not themselves be in a government or associated with a state , but have a haven within one , then every state in the world must know we will retaliate against those states , " Clinton said .
" There can not be safe havens for stateless terrorists who are in these networks that are plotting to have the proliferation of nuclear weapons ... that could cause such havoc .
So I think we have to be very , very clear : Deterrence worked during the Cold War in large measure because the United States made it clear to the Soviet Union that there would be massive retaliation .
We have to make it clear to those states that would give safe have to stateless terrorists that would launch a nuclear attack against America , that they would also face very heavy retaliation . "
Obama said he would retaliate against anyone who struck American soil , although he focused more on the need to decrease the availability of nuclear weapons overall .
He criticized President Bush for abandoning the goals of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and he said the US needed to work with Russia so both countries can begin reducing their nuclear arsenals .
Four out of Five Facebook users said Saturday 's debate was helping them decide who they would support , and two - thirds said they were confident a Democrat could handle national security issues , according to real - time polls on the social networking site .
Later in the debate , Clinton implicitly invoked President Bush in warning about the perils of choosing likability over experience in a presidential race .
The former First Lady , who 's long struggled with image concerns , joked that it " hurts my feelings " that polls show voters find Obama to be far more likable that her .
" He 's very likable , there 's no doubt about that , " Clinton said , but " I do n't think I 'm that bad . "
" You 're likable enough , " Obama cut in .
Then Hillary unleashed her Bush comparison .
" In 2000 we ended up with a president who people wanted to have a beer with , " she said .
" The most important question is who is ready to be President on Day One . " DEVELOPING ...
This video is from ABC Presidential Debate , broadcast January 5 , 2008 .
Since The Worst - Case Scenario Survival Handbook , by Joshua Piven and David Borgenicht is copyrighted 1999 , it must have been written and put through the pre-print process before the 2000 election and therefore the book was ahead of its time as far offering fear mongering to the American public is concerned .
The two authors warn readers : " When a life is imperiled or a dire situation is at hand , safe alternatives may not exist . "
Since the book ’s publication , the Bush Administration has brought fear and paranoia to a fever pitch in the United States , but , for someone who is really good at worrying , it seems possible that Piven , Borgenicht , Bush , Homeland Security , et al may have missed the biggest , baddest , most screwed - up possibility of them all .
Sit back , relax , have a tall refreshing glass of Diet Pepsi Vanilla ( if you can still find one ) and enjoy ( ? ) this hypothetical example of Uberspeculation called : The Decline and Fall of Democracy in the United States . "
While the attention of the mainstream media ( MSM ) is diverted by the 2008 Presidential election , some in the online Casandra Chorus decry the continued use of electronic voting machines which leave no paper trail and are ( Do a Google search for " F2654hD4 " ) vulnerable to tampering .
Anchors on the various TV news programs do n’t want to jeopardize their image as omniscient voices in the night , and so they will accept the dictates of the conservative talk show hosts ( union ? ) and dismiss the alarm as the baseless blatherings of deranged individuals who are envious of the prestige accorded to the successors to the mantel once worn by Edward R.Murrow .
As the November election day approaches , the media becomes hypnotized by polls which indicate that the final results for the November elections will provide liberal pundits with material that calls for comparisons to Custer ’s Last Stand , and / or ( if one subscribes to the " Stop Hillary Express " philosophy ) the time a mob unanimously granted freedom to Barabas .
On the day after the elections , the results that are posted will show that the Republican candidates in strongly Democratic districts have won with majorities that are up in the 90 % of the vote range .
The Presidential election will show a similarly obviously unreliable result .
The " defeated " Democrats , lead by the Presidential nominee , will be presented with the same dilemma that Al Gore once had to face : Contest the results in court or concede to sham results .
Either way , the conservatives will be satisfied .
The public outrage will reach explosive levels ( " the whole world is watching " ) and the Democrats will either concede defeat or reluctantly file a tsunami of law suits contesting the election results .
The Republican " winners " will quickly file counter suits alleging " harassment . "
President Bush succumbs to another " pretzel incident , " which is fatal .
Vice President Cheney will quickly be sworn in ( in December ) and face the dilemma about what to do about the political gridlock that will have gripped the United States in this bit of prognostication .
Some folks will want the sham Republican " winners " sworn in on Inauguration Day of 2009 .
The Democrats will want the results to be invalidated and have the Democratic candidates sworn into office .
The animosity in the nation between the " reds " and the " blues " ( fanned by the rabid rantings of the conservative talk show hosts who follow in the footsteps of Father Coughlin ) will be whipped up to the boiling point .
The emotional level of the rancor will be just about equal to that which exists between the Sunni and Shi’ite Muslim sects and the possibility for a calm and measured response to the crisis will be about equal to the chance that the two Muslim groups will forgive and forget at a peace conference brokered by the Pope .
Cheney " freezes " things because of the confusion and uncertainty and , using " temperary " emergency powers , continues his term in office while the various lawsuits are handled in a safe , sane and consensual ( civilized and proscribed ) way .
Unfortunately , the process will take years of litigation and haggling .
At about that same time , a conversion of TV signals from analogue to digital becomes a SNAFU ( Situation Normal ; All Fouled Up ) of the enoumous proportions that is to be expected during the Bush Era .
Because of that , the TV news coverage of the political bickering is mostly unavailable to the public .
The old " no one could foresee these possibilities " argument , which were so useful when the War in Iraq failed to live up to expectations , are revived in a way that seems rehearsed and coordinated .
Cheney will use troops to restore calm and maintain order .
The temporary emergency will last a long time .
At that point , would n’t it be convenient if the Internets suffered a hack that brings it to a temporary halt and deprived the voters of that source of news and information ?

Ursula K. Le Guin wrote : " He had grown up in a country run by politicians who sent the pilots to man the bombers to kill the babies to make the world safer for children to grow up in . "
Now , the disk jockey will ring in the New Year by playing John Lennon ’s recording of Imagine and we will tell Scotty to beam us up into a new year .
Have a great New Year ’s and we will end this column with Dave Garroway ’s old sign - off : " Peace ! "

While schools teach many useful things , there are some things they regrettably do not .
It is good to know science , history , and mathematics , and English is essential for those of us who live in the United States , but one of the most important things of all for any male to learn is left in the dust .
One of the most important things to learn as a boy is how to be a man .
The first place that you learn what it means to be a man is your father , and you learn more by his example than by his words , though you DO still learn from his words .
That puts children whose father never “ grew up ” mentally and emotionally at a serious disadvantage .
If the person from whom you are learning to be an adult still acts like a child , then that is what you will learn .
That means that if you are a father , you need to be especially careful , because your children , and your sons in particular , are going to be watching you .
They will learn from what you do , learning what is right and what is wrong , what is acceptable and what is not , so it is essential that you make sure that you behave the way you want them to learn to behave .
It is also essential that you spend time with them , to give them the opportunity to learn from you .
So what happens to children who do not have a father from whom to learn ?
They must find someone else to teach them .
Unfortunately , children have no way of knowing who is a good choice and who is a bad choice , so they will mostly simply find whoever is most convenient .
That ’s one reason that mentoring programs are such a great thing … they can provide a good example to learn from .
With all of the above said , what is it that distinguishes a man from a boy ?
What can you look at to say whether someone is a good man ?
Most importantly of all , for the males reading this , what can you look at inside yourself , and what can you learn , in order to be that good man ?
Here is a list of the core attributes of a man :
Honor
This is the core , the all encompassing attribute of what it means to be a man .
It includes all of the other attributes , blended into a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts .
Honor means you tell the truth , even when it hurts .
Honor means you take care of your responsibilities .
Honor means you live up to any committment you make , even when it ’s hard .
Honor means taking care of those weaker than you .
Honor means all of these things and more … and you know it when you see it , whether in a person you meet or in a character in a movie ( think Leonidas in 300 ) .
Maintaining your honor is essential to being a man , but part of maintaining your honor is knowing which of its components is more important when they are in conflict .
Integrity Integrity is all about truth .
That means being truthful everywhere and to everyone , including yourself .
It means do n’t pretend to be something or someone that you are not .
It means accepting the truth of who you are , and if you do n’t like it , accepting the responsibility of changing it , not just acting like it ’s not even there .
A man of integrity is true to himself , true to others , and true to his word .
He does n’t need to swear an oath or make a promise , because his yes means yes and his no means no .
Responsibility Responsibility is another essential component .
A man must take responsibility for his own choices , both to himself and to others .
That means that you cannot blame others for things you do , or the way you are , because they can only influence you to the extent that you choose to allow them .
If you accept responsibility for something , it is up to you to make sure it is done , and to accept the blame if it is not , regardless of why it is not .
If you can not be sure that you can do it , then do not say that you will .
Respect A man gives respect to those around him until they show that they are not worthy of it .
And even then , he gives them the opportunity to earn it back .
All interactions with others should be done inside the framework of respect … even if someone has shown that their behavior is not worthy of respect , you can respect their knowledge and / or expertise in whatever areas they have it .
Also keep in mind that regardless of whether someone is worthy of your respect or not , you should still treat them with respect … just be aware of it in your expectations of them and their behavior .
Faithfulness Responsibility is about following through on what you say you will do .
Faithfulness is about following through on the things that you should be doing whether or not you have said you will .
Faithfulness is about going the extra mile to do the right thing in the right way , even if it means going beyond what you said you would do .
Faithfulness is what comes after responsibility … when you do n’t just do things because you said you would and you feel like you ’re stuck with it now , but instead do them because they are the right thing to do .
Compassion Compassion is one of the primary things that differentiates man from animal , and man from machine .
When you feel that other people are individuals , with their own worth , and their own value , worthy of your help , your work , and your consideration on their own merit , then you have compassion .
Compassion is n’t feeling sorry for people , it ’s feeling that they are worthy of your time and effort , and then giving it to them .
You should n’t just feel compassion for those in worse situations than you , you should feel it for everyone .
Everyone should be worthy of your time and effort when they need help with something .
Strength Strength is another part of being a man that is commonly misunderstood .
Strength is n’t about not admitting your weaknesses ( or mistakes ) , it ’s not about not having or showing emotions , and it ’s not about how much weight you can lift .
Strength is about following through on all of the things above .
Strength is doing what you should be doing , regardless of how hard it is or how you feel about it .
It actually shows far more strength to admit your weaknesses and mistakes , and then do something about them ( I can not emphasize that enough … admitting weaknesses and mistakes may be hard , but the real sign of strength is that you then do something to fix , or compensate for , them ) , than it does to try to hide them or pretend they do n’t exist .
That ’s what it takes to be a man instead of an adult boy .
Every male has it in them to do the things listed above , and every male will fail at each of them at some point .
The difference is that for a man , the failure is the exception , not the rule , and when they fail at one of them , they pick themselves back up and get back to it .
I got a lot of comments saying that playing Crayon Physics on a tablet PC was loads of fun .
I never had a change to test it .
Until now .
I got my hands on a tablet PC and while it was fun to play Crayon Physics on it , it was way more fun to play Crayon Physics DELUXE on it !
Here ’s a little video of me playing Crayon Physics Deluxe on a tablet PC .

T he eXile had planned to provide on - the - ground coverage of last weekend 's protests in a way that no other news outlet could or would .
Part of our plan was to do a kind of Whore - R stories of a few protesters -- Protest - R stories , if you will -- to find out who these democracy heroes really were : what they ate , how they talked , which part of town they lived in , where they shopped , what their favorite sex position was , what idiotic bands they listened to , etc .
What we wanted to know was , what sort of Russian is actually willing to risk his future , and perhaps life and limb , in order to follow not Gandhi , not Vaclav Havel or even the poisoned Viktor Yuschenko of 2004 , but rather ...
Gary Kasparov , an eccentric Jewish chess player from Azerbaijan ?
More to the point : did Kasparov even have any followers outside of the Western press corps ?
Or was it all smoke and mirrors , involving the use of a lot of borrowed National Bolsheviks , paid students , and the usual collection of crusty perestroika protesters ?
Given the degree of Putin 's popularity , and the bad stench associated with so - called " liberal " or " pro-Western " values after Yeltsin 's disastrous rule , it was hard to believe that the protest movement was really a threat .
Or that it was even real .
What last Saturday 's protests in Moscow revealed was that the larger story is far more interesting and complex than we 'd expected .
There was too much adrenaline and urgency , too much of a sense of an intangible shift taking place .
If we 'd reduced it all to the mundane lives of a couple of Saturday 's protesters , it would n't have been funny , and more importantly , it would n't have revealed anything .
What 's happening is potentially too serious .
It is potentially the early seed of something very profound -- and , that is why it is a genuine threat to Putin 's regime .
G8 Protest Control Strategies that WORK Russia can still be a little clumsy and timid when it comes to protest control , but with a little practice , the Kremlin should soon be able to crush tiresome street protest with the best of the world 's leading industrialized democracies .
Here 's a look back at some recent G8 crowd control methods that the Kremlin might consider borrowing .
1 ) Los Angeles Democratic Presidential Convention , 2000 : CALL FAKE BOMB THREAT
What to do when independent media extremists have set up a counter broadcast with a potential web and satellite audience of 14 million ?
Easy -- say a bomb has been planted on the premises and move in for everyone 's safety !
In LA , police " responded " to a bomb threat , then barred access to an independent media satellite truck at the time of the scheduled broadcast .
A member of the L.A. sheriff 's department was even heard bragging that the " [ bomb ] threat would evaporate as soon as the satellite time elapsed . "
Once the bomb threat is over , move on to the pepper spray and rubber bullets !
Final Free Speech Tally : Dozens arrested and beaten .
Unkown number hit with rubber bullets and bean bags .
2 ) Seattle WTO Meeting , 1999 : HIT 'EM WITH EVERYTHING YOU GOT
When the hippies and the extremists start chanting " The Whole World is Watching " , show them you do n't give a shit .
Use everything you have like nobody is watching : chemical weapons , concussion grenades , rubber bullets , clubs -- anything that clears the streets and send the brats back to their smelly safe houses and coffee shops .
Arrest the stragglers and make sure they spend at least a few days in prison .
Final Free Speech Tally : 600 arrested , dozens beaten / gassed .
3 ) Genoa G8 Summit , 2001 : USE REAL BULLETS , AIM FOR HEAD ; FOLLOW THEM BACK TO THEIR BEDS Sometimes you need to send a message by using real bullets against the bastards .
When you hit one , run over the body a couple of times for effect .
After the protests on the streets die down , send special police to the dwellings of protestors and foreign journalists .
Take their computers and beat them unconscious .
Force as many as possible into a waiting bus , drive them to a safe house outside city limits and beat them some more while singing old Fascist tunes .
Make sure other G8 leaders publicly acknowledge the " difficult job " faced by your brave security forces .
Final Free Speech Tally :
One killed , dozens arrested and beaten in police captivity , including native and foreign journalists .
4 ) Miami Free Trade Area of the Americas summit , 2003 : BANG THOSE SHIELDS !
What 's the point of having all those metal - armored riot suits if you can't throw a little rhythm behind your heavily armed advancing line ?
Before you move in with the gas , the grenades , the clubs , and the rubber - bullets , put the fear of God into them by banging your clubs against your plastic shields in time while chanting , " back ! back ! back ! " like some plains Indian tribe in gas masks .
Then , once you 've gotten close enough , break formation and go Seattle on their skinny unarmed asses !
Then , call it the " [ Your City Here ] Model " and helloooo consulting fees !
Final Free Speech Tally : More than 100 arrested , dozens beaten , including journalists .
5 ) NYC Republican National Convention , 2004 : BAN THOSE BIKES AND PUT 'EM IN A PEN !
A lot of extremists may try to hide behind an " ecological " agenda and protest on bicycles , but do n't let these rides get out of hand .
Impound the bikes and make sure protesters do n't get any funny ideas about gathering near " sensitive historical locations " around the city .
If they do , haul them to a remote defunct facility lined with toxic waste and hold as many as you can for as long as you can .
Make sure this holding pen is ringed with barbed wire and , whatever you do , do n't feed anyone !
Hold them until some judge says you have to let them go .
Final Free Speech Tally : 1,800 arrested , dozens beaten , hundreds of bikes impounded .

Notes
Why “ Ampadoje& ” for sample text ?
I wanted a small range of glyphs to give a flavour of the faces with common vowels , ascenders , descenders and at least one capital and special character .
Plus , trying to pronounce the word made me smile .
I have it as “ amp–a–doh–gee ! ”

Click to viewWhile Linux is pretty efficient with a computer 's resources out of the box , there are still ways you can make it run leaner and meaner on your desktop .
Using a little bit of know - how , a willingness to run a few terminal commands , and a mind for efficiency , you can get every last bit of power from your Linux box , or get more life from an older system .
Read on for a roundup of ways to slim down and speed up Linux that any level of user can implement .

One quick note :
Many of these tweaks require altering system files , disabling processes or otherwise changing how your system runs .
Whenever you alter a system file , back it up .
The easiest way is to open a terminal and create a " .backup " version of it .
For instance , to back up the /etc / hosts file , open a terminal and type :
sudo cp /etc/hosts
/etc/hosts.backup
More importantly , if you 're unsure of anything , do n't do it .
Prune your processes
The easiest and safest way to free up memory in any Linux system is to stop unnecessary programs and background processes from running , and then get your system to remember how you like it .
Most Linux distributions have a tool in their " System " or " Administration " menus that let you see what 's going on and halt things , if necessary — in Ubuntu , there are two of them : System -> Preferences ->Sessions , and System -> Administration ->Services .

On every computer I 've loaded Linux onto , there are a few startup programs I almost always disable from the " Sessions " menu .
I do n't sync my phone to my computer and use Thunderbird instead of the built - in Evolution , so the Bluetooth Manager and Evolution Alarm Notifier are first to go .
Before touching anything in the " Services " window , consult this ExtremeTech guide for pointers on what is and is n't safe to turn off .
As mentioned in the guide , Ubuntu ( like most distro GUIs ) only sees a few of the many services your computer is running .
If you really want to fine - tune your system , you can install the sysv-rc - conf package found in many distros and surgically remove unnecessary background programs — but I 'll reiterate that point made above about backing up and making only a few changes at a time .
Install Lighter , Faster Applications

Full - featured , well - rounded programs like Firefox , OpenOffice.org , and Amarok are a big part of the growth in Linux users .
For computers running tight on memory , however , they can make Linux feel less like the streamlined system it 's meant to be .
For users who only need the basics , there are lighter - weight alternative applications that take up less memory and move a little swifter .

Remove extra virtual terminals
Virtual terminals are a good tool to have — they offer a last - ditch escape to command line for a chance to fix things in a crashing system .
But many Linux systems come with six of them enabled , which is n't usually necessary .
You can usually disable five of them with few consequences .
If you 're using Gutsy , open a terminal and type in the following commands :
cd /etc/event.d
sudo mv tty3 tty3.bak
sudo mv tty4 tty4.bak
... and so on , through the tty6 file .
If you 're still on Feisty or other Linux distros , you 'll likely have to edit the file in /etc / inittab and add a # character in front of the lines ending with tty3 , tty4 and the like .

Reduce swappiness
Advertisement
If your system generally has enough memory to handle what you throw at it , your use of swap space should be minimal , but your system does n't know that .
To temporarily lower your swappiness , type the following command into a terminal ( replacing " sudo " with " su " in some systems ) :
Learn More About Swap Space Swap space , the hard drive portion used as temporary memory by Linux systems , is often one of the… Read more
sudo sysctl -w vm.swappiness=10
To make that fix permanent , enter the following command ( trading " gedit " for " kate " in KDE systems , or " nano " or " vi " if you have neither ) :
sudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf
In the file that comes up , look for the line vm.swappiness=x and change the value to 10 , or add the line if it does n't exist .

Get good with the terminal

You 've heard us evangelize about the efficiency of terminals before , but it 's especially true in Linux .
Give your terminal a handy keyboard shortcut , keep a list of basic commands handy , and learn to write bash scripts , create command shortcuts and find anything from one no -nonsense interface .

Five more tips and guides to speeding up your system

How do you optimize your Linux desktop ?
Let us know in the comments .
Kevin Purdy , Lifehacker 's newest Associate Editor , digs finding optimization tips .
His weekly feature will appear every Friday on Lifehacker .
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama launched an online viral counteroffensive Tuesday against persistent e-mail chain letters that lie about his religious and political background .
But history suggests that the effort might backfire , according to experts in urban myths and folklore .
" The principle is that a very strong denial makes some people think : ' Uh huh , we knew it .
If he 's taken the trouble to make such a strong denial , there must be some truth to it , ' " says Bill Ellis , a professor at Pennsylvania State University who studies contemporary folklore and popular cultural responses to societal events like the 9/11 attacks .
There are various versions of the e-mails , but they generally insinuate that Obama is secretly a Muslim who attended a radical Islamic school in Indonesia .
One of the e-mails charges that he 's a radical Muslim who refuses to recite the Pledge of Allegiance .
Another e-mail claims that he was sworn into the Senate using a copy of the Quran .
All of the allegations are false .
According to a list on the urban - legends tracking - and - debunking page Snopes.com , the falsehoods about Obama are the " hottest " urban legends on the internet right now .
Obama 's campaign launched a sophisticated counterattack late Tuesday with a webpage called a " Fact Check Action Center , " with three paragraphs and a YouTube video testimonial about Obama 's background .
The page allows supporters to enter 10 e-mail addresses at a time – or import their Gmail , Yahoo , Hotmail or AOLMail contact lists – into a web form on the site , and with a single click send out talking points that counter the lies in the anti-Obama e-mails .
The page says the campaign wo n't " hold on to any of the e-mail addresses you share . "
The Obama campaign announced the debunking effort with an e-mail barrage from John Kerry of Massachusetts , in which the former presidential candidate urges supporters to " e- mail the truth " to everyone on their address books , to print out the facts about Obama 's background and post them at work , and to call local radio stations and talk to neighbors .
" If lies can be spread virally , let 's prove to the cynics that the truth can be every bit as persuasive as it is powerful , " Kerry wrote in the note .
Kerry 's note was titled " Swiftboating " – a reference to Kerry 's own presidential campaign in 2004 , which was famously sunk by falsities spread by the lobbying group Swift Boat Veterans for the Truth .
Many politicos believe that Kerry 's decision not to " dignify " the rumors and fight them aggressively contributed to his campaign 's defeat in the general election .
But Gary Alan Fine , a professor of social psychology at Northwestern University , who 's studied the subject of politics and reputation , suggests that Obama 's blanket approach may not be the wisest .
" It underlines the attack , " Fine says .
" Sometimes defenses against rumors work ; sometimes they backfire . "
Penn State 's Ellis cites an incident from the 1980s that illustrates the problem .
The French government was forced to officially denounce a pervasive rumor that lick - and - stick tattoos contained LSD , and that the government was n't doing anything to protect children against these dangerous products .
When researchers conducted a survey of people and their views of the credibility of the government 's claim , they found that those who had already heard the rumors found the government 's denial plausible .
But those who first heard about the tattoo - LSD rumor through the government denial itself were more suspicious .
They thought the strong denials masked an underlying truth .
Fine 's advice is for Obama 's supporters to be more strategic , and try to feel out friends , colleagues and relatives before sending them the debunking chain letter .
" What you want to do , when you deny the rumor , you only want to deny it to the people who originally heard it , " Fine says .
At David ’s company , management was n’t a big fan of the whole check - in / re - compile / re - deploy process .
They felt that it had too many steps and took far too long to complete .
Their organization needed to adapt to software changes - especially bug fixes - much faster .
So , to address this problem , they thoroughly analyzed the development process and carefully tweaked it for efficiency .
I ’m just kidding .
Actually , their solution was to pioneer a new methodology called “ SQL Sentences ” .
Management figured that , since a large portion of their application dealt with saving and retrieving data from the database , then a lot of the bugs must be a result of bad SQL queries .
Likely , it was things like a LEFT JOIN instead of an INNER JOIN , or a > instead of a >= .
And , since their application already used a database , they figured - you know where this is going - why not store all of the SQL queries in the database ?
The idea was handed off to the lead developer , who then worked long and hard to transform it into something far , far worse : the “ SQL Sentences ” library .
every single SQL query was to be stored in a table called sql_sentences
in order to not “ hard code ” the purpose of a SQL query in its identifier , SQL sentences were given 4 - digit hex identifiers - 0x00F9 , 0xA004 , etc. - instead of GET_ALL_CUSTOMERS
each sentence has privileges associated with it ; the GetSQLSentence ( ) method made several other queries to make sure the logged - on user could execute the query
to appease the developers who were against storing SQL in the database , a configuration value called “ UseHardcodedSQL ” was added
All told , these changes required developers to modifiy their code to look like this ...
string sql ; // @SQLSentence=0x02f0 if ( ( bool ) ( Configuration.GetValue(" UseHardcodedSQL " ) ) ) { sql = " SELECT cust_name , cust_phone , cust_addr " + " FROM customers WHERE cust_type= ' Active ' " ; } else { sql = DataConnector.GetSQLSentence(0x02f0 ) ; }
... and , of course , add that same query to the sql_sentences table .
And , should there ever be a change to the query , maintain it in both the code and the gigantic script created the sql_sentences table and the production database .
Though David was n't around when these changes were implemented , when he came onboard and heard the story he asked the Lead Developer if he 'd ever heard of a Stored Procedure before .
“ Yeah , ” he replied , “ but I ’ve heard they ’re a big pain to maintain . ”
Huckabee equates homosexuality with polygamy , bestiality
About a month ago , David Corn took a closer look at a book Mike Huckabee wrote as governor in 1998 , called “ Kids Who Kill : Confronting Our Culture of Violence , ” and found a “ fierce culture warrior . ”
The Arkansan was especially pointed in his criticism of gays .
At one point in the book , Huckabee argues , “ It is now difficult to keep track of the vast array of publicly endorsed and institutionally supported aberrations — from homosexuality and pedophilia to sadomasochism and necrophilia . ”
It certainly looked like Huckabee was linking homosexuality with sadomasochism , pedophilia , and necrophilia , which is , of course , rather insane .
On “ Meet the Press ” a few weeks ago , Tim Russert asked the former governor about this , and he said the comment in the book had been “ taken out of the larger context of that book . ”
Russert asked directly if Huckabee considers homosexuality somehow equivalent to pedophilia or sadomasochism .
“ No , ” Huckabee said , “ of course not . ”
With this in mind , Huckabee ’s interview with BeliefNet helped shed some additional light on his anti-gay animus .
In context , the former governor had just explained why he wants to change the Constitution to mandate a Biblical definition of marriage , as he sees it .
( via Greg Sargent )
Q : Is it your goal to bring the Constitution into strict conformity with the Bible ?
Some people would consider that a kind of dangerous undertaking , particularly given the variety of biblical interpretations .
HUCKABEE : Well , I do n’t think that ’s a radical view to say we ’re going to affirm marriage .
I think the radical view is to say that we ’re going to change the definition of marriage so that it can mean two men , two women , a man and three women , a man and a child , a man and animal .
Again , once we change the definition , the door is open to change it again .
I think the radical position is to make a change in what ’s been historic .
( emphasis added )
Yep , ol ’
Mike ’s pretty far out there .
Equating two people of the same gender getting married with bestiality may still be part of the Republican Party mainstream , but it should be on the fringe on modern political thought .
I ’d just add , by the way , that Huckabee happens to be picking up where Rick “ Man on Dog ” Santorum left off .
Santorum said the priests were engaged in “ a basic homosexual relationship ” with “ post - pubescent men ” , and went on to say that he had “ a problem with homosexual acts ” ; that the right to privacy “ does n’t exist in my opinion in the United States Constitution ” ; that , “ whether it ’s polygamy , whether it ’s adultery , whether it ’s sodomy , all of those things are antithetical to a healthy , stable , traditional family ” ; and that sodomy laws properly exist to prevent acts that “ undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family ” .
When the Associated Press reporter asked whether homosexuals should not then engage in homosexual acts , Santorum replied , “ Every society in the history of man has upheld the institution of marriage as a bond between a man and a woman .
Why ?
Because society is based on one thing : that society is based on the future of the society .
And that ’s what ?
Children .
Monogamous relationships .
In every society , the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality .
That ’s not to pick on homosexuality .
It ’s not , you know , man on child , man on dog , or whatever the case may be .
It is one thing .
And when you destroy that you have a dramatic impact on the quality ” .
I just ca n’t imagine what goes on in the minds of conservatives , that leads them to think of bestiality with such ease .
It ’s kind of scary , actually .
Coalition Warship Thwarts Pirate Attack in Arabian Sea
Navy NewsStand
Story Number : NNS071125-01
Release Date : 11/25/2007 3:15:00 PM
From Combined Maritime Forces Public Affairs
ARABIAN SEA ( NNS ) -- British Navy warship HMS Campbeltown saved a civilian cruise liner from potential pirate attack while on coalition patrol in the Arabian Sea .
The Seabourn Spirit 's call for help was taken at the Bahrain headquarters of Royal Navy and coalition operations in the Gulf , as the liner transited for Muscat , Oman .
The crew had grown increasingly concerned about small skiffs believed to be pirates closing on their position .
Pirates are known to operate in the area - the Seabourn Spirit was attacked by armed criminals in nearby waters exactly two years ago .
A number of vessels have been successfully hijacked in waters around the Somali coastline this year .
Over 120 nautical miles away Campbeltown 's maritime attack Lynx helicopter was dispatched to the scene , armed with its machine gun to reassure the cruise liner , and if necessary intercept the pirates .
By the time the helicopter had reached the liner the skiffs had disappeared .
The helicopter 's presence greatly reassured the passengers on board and the Royal Navy has been officially thanked for its assistance by the commanding officer , himself ex-Royal Navy .
Most importantly , Campbeltown 's actions have reassured vessels transiting through the Combined Task Force 150 Joint Operating Area that the coalition warships are effective at supporting requests for help in any direction .
Campbeltown Commanding Officer , Cmdr. Gordon Abernethy , Royal Navy , said , " It is extremely rewarding to be of assistance and know that our presence reassures law - abiding mariners going about their normal business . "
Campbeltown is currently one month into a seven - and - a- half month deployment east of the Suez Canal .
Up to and including Christmas , the ship is operating in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden .
A couple of years ago I spoke at a conference about mathematics that brought together philosophers , psychologists and mathematicians .
The proceedings of the conference will appear fairly soon — I will give details when they do .
My own article ended up rather too long , because I found myself considering the question of “ essential equality ” of proofs .
Eventually , I cut that section , which was part of a more general discussion of what we mean when we attribute properties to proofs , using informal ( but somehow quite precise ) words and phrases like “ neat ” , “ genuinely explanatory ” , “ the correct ” ( as opposed to merely “ a correct ” ) , and so on .
It is an interesting challenge to try to be as precise as possible about these words , but I found that even the seemingly more basic question , “ When are two proofs the same ? ” was pretty hard to answer satisfactorily .
Since it is also a question on which we all have views ( since we all have experience of the phenomenon ) , it seems ideal for a post .
You may have general comments to make , but I ’d also be very interested to hear of your favourite examples of different - seeming proofs that turn out , on closer examination , to be based on the same underlying idea ( whatever that means ) .
A general remark that becomes clear quickly when one thinks about this is that there are fairly standard methods for converting one proof into another , and when we apply such a method then we tend to regard the two proofs as not interestingly different .
For example , it is often possible to convert a standard inductive proof into a proof by contradiction that starts with the assumption that is a minimal counterexample .
In fact , to set the ball rolling , let me give an example of this kind : the proof that every number can be factorized into primes .
The usual approach is the minimal - counterexample one : if there is a positive integer that cannot be factorized , let be a minimal one ; is not prime , so it can be written as with both and greater than 1 ; by minimality and can be factorized ; easy contradiction .
Now let ’s give the inductive version .
We need the “ strong ” principle of induction .
Suppose , then , that we have proved that every integer up to can be factorized and are trying to factorize .
If is already prime , then we are done .
Otherwise , we can write with both and greater than 1 .
But then and are less than , so by induction they can be factorized .
Putting together those factorizations gives a factorization for and the inductive step is complete .
( I missed out the proof that the induction starts , just as I did not check in the first proof that there exists a number that can be factorized . )
That ’s a rather boring example of sameness of proofs — boring because they are so obviously the same , and one can even point to a mechanical procedure that converted one into the other ( which can be applied to many other proofs ) .
More interesting are examples where the sameness becomes apparent only after a more complicated process of transformation .
At this point , I ’d like to mention the theorem that I discussed in great detail in the bit that I removed from my article : the irrationality of .
Very briefly , here ’s the standard proof .
If is rational , then we can write it as .
Let us do so in such a way that and are not both even .
We know that , so is even , so is even , so for some integer .
This gives us , so , so is even , so is even , which is a contradiction .
Now , equally briefly , here is another proof .
Suppose again that and let be written in its lowest terms .
Now .
Substituting for and tidying up , this gives us that .
But , so the denominator of the right - hand side is less than , which contradicts the minimality of ( and hence too , since their ratio is determined ) .
Now there are some similarities between those two arguments : both assume that and aim for a contradiction , assuming that is in its lowest terms .
But there are also definite differences .
For example , the first proof does n’t actually care whether and are minimized : it just wants them not both to be even .
The second proof does n’t care at all about the factorizations of and but does care about their sizes .
So I ’d maintain that they are different proofs .
Having said that , I once put that to Terence Tao in a conversation and he immediately adopted a more general perspective from which one could regard the two arguments as different ways of carrying out the same essential programme .
It had something to do with if I remember correctly .
Terry , if you felt like reminding me of exactly what you said , that would be a perfect illustration of “ non-obvious equivalence ” between proofs .
Here , though , is a third argument for the irrationality of .
You just work out the continued - fraction expansion .
It comes out to be .
Since the continued - fraction expansion of any rational number terminates , is irrational .
Here ’s a fourth .
Let and be coprime and suppose that does not equal .
Then and are also coprime .
We also find that .
From this observation we can build a succession of fractions , each in their lowest terms , with tending to infinity and with all equal .
From that we find that has order of magnitude , and from that it is easy to verify that has order of magnitude as well .
But it is impossible to find a sequence of rationals with denominators tending to infinity that approach a rational this quickly .
Indeed , , which for fixed has order of magnitude .
( For large and coprime and , the difference can not be zero . )
I wo n’t demonstrate it here , but it ’s not too hard an exercise to see that the second , third and fourth proofs are all essentially the same .
( At some point , perhaps I ’ll put a link to a more detailed account of exactly why , at least for the second and third .
The fourth has only just occurred to me . )
For instance , the construction of the sequence in the fourth proof is the same as the construction of the continued - fraction expansion of ( as lovers of Pell ’s equation will know ) .
Also , the way that we produced from is just the reverse of the way that we produced a smaller fraction from in the second proof .
The fourth proof is perhaps very slightly different , in that it involved inequalities , but that was not a fundamental difference .
( It would be interesting to be precise about why not — this is what I have n’t got round to thinking about yet . )
To repeat : for the time being I am interested in responses of two kinds .
First , I ’d like to see lots of examples of proofs that turn out to be essentially the same when they might not initially seem that way .
Secondly , I ’m keen to see examples of “ conversion techniques ” — that is , methods for transforming a proof into another that is not interestingly different .
See this comment for some interesting links , though here I am not so much looking for a formal theory right down at the level of logical formulae .
Rather , I would like as good a picture as possible of high - level equivalence of proofs .
Some general questions are quite interesting .
For instance , if two proofs are essentially the same , must there always be some more general perspective from which one can see that the only differences between them consist in arbitrary choices that do not affect the argument in an important way ?
( A simple example of what I mean is something like replacing “ Let ” by “ Let ” in an argument in real analysis .
But there are much more interesting examples of this . )
Also , is “ essential equivalence ” really an equivalence relation , or could one morph in several stages from one proof to another that was “ genuinely different ” ?
( My own feeling , by the way , is that the morph would itself be a demonstration of essential equivalence , but perhaps a really good example might change my mind on that . )
Is it ever possible to give a completely compelling argument that two proofs are genuinely different ?
How would one go about such a task ?
Could one attach an invariant to a proof , perhaps ?

Questions have been raised about election standards in Putin's Russia
" Russia has made it impossible , " said Christian Strohal , monitoring chief for the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) .
The OSCE has been arguing with Russia over the size and scope of the observers ' mission .
Russia 's foreign ministry called the monitors ' decision " unacceptable " .
" This position can only cause us to feel the deepest regret , " spokesman Mikhail Kamynin said .
The watchdog rejected concessions by Moscow aimed at averting a boycott .
Russia had refused permission for his body to send an assessment mission last year , said Mr Strohal , director of OSCE 's monitoring wing , the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights ( ODIHR ) .
They have imposed restrictions and limitations which do not allow us to deliver a professional job
Christian Strohal
ODIHR director
Moscow had then limited the number of observers and the length of time they could stay in Russia , he added .
" They have imposed restrictions and limitations which do not allow us to deliver a professional job in accordance with our mandate , " said Mr Strohal .
' Unacceptable '
The European Union 's Slovene presidency said it regretted that due to Russia 's restrictions the OSCE 's election monitoring wing " was put in a situation where it found it impossible to execute its mandate and cancelled the election observation mission " .
It also expressed " its full support to the election observation activities " of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights ( ODIHR ) .
The OSCE 's parliamentary assembly announced its decision in a letter sent to the Russian parliament .
" We unfortunately cannot accept your invitation to send a limited number of observers to Russia for the presidential election , " assembly President Goran Lennmarker said in the letter .
Mr Lennmarker also mentioned " other conditions and circumstances " , without specifying .
' Ultimatums '
Earlier , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that no self - respecting country would bow to " ultimatums " of the kind set by the OSCE .
Mr Lavrov urged the ODIHR to stop " inventing instructions "
Mr Lavrov also called for the OSCE election monitoring wing to be reformed , accusing it of working on the basis of rules it invented itself .
The ODIHR and Russia 's election commission have been involved in a row over the size and time schedule of the observers ' mission .
The ODIHR on Wednesday rejected a commission offer designed to avert a boycott .
Russia said it would allow ODIHR observers to arrive on 20 February - a week earlier than Moscow had originally wanted .
The commission also accepted an increase in the number of monitors , from 70 to 75 .
Restrictions
But the ODIHR said the offer did not go far enough , insisting on 15 February as the start date .
The monitors had argued that arriving just three days before the vote would mean they could not monitor the election campaign to see if it was free and fair for all candidates , including their access to Russia 's media .
Monitors normally arrive in countries up to two months before voting takes place so they can observe the registration of candidates , campaigning and media coverage as well as the vote itself .
The OSCE monitors decided not to observe the parliamentary election in Russia last December because of similar restrictions , the BBC's Richard Galpin in Moscow says .
Western observers who did come to Russia in December criticised the election , saying it had not been fair , our correspondent says .
WASHINGTON  The Democratic presidential race has become a cliffhanger as a new USA TODAY / Gallup Poll on Sunday showed Barack Obama wiping out Hillary Rodham Clinton 's double - digit national lead just before coast - to - coast contests on Tuesday .
The pair stood at Clinton 45 % , Obama 44 % in the latest snapshot of the volatile race .
Republican John McCain also surged in the poll , posting a decisive 42 % - 24 % lead over Mitt Romney .
Mike Huckabee trailed at 18 % .
McCain greeted the news cautiously .
" We 'll see how the votes go .
We 'll keep working , " he said .
With a celebrity cast and some Super Tuesday states too close to call , interest was high .
Seven in 10 people in the poll said they were paying " quite a lot " of attention — up from 58 % at this point in 2004 , during another high - interest wartime race .
The Wednesday through Saturday poll of adults nationwide came after Rudy Giuliani left the GOP race and Democrat John Edwards ' exit set up a Clinton - Obama clash .
Obama strategist David Axelrod said Clinton is " the greatest brand name in Democratic politics . "
Still , he said , the Illinois senator has made good progress and " there 's a powerful , powerful mood for change in this country . "
Obama has ridden a wave of momentum since a landslide win Jan. 26 in South Carolina .
On Sunday , he ran a TV ad during the Super Bowl on local Fox stations in 23 states .
Building on a series of Kennedy family endorsements , he received support from California 's first lady , Maria Shriver .
Clinton 's lead faded over two weeks during which Obama advertised heavily and her husband , former president Bill Clinton , took heat from fellow Democrats for attacking Obama .
" We have a strong and broad coalition that I think will give us significant delegates and victories on Feb. 5 , " Clinton adviser Mark Penn said .
In the poll , Clinton led Obama 48 % - 42 % among women , compared with 50 % - 31 % two weeks ago .
He reversed her slight lead among men , and completely erased her 21 - point advantage among people ages 35 to 64 .
Whites backed Clinton 49%- 39 % , while blacks backed Obama 63 % - 25 % .
Both racial gaps were higher than two weeks ago .
McCain , who has been strong among independents and moderates , beat Romney 41 % - 26 % among Republicans or independents leaning Republican and 38 % - 28 % among conservatives .
Romney spokesman Kevin Madden said national polls " tell you very little " about state contests .
The poll 's margin of error is +/— 4 percentage points for 867 Republicans and adults leaning Republican , and +/—3 percentage points for 985 Democrats and adults leaning Democratic .

Senator Chris Dodd's Presidential campaign died with a whimper in Iowa .
But he still seems to be dictating national security policy to fellow Democrats on Capitol Hill , and unless the Bush Administration is willing to fight , perhaps to the next President too .
We 're told that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is saying privately he now wo n't attempt to update the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) on the wiretapping of al Qaeda suspects .
Instead , he 'll merely support another 18 - month extension of the six - month - old ...
We 're in the middle of the Pacific .
As I write , we 're rolling in a gentle swell just north of the equator on the 32,000 - tonne container ship , the Hansa Rendsburg , a 175 m - long Chinese - built vessel with what one of the crew described charmingly as a ' deciduous ' engine - it sheds parts , apparently .
Tahiti , our last port of call , is 2,000 miles behind us , and the next , Ensenada in Mexico , is another 2,000 miles ahead .
In the context of ' getting away from it all ' , I 'm not sure how much further away we could possibly get .
This is our third ' freighter cruise ' , having previously sailed as passengers on cargo ships from Singapore to Brisbane and from Melbourne to Napier in New Zealand as part of our round - the - world trip without flying .
While we 're not actually expected to swab the decks in exchange for our passage , this is a far cry from cruising .
Contrasting cargo ships with cruise liners is like comparing a truck with a limousine - they both get you to your destination , but only one has a champagne fridge and leather seats .
The luxurious pampering and clientele of clubby retirees are all part of the cruise liner experience and come with a price tag to match .
Cargo ships are very much the ' no - frills ' option .
The core business of our vessel is to shift stuff around the world .
The financial benefit of our presence to the company , when fuel costs run into many thousands of pounds a day , is minuscule .
We 're essentially a welcome distraction , mainly because , after several months at sea the crew , if not exactly sick of the sight of each other , at least appreciate some fresh faces and new conversation .
We have a ' suite ' that is pleasant and spacious enough - in a Slough Travelodge sort of way .
There is also a fridge - which we 've stocked with beer from the ship 's store ( sadly , there is no Möet ) .
Onboard are 21 crew , a mixture of Kiwis , Ukrainians , Filipinos and Kiribatis ( from a remote group of atolls in the equatorial Pacific ) .
There 's one other passenger - a retired female Canadian Mountie who ' ca n't stand flying ' - and around 1,000 metal containers .
These are stuffed with dried milk products , white goods , fruit and , in the 150 or so refrigerated ' reefer ' containers , fish , meat and ice - cream .
We 've even got a cargo of ' low - specific ' radioactive material going to Canada , which means we 'll acquire a Mexican naval escort for the approach into Ensenada .
That 's what I call arriving in style .
With 16 days at sea , we make our own entertainment .
We 're studying Spanish in anticipation of our arrival in Mexico , for which I am also entertaining myself by growing a big , fat , culturally appropriate moustache .
With no cinema aboard , the only ' pirates ' we 've seen have been in the ship 's library of DVDs of dubious origin and suspect titles of the lewd , nude variety .
The male crew , it must be remembered , are alone at sea for very long periods .
Apparently one middle - aged woman found horizontal ways to entertain herself and most of the crew , on a one - to - one basis , during a recent Pacific crossing .
There are also opportunities for lovers of wildlife .
We 've seen pods of whales in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon , skittering flying fish off Tahiti , gangs of tiny petrels , and a lone majestic albatross wheeling gracefully around the ship in the Tasman Sea .
Nature is less visible in the mid-Pacific , but there 's still plenty to stimulate the senses .
We 're fantastically remote , potentially vulnerable , yet constantly lifted and inspired by the vivid blue beauty of sea and sky : rolling cloudscapes , wildly flamboyant sunsets and star - peppered nights .
We are truly at the mercy of the ocean 's might , which is as profoundly humbling as it is scary .
For exercise , all ships have some form of ' gym ' , though this is usually a slightly optimistic description of a room with a table - tennis table , weights and an exercise bike if you 're lucky .
Our current vessel also has a swimming pool , which sloshes merrily with the movement of the ocean .
Who needs a wave machine ?
It 's the size of a large septic tank and filled directly with unheated seawater .
As a result , it 's only really fun in the tropics .
Still it helps burn off the steady ingestion of food that punctuates the day .
On the gastronomic front , no two cargo ships are the same .
The menus have swung from eastern European ' meat and mash ' offerings to Filipino fried fish , spicy okra and plenty of rice .
We crossed the Tasman on a French ship where meals were conjured up with typical Gallic culinary flair , made sweeter still by the limitless carafes of free wine .
The Hansa Rendsburg is somewhere in between these extremes , though tomorrow the entire ship 's company is gathering in medieval fashion to barbecue a whole suckling pig on the aft - deck , a regular mid-ocean treat .
People are a key part of the journey and are often folk you would n't normally speak to , let alone get to know .
Sharing a ship has been enlightening , entertaining and at times socially demanding .
We 've learnt the hard way about Russian conversational reticence when sitting in stony silence around the dinner table .
We 've partied with a phalanx of friendly Filipinos over beers , and discovered a hitherto latent personal penchant for karaoke .
With senior Anglophone crew members and passengers , we 've wrestled ( and argued ) with old - school attitudes on race , religion and gender equality from perspectives unpolished with any veneer of political correctness .
Cargo ship travel is not for everyone , but in an age when any idiot can get on a plane and twang themselves to the other side of the planet , there is something uniquely satisfying about a long voyage by sea .
You gain a respect for the crews who spend so many months of their lives each year half a world away from their nearest and dearest .
You get to explore the mechanics of the biggest engines you 'll probably ever see , hang out on the bridge and try on thick orange Neoprene immersion suits that make you resemble a cross between a Teletubby and a lobster fetishist .
Freighter cruising also gives a fascinating insight into the logistics of the way much of the world 's trade is conducted - sobering when you see first - hand the scale of maritime shipping operations and the challenges involved .
Cheap oriental Christmas decorations are seen in a new light when you appreciate how they 've reached the UK .
A cargo ship journey is a contemplative , relaxing experience - if the weather obliges .
Freed from the distractions of telephones , the internet and the modern world that permeate even the remotest holiday resorts , at sea your mind can wander , ruminate and truly escape .
The tragedy is that these opportunities are in decline and capacity is limited to a few passenger cabins per ship .
Compounding this , Orwellian security and immigration measures introduced by the US in recent years have created so many headaches for shipping companies that many have simply stopped carrying passengers at all .
A long , proud tradition of travel by sea is in danger of disappearing altogether .
Do n't miss the boat .
How to plan your own cargo voyage
Where should I start ?
There 's a lot of information available online from various shipping companies that offer passenger bookings , but it 's not all in English and it can be confusing trying to compare what 's out there yourself , so the best way to book is through a specialist agent .
Among the best in the UK are Strand Travel www.strandtravel.co.uk ( 0207 010 9290 ) and The Cruise People www.members.aol.com/CruiseAZ/home.htm ( 0207 723 2450 ) .
Both have excellent websites , and Strand Travel 's boasts an interactive map showing possible routes .
What does it cost ?
Travelling by cargo ship works out more expensive than flying but your food and lodging are included in the price .
The Cruise People estimate that it costs around £ 70 per day per person .
How does the cost compare with that of a cruise ?
Cargo ships will work out cheaper , although perhaps not by as much as you might expect .
P&O Cruises ' American Adventure , for example , is a 30 - night round trip from Southampton to Madeira , Florida , South Carolina , New York , Boston and Vigo , leaving in September , and discounted fares start at £ 2,599 per person , though this increases as availability decreases .
The price includes meals and accommodation , but not excursions .
A 28 - day round trip on a cargo ship from Southampton , to New York , Virginia ( US ) , the Netherlands , Germany and France , costs £ 1,775 per person , including meals , with Strand Travel .
Once on board a cargo ship things are very cheap too ; drinks are duty free and are not usually marked up .
Unlike cruise ships , there are rarely single - supplements on cargo ships , which can make a huge difference .
Where can you go ?
Options range from short journeys to the Med , to trans -Atlantic and trans - Pacific voyages or mega round - the - world trips .
The longest voyage Strand Travel features is a 124 - day round - the - world trip leaving from Hamburg and travelling via the Suez Canal , China , Japan , the Panama Canal and the US , which costs £ 7,345 per person .
One of the shortest is a 10 - day round trip from Goole in Humberside to Sweden , via Denmark and Germany , from £ 705 .
On most of the longer itineraries , it 's usually possible to join the ship for part of the route , and it 's common to fly one way , or return on another ship .
What 's included ?
Three meals a day plus snacks are included , as well as accommodation .
You 'll have to pay for drinks , cigarettes and anything else you want on board .
Bed linen and towels will be changed regularly and there will be a self - service launderette for personal items .
You 'll need to arrange your own insurance , too .
What are the ships like ?
A variety of freight ships will take passengers , but most are container ships .
Accommodation is of a good standard .
Facilities vary greatly but there 's likely to be a lounge , with TV , DVD and CD player and a selection of films and books , shared with officers and sometimes crew .
There 's usually a bar and a fitness room .
Cabins are generally quite spacious , tend to be on the outside of the ship , and usually have en suite facilities .
Compared with the average cabin on a cruise ship , you 're likely to have more space but less luxury .
Generally ships will have swimming pools too , mostly outdoor .
How to plan your own cargo voyage
What 's the food like ?
It tends to be simple but good , often reflecting the nationality of the ship .
Passengers generally have their own table , which is usually in the officers ' restaurant .
How many passengers are there likely to be ?
Usually just five or six , but you could be the only one .
There will rarely be more than 11 because if a ship has more than 12 passengers it 's legally required to have a doctor on board .
What nationality will the crew be ?
The shipping companies are of all different nationalities , and the captain is usually the same nationality as the ship 's owners , but the crew is likely to be a real mix , from anywhere around the world .
Are you expected to tip staff ?
It is usual to tip the steward who looks after you .
He 'll generally clean your cabin and serve you at mealtimes .
Will I be able to see much in port ?
You 'll probably only have time for the most whistle - stop of tours .
Most ships will spend 10 - 12 hours in port , but bear in mind that you could be arriving at 10 pm .
Can anyone join a cargo ship ?
Most companies wo n't accept anyone over 80 .
Passengers with chronic health conditions are generally not accepted .
Will I arrive on the expected date ?
Departure and arrival dates are very likely to change because of weather conditions , cargo requirements , even strikes , so it 's not for those with fixed schedules .

CCTV : This is the same police station that the female police officer that dumped a man from his wheelchair .
Marcella Pourmoghani claims she was beaten by a Hillsborough County Sheriff 's Office detention deputy that she had to be taken from the jail to a hospital .
Here is the surveillance video from the Orient Road Jail .
A woman who said she was beaten by a deputy at the Orient Road Jail has filed a federal lawsuit .
After seeing what happened to Brian Sterner , the wheelchair - bound quadriplegic , dumped from his chair at the same jail facility , Marcella Pourmoghani is speaking out .
The deputy involved in the Sterner case , Charlette Marshall - Jones , submitted her resignation Monday .
" Unprovoked , just as what happened to myself , " she said after watching the wheelchair incident .
" I could not breathe from the blood pouring from my mouth and my face , ' Pourmoghani said .
" And she had her knee on the base of my skull .
" Pourmoghani said she was beaten so severely that she had to be taken from the jail to a hospital .
At that time , Pourmoghani also was charged with battery on a law enforcement officer .
But the state attorney 's office dropped the charge after seeing the video .
On Friday , Pourmoghani 's attorney filed a lawsuit in federal court .
She 's suing Hillsborough County , the sheriff 's office and all the deputies seen on the video .
Because of the lawsuit , the Hillsborough County Sheriff 's Office wo n't comment on the case .
But last August , when the video first surfaced , a jail supervisor defended the deputy .

Less than 1 % of Chinese music sales are said to be legal
Firms targeted in the legal action include Baidu , China 's largest internet business , and Yahoo China , in which US giant Yahoo has a 44 % stake .
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry says the firms offer direct links to pirated music .
It estimates that 99 % of all music files in China are pirated .
As a result , the trade body says the annual legal music market in China accounts for just $ 76 m ( £ 38 m ) .
Advertising revenues
An IFPI spokesman said the industry had hoped that the arrival of digital music would bring a new start for the music industry in China , which was a hotbed of CD piracy , but those hopes had been dashed .
It accuses China 's internet companies of linking to pirated music sites to boost their advertising revenues .
The IFPI has written to the directors of Yahoo in the US to urge them to use their influence to stop the practice .
The World Trade Organization is currently continuing with a formal investigation into a US complaint about Chinese piracy .
BANGKOK ( Reuters ) - Alarmed by polls showing one in four Thai teens will celebrate St. Valentine ’s Day by having sex , police plan to swoop on motels , malls and parks to ensure youths behave themselves on the “ Day of Love . ”

The annual campaign to ensure good behavior on February 14 will see city officials turn on all lights at public parks in the capital Bangkok , while parents are urged to make sure their teenagers come home early .
Police and “ student inspectors ” from the Education Ministry will be checking discrete “ curtain ” motels to make sure youths under the legal age of 18 are not using them for amorous interludes .
“ We will send patrols to check out public parks , restaurants and shopping malls , which are the starting points for potential sexual activities that will be done at home or motels , ” Bangkok police spokesman Suporn Pansuea said .
Thailand ’s moral guardians are taking action after an Assumption University poll showed 27 percent of 2,400 Bangkok teenagers surveyed said they might have sex on Wednesday .
Despite Bangkok ’s reputation as one of the world ’s sex industry centers , predominately Buddhist Thailand is generally a conservative country .
This year ’s St Valentine ’s Day celebrations have been tempered by a sluggish economy after two years of political strife and a 2006 coup , and nationwide mourning for King Bhumibol Adulyadej ’s sister who died in January .
Rose vendors have complained about sagging sales because people have less disposable income .
“ I do n’t think we ’ll have robust sales this Valentine ’s Day , ” Den Yarum , a florist at Bangkok ’s main flower market , told the Thai- language Daily News .
A number of annual high - profile events , such as weddings conducted on mountain cliffs , underwater or in hot - air balloons , have been cancelled or postponed due to the 100 - day mourning period for Princess Galyani Vadhana .
Bangkok ’s “ District of Love , ” a city office where superstitious couples flock to register their marriages on Valentine ’s Day , will be open for business , but the ceremonies will be low key .
“ People are still mourning Princess Galyani Vadhana so the activities will be simple , with an emphasis on her love for the people , ” district chief Pravit Panviroj said .

In a series of essays I am exploring the sociological reasons that the prosperous democracies with high levels of religiosity – the conservative and creationist USA most of all -- tend to have high levels of social dysfunction .
In the last essay we looked at teen sex .
This time around it is marriage and divorce .
The Christian right would have us believe that the nuclear family as per Leave it to Beaver and Father Knows Best is Christ ’s way for all humans .
In reality the 1950 ’s family unit was an invention of the 20th century .
Marriage as described in the Bible was a standard property relationship for the time , in which the husband essentially owned the wife , who could be a literal slave forced into marriage .
Unless you subscribe to the notion that Jesus was secretly married to Mary Magdalene , the Biblical Christ had little use for the institution .
He thought the end times were nigh , so why bother ?
In Luke 12 Jesus says that he had come to earth to divide father against son , mother against daughter and mother - in - law against daughter - in - law .
The modern idea of marriage as the end result of romantic love between a boy and girl who decide they want to be with one another 24/7 came in during the , well , Romantic Period .
Ever since commentators have observed that this arrangement is a recipe for instability .
If a couple gets hitched because they like one another rather than as part of a practical , arranged social contract , then what happens if they ca n’t stand one another anymore ?
This problem is displayed in another classic 1950s sitcom , I Love Lucy .
Ricky and Lucy get along well enough despite the latter ’s ditzy ways , but their friends and landlords Ethel and Fred are another matter .
Their love , sparked when Fred was a “ gay young blade ” on the vaudeville tour , had long since soured , ( that the actors , the relatively liberal Vivian Vance and the old Irish misogynist William Frawley loathed one another in real life aided the effect ) .
Maybe Fred could have used some Viagra .
Because social and legal barriers to divorce were still so strict , the Mertz ’s were stuck with one another .
When frustrated with their mates , Fred and Ricky occasionally entertained the notion of having an affair , a threat their wives take seriously .
Divorce was rare prior to WW II .
During the war strictures against sex outside marriage were still severe enough that lots of hormone driven couples got married so they could enjoy intercourse before he left for duty .
Immediately after the war the divorce rate soared as countless quicky couples decided they were not about to spend the rest of their lives together .
But the divorce level soon settled back down to prewar levels .
It was during the 60s that divorce started its long - term rise .
Notice to the elements of the right .
The divorce boom did not , repeat did not , arise among 60s baby boomers corrupted by the elimination of school prayer early in the decade combined with the hedonistic individualism of the counterculture .
The BBers were just starting to get married .
Divorce American style had its beginnings among the “ Greatest Generation ” , the WW II veterans who were in their fortysomething prime at the time .
The people over on the religious right would like for us to believe that the age of divorce is the fault of the masses falling away from the ways of the Biblical God .
There is a little problem with this thesis .
Among the western democracies , the religious USA has an exceptionally high level of divorce among married couples , matched only by the Swedes .
And do n’t blame the secular liberals for this .
Within our country , born - again evangelicals are splitting up at sky - high rates that are exceeded by no other major cohort .
The collapse of divorce as a legitimate issue of social traditionalists started a few decades ago .
As divorce became common the right quickly turned it into a wedge issue , denouncing it as another example of modernity ’s secular amorality .
It was one of their main lines – until something awkward came up .
Ronald Reagan was once married to Jane Wyman .
After some years they got a Hollywood divorce ; seems she was having an affair , and their politics were diverging .
Not long after that Ronnie married another actor , Nancy , who eventually thought it would be a great idea if her hubby became president .
Had Reagan not divorced liberal Jane , he might well never have become the chief executive .
As Reagan became the darling of the right , the right ’s obsession with divorce as an intolerable sin all of a sudden tailed off into its being a serious but excusable flaw .
Convenience trumped conservative principle – again .
Oh , traditionalists still like to bring up the divorce thing when it serves their purposes to do so .
But failed marriages , often mixed with adultery , has become a common habit among conservative leaders .
It has been a feature of most of the leading Repub presidential candidates .
A feature that may have contributed to Giuliani , ’s problems , but has not done McCain much harm .
Why are working and middle class born - agains doing the splits ?
Leslie Bennett in The Feminine Mistake describes the problem .
Young couple takes the theocon path to familial bliss , and she stays home and raises the kids .
The pair get older and their kids leave the nest .
Devout Christian husband comes home and announces he is dumping middle aged her in favor of his hot secretary or whoever he has been having his latest affair with .
Since he has the money she gets a raw deal all round .
Or , she gets fed up with living the dull patriarchal life , wants a career and interests of her own , and takes off leaving him wondering what happened .
Even the theocon elite recognizes that they have a serious credibility gap when it comes to divorce , so they came up with an idea that seemed brilliant .
Covenant marriage .
This heavy duty version of hitching up requires premarital counseling , oral and written affirmation that the happy couple really is marrying for life , plus narrower grounds for divorce combined with a longer waiting period before a final split is finalized .
Three southern states , Arkansas , Louisiana and Arizona , passed covenant marriage laws .
Traditionalist leaders calculated that with hundreds of thousands , nay millions , wedded tight as Siamese twins , evangelical divorce would die on the vine .
Meanwhile , the liberal fools , still wedding under the looser , secular rules , would continue to suffer from high levels of divorce , demonstrating once and for all the superiority of His ways .
Seemed like a good idea at the time .
Although governor Mike Huckabee occasionally likes to cite his rule in the adoption of covenant marriage under his watch in Arkansas , the movement as withered as no additional states have adopted the system .
That ’s because in the states with covenant marriage , 1 % have been under the new rules .
That ’s a few thousand people .
About the same number of gays joined one another in wedded bliss in Massachusetts , and tens of thousands have signed up for domestic partnerships in California .
So gays are showing more commitment towards being as committed to one another as the law allows than are Bible believers .
Most conservative Christians do n’t want to have anything to do with a rigorous marriage contract .
Here ’s why .
They want the option to opt out if it comes down to it .
This is America after all , land of the free – free to move on .
Let ’s not be holier than thou when it comes to the right - wingers over the divorce dilemma .
Divorced secularists are not exactly a rare species , and no one including me seems to have a good solution to what has become a chronic trait of modern western life .
The problem with the theocon elites is that they continue to arrogantly proclaim that only their Bible based ideology leads to sound marriages , when it is painfully obvious they have no clue how to address their own divorce troubles much less that of society at large , and if anything the structure of right wing marriage exacerbates the problem .
They really should knock off lecturing the rest of the culture until they get their house in order ( since they never will that would keep them quiet for a long time ! ) .
In the next essay we ’ll take a look at why European families seem to be doing reasonably well despite , or perhaps even because of , low rates of marriage and significant levels of divorce .

UNITED NATIONS 
The General Assembly approved a two - year budget of $ 4.17 billion on Saturday , with the United States casting the only vote against the measure because it included financing for a conference the United States felt would be prejudicial to Israel .
The vote , taken at 5:55 a.m. after days of round - the - clock negotiations , was 142 to 1 .
The United States said it was forced to oppose the measure because of the insistence of the Group of 77 , a powerful assemblage of 130 developing nations , that the budget provide money for a proposed conference that would be a follow - up to the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban , South Africa .
The United States walked out of the Durban meeting because it said it had become a forum for attacks on Israel .
Mark Wallace , the American ambassador for management , said the United States objected to “ revisiting an event that was noxious to my country and a disgrace in the international community . ”
Bionic Woman 's future is uncertain after low ratings
The networks spend millions of dollars each year turning scripts into single episodes to test audience reaction .
But NBC Universal chief executive Jeff Zucker thinks he can save $ 50 m ( £ 25.6 m ) each year by scrapping them .
" We will still market those scripted series .
We are just going to go straight to air with them and cut out the pilots , " he said .
The move has partly been prompted by the writers ' strike , which has led studios to scale back on new productions because of a lack of scripts .
Soaring costs
The cost of producing a pilot has soared over the last three years from $ 3 m ( £ 1.5 m ) to $ 7 m ( £ 3.6 m ) .
Last year NBC commissioned eight new drama series after pilots were produced .
The system is supposed to weed out failures .
" I think there were a tremendous number of inefficiencies in Hollywood and it often takes a seismic event to change them , and I think that 's what 's happened here , " Mr Zucker told the Financial Times .
Among the shows dropped by NBC after one series is Journeyman , a time - travel series featuring Scottish star Kevin McKidd .
The future of Bionic Woman - starring former EastEnders actress Michelle Ryan - is uncertain after it suffered low ratings .
Only eight episodes were aired before the writers ' strike affected production .
NBC says it will still commission one or two pilots a year , but other series will go straight into production .
It is not clear whether other studios will follow .

Perhaps only woody plants , not grasses , emit the greenhouse gas .
Some sorts of ecosystems might release more methane than others .
Pixtal
Nearly two years after the confusing discovery that terrestrial plants may be pumping out methane through an unknown mechanism , scientists are still producing puzzling results about this strange phenomenon .
A study this week seems to confirm that methane is emitted in this way , but adds that it might be limited to woody plants — again for unknown reasons .
Methane ( CH 4 ) , the main component in natural gas , is a simple hydrocarbon and a potent greenhouse gas .
It is most commonly released by organic matter decaying in oxygen - free environments , such as swamps and animal guts .
The original finding , published in January 2006 , that green plants emit methane in the presence of atmospheric oxygen1 seemed to turn upside down textbook knowledge .
It was clear that if global vegetation does release substantial amounts of the gas , one or more of the known methane sources must have been considerably overestimated ( see The methane mystery ) .
But those initial measurements , by Frank Keppler of the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg Physics , Germany , have proven hard to verify .
Using a different experimental approach , other researchers failed to find evidence for any significant ‘ aerobic ’ methane emissions by plants .
In a study published in May2 , Tom Dueck , then with Plant Research International in Wageningen , the Netherlands , and his colleagues concluded that the contribution of green plants to global methane emission is very small at most .
However , a Chinese–American team has now confirmed , with a very precise carbon - isotope method , that at least some plants do indeed emit measurable , if small , amounts of methane under aerobic conditions3 .
But the results suggest that the effect is not universal among plants .
Methane in a bottle
Zhi-Ping Wang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ' Institute of Botany in Nanxincun and his colleagues tested 44 different plant species which they had randomly collected around the Chinese Academy of Sciences ' Ecosystem Research Station in Inner Mongolia .
They put leaves or stems in gas - tight bottles , flushed the bottles with methane - free air ( or alternatively with air containing small initial methane concentrations ) , and then let them rest in the dark at room temperature .
When 10 - 20 hours later they determined methane concentration , they found that 7 out of 9 woody species — most notably the shrub Achillea frigida — had emitted aerobically produced methane .
Herbaceous plants and grasses had not , they report in Environmental Science and Technology3 .
If correct , this finding would mean that mid-latitude grasslands such as the Inner Mongolian steppe are not a source for atmospheric methane , whereas ecosystems dominated by trees and shrubs might be more likely sources .
But the results are by no means definitive .
Although Wang did not see emissions from herbaceous plants , Keppler did .
And there is also some preliminary field evidence for the effect occurring over tropical grasses .
Confusion continues
“ This is a difficult process to study , ” says Jay Gulledge , a microbiologist at the University of Wyoming in Laramie and a co-author of the newest study .
“ It will take a lot more work to figure out when , where , and why it happens , and whether or not it is actually important to the global methane budget . ”

Keppler had estimated initially that terrestrial plants could account for up to 40 % of total methane emissions , but the figure has since been revised downwards .
If the effect is not universal among plants it would imply an even smaller contribution to the global methane budget .
As yet , all global estimates are extremely uncertain .
But even if plants contribute little to the global methane budget , scientists are keen to understand the unknown chemistry behind the elusive effect .
Dueck , who had not looked at woody plants in his own study , says that the new results are interesting and instructive .
But they do not clarify the mechanism by which the methane is produced .
And it is even harder to see how stems might produce methane .
“ That only woody plants might emit the gas has got me completely puzzled , ” he says .
DOES THE INERTIA OF A BODY DEPEND
UPON ITS ENERGY - CONTENT ?
By A. Einstein
September 27 , 1905
The results of the previous investigation lead to a very interesting conclusion , which is here to be deduced .
I based that investigation on the Maxwell - Hertz equations for empty space , together with the Maxwellian expression for the electromagnetic energy of space , and in addition the principle that : —
The laws by which the states of physical systems alter are independent of the alternative , to which of two systems of coordinates , in uniform motion of parallel translation relatively to each other , these alterations of state are referred ( principle of relativity ) .
With these principles as my basis I deduced inter alia the following result ( § 8 ) :—
Let a system of plane waves of light , referred to the system of co-ordinates ( x , y , z ) , possess the energy l ; let the direction of the ray ( the wave - normal ) make an angle with the axis of x of the system .
If we introduce a new system of co-ordinates ( ) moving in uniform parallel translation with respect to the system ( x , y , z ) , and having its origin of co-ordinates in motion along the axis of x with the velocity v , then this quantity of light — measured in the system ( ) — possesses the energy
where c denotes the velocity of light .
We shall make use of this result in what follows .
Let there be a stationary body in the system ( x , y , z ) , and let its energy — referred to the system ( x , y , z ) be E 0 .
Let the energy of the body relative to the system ( ) moving as above with the velocity v , be H 0 .
Let this body send out , in a direction making an angle with the axis of x , plane waves of light , of energy ½L measured relatively to ( x , y , z ) , and simultaneously an equal quantity of light in the opposite direction .
Meanwhile the body remains at rest with respect to the system ( x , y , z ) .
The principle of energy must apply to this process , and in fact ( by the principle of relativity ) with respect to both systems of co-ordinates .
If we call the energy of the body after the emission of light E 1 or H 1 respectively , measured relatively to the system ( x , y , z ) or ( ) respectively , then by employing the relation given above we obtain
By subtraction we obtain from these equations
The two differences of the form H − E occurring in this expression have simple physical significations .
H and E are energy values of the same body referred to two systems of co-ordinates which are in motion relatively to each other , the body being at rest in one of the two systems ( system ( x , y , z ) ) .
Thus it is clear that the difference H − E can differ from the kinetic energy K of the body , with respect to the other system ( ) , only by an additive constant C , which depends on the choice of the arbitrary additive constants of the energies H and E .
Thus we may place
since C does not change during the emission of light .
So we have
The kinetic energy of the body with respect to ( ) diminishes as a result of the emission of light , and the amount of diminution is independent of the properties of the body .
Moreover , the difference K 0 − K 1 , like the kinetic energy of the electron ( § 10 ) , depends on the velocity .
Neglecting magnitudes of fourth and higher orders we may place
From this equation it directly follows that : —
If a body gives off the energy L in the form of radiation , its mass diminishes by L/ c² .
The fact that the energy withdrawn from the body becomes energy of radiation evidently makes no difference , so that we are led to the more general conclusion that
The mass of a body is a measure of its energy - content ; if the energy changes by L , the mass changes in the same sense by L/9 × 1020 , the energy being measured in ergs , and the mass in grammes .
It is not impossible that with bodies whose energy - content is variable to a high degree ( e.g. with radium salts ) the theory may be successfully put to the test .
If the theory corresponds to the facts , radiation conveys inertia between the emitting and absorbing bodies .
Footnotes
The principle of the constancy of the velocity of light is of course contained in Maxwell 's equations .

Shoppers have also grown accustomed to looking for a little visual pop on aisle shelves as design has become a mainstream marketing tool —
Target stores in particular use that visual pop as a key advertising theme , for example .
Sameness carries a risk that a product will fade into the background .
“ Consumers are looking for what ’s new , ” said Kimberly Drosos , director for package development at Unilever North America , which recently changed the shape of its
Suave shampoo bottles for the first time in 25 years , and sells
Axe shower gel bottles shaped like video - game joysticks .
Ms. Drosos added : “ They say , ‘ What else do you have for me ?
That was nice last year , but I want the packaging to be refreshing . ’ ”
There are many other reasons behind the shift .
Some packaging changes are occurring because companies are trying to shrink container sizes and reduce their environmental impact , or because of new approaches for old products ( Orbit now sells gum in a bottle made to fit in a car ’s cup holder ) .
Some brands are bragging that their bottles of cleansers and other household products are attractive enough to be left out in plain view , rather than hidden in a closet or drawer .

“ It ’s an inexpensive way to really deliver that newness to people ’s homes , ” said Becky Walter , director for innovation design and testing at Kimberly - Clark , the maker of Kleenex , Huggies and other brands .
“ It ’s not like they have to go out and purchase new furniture . ”
Evian is among the marketers using packaging to add a sense of luxury to ordinary products — its new “ palace bottle ” water , for example , is being sold in restaurants and hotels .
The bottle has an elegant swanlike neck and sits on a small silver tray .
Technology is also driving the changes — like the thermochromatic ink in the Coors label that changes the color of the label ’s mountains with the temperature of the beer bottle .
The rumors of Java 5 being horribly broken beyond all usability on Leopard are , quite frankly , bullshit .
It 's faster , has better integration with the OS , the Aqua L&F is significantly improved , it has full support for 64 bit and a huge raft of bug fixes and miscellaneous improvements .
Everyone 's pointing to an uninformed rant on JavaLobby which as it's key example actually highlights a major improvement to the Aqua L&F – the JOptionPane icons should use the application icon , not some obscure artwork that 's not used anywhere else in the system .
The new dialogs actually allow you to look more like native app , not less .
It 's even explained in the release notes – heck , the old implementation was probably reported as a bug against Tiger .
Radar # 4858198 JOptionPanes did not match the native Mac OS X dialog appearance Description : Default info JOptionPanes now use the application 's icon , as per the Aqua User Interface Guidelines instead of a message bubble icon .
Warning and error JOptionPanes now show the application 's icon badged onto the warning or error icon as per the Aqua User Interface Guidelines .
Resolution :
This problem is now fixed in Mac OS X 10.5 .
The graphics pipeline has changed in Leopard which means that if you 've optimized for the Quartz renderer , you should specifically request it or you may find that suddenly things start going much slower .
In most cases the Sun 2D pipeline is faster than the Quartz pipeline – particularly if the code makes Windows specific performance assumptions ( most Java 2D code does whether the author knows it or not ) .
So while some applications may run slower by default , most applications run much faster and those that do run slow can switch back to the Quartz pipeline .
Change is n't always easy but it happens – stop whining and start coding .
You can complain that there 's no Java 6 yet ( though all those people complaining are n't getting anywhere with porting their own and there 's no excuses now ) , and you can complain about the lack of information but Java 5 on Leopard is a significant improvement and the engineers at Apple deserve to be congratulated for that – not insulted .
The image displayed above is a television screen shot taken from a news report aired on Martin Luther King Day in January 2007 by Corpus Christi , Texas , station KIII - TV :
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , January 2007 ]
This came with only a subject and a forward subject .
Seems like something that could have been photo - shopped .
Fwd :
Is this what MLK died for ?
Subject : I have a WHAT ?
The subject of this e-mail is : I have a WHAT ?
The body of the e-mail only says :
This was a cell phone camera picture , taken of the TV evening news in Corpus Christi , TX. recently .
A few of the local community members who had gathered that day to honor the memory of Dr. King carried signs displaying misspellings of the word “ dream , ” and neither the station ’s cameraman nor the segment ’s editor noticed that aspect of the video before the piece aired .
This image has also been circulated with text claiming that it originated not with a Martin Luther King Day event but rather with a rally promoting literacy , and the sign - bearers therefore deliberately misspelled the word “ DREAM ” as “ DRAEM ” and “ DERAM . ”
That explanation is incorrect .
The news director at KIII - TV , Richard Longoria , said of the attention this image has garnered :
Illegal visitors in Catch - 22 : Detained at airport , then sent back Illegal visitors find themselves in a Catch - 22
On the way out of U.S. , they 're being detained , then deported to their original flight destination
It seems counterintuitive .
The government pulls people suspected of being here illegally out of airplane lines and then pays to detain , prosecute and deport them to the country they were headed to in the first place .
Public defenders say it 's a colossal waste of time and taxpayer money .
" What 's silly about this is that they are on their way home .
They have gotten the message that they should n't be here , " said Houston 's Federal Public Defender Marjorie Meyers .
" It 's not cost - effective . "
Not true , says Houston 's U.S. Attorney Don DeGabrielle .
The people they are prosecuting are repeat violators of U.S. immigration laws and it's not only necessary , but also efficient , to stop them and prosecute them , he said .
" We had already expended some time , effort and money before to institute deportation , " DeGabrielle said .
To allow them to come back into the country without proper permission and then just let them leave would minimize what the government is trying to accomplish , he said .
" We feel it 's definitely worth the resources to hold these people accountable , " DeGabrielle said .
Question of a trend
It 's not the number of people who 've been detained and prosecuted that has public defenders most concerned .
The numbers have been relatively small .
But a trend could be developing : five cases since July , four in the past three months .
All five had been deported previously , had no criminal convictions and were stopped and detained by Customs and Border Protection officials at Bush Intercontinental Airport while trying to board planes to leave the country .
The four men and one woman were heading south — to Mexico , Honduras or El Salvador .
All were accused of the felony of re-entering the United States illegally after their prior deportation .
A felony record will make it difficult for them to ever get legal permission to come back to this country .
DeGabrielle said there is no new policy , and the cluster of people stopped while leaving the country , at least four of them just flying through Houston making a connection , is a coincidence .
His office is not convinced they were leaving the country for good , he said , since all have come back without permission before .
Costs add up
Generally , the suspects are detained first at the airport , then brought downtown into custody of the U.S. Marshals Service .
They then plead guilty to having entered the country illegally and are sentenced to time served , then deported at government expense , the lawyers involved said .
The biggest cost to taxpayers is the detention , which a Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman said averages $ 66.96 a day nationwide .
They are held for two to three months , so that cost would be roughly $ 4,000 to $ 6,000 .
Added to that is the cost of deportation — a bus trip to the border for Mexico , a plane ride for other countries .
And then there is a portion of the salaries of the government lawyers and the court personnel involved , plus court costs .
In the earliest case noticed by the public defenders in Houston in July , Freddy Navarro - Doblado was accompanied by a California police officer who had planned to take him all the way to Honduras .
Instead , Navarro - Doblado was taken into custody in Houston .
The other four cases were in December and January .
" It 's a Catch - 22 for these people .
They can't leave the country to make it right , " said Michael Herman , an assistant federal public defender who 's handling some of the cases .
" They are self - deporting , but they wind up in shackles and chains when these people have ... heeded the cry of the public for them to leave . "
One defendant was sentenced this month by U.S. District Judge Nancy Atlas .
On his way home
Hector Manuel Palafox - Acevedo , 29 , pleaded guilty to the felony of entering the United States without proper documentation and was sentenced to the two months he has already served in detention .
He will now be deported to Mexico , where he was heading when he was stopped as he tried to board a plane Dec. 12 .
Herman defended Palafox - Acevedo in court and said he was heading to his hometown on a one - way ticket to Mexico to get married to his fiancee , a U.S. citizen , and work to get proper papers to come back to the United States legally .
He said Palafox - Acevedo has been here since he was 14 , working as a machine operator and migrant worker and recently helping his fiancee raise her children .
Palafox - Acevedo , a slight man wearing detention center khakis , cried as he told the judge on Feb. 11 he would not come back to the United States again .
" The only thing I want is to go back , " Palafox - Acevedo told the judge tearfully through a court interpreter .
" I am afraid of going back to jail . "
But as prosecutor Bert Isaacs noted , Palafox - Acevedo has been deported without a felony conviction three times : in 2002 , 2006 and 2007 .
Isaacs asked the judge to hold Palafox - Acevedo longer while a full background check was done .
" I do n't know whether Mr. Palafox - Acevedo has gotten the message or not , " Isaacs told the judge , when asking for the maximum penalty of six months in prison , given all the sentencing factors in the case .
But the judge said it would not be a good use of resources to do a further background check since Palafox - Acevedo had already been vetted .
Kelly Klundt , a spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Washington , D.C. , said the agency checks passenger lists to find people who have broken the law , which has helped stop a child abduction and find large amounts of currency and drugs .
" We have an obligation and the authority to intercept them , " Klundt said .
She said she has n't been asked about these kinds of detentions and prosecutions anywhere but Houston , and that it is the prosecutors ' decision whether to see the cases through .

Environment Canada has “ muzzled ” its scientists , ordering them to refer all media queries to Ottawa where communications officers will help them respond with “ approved lines . ”
The new policy , which went into force in recent weeks and sent a chill through the department research divisions , is designed to control the department ’s media message and ensure there are no “ surprises ” for Environment Minister John Baird and senior management when they open the newspaper or turn on the television , according to documents obtained by Canwest News Service .
“ Just as we have ‘ one department , one website ' we should have ‘ one department , one voice , ' ” says a PowerPoint presentation from Environment Canada ’s executive management committee that ’s been sent to department staff .
It laments that there has been “ limited co-ordination of messages across the country ” and how “ interviews sometimes result in surprises to minister and senior management . ”
Environment Canada scientists , many of them world leaders in their fields , have long been encouraged to discuss their work on everything from migratory birds to melting Arctic ice with the media and public .
Several of them were co-authors of the United Nations report on climate change that won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize .
“ It ’s insulting , ” says one senior staff member , who asked not to be named .
She says researchers can no longer even discuss or confirm science facts without approval from the “ highest level . ”
Until now , Environment Canada has been one of most open and accessible departments in the federal government , which the executive committee says is a problem that needs to be remedied .
It says all media queries must now be routed through Ottawa where “ media relations will work with individual staff to decide how to best handle the call ; this could include :
Asking the program expert to respond with approved lines ; having media relations respond ; referring the call to the minister ’s office ; referring the call to another department , ” the presentation says .
Gregory Jack , acting director of Environment Canada ’s ministerial and executive services , says scientists and “ subject matter experts ” will still be made available to speak to the media “ on complex and technical issues . ”
He would not explain how “ approved lines ” are being written and who is approving them .
Jack said the policy is meant to bring Environment Canada in line with other federal departments , but insists “ there is no change in the access in terms of scientists being able to talk . ”
He says the intent of the new policy is to respond in a “ quick , accurate way that is consistent across Canada . ”
The reality , says insiders , is the policy is blocking communication and infuriating scientists .
Researchers have been told to refer all media queries to Ottawa .
The media office then asks reporters to submit their questions in writing .
Sources say researchers are then asked to respond in writing to the media office , which then sends the answers to senior management for approval .
If a researcher is eventually cleared to do an interview , he or she is instructed to stick to the “ approved lines . ”
Climatologist Andrew Weaver of the University of Victoria works closely with several Environment Canada scientists .
He says the policy points to the Conservative government ’s fixation with “ micro- management ” and message control .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Striking Hollywood writers will be back at their keyboards Wednesday after voting overwhelmingly to end a 100 - day walkout that essentially shut down the entertainment industry .
Writers Guild of America member Steven Binder shows his approval as he votes Tuesday in Beverly Hills , California .
More than 92 percent of the Writers Guild of America members who cast ballots Tuesday in Los Angeles and New York voted to end their work stoppage over residuals for writing in the digital age , including new media and the Internet .
The new deal is for three years .
" The strike is over .
Our membership has voted , and writers can go back to work , " said Patric Verrone , president of the WGA 's West chapter .
Michael Winship , president of WGA 's East guild , said , " The success of this strike is a significant achievement not only for ourselves but the entire creative community , now and in the future . "
WGA members walked off the job November 5 after talks broke down over how writers are paid for the use of their material on the Internet and DVDs , among other issues .
" It is not all that we hoped for , and it is not all we deserve , " Verrone said when a tentative deal was announced Saturday .

But he added , " This is the best deal this guild has bargained for in 30 years . "
Leslie Moonves , chief executive officer of CBS Corp. , told The Associated Press , " At the end of the day , everybody won .
" It was a fair deal and one that the companies can live with , and it recognizes the large contribution that writers have made to the industry . "
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers , which represents production companies and media conglomerates , has had no comment on the agreement .
The vote meant that the Academy Awards ceremony on February 24 will be the usual scripted gala , the AP reported .
" I am ecstatic that the 80th Academy Awards presentation can now proceed full steam ahead , " without " hesitation or discomfort " for the nominees , Sid Ganis , president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , which stages the Oscars , told the AP .
As long as the strike continued , the traditional Oscars spectacular was in doubt since many Hollywood stars would not cross WGA picket lines .
It 's unclear how soon new episodes of scripted programs will start appearing , because production wo n't begin until scripts are completed , the AP reported .
It will take at least four weeks for producers to get the first post - strike episodes of comedies back on the air ; dramas will take six to eight weeks , the AP said .
Verrone said the WGA achieved two of three goals through negotiations with the studios .
Watch Verrone explain what he thinks the strike accomplished »
The first goal relates to writers ' " jurisdiction " in new media , Verrone said , meaning that any content written by guild members specifically for new media , such as the Internet or cell phones , will be covered by their contract .
The second goal relates to reuse of content in new media , Verrone said .
The agreement bases payment for reuses on a distributor 's gross formula for residuals , " so that when they get paid , we get paid , " he said .
It is the " first time in our history that a new delivery system pays on a residual formula superior to the prior existing system , " Verrone said .
The third goal , which Verrone said the guild did not achieve , was to shore up writers ' shares of the revenue from animation and reality television .
" Giving up animation and reality was a heartbreaking thing for me personally , " he said .
" But it was more important that we make a deal that benefited the membership , the town as a whole , that got people back to work and that solved the biggest problems in new media . "

Text of the letter follows :
? Dear President Bush ,
? China ?s recent test of an anti-satellitemissile , destroying a satellite in low earth orbit , marks the commencement of anew era of military competition in space .
The dependency of American warfightingcapability , and the economy , on space assets compels our nation to take thenecessary steps to ensure our forces cannot be targeted through an adversarialspace strike .
? Space capabilities are integral to the daily execution ofvirtually every military campaign , operation , and exercise involving U.S. forces today .
Therefore , a review of Departmentof Defense programs intended to preserve American space assets iswarranted .
Further , new programs which provide protection , redundancy , andreconstitution of space assets should be essential .
? Mr. President , it is important that substantial efforts are made now to avoidtechnological surprise .

? Q: Should taxpayers continue to fund NASA , or should it move to the privatesector ??
?A : They should continue to fund these programs .
When we opened up our frontiers , the Lewis & Clark Expedition and so forth , those were not privately fundedmatters .
Our Founders considered exploring this great continent to be one ofthe important functions of government .
And we should as a community sustain ourcommitment to develop the great frontier [ of space ] for the sake of humanity , not just for our own sake .?
? Space exploration has a spiritual component which we may be losingsight of .
As a people we need continually to have before us the truth that ourpotential is best realized when we are challenging ourselves to reach for thosethings that transcend our everyday needs and desires and passions and commit usto the kind of endeavors that have importance not only for us , but for futuregenerations .
I think space exploration is one of those and I would support itstrongly .?

What is most remarkable about SpaceShipOne , of course , isthat it is the first privately - financed and privately built vehicle to leavethe Earth ?s atmosphere ?
? Theirsuccess should also be read as a cautionary tale for all of us in government .
If only the United States had a taxation policy that limited government andthereby freed up more private capital , there is no telling how many more likeBurt Rutan , Paul Allen , and Michael Melvill would be able to do great things tothe benefit all of mankind .
This not just in space exploration , but in medicalresearch , alternative energy research , and any number of the problems thatcontinue to perplex mankind .
Private enterprise depends on results and successand therefore private capital is always targeted much more wisely than ismonies confiscated by governments .?

Dear Mr Ross ,
I happen to have read your article recently “ Boycott of U.S Brands Affecting Economy . ”
As an Australian , I 'm one of those consumers you cite boycotting everything American , on moral grounds as a form of protest , as like most people here in Australia ( contrary to what you may hear ) we 're quite revulsed by the U.S , the people and its behaviour in the world now and for quite some time , decades indeed .
I myself am a reasonable sort of chap and I work in science and am a keen sporting enthusiast ( you would't happen to be a sailor by any chance would you ? ) , but Sir I can honestly say that here in Australia all my life , there has always been a strong undercurrent of anti American feeling here amongst the public .
Politicians dislike it , but are powerless to stop it .
However recent years have seen this anti American feeling come to the fore quite openly ( much to the chagrin of politicians here ) in reponse to the excesses of the U.S which have been to blatant to ignore .
So now anti-Americanism is ' de rigeur ' here with levels akin to sentiment in western Europe and is now the new standard for the Australian attitude toward the U.S .
The former Howard government paid the price of its hubris and not listening to the public and was voted out for thinking its extremist pro-Americanism was representative of the public mood .
Clearly they were wrong and paid the price , for this crude attempt of American dominionisation of Australia , which people here completely reject .
Thus to take your point on boycotts , yes I think you 're correct in your argument that a growing number of people like myself are alienated from the U.S and have simply altered our lives and choices to bypass the U.S completely .
More freedom for starters and the satisfaction of registering a protest too .
Most Australians have completely different sensibilities to the U.S anyway as we retain British and European heritage and outlook based on the continent .
Polls consistantly put Britain up in the high 80's percentile compared to the U.S which is about half that and near countries like Malaysia , etc.
I 'm also sceptical that the trend will reverse as we see the U.S as extremists far removed from the rest of the word and intent on world domination , no matter what their political stripe .
Even if the Democrats win the presidency , little will change as all Americans are seen as " extreme right wing nutters " ( no offence intended mate ) with little different in policy between Mr Bush or Mr Obama for instance .
U.S leadership of the world , etc and other platitudes are so frequently mentioned that the U.S forgets that people in the world resent being bullied , nagged and threatened as part of some self selected American " manifest destiny " fetish .
Thus its unlikely things will change and the boycott and opposition to the U.S will continue .
People are already organising to stop the U.S in other ways too .
As a scientist I ( along with others ) have pondered how to stop the U.S as its aggression shows no limits .
Once solution is a new defence system I and others have devised that bypasses current designs and renders U.S bombers , ships and aircraft carrier groups as vulnerable and as obsolete as the WW2 battleship .
Entirely new solution and it gives the defender the advantage for even small nations too with the ability to ( for instance ) sink aircraft carriers far away from their shores at minimal effort or risk .
Making U.S war machines more vulnerable so they can't be used , was the aim and has now been achieved here .
Just one manifestation of a natural response when a threat emerges , a countermeasure is bound to evolve , be it in nature or in human affairs .
Its bound to happen and the U.S only has itself to blame for its behaviour over the decades .
Other nations and scientists have thought of other ways too .
Still thats by the by with boycotts you rightfully suggest , definitely in place against the U.S and I predict that will continue too in future .
Thanks for your interesting article Mr. Ross , a good read and quite right in places .
Thanks for your time today and I wish you good health .
I hope I have n't caused you some dismay , but I mean no offence and my tone is quite measured and matter of fact .
Good health , Kevin Lindsay
SYDNEY , Australia , Sept. 7 — At the invitation of North Korea , an international delegation of nuclear experts from Russia , China and the United States will travel to the North next week to inspect nuclear sites that are to be shut down , the chief American envoy to the country said here on Friday .
The announcement , by Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill , came on a day when the North ’s nuclear ambitions dominated the sidelines of the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation forum here , creating an awkward and testy exchange between President Bush and President Roh Moo-hyun of South Korea over what would seem like a historical anachronism , the lack of a peace treaty ending the Korean War .
With Mr. Roh scheduled to go to Pyongyang to meet his North Korean counterpart , Kim Jong - il , next month , the South Korean leader used his photo opportunity with the president to make a public issue of the peace accord .
With television cameras rolling , and Mr. Bush by his side , Mr. Roh publicly pressed the American president to declare a formal end to the hostilities — something Mr. Bush has said he will not do until the North has completely scrapped its nuclear program .
“ I said it ’s up to Kim Jong - il , ” Mr. Bush said , looking irked , “ as to whether or not we ’re able to sign a peace treaty to end the Korean War .
He ’s got to get rid of his weapons in a verifiable fashion .
And we ’re making progress toward that goal .
It ’s up to him . ”
When the Colts ducked the AFC Championship Game with an indefensible choke job against San Diego , many die - hard Boston fans thought the same thing : Ralph Sampson .
Kevin McHale and the 1986 Celtics were denied that one final tussle with James Worthy and the Lakers .
After all , a heavily favored Lakers team pulled the same trick in the ' 86 Western Conference finals , allowing themselves to be " shocked " by the upstart Rockets -- with Sampson making the series - winning shot in Game 5 at Los Angeles -- to avoid what would have been a ritual beating by an unstoppable Celtics team .
Twenty - two years later , Indianapolis could n't beat the banged - up Chargers at home when the refs were handing the defending champs every call and Billy Volek and Norv Turner were prominently involved .
Did they want any part of the Patriots in Foxborough ?
Apparently not .
Look , I 'm not saying the '07 Colts or ' 86 Lakers openly chose to lose .
They just took the easy way out .
Subconsciously , they were probably thinking , " Deep down , we know we 're not winning the title this year , " and responded in crisis with the appropriate amount of urgency .
In the process , they cheated two unforgettable teams of punctuating unforgettable seasons by topping their natural rivals .
And that 's not where the similarities begin and end with the ' 86 Celtics and the '07 Patriots .
For the past few months , I 've been avoiding the inevitable " Dr. Jack breakdown " because the responsibility of choosing between the best Boston - area teams of my lifetime was too overwhelming .
But following the undeniable parallels between the Lakers - Rockets and Colts - Chargers outcomes , in the words of REO Speedwagon , I can't fight this feeling anymore .
( One crucial anti-jinxing note : So I do n't have to keep writing " assuming the Pats eventually win the Super Bowl " throughout the column , we 'll shorten that phrase to the acronym " ATPEWTSB . "
Got it ?
I do n't want to be blamed if this Patriots ' season somehow goes to hell .
This is a hypothetical analysis predicated on the realistic assumption that the Patriots , currently 1 - 3 favorites to win Super Bowl XLII and 14 - point favorites in the AFC title game , will win two more games .
Which seems fairly likely .
You have to admit . )
All right , let 's break this baby down , Dr. Jack style
Matthew Emmons-US PRESSWIRE
It 's hard to imagine any quarterback playing better than Tom Brady has this season .
MOST VALUABLE PLAYER
Tom Brady submitted the best regular season in quarterbacking history ( 4,804 yards , 50 touchdowns , eight picks and a 117 QB rating ) and came within a Wes Welker drop and an uncalled interference penalty away from completingagainst the Jaguars in the AFC divisional playoffs .
Meanwhile , Larry Bird cruised to his third straight MVP award in ' 86 , averaged a 26 - 9 - 8 for the playoffs and created the 90 - 50 - 40 Playoff Club ( 90 percent from the line , 50 percent from the field , 40 percent from 3 - point range ) .
The phrase " peak of his powers " applies to both guys , and both were true leaders who connected with teammates on a supernatural level -- Brady and his receivers with their uncanny ability to freelance at the line of scrimmage , Bird and his teammates with their unselfish passing .
So this one comes down to degrees .
They were / are equally good in the clutch , so that category gets thrown out .
Larry Legend gets a point because he had a cool nickname ( actually , he had three nicknames if you count " The Hick from French Link " and " The Basketball Jesus " ) ; poor Brady does n't have a single nickname other than the obscenities Bridget Moynihan mutters every time she flips through US Weekly and sees him with Gisele .
Brady gets a point because he dominated throughout the ' 07 season ( save for a couple of cold - weather games ) , whereas Bird battled a sore back for three months and did n't get rolling until February .
Bird gets a point because there was a genuine reverence for the Legend in the mid-80s that Brady has n't totally matched for whatever reason .
Locally , they 're adored the same , although Bird 's spiritual connection with the raucous Boston Garden fans easily transcended Brady 's connection with Gillette Stadium .
Here 's the trump card : I can't imagine any professional athlete executing his job better than Brady did through these first 17 games :
He made the single toughest position in sports look easy , and every time the Patriots needed him to come through , he did come through .
On top of that , he excelled during an unhealthy era in which we digest sports through various mediums , argue about them constantly and pick athletes and coaches apart on a 24/7 basis .
As Tony Romo showed over the past few weeks , many of these " superstars " can't handle it .
But Brady 's unwavering focus and complete command at all times stood out more than any statistic , especially given the level of public interest in both Brady and this particular Patriots team .
I just do n't think we 'll ever see another season quite like it -- and the undefeated record backs that up -- whereas we 've seen multiple basketball efforts that compared to Bird 's work in ' 86 ( and in some cases , even surpassed it ) .
Throw in Gisele and this was surprisingly easy ( ATPEWTSB ) .
( Ducking lightning bolt . )

FLAW THAT HELD THEM BACK HISTORICALLY
Quite simply , the ' 86 Celtics ( 67 - 15 ) got bored at times ; you could catch them on the right night if they were tired or not paying attention .
Eleven of their 15 regular - season losses were to sub -.500 teams ( including the 23 - win Knicks , 26 - win Pacers and 29 - win Cavs ) , but they finished 19 - 2 against 50 - win teams .
These guys should have cracked the 70 - win barrier and even admit as much now .
As for the Patriots , you 'd have to go with their coach costing them a first - round pick by breaking the rules in Week 1 .
If a 19 - 0 season is like building the perfect Ferrari , then SpyGate would be a noticeable 7 - inch scratch on the passenger 's door that can't come off no matter how many times you polish it .
And every time someone gets in the car , no matter how gorgeous it is and how fast it goes , they 'll always ask you , " How 'd you get that scratch ? "
That 's just the way it is .

Few athletes have ever fed off the energy of the home crowd like Larry Bird .
BIGGEST WEAKNESS
Thanks to an inordinate number of goofy white guys , the Celtics struggledagainst athletic teams that loved to run , like the Blazers .
This was n't an ongoing issue and surfaced only if they were tired or bored ( see above ) .
The Pats ' weakness is much more glaring -- they 're slow at linebacker , something that has been exploited for pieces of games but never for four straight quarters .
And let 's hope it stays that way .
In fact , I do n't even want to talk about it .
( While we 're here , each team also had " overrated " weaknesses :
The Pats have a " shaky " running game and the ' 86 Celts had " shaky " outside shooting from their guards .
In the case of the Celts , people were just picking nits .
In the case of the Pats , ATPEWTSB , everyone was just picking nits . )
Edge : Celtics
DEFINING POST -VICTORY TRADITION
For the Patriots , it 's Bill Belichick 's handshake with the opposing coach that I described two months ago like this : " He has the same satisfied smirk on his face that someone has when they 're meeting the boyfriend of a kinky ex-girlfriend , like he 's particularly delighted to make eye contact for that split - second as they 're shaking hands . "
Meanwhile , the Celtics had Kevin McHale holding up his gangly arms and displaying his hairy , sweaty armpits for everyone to see .
I do n't know , I 've always been partial to the ' pits .
Slight Edge : Celtics .
Bill Walton will always have a special spot in the hearts of Celtics fans .
PRIZE ADDITION
Both Randy Moss and Bill Walton were considered on the downside of their careers , both were rescued from bad teams , and both transformed their teams from " really good " to " great . "
Statistically , Moss crushes Walton in every respect ; his ability to stretch defenses , draw double - teams and provide a home - run threat for Brady dwarfs anything Walton did for the Celts .
So this should n't be close .
Still , Walton 's undeniable contributions remind me why I despise the increasing reliance on complicated statistics for basketball judgments :
That season , he only averaged 20 minutes , 7.6 points , 6.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists -- not breathtaking numbers by any imagination -- and yet , you had to be there to witness his infectious and sorely needed enthusiasm , the otherworldly way he and Bird freelanced together on pick - and - rolls , the way the Garden crowd responded to him , and how Walton 's minutes allowed Bird , McHale and Parish to stay fresh AND keep the team playing at a high level .
For one season , the Celtics were fortunate enough to have a completely overqualified sixth man , almost like the " Sopranos " bringing in Leo DiCaprio to play Meadow 's boyfriend for Season 4 .
Walton also made the single biggest play of that entire season , a crunch - time putback in Game 4 of the Finals that effectively clinched the title .
We 'll see if Moss has a moment in these final two games that matches that one .
With that said , the neatest thing about the Walton / Moss parallel is how they pushed the careers of Bird / Brady to another level .
Nothing was more exciting this season than seeing Brady take seven steps back , plant his feet and heave the football as far as he possibly could to Moss , and if you were a true basketball fan , there was nothing like watching Bird and Walton run pick - and - rolls and give - and - gos like they 'd known each other for 30 years .
What a cool category .
I feel honored just to be writing this section .

DEFINING FACIAL HAIR
For the Pats , it 's a toss - up between Wes Welker 's porn ' stache and the Dan Haggerty beards grown by the offensive linemen every year .
But even if you teamed those two looks together , they could n't match the unbeatable combination of the Legend 's blonde afro-mullet and wispy blonde mustache .
Anytime someone can take eight lip hairs and make magic with them , you have to tip your hat .
Edge : Celtics
SIDEKICK FOR MVP
Since there are four times as many guys on a football team , we 're using two receivers ( Moss and Welker ) for Brady and Kevin McHale for Bird .
Anyway , McHale played power forward as efficiently as that position has ever been played -- he scored on everyone and commanded double - and triple - teams , defended everyone from Adrian Dantley to Kareem , shot a ludicrous 60 percent from the field and averaged a 26/10 every night , and could play any conceivable style of basketball .
On top of that , his array of remarkable low post moves has n't been seen since ; there was a genuine art to what he was doing on the block , and I 'm not sure you could say that about many athletes over the past 25 years .
He was a human YouTube clip .
And McHale helped Bird immensely by stretching the floor , reducing the scoring burden , carrying the offense when Bird was resting , defending the other team 's best forward and never caring about getting credit or being " The Man . "
The Moss / Welker combo had a similar effect for Brady : Moss was the perfect deep threat for him and Welker was the perfect slot guy .
It 's hard to imagine any Hall of Fame power forward fitting in more perfectly with the ' 86 Celts ( with the " possible " exception of the ' 03 Tim Duncan ) , and it's hard to imagine a better longball / possession combo than Moss / Welker for this particular Pats team .
If you had the power to retroactively switch one of them for any other NFL receiver this season , would you even bother ?
Probably not .
Everyone wins in this category .

DEFINING REGULAR -SEASON GAME
Could you narrow it down to one for the Pats ?
I do n't think you can -- at gunpoint , I 'd go with the Giants game , but you could make strong cases for four or five other ones .
As for the Celtics , one definitely stands out : A January comeback win when the Hawks raced to a 27 - point lead at home and made the unforgivable mistake of talking trash right before halftime , leading to a ferociously ticked - off Boston team roaring back , scoring 14 straight in the fourth quarter and eventually winning in OT .
I have this one on tape -- in the second half , the entire Celtics team morphs into Clint Eastwood during the final 15 minutes of " Unforgiven . "
It 's incredible to watch .
This game should run on ESPN Classic once a week .

The Pats can't top that one unless they beat the Chargers 56 - 0 and force Tomlinson , Rivers and Norv to cry at the exact same time on the sidelines .
Anything less and they lose this category .

When he got bored , Bird would spend an entire game just shooting with his left hand .
MOST ENDEARING TRAIT
Both teams were so confident , they actually screwed around during games -- like the game in Miami when Brady apparently decided , " I want to see how many Dolphins can cover Moss deep at the same time when he 's catching a bomb in traffic , " or the West Coast trip when Bird got bored and decided he'd only shoot with his left hand for the Portland game .
The Celtics get the edge because they experimented throughout the season , whereas the Patriots slowed down in this department by Thanksgiving .
( Note : Even in the playoffs , the Celtics messed around .
For instance , in the Houston series , Bird became enamored with a play in which they isolated him on the right side and he slowly backed Rodney McCray down .
If the double - team came , he found the cutter for the layup .
If no double - team came , he abused McCray .
And it just kept happening and happening , especially in Game 6 , when Bird looked like a cat toying with a mouse and even split a triple team for one driving layup .
We 've seen NBA teams dominate before , but Bird experimented like Dr. Moreau that season -- he was doing everything short of breeding McHale and Walton . )

HATEABILITY
Do n't sleep on the Celtics here .
The two biggest markets in the country loathed them ( New York and Los Angeles ) , three other major cities ( Philly , Detroit and Atlanta ) loathed them , Spike Lee took some pointed shots at the Legend in " She 's Gotta Have It , " and it 's safe to say they were black America 's least - favorite NBA team ( as J.A. Adande detailed recently in an ESPN.com column ) .
Also , every non-Celtics fan truly detested Danny Ainge at the time -- he ranked only behind Bill Laimbeer as the most despised NBA player of the ' 80s .
But considering a Packers - Pats Super Bowl would galvanize America behind one team like nothing we 've seen since " USA 4 , USSR 3 , " I think the Pats have this category locked up .

PLUSH DRAFT PICK HELD FOR FUTURE DOMINATION
The ' 86 Celts owned Seattle 's No. 1 thanks to an earlier trade , so we rooted for the Sonics to tank all season , and they eventually handed over the No. 2 pick ( Lenny Bias ) .
The '07 Pats owned San Fran 's No. 1 thanks to an earlier trade , so we rooted for the Niners to tank all season and they eventually handed over the No. 7 pick ( to be named ) .
I recommend we keep New England 's first - round pick under 24 - hour , round - the - clock surveillance for the entire spring and summer just to be safe .
Edge : ( Shaking my head sadly . )
UNSUNG SIDEKICK
Robert Parish did all the little stuff : set the best picks , protected the rim , played hurt and never cared about his own numbers .
We loved him for it , called him " The Chief " and yelled his nickname every time he did something good .
But at no point in his career was The Chief better than New England 's offensive line this season : not only did the line handle every quality defense in the league except for Green Bay 's ( and that might be coming in two weeks ) , during the past two months , it protected Brady against a bunch of fired - up defenses that did everything but draw a bull 's - eye on Brady 's jersey .
Throw in the Dan Haggerty beards and it's no contest .

SUPPORTING MONEY GUYS
Dennis Johnson was the NBA 's best money guard for 10 years and deserves to be in the Hall of Fame .
( I pleaded his case last year when he died at age 52 ) .
For the Patriots , we 'll team Mike Vrabel , Rodney Harrison and Tedy Bruschi together because they 're the " money guys " for the Pats ' defense -- like DJ , one of them always seems to make a big play when the team needs it .
I have nothing but praise for Vrabel and Bruschi , but Harrison disgraced the franchise with his HGH suspension and slightly tainted a few of this season 's games with cheap shots , late hits , dumb penalties and generally irrational behavior .
For Pats fans , he 's like dealing with a family member who says and does dumb things at every holiday dinner -- maybe you do n't hold those things against him because he 's family , but you always find yourself complaining about him when he 's not in the room .
Anyway , DJ was a good guy who never cheated or resorted to cheap shots , and you never had to worry about him imploding at the wrong time and potentially costing you a victory with a hotheaded mistake .
Even if Harrison has a DJ - like knack for making big plays at the best possible times , that 's where the similarities end .
DJ 's teammates loved him and his opponents always respected him .
You can't say the same about Rodney Harrison .

ARTFULNESS WITH THE SALARY CAP

When these guys played in the Garden , they usually had a lot of time to sit back and joke .
HOME CROWD
Almost as big of a mismatch as Belichick - Jones , only the other way :
The ' 86 Celtics had one of the most significant home - court advantages in sports history , finishing 50 - 1 at home ( including the playoffs ) and breaking records for " Most times a group of fans recognized that a great pass was about to happen even before it happened , " and " Most times a crowd has ever lifted a team from one level to another . "
( If you ever want to see how a home crowd can affect a game , watch Game 6 of the ' 86 Finals when it's on ESPN Classic some time , and pay special attention to the completely terrified look on Sampson 's face . )
I know I sound like Bill Brasky whenever the topic is the ' 86 Celtics , but seriously ... 50 - 1 at home ?
We 'll see another 19-0 NFL team before we see another NBA team go 50 - 1 at home .
As for the Patriots , they built a beautiful stadium that provides no real home - field advantage because the noise drifts up and out -- operating almost like an anti-Dome -- leading to the bizarre outcome of longtime season - ticket holders ( as described by my buddy J - Bug in last week 's B.S. Report ) openly pining for the old stadium even though the old stadium was a complete dump with aluminum rows for seats .
Bizarre .

LOCAL LOVE FOR THE TEAM
ATPEWTSB , the Pats have a built - in advantage for the simple reason that football is more popular than basketball .
On top of that , when the Patriots were vilified nationally after SpyGate , that made Patriots fans more attached to the team and the season became about something else .
Everyone loved the ' 86 Celtics , but this Patriots season has been different -- it 's a much more personal experience as a fan , something that can't fully be explained .
When you 're rooting for a team that everyone is rooting against , it 's almost debilitating .
I 'm not kidding .
I need a vacation after this season .

QUIRKIEST WRINKLE
For the Pats , it 's the fact they finished 16 - 0 even though they were basically running Warren Moon 's old run-and - shoot offense for the past 10 weeks .
( I did n't even realize this until stumbling across highlights of an old Oilers game and realizing their offense looked familiar . )
For the Celtics , they'd throw out a lineup from time to time that could have just been called " Springfield " -- Parish at center , Walton and McHale at forward , Bird at 2 - guard and Dennis Johnson at point -- which somehow worked because McHale could guard 2 - guards on the other end , and offensively , they 'd just crash the boards and find mismatches on every possession .
Insane .
But that was n't even their quirkiest wrinkle because they were the last NBA title team that could throw out a legitimate Whitewash : Bird , McHale , Walton , Ainge and Jerry Sichting , with Scott Wedman as the sixth man .
And you wondered why Ed Norton loved the Celtics so much in " American History X . "

CAPACITY TO SHAME BIGGEST RIVAL INTO SUBCONSCIOUSLY GIVING UP BEFORE THE DAY OF RECKONING
Rockets - Lakers was an enormous upset , but not totally :
The ' 86 Lakers were a subpar rebounding team and an aging Kareem was too much of a ninny to deal with the young legs of Sampson and Hakeem .
So it was a semi- defensible upset until the series - clinching game , when Hakeem got thrown out for fighting and the Lakers still managed to choke at home .
Really , that 's how a defending champ should go out ?
Come on .
As for the Chargers - Colts game , even though San Diego showed an immense amount of heart and Norv Turner 's play calling was so good that he nearly caught fire on the sidelines at one point like an " NBA Jam " character , you can't say enough about that gag job by the defending champs .
What a disgrace .
Part of winning a title is defending the title after you win it and that was n't anything remotely resembling a defense .

UNINTENTIONAL COMEDY
I 'm not saying the ' 86 Celtics were an ugly team , but after they won the title , they celebrated at the " Star Wars " bar .
For historical purposes , only the 2002 Kings , 1987 Bucks , 2000 Hornets and 1984 Knicks could hang with them in the looks department .
Still , does that surpass the ongoing comedy of a slightly dazed Robert Kraft reacting to big plays in the owner 's box or babbling during victory celebrations ?
For some inexplicable reason , the ongoing success of the Pats has turned him into Gary Busey .
I can't get enough of him .

CONFIDENCE OF THE FAN BASE HEADING INTO THE PLAYOFFS
Hard to believe , but it was higher for the ' 86 Celts .
When the Colts blew it last week , some New England fans ( including my dad ) were actually rooting for the Chargers because it was an easier game .
When the Lakers lost to the Rockets , NOBODY was rooting for Houston .
We all felt cheated .
I 'm still bitter , actually .

That was always my favorite Eff - You sports moment until SpyGate happened and the Pats made the Eff - You Touchdown a tradition for two solid months , leading to me writing an entire Eff - You column in October .

MY DAD'S TAKE
With the Celtics holding a slim 12 - 10 lead , I phoned my father to get his grizzled take for the deciding verdict .
Here 's a rough transcript of our conversation :
Dad : " Oh , Gawd .
Come on .
[ Thinking . ]
You know , I 'd have to go with the ' 86 Celtics .
That 's my favorite team ever .
I can't imagine ever liking a team more than I liked that team .
[ Thinking . ]
Although maybe that 's because I went to all those games so I 'm more attached to them .
[ Thinking . ]
And the Pats are definitely more popular here because more people like football in general .
[ Thinking . ]
On the other hand , I felt more of a connection to that Celtics team because there were so many more games , and the guys were right there on the court , you felt like you knew them more .
And they did n't cheat like the Pats did .
[ Thinking . ]
But if the Pats finish the season undefeated , I mean [ Thinking . ]
Wait , why did n't you wait until after the Super Bowl to figure this out ? "
Me : " Trust me , I 'm going to take great pains to qualify that the comparison can't take full effect until after the Super Bowl .
Besides , it 's a relevant conversation , right ? "
Dad : " I guess .
[ Thinking . ]
I have to go with the ' 86 Celtics .
There was no way we were losing that season .
Nobody could beat us in the Garden .
With the Pats , our defense makes me nervous and nothing made me nervous during that Celtics season .
Then again , if the Pats go 19 - 0 [ thinking ] you know , I can't believe you 're doing this before the last two games !
Why are you doing this again ?
This is the dumbest thing you 've ever done -- it 's even dumber than the time your car got stolen because you left your keys in your car door .
Ca n't you wait three weeks ?

Like many Americans my age , I grew up with a positive association to fluoride .
Toothpaste commercials told me that fluoride helped prevent tooth decay and that I should brush my teeth with fluoride toothpaste , so I used it every day .
The dentist gave me fluoride treatments for my teeth .
Fluoride was also added to municipal water supplies , so drinking tap water ( and anything made with it ) gave me a daily dose of fluoride too .
Like most other people , I assumed it must be healthy .
Otherwise , why would people add it to toothpaste and water ?
Many years ago though , I started hearing rumors about fluoride being potentially unhealthy .
I realized I ’d never looked into fluoride and did n’t really even know what it was and why I should be consuming it .
I had to admit that all my knowledge of fluoride ultimately came from the people who were marketing it .
People market plenty of other products that are n’t healthy ( cigarettes , junk food , etc. ) , so why should I assume fluoride was healthy just because the marketers said it was ?
So way back in 1997 , I got curious and started taking a deeper look into fluoride .
Today this is very easy to do because there ’s plenty of info available online .
I ’ll share some of that info with you and provide some links so you can look into it further if you so choose .
My goal is to help you consciously decide whether you wish to continue using fluoride .
What is fluoride ?
The substance fluoride is technically a fluorine ion .
Fluorine is a gas , and in nature it will be found bonded with other substances , forming compounds such as calcium fluoride .
Fluoride is a naturally occurring substance found abundantly in the earth ’s crust .
Consequently , it is found in natural water supplies , usually in very low levels ( well below 1 part per million ) .
Plants naturally absorb fluoride from the soil , so small amounts of fluoride compounds are present in all our food .
Fluoride is also commonly used in pesticides , so plant foods grown with pesticides will have a higher concentration of fluoride .
The highest dietary concentration of fluoride occurs in animal foods and in processed foods , especially fish .
Fluoride builds up in the tissues of animals .
And whenever fluoridated water is used in food production , fluoride will be concentrated in the final product .
The same goes for cooking with fluoridated water .
Although it is a natural substance , fluoride is highly toxic to human beings , even more so than lead .
If you were to ingest a mere 2 - 5 grams of sodium fluoride ( a common ingredient in toothpaste ) , you would probably die .
The amount of fluoride in a typical tube of fluoride toothpaste is sufficient to kill a small child if it were consumed all at once .
Fluoride toothpaste contains a much higher concentration of fluoride than what is found in nature .
In the USA the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) regulates fluoride usage .
Is fluoride necessary for health ?
Not remotely .
Unlike calcium or magnesium , fluoride is not an essential nutrient for your body .
If you were to consume zero fluoride your entire life , you would n’t suffer for it .
There ’s no such thing as fluoride deficiency .
What is fluoride ’s purported role in tooth decay ?
Fluoride acts as an enzyme inhibitor .
For this reason it is believed to help prevent cavities by literally poisoning the bacteria in your mouth .
Unfortunately , because fluoride is so toxic , you ’re taking a big risk by using it to try to prevent cavities .
You not only poison the bacteria in your mouth but your other cells as well .
“ Fluoride inhibits enzymes that breed acid- producing oral bacteria whose acid eats away tooth enamel .
This observation is valid , but some scientists now believe that the harmful impact of fluoride on other useful enzymes far outweighs the beneficial effect on caries prevention . ”
– UNICEF , Dec 1999
Fluoride only works topically .
If you swallow fluoride , it wo n’t help your teeth at all except to the extent it touches them .
So fluoride supplements are utterly worthless .
What are the risks of fluoride consumption ?
Aside from the risk of death , fluoride can cause serious problems even at low levels of ingestion that come from using toothpaste or mouthwash or drinking fluoridated water .
One risk is a condition known as fluorosis , caused by excessive exposure to fluoride .
This comes in two kinds : dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis .
Dental fluorosis occurs at a young age , and the main symptom is discolored and / or pitted teeth , but the outward signs on the teeth are believed to be linked with a deeper neurological impairment .
Skeletal fluorosis is an arthritic disease caused by a build - up of fluoride in the bones that can cause the bones to become brittle .
Studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association noted that hip fractures are more common in communities that fluoridate their water supply .
Drinking fluoridated water is linked with reduced cognitive ability in children .
There are also over 30 animal studies showing that fluoride is a neurotoxin which reduces learning and memory .
Essentially , fluoride makes you a bit less intelligent .
If you wish to look into this further , you can find a lengthy list of health problems associated with fluoride and links to some of the research here :
Fluoride Health Effects Database
There are many more health problems than the few I ’ve listed above , including kidney damage and cancer .
Fluoride problems are an active area of research .
A lot of new information has come out in just the past decade .
Why did people start adding fluoride to toothpaste and water ?
You do n’t want to know .
Really you do n’t .
But if you do , you can start by reading these articles :
Industry and Fluoridation
Fluoride , Teeth , and the Atomic Bomb
And if you really want to hurt yourself , you can read all about the fluoride fraud here :
Suppression of Scientific Dissent on Fluoride ’s Risks and Benefits
If you do n’t want to read the above , the bottom line is that fluoride is an industrial pollutant which became a serious problem several decades ago , and this problem was essentially solved by devising ways to feed the stuff to humans .
Today it ’s become a difficult issue that involves big business , large sums of money , the ADA , the FDA , and somewhere near the bottom of the political food chain … health .
What about water fluoridation ?
Water fluoridation is common practice in the USA .
About 60 % of the U.S. water supply is now fluoridated .
My city of Las Vegas started fluoridating its water supply a few years ago ( in what was apparently something of a political fiasco ) .
The last time I checked , water fluoridation was banned in Japan , China , India , and most European countries .
What ’s interesting though is that in Europe the levels of tooth decay are no worse than in the USA .
In both the U.S. and Europe , the levels of tooth decay have been falling at about the same rate for decades .
Fortunately for non-U.S. residents , the politics of fluoride which have infected the U.S. have not similarly infected the rest of world .
The theoretical reason for water fluoridation is that it supposedly helps prevent tooth decay .
The problem , however , is that the theory just does n’t hold true .
There ’s no evidence that water fluoridation helps prevent tooth decay at all .
The evidence in fact shows that fluoridation has no effect whatsoever on tooth decay , but fluoridation does cause other health problems such as fluorosis .
“ All of the recent large - scale studies on fluoridation and tooth decay show that fluoridation does not reduce tooth decay .
Studies from New Zealand , Canada , Europe , and the US have confirmed no difference in decay rates for permanent teeth of residents of fluoridated vs. non-fluoridated communities . ” ( source )
“ In summary , we hold that fluoridation is an unreasonable risk .
That is , the toxicity of fluoride is so great and the purported benefits associated with it are so small – if there are any at all – that requiring every man , woman and child in America to ingest it borders on criminal behavior on the part of governments . ”
– Dr. J. William Hirzy , Senior Vice - President , Headquarters Union , US Environmental Protection Agency , March 26 , 2001
“ I am quite convinced that water fluoridation , in a not - too - distant future , will be consigned to medical history . ”
– Dr. Arvid Carlsson , Winner of the 2000 Nobel Prize for Medicine
So what are the health reasons for water fluoridation ?
There are n’t any .
The real reason for fluoridation is a combination of business and politics .
The health claims are largely used to draw attention away from the real reason .
In the USA it is n’t so hard to get fluoridation policies passed in new cities simply by leveraging the previous marketing work that has been done in favor of fluoride .
Communities will vote in favor of fluoridation because most of the people doing the voting do n’t know any better .
People will emotionally defend something as true which deep down they never understood .
What about bottled water ?
It depends on the source .
Most water from natural springs will have on the order of 0.1 ppm fluoride , which is about 10 % of the level found in fluoridated municipal water supplies .
So with bottled water your exposure to this toxin is greatly reduced .
Be aware that some bottled water delivery companies do fluoridate their water .
I called two of them to ask : Sparkletts and Arrowhead .
Sparkletts told me they do fluoridate their water .
Of course I let them know that I would never be a customer of theirs as long as they do so .
Arrowhead told me they do NOT deliver fluoridated water unless the customer specifically requests it .
Consequently , I have been an Arrowhead customer for many years .
If I find out that they ’ve started fluoridating their water , they will lose my family as a customer .
If you want to know whether or not your water contains fluoride , call the company and ask them how much fluoride is in their water and whether or not they add fluoride to it .
They will be able to tell you how many parts per million of fluoride their water contains .
One fluoride - related web site suggested specifically avoiding Trinity Springs water because it contains a very high concentration of fluoride , on the order of 4 ppm .
That ’s about 4 x the level you ’ll get from fluoridated tap water .
You can also use a water filter to reduce fluoride from tap water .
In this case you will need a reverse - osmosis filter , which will remove 90 % + of the fluoride .
Distillation will also remove fluoride from water .
Is there such a thing as non-fluoride toothpaste ?
Yes , absolutely .
Fluoride is not the ingredient in toothpaste that cleans your teeth .
It is the abrasive calcium carbonate that does most of the cleaning .
Fluoride ’s only role is to poison the bacteria ( and of course the rest of you gets poisoned in the process ) .
Additionally , commercial toothpastes often contain sweeteners that can actually promote tooth decay .
I can recommend a couple brands of fluoride - free toothpaste which I ’ve been using for years : Nature ’s Gate and Tom ’s of Maine .
You should be able to find these at any health food store .
I buy them at Whole Foods and Wild Oats .
My personal favorite is Nature ’s Gate Herbal Creme de Peppermint .
My wife prefers Tom ’s of Maine .
Tom ’s of Maine also has children ’s fluoride - free toothpaste available , which our 5 - year old daughter uses .
Both of these companies are cruelty - free as well , meaning they do n’t test any of their products on animals .
These toothpastes are made from all - natural ingredients , and they do n’t contain extra sweeteners .
One thing I like about Tom ’s of Maine is that they list all the ingredients on the box along with a description of what each thing is and why it ’s there .
Because of the lack of sugar , it may take you a few days to get used to these toothpastes .
But after that you ’ll never look back .
What about dentists ?
I challenge you to ask your own dentist for detailed information on fluoride .
Test his / her knowledge of this subject , and see if the answers you get make you more confident or more doubtful .
Ask your dentist to tell you exactly what fluoride is and what the lethal dosage is .
Ask your dentist where the fluoride in their toothpaste and fluoride treatments originally comes from ( trust me — you really do n’t want to know ) .
Ask your dentist how s/he came to believe that fluoride helps prevent tooth decay .
Ask your dentist to tell you about the dangers of fluoride exposure .
Ask your dentist to tell you where you can obtain the proof that fluoride usage is safe and effective .
Would n’t you expect your dentist to know this information ?
Personally I have never met a dentist who knew even the most basic facts about fluoride .
Dentists apparently learn about fluoride from the same people that market it to consumers .
Most likely your dentist does n’t know much more about fluoride than you do aside from the information that ’s been provided to them by marketers .
In fact , simply by reading this article , you probably know a lot more about fluoride than your dentist does , unless your dentist happens to be exceptional .
What should you do ?
I think you should look into this for yourself and make your own conscious decision .
Look beyond the fluoride marketing hype and decide if fluoride is something you want to put into your body on a regular basis .
Common sense suggests that you should n’t ingest such a toxic substance unless you fully understand what you ’re doing .
Remember that you have no dietary need for fluoride , so if you have any doubt , leave it out .
In my opinion that ’s the safest bet .
Fluoride is not addictive , so I think you ’ll find it easy to do without .
You may even notice some health benefits in doing so .
Who knows ?
Maybe your IQ will even go up a few points — that effect is certainly conceivable given that fluoride is a neurotoxin and has been linked to reduced IQ in children .
At the very least , doctors recommend not using fluoridated water to make infant formula .
Do n’t give young children any fluoridated water if you can avoid it .
Fluoride ’s toxicity is relative to body mass .
So the smaller the person , the more toxic a particular dose will be .
Consider nature ’s example — the level of fluoride found in human breast milk is about 100 times lower than in fluoridated water ( i.e. 0.01 ppm vs. 1.0 ppm ) .
My viewpoint is that if you want to convince me to ingest a toxic substance on a regular basis , the burden of proof is all yours .
By default I ’m not going to take poison , so if you ca n’t provide rock - solid evidence that your substance is worth consuming , you wo n’t convince me .
And fluoride is a substance where the mountain of evidence has convinced me I ’m better off without it .
You do n’t need to poison yourself just to try to prevent cavities .
I hope you can begin to see the insanity in that approach .
If you have excessive bacteria eating away your tooth enamel , realize that it ’s a sign of a greater imbalance in your body .
Do n’t try to correct the imbalance by poisoning the symptoms ( i.e. the bacterial growth ) .
Address the root cause .
By reducing the acidity of your diet , you can safely prevent your teeth from dissolving .
Especially cut out refined sugar and coffee if you can , and eat more raw fruits and vegetables .
If you are n’t going to change your diet , at least acknowledge that tooth decay is not the worst health problem in the world .
Even if you do get cavities , it ’s a fixable problem , and in my opinion , it ’s not worth taking poison to try to prevent one problem and cause yourself far greater grief in the long run .
You might miss your teeth , but I think you ’ll miss your brain , bones , and kidneys even more .
I want to look into this further .
Hook me up .
First , you can start with a simple Google search on fluoride or on such terms as “ fluoride toxic poison ” ( without the quotes ) , and you ’ll find plenty of sites to look through .
Here are a couple of my favorite fluoride sites with loads of articles , information , and research references :
The Fluoride Debate
Fluoride Action Network
At the very least , I recommend you read the home page of The Fluoride Debate site to give yourself a nice overview .
But you will certainly learn a lot by diving deeply into both of these sites .
There are also some books on the subject ( you can find both at Amazon ) :
The Fluoride Deception by Christopher Bryson and Theo Colborn
Fluoride : Drinking Ourselves to Death by Barry Groves
I just ca n’t believe any of this .
It ’s too unbelievable .
I ’m sorry to be the one to shatter your blissful fluoride fantasy .
Really , I am .
I know you ’ll probably curse me the next time you pick up your toothpaste and see a tube of IQ - lowering poison instead of sugary cavity - fighting bliss .
I ’m just the messenger though .
I did n’t invent any of this information .
And my goal is n’t to convince you not to use fluoride .
My goal is far more insidious — it is to encourage you to think for yourself and make decisions more consciously , whether you agree with me or not .
CONGRATULATIONS ON SELECTING SEAT 21C !
This manual is intended to familiarize you with the many options available to you .
Before BUCKLING in , please note that the man standing in the aisle
next to you is about to make a request .
He wonders if it would be
okay for you to switch seats with his wife , who is in the middle seat
three rows ahead .
She is the one seated between the former linebacker
and the canola oil salesman , and is peering over the seatbacks at you
with wide and imploring eyes .
The man will ask this in a voice sufficiently loud that all
passengers seated within several rows will look up from their sudoku
puzzles and await your answer .
If you say no , the passengers will all
wonder :
Why do you hate married people ?
You must be a bitter and
lonely person .
Note also that there is no overhead luggage space
three rows ahead , so you will have to wait for the entire plane to
empty to come back and retrieve your bags .
Have a good flight up at 18E !
Once permanently seated , grasp both ends of SEAT BELT and press
firmly together .
If you hear only a dull metallic clanking sound
rather than a smart “ click , ” extend half of the seat belt to your
seatmate and awkwardly suggest that he must be sitting on your half .
If you would like a small and insubstantial PILLOW and cannot locate
one , ring the flight attendant call button located directly overhead .
If the flight attendant does not appear within five seconds , press
the button repeatedly and with increasing urgency .
If the flight
attendant tells you no more are available , wait five minutes and
repeat process .
On either side of you is an ARMREST .
If you look down and see that it
is currently occupied by the ham - sized elbow of your seatmate , it is
often possible to claim your space by simply pressing your clammy
forearm against his with a casualness that suggests that you had n’t
noticed that you were even touching .
( Note : this is effective chiefly
in man - to - man seating configurations . )
Ahead of you is the marsupial - like SEAT BACK POUCH .
In it you will
find a magazine featuring ads for foreign language software favored
by farm boys hoping to impress hot Italian models ; an emergency
evacuation card depicting families who seem disturbingly calm for
people about to abandon a sinking airliner for a shark - filled ocean ;
stray bits of Life Saver foil ; and a boarding pass stub from someone
named Richard from Ohio .
Also , you will find the SKYMALL CATALOG , from which you may order a
product called “ Poop Freeze , ” described as a spray refrigerant that

The case , including the bizarre attempt at cover - up , was widely covered in the legal blogs ( see here and here ) , but barely merited coverage by the mainstream press .
Columbia Journalism Review has an interesting story about the poor media coverage .
[ There were two previous diary entries at Daily Kos , brought to my attention after my posting here .
Dday posted The FBI , Egyptian Torture , and the Court Opinion That Was n't on October 23 .
Albaum followed up the story , with emphasis on the issue of court redaction , in the diary Federal Appeals Court Covers Up Abuse ?
Both diaries are well - worth the read . ]
There was one article in the Washington Post last week :
The FBI interviewer allegedly gave Abdallah Higazy a choice : Admit to having a special pilot 's radio in a hotel room near the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 , 2001 , or the security service in his native Egypt would give his family " hell . "
Higazy responded by confessing to a crime he did n't commit ....
In an unusual move , however , the appeals court withdrew the first opinion within minutes on Thursday and issued a second opinion Friday , with the details of Higazy 's allegations removed .
" This opinion has been redacted because portions of the record are under seal , " the new ruling reads .
" For the purposes of the summary judgment motion , Templeton did not contest that Higazy 's statements were coerced . "
Howard Bashman , who writes a legal blog " devoted to appellate litigation " , HowAppealing.com , gets the credit for breaking this story .
He was , as already noted , approached by a clerk in the U.S. Court of Appeals , Second Circuit , and told to take down his post of the original court opinion .
According to an article posted at ABA Journal , the clerk , one Catherine O'Hagan Wolfe , said the material was redacted to protect Higazy and his family , and that neither the FBI nor the Justice Department requested the material be censored .
But a number of commentators have seriously questioned that .
A Look at Censorship in Action
OK , let 's compare the versions and you make up your mind .
This is from the currently posted ( redacted ) version of the opinion .
The excerpt picks up during a description of the FBI polygraph of Higazy , a procedure requested by Higazy himself , although he found it physically painful :
Templeton unhooked the polygraph , and according to Higazy , called Higazy a baby and told him that a nine - year - old could tolerate this pain .
Templeton left the room to get Higazy water , and upon his return , Higazy asked whether anybody else had ever suffered physical pain during the polygraph , to which Templeton replied : " [ i]t never happened to anyone who told the truth . "
Higazy alleges that during the polygraph , Templeton told him that he should cooperate . . . .
This opinion has been redacted because portions of the record are under seal .
For the purposes of the summary judgment motion , Templeton did not contest that Higazy 's statements were coerced .
Higazy then gave Templeton a series of explanations as to how he obtained the radio .
First , he admitted that he stole the radio from J&R , an electronics store .
Then he recanted this story , and explained that he found it near J&R .
Higazy next denied ever seeing or possessing the radio .
Templeton allegedly banged on the table and screamed at Higazy : " You lied to me again !
This is what ?
How many lies ? "
Higazy then lied again , this time telling Templeton that he found the radio on the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge .
Higazy recalled that Templeton " turned so red I thought he was going to hit me . "
Templeton accused Higazy of being a liar , and said that he would " tell Agent Sullivan in my expert opinion you are a terrorist . "
Finally , Higazy told Templeton that he had stolen the radio from the Egyptian military and had used it to eavesdrop on telephone conversations .
Templeton then wrote out a statement providing that Higazy had stolen the radio from the Egyptian military , which he asked Higazy to sign .
Among other things , Higazy 's experience and reactions are a textbook case in how to elicit a false confession .
But why did Higazy cave ?
Was he a crybaby , as his interrogator suggested ?
Consider the fully uncensored version , and note that the court accepts this version , even if it redacted it later ( emphases are added ) .
Templeton unhooked the polygraph , and according to Higazy , called Higazy a baby and told him that a nine - year - old could tolerate this pain .
Templeton left the room to get Higazy water , and upon his return , Higazy asked whether anybody else had ever suffered physical pain during the polygraph , to which Templeton replied : " [ i]t never happened to anyone who told the truth . "
Higazy alleges that during the polygraph , Templeton told him that he should cooperate , [ begin unredacted portion ] and explained that if Higazy did not cooperate , the FBI would make his brother " live in scrutiny " and would " make sure that Egyptian security gives [ his ] family hell . "
Templeton later admitted that he knew how the Egyptian security forces operated : " that they had a security service , that their laws are different than ours , that they are probably allowed to do things in that country where they do n’t advise people of their rights , they do n’t – yeah , probably about torture , sure . "
Higazy later said , " I knew that I could n’t prove my innocence , and I knew that my family was in danger . "
He explained that " [t ] he only thing that went through my head was oh , my God , I am screwed and my family ’s in danger .
If I say this device is mine , I ’m screwed and my family is going to be safe .
If I say this device is not mine , I ’m screwed and my family ’s in danger .
And Agent Templeton made it quite clear that cooperate had to mean saying something else other than this device is not mine . "
Higazy explained why he feared for his family :
The Egyptian government has very little tolerance for anybody who is -- they ’re suspicious of being a terrorist .
To give you an idea , Saddam ’s security force — as they later on were called his henchmen — a lot of them learned their methods and techniques in Egypt ; torture , rape , some stuff would be even too sick to . . . .
My father is 67 .
My mother is 61 .
I have a brother who developed arthritis at 19 .
He still has it today .
When the word ‘ torture ’ comes at least for my brother , I mean , all they have to do is really just press on one of these knuckles .
I could n’t imagine them doing anything to my sister .
And Higazy added : [ L ] et ’s just say a lot of people in Egypt would stay away from a family that they know or they believe or even rumored to have anything to do with terrorists and by the same token , some people who actually could be — might try to get to them and somebody might actually make a connection .
I was n’t going to risk that .
I was n’t going to risk that , so I thought to myself what could I say that he would believe .
What could I say that ’s convincing ?
And I said okay .

The FBI Is Not Clean on Torture
What else can we conclude ?
In the controversies over CIA and military torture at Guantanamo , Abu Ghraib and elsewhere ( and particularly over the interrogaton of Abu Zubeida ) , the FBI were portrayed as whistleblowers , as real interrogation professionals who eschew torture .
But here we can witness the FBI practicing a form of torture - threats to family - to induce a coerced confession .
And then somebody tried to cover up the tracks when the embarrassing information popped up in a legal opinion .
Apparently it was posted for only minutes before it was withdrawn , but it was too late for the government censors .
What else can we conclude but that this is how some , not all , FBI interrogations are conducted .
How often does this happen ?
We do n't know .
How much is covered - up ?
We do n't know , mainly because we can't estimate things done in secret .
But we do know something about FBI history .
During the 1950s and 1960s , the FBI ran a domestic counterintelligence campaign targeting U.S. dissidents and radicals , Cointelpro .
This is from Brian Glick 's 1989 book , War at Home :
In early 1971 , the FBI 's domestic counterintelligence program ( code named " COINTELPRO " ) was brought to light when a " Citizens Committee to Investigate the FBI " removed secret files from an FBI office in Media , PA and released them to the press ....
When congressional investigations , political trials and other traditional legal methods of repression failed to counter the growing movements of the 1950s , '60s and ' 70s , and even helped fuel them , the FBI and police moved outside the law .
They used secret and systematic methods of fraud and force , far beyond mere surveillance , to sabotage constitutionally protected political activity .
The purpose of the program was , in FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover 's own words , to " expose , disrupt , misdirect , discredit and otherwise neutralize " specific groups and individuals .
Its targets in this period included the American Indian Movement , the Communist Party , the Socialist Worker 's Party , Black Nationalist groups , and many members of the New Left ( SDS , and a broad range of anti-war , anti-racist , feminist , lesbian and gay , environmentalist and other groups ) .
Many other groups and individuals seeking racial , gender and class justice were targets who came under attack , including Martin Luther King , Cesar Chavez , the NAACP , the National Lawyer 's Guild , SANE - Freeze , American Friends Service Committee , and many , many others ....
Much of what was done outside the law under COINTELPRO was later legalized by Executive Order 12333 ( 12/4/81 ) [ under President Ronald Reagan ] .
One could argue that the practices of Cointelpro did not involve torture or the elicitation of false confessions .
But they do reveal a pattern of operating in secret and outside the law .
Some terrible things have been happening in this country .
The naive belief that the FBI is somehow above the barbaric practices of the CIA and the military , with the latter highlighted over the waterboarding issue roiling the Mukasey nomination , must give way to an informed and sophisticated view of how the government really operates , particularly its police branches .
We got to peek at how some of some of government secrecy operates to protect its police agents and their abuse .
We must demand an end to such secrecy , a restoration of the FOIA to its full 1970s power , and the prosecution of those who use torture or cruel treatment , and those who pursue it as state or agency policy .
Blogger Steve Bergstein summed up the Higazy revelations :
That 's how they do it , folks .
If a foreign national is suspected of terrorist activity , the FBI will threaten to have a brutal foreign government punish his family .
And punishment in a place like Egypt is not like punishment here .
Punishment here consists of solitary confinement and a very long prison term .
Punishment over there is torture .
Update :
For those who really like to get into the nitty - gritty of the case , Mary2002 gave an important link in the comments .
She noted that the information that was redacted in the court opinion had been available elsewhere publicly online .
The matter at the link gives evidence that the FBI had been conducting a cover - up on Higazy for some time .
Here 's the link , and a brief explanation from the site as to what it contains ( and a tip of the hat to all the brilliant and informative comments from the readers ) .
Note that the matter below was written before the Second Circuit opinion , and before Agent Templeton , for the purposes of the summary judgment motion , " did not contest that Higazy 's statements were coerced " :
[ Posted ] are pages 2 - 11 of the report on the investigation conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice 's Office of the Inspector General ( OIG ) prepared by Deputy U.S. Attorney David N. Kelley in behalf of U.S. Attorney James B. Comey , Southern District of New York , on how an FBI polygrapher came to extract a false confession from Abdallah Higazy .
The first page of the report was not available ....
The OIG report 's main conclusion , that " there is insufficient evidence to corroborate Higazy 's allegations that the polygrapher threatened him " was foreordained by the FBI 's deliberate policy of not audio - or video - recording polygraph examinations , a policy that ensures there will be no record of any such misconduct by a polygrapher .
Higazy 's lawyer , Robert S. Dunn , has characterized the OIG report as a whitewash .
This view is supported by the fact that the OIG failed to even review Higazy 's polygraph charts before filing its report .
That the OIG was biased against Higazy and in favor of the polygrapher is evidenced by the fact that in reporting on its interview of Higazy , almost everything Higazy said is caveated with prefatory words such as " Higazy stated , " " Higazy said , " " According to Higazy , " and " According to Higazy 's account , " whereas in reporting on the polygrapher 's interview , such prefatory remarks appear relatively infrequently , and much of the polygrapher 's account is presented as if it were undisputed fact .

I promised recently to publish more of my reflections on what I ’ve learned from studying the parallels between Web 2.0 and financial markets , one of the real wake - up calls was the way that Wall Street firms moved from being brokers to being active players “ trading for their own account . ”
Ever since I heard Bill Janeway point out that over time , Wall Street “ firms began to trade against
their clients for their own account , such that now , the direct
investment activities of a firm like Goldman Sachs dwarf their
activities on behalf of outside customers , ” I thought , whither Google , Yahoo ! and Amazon ?
And sure enough , there is lots of evidence that this process is already far advanced .
These sites , once devoted to distributing attention to others , are increasingly focused on consuming as much of the user attention as possible .
What else do you make of Google ’s recent sally against Wikipedia , the so - called knol .
Anil Dash ’s analysis was spot-on :
Google ’s announcement of Knol shows that they understand some of
their key business drivers very well ;
With as much as 5 % of the
search result links for popular terms going to Wikipedia pages ,
a solution to capturing some of that traffic in an environment
that Google can control and display ads on makes good business
sense … . [ But ]
Knol shares with Google Book Search the problem of being
both indexed by Google and hosted by Google .
This presents inherent
conflicts in the ranking of content , as well as disincentives for
content creators to control the environment in which their content
is published .
This necessarily disadvantages competing search
engines , but more importantly eliminates the ability for content
creators to innovate in the area of content presentation or
enhancement .
Everyone applauds when Google goes after Microsoft ’s Office monopoly , seeing it simply as “ turnabout ’s fair play , ” ( and a distant underdog to boot ) , but when they start to go after web non-profits like Wikipedia , you see where the ineluctable logic leads .
As Google ’s growth slows , as inevitably it will , it will need to consume more and more of the web ecosystem , trading against its former suppliers , rather than distributing attention to them .
We already take for granted that common searches , such as for weather or stock prices , are satisfied directly on the search screen .
Where does that process stop ?
And much as I support what Google is doing with Google Book Search , I am troubled by the fact that they give preference to their own content repository over digital copies provided by publishers or other aggregators .
( See my post Book Search Should Work Like Web Search . )
We see the same pattern at Amazon , which is aggressively pursuing authors for direct publishing on the kindle and seeking to displace publishers by making themselves the sole source for books on the device .
[ Update :
And reader GL , in the comments on this post , observed “ this year I found it quite interesting that YHOO made such a large effort to become a ‘ super affiliate ’ .
The amount of product reviews tied to affiliate links was amazing .
Would you rather make $ 2 per click selling PPC ad or make $ 25 per click ( 5 % of a $ 500 sale by advertising along side other ppc advertisers ?
I think the answer is simple .
Interestingly , in this scenario YHOO wins on both sides of the trade . ” ]
Ultimately , I think we see this pattern in the economic development of every innovation .
When a new technology is introduced , there ’s a lot of green - field opportunity , and so much value is being created that there ’s no need to capture it all .
But as the technology matures , the winners need to capture more of the total value being created .
They gradually crowd out suppliers as well as competitors .
Fortunately , there ’s another side to Bill Janeway ’s unorthodox history of Wall Street ( as told in the Release 2.0 issue on the subject ) , and that ’s the one we ’re focusing on at the Money : Tech Conference in New York in February .
And that is the rise of new opportunities for specialized information and data mining services that go deeper than what ’s available in search engines .
I ’ll write about that next week .
Journal Friends Archive Profile Memories Chalain Jan. 12th , 2008 06:30 pm Proxying vs. Demeter
A while back I wrote this post about dishonesty in programming , and someone recently asked a very good question .
My answer was so long that it broke LiveJournal 's comment size restrictions , so I decided to make it a full post .
Your comments are welcome .
>> do n't write a public accessor to a private member and tell me that member is still private
So if you need to add an object to a list what is your proposal ?
Because I can see less problems in :
a.getList ().add ( obj )
than in creating a new method for every operation in the list interface ( for each private collection in the class ! ) .
Like :
a.addObjectToList(obj )
The accessors are meant to wrap the field so logic can be attached to the operation but in the end they are making private fields public .
Am I missing something here ?
Short answer : Yes .
In general , when you have conversations with an object , you should only ever have conversations with that object .
If you 're talking to something inside that object you 're violating encapsulation .
If you 're talking to a parent 's child object directly , the parent can no longer guard access to the child , and must guard itself against changes to the child .
In other words , it becomes a peer object and should either be treated as such or the access should be proxied .
Longer answer :
Your concern is valid .
If we proxied everything all the way down every interface in every system would have 700 methods and that gets messy .
It does n't " get messy real fast " , however , but yes it can get out of hand if taken to an extreme .
You have to find the right balance , but in my experience the balance is like 90 / 10 in favor of proxies .
Classes and objects that exist solely to broker connections , for example , can violate this rule .
Frameworks often violate this rule as well , but the hows and whys of this are a topic for a whole ' nother post .
I have a vital software design concern for you , however , and I say this not as a challenge to you but as hopefully food for thought .
When you say " if you need to add an object to a list " , you have already gotten into trouble .
It 's hard to see it in a generic example like this one , however .
Let 's use a concrete example to make things clearer .
Let 's say class Customer has a List of Address objects , and you need to add a new address to a customer .
Consider the statement " Add a new address to a customer 's known addresses " versus " Append a new address to a customer 's address list " .
That second statement makes my teeth itch .
Why do you need the address * list * ?
Why are you performing class - dependent operations on a member object of another object ?
The proxies do n't always have to look awful , either .
Consider :
customer.addAddress(address ) ;
I would also write removeAddress ( address ) .
For collections that have a lot of churn , I would add clearAddresses ( ) .
These mimic the standard List operations , but it is vitally important to see that we are not bound to a List object underneath .
It is a balance ; for trivial data you may not care and you just want to expose it .
Also , objects that exist only to give you access to other objects -- such as a caching object -- also should not proxy .
Remember , though , that every time you reach through an object to a child object , you
1. Violate encapsulation
2 . Tightly couple all three objects together
3. Cripple modularity / type independence
4 . Deprive the parent class of the ability to guard , or even be aware of , the child data .
That last one is particularly scary : the parent can no longer guard the child data .
If it needs to know the child object 's state , it must ask the child for its state .
They are no longer parent / child objects ; they are peers .
Two quick examples :
1 . I worked on a Java project last year that broke this rule with abandon .
One List object we were using everywhere suddenly needed to be changed to a Dequeue .
Because it was accessed in over 70 places in the code as a List object , the refactoring took all afternoon rather than 5 minutes behind the proxy .
2. Same project .
Because a List object was exposed , programmers got in the habit of grabbing the list and modifying it directly .
Later I discovered that programmers were iterating over the list performing Load ( ) operations on each child .
Each load took 30 - 80 ms , and some collections had 500 objects in them .
This meant our app would hang for 15 to 40 seconds when you opened one form .
I quickly refactored it so the parent object could guard the data with one single load , taking about 50 - 100 ms .
But then I discovered literally dozens of places in the code where not only did the code expect to be able to grab the list , but that had intertwined their logic around the notion of a List on the other side of the parent object .
Before I could refactor that collection , I had to rewrite about 3,000 lines of code throughout the application to get its dirty paws off my data -- in such a way that the other areas of code could still do their jobs .
Thank you for this comment .
Before now I had thought that it was n't a balance at all ; that proxies were always preferable to violating encapsulation .
But as I wrote this I realized that it is a tradeoff : when you proxy , you create type independence through encapsulation , but you do it at the expense of separating the business logic on either side of the interface , and there are times when seamless logic is more important than encapsulating data .
I need to think more on this .
Thanks !

Thank you for writing all of this down .
There 's nothing here that strikes me as unobvious ( though I 'd never specifically thought of a caller reaching through a parent object to the child object as binding all three together before ) , but seeing an effectively complete discussion of the basics of parent - child encapsulation is thought - provoking .
I 'll be turning this over in my head for the next week or two at work , most likely .
Finally :
You really need to consider that book of essays .
This kind of stuff is why .

Indeed .
Another question to ask yourself if you find yourself writing lots of proxy methods : is your abstraction trying to do too much ?
In other words , break abstractions down into smaller , simpler abstractions each with a single purpose .
I think that lots of proxy methods often indicates a complicated and / or confused abstraction .

This is the thought that sprang up at the end of my post : proxies create a schism in the business logic .
If you have a lot of proxies ( or violate the Law of Demeter often ) , perhaps your business logic needs to be revisited .
You 're trying to do too much low - level stuff from too high a place .

Interesting arguments ( Link ) Yes , interesting arguments .
I 'm more concerned about the first two than the fourth .
I mean , you can always create a property change listener .
The thing is some frameworks ( Hibernate comes to my mind ) and Java in general expect public accessors .
This will break encapsulation right there .
And once in that position it's a difficult proposition to enforce , is n't it ?
I mean , how can I convince one of my developers that the getter has to be there but that nobody should use it ?
Should we enforce immutable collections from getters ?
And what about getters that return simple beans ?
When I first asked the question I expected some discussion about encapsulation .
I 'll have to think more about this as well .
May be even blog ( http://internna.blogspot.com) a little further !
Reply ) ( Thread From : chalain Date : January 13th , 2008 08:39 pm ( UTC ) Re : Interesting arguments ( Link ) I mean , you can always create a property change listener .
I actually cried out in dismay when I read this , because it felt like I was saying " this hurts , because XYZ " and you were saying , " yes , but rather than fix the hurt we can throw more hurt at it " . :-)
On second thought , however , I think we 're actually in agreement .
I argued that when the parent class loses the ability to guard the child , they become peers ; I failed to expand the logical followthrough of that thought : you should change your design so that they ARE peers .
The thing is some frameworks
This is that topic for a whole ' nother post , which I will summarize now and then probably never get around to writing : frameworks propagate this design flaw rampantly .
Because a framework 's entire object model is published , documented , well - established , and frozen , the first three of my concerns are inconsequential .
I mean , getChildWindows is always going to return Collection < Window > .
It is not only acceptable but expected that the caller will get that child window collection and do something collectiony with them .
My chief concern with this is that programmers write what they read ; they see a clever design and ape it .
At least , I know I do this .
But there 's nothing in the framework code that clearly states the precon{di , cep}tions that went into the code .
And so , we sit down and copy this pattern into code that is brand new , undocumented , not established , and completely fluid , we suddenly get bitten by the consequences of that design choice .
I have posted elsewhere that frameworks in general are at best a necessary evil , and no programmer should ever write framework code unless the actual deliverable of the project is that framework ( as opposed to a product that would " clearly benefit " from a framework ) .
I accept that this makes me a crazy old coot . :-)

Collection < Address > getAddresses ( ) { return m_addresses ; } This would make switching between lists and queues simple .
Unfortunately , adding custom validations to this would be tricky to do in Java .
But in a more flexible OOP language , this is probably a better solution .
Ideally you 'd use an interface as your proxy .

This delegation pattern , however , is still ( IMO ) quite flawed , unless the first object really is nothing more than a delegate .
To illustrate , I think the function Customer.getAddresses ( ) : Collection < Addre ss > is inappropriate design , but Cache.getAddresses ( ) : Collection < Address > makes perfect sense .
As long as you do n't ever want to change the " get this object and manipulate it " pattern , you 're fine ; and using an interface then effectively gives you type - independence .
For example if you later found you needed extra intelligence in the collection -- such as shallow loading , or deferred write caching -- you could write a custom collection template class that inherits from Collection and handles everything .
But you really have now made the address book a peer object to the Customer , and this all falls apart if any operation on the child class depends on an interaction with the parent -- i.e. they really should n't be peers .
For example , let 's say that manipulating a customer 's addresses is affected by some rules at the business logic level : retail customers can only have two addresses , but business customers can have five .
In order to implement this via interfaces , you 're going to need Address to notify Customer that it 's being updated , and to ask permission to add the new address based on type .
Or you 're going to have to customize the address collection itself to know that it can only allow maxAddressCount entries .
To make address a peer class , it must stand alone and be unique in its own right .
But suddenly it has this dependence on Customer or it has this weird logic that seems quite specific to a weird case .
You can tell when you 're in this position because the names get really wacky and convoluted .
The first might be InterlockedCollection ( with Customer implementing ICollectionEventListener ) while the second might be a generic class called SizedCollection .
SizedCollection is one of those classes that really does n't add much to the whole notion of a Collection , and I try to weed out " unfit specialization " like this whenever possible .
This is a classic example of bizarro - world programming : we have created an entire class template to avoid TWO LINES of business logic code !
if ( this.addresses.getCount( ) >= this.maxAddressCount ) { throw IllegalArgumentException ; } ALL of these issues would go away if Customer simply proxied the request , and clients realized that if they want to add an Address to a Customer , they need to have a conversation with the Customer rather than Customer 's address book .
Thank you for your comment .
I think we agree that we should use delegation when delegation is appropriate and proxying when proxying is appropriate ; if we disagree is in mainly in how often and which situations we find appropriate .
HMMM , that 's ANOTHER thought that had n't occurred to me until you provoked it :
My experience has been that many people tend to use delegation when they are n't sure , and those people are my target audience here , because I think that in almost all of those cases proxying would be better .
It is true , however , that in statically - typed languages like Java and C++ , proxying requires lot more typing and boilerplate than delegation .
And since a little delegation does n't hurt , we use it perhaps more often than we should .
I must think on this more .
Thanks !
True , and this is definitely a step in the right direction in languages that support interface - based programming .
I 'm not a big fan of Java 's implementation of interfaces but it IS a way to lock down the interactions between objects .
This delegation pattern , however , is still ( IMO ) quite flawed , unless the first object really is nothing more than a delegate .
To illustrate , I think the function Customer.getAddresses ( ) : Collection is inappropriate design , but Cache.getAddresses ( ) : Collection makes perfect sense .
As long as you do n't ever want to change the " get this object and manipulate it " pattern , you 're fine ; and using an interface then effectively gives you type - independence .
For example if you later found you needed extra intelligence in the collection -- such as shallow loading , or deferred write caching -- you could write a custom collection template class that inherits from Collection and handles everything .
But you really have now made the address book a peer object to the Customer , and this all falls apart if any operation on the child class depends on an interaction with the parent -- i.e. they really should n't be peers .
For example , let 's say that manipulating a customer 's addresses is affected by some rules at the business logic level : retail customers can only have two addresses , but business customers can have five .
In order to implement this via interfaces , you 're going to need Address to notify Customer that it 's being updated , and to ask permission to add the new address based on type .
Or you 're going to have to customize the address collection itself to know that it can only allow maxAddressCount entries .
To make address a peer class , it must stand alone and be unique in its own right .
But suddenly it has this dependence on Customer or it has this weird logic that seems quite specific to a weird case .
You can tell when you 're in this position because the names get really wacky and convoluted .
The first might be InterlockedCollection ( with Customer implementing ICollectionEventListener ) while the second might be a generic class called SizedCollection .
SizedCollection is one of those classes that really does n't add much to the whole notion of a Collection , and I try to weed out " unfit specialization " like this whenever possible .
This is a classic example of bizarro - world programming : we have created an entire class template to avoid TWO LINES of business logic code !
ALL of these issues would go away if Customer simply proxied the request , and clients realized that if they want to add an Address to a Customer , they need to have a conversation with the Customer rather than Customer 's address book .

Reply ) ( Parent ) ( Thread From : ( Anonymous ) Date : January 14th , 2008 07:45 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) I do a lot of GUI programming , and I can ensure you , your proposal would n't work there .
It would be a total waste of time to proxy all methods of all controls on a form .
Of course you could see this as the exception , but it does prove the proxy method is n't efficient .
You lose all benefits Object Orientated has to offer .
Another example would be , if you had 10 different objects all having an address list , you have to copy / paste your safe - guarding routines 10 times .
My solution would be , do n't use the list class .
Make your own list class that encapsulates the regular list .
You can extend your own object with guards and events .
For example the list could call the parent ( or better yet , multiple listeners ) requesting if it 's OK to add the new item .
Also adding a smarter load to your list , would have solved that performance problem you mentioned .
And not only for that list , but for all lists .
Or add a property BehaveAsDequeue .

I 'm gonna have to turn off anonymous posting here soon , so I can track you people down . :-)
I would love to have a followup discussion with you , because I find this statement interesting .
I 'm coming from about 15 years of GUI programming , and I 've seen it work over and over again , so we 're clearly not on the same page yet .
The thing is , I learned this principle late in life and spent years doing GUI programming where I would have agreed with you ... but I cannot remember why I would have agreed with you , and I need to track you people down so I can ferret out what that thought pattern was .
Ah well .
I think I see most of your point , though - - see my note elsewhere in the comments here about frameworks .
When you work within an established framework , you do n't have to worry about the first three drawbacks of violating the Law of Demeter .
Because you 're never going to change the framework code and because you have the full framework clearly documented and mapped out , you do n't need to worry about most of the design complications there .
As for the rest of the point ...
I need to make another post , I guess .
You people are writing custom classes to replace existing classes , stacking listeners on top of child classes to make them peers ( but leaving them as children ) and architecting class hierarchies that make it impossible to operate the program in any other way than specified .... all of which could have simply been solved with two lines of business logic .
Are you really that allergic to business logic ?
At some point we have to stop ourselves and ask , " Does programming have to hurt this much ? "
Reply ) ( Parent ) ( Thread From : billgoates Date : January 14th , 2008 09:45 pm ( UTC ) ( Link )
Yeah , sorry , normally anonymous posting still requires a name + email .
I discovered I did n't leave a sign just after pressing post .
Lets try to explain it different then .
When you have an address object , you will need all kinds of tests to validate the data .
I can do these tests on the parent , but when I have multiple objects owning an address list , that validation code is needed multiple times .
So the best place to include the validation code is in the address object .
When a validation rule changes , you know exactly where to modify , and only have to modify it once .
And the same goes for list objects .
All problems you described , were all because the list object is n't safe , smart and / or fast enough .
So there are two choices , try to invent a work around , or solve the problem .
Your proposal is a work around , I prefer to extend the platform .
Maybe the difference is that you use a framework , I did n't recognize such from the examples , where I try to stay away from off the shelf code .
I think frameworks are overrated , bloated , too general purpose and a waste of time .
Experienced taught me , that 3rd never party software rarely does everything it is required to do , and the time needed to find the best framework , learn every detail of it , and get it to play nicely with the rest of the code , is equal to much more time than to write the necessary code yourself .
The big difference is that my knowledge does n't go obsolete within 5 years , and I do n't have to worry about a vendor going out of business or planning a major rewrite or have to solve / workaround code that is n't mine .
But not everyone has this luxury and are forced to work with their current employers framework .
And since it 's best not to rewrite parts of it , you will end up doing your proposal , but in my eyes it always will be a work around .
I do have to admit I was n't familiar with the Law of Demeter , so I did some reading up on it , and more than ever I am convinced it's an outdated law that should be forgotten and buried as quick as possible .
It originates from 1987 , long before OO became popular or anyone heard of event based objects .
I saw lots of blogs promoting the law , but did n't see any valid reason of why to use it .
I even saw someone suggesting to use a Demeter generator to overcome the disadvantage of writing a large number of wrappers .
Talking about insanity .
Anyone thinking that auto generating pointless heaps of code will make their software more stable , safer or easier to maintain instead of the opposite , may have a free lifetime straightjacket .
The advantage of replacing existing classes is much more than saving 2 lines .
Those 2 lines you mention are the forwarding call only .
Validation code is still required , without it the forwarding does n't serve any purpose other than to comply to some ancient law .
And those 2 lines + validation , are for every child method , multiplied every time this object is used .
And after all that work you still do n't have any guarantees if some ' smart ' developer is n't accessing the child directly .
Encapsulating a list takes 5 maybe 10 minutes .
And all you need after that is one global replace .
From there on you can slowly upgrade your software where needed .
And a list object is important enough , that even if you would take a full week off to fully customize it , it will pay back in the first medium size project .
Reply ) ( Parent ) ( Thread From : chalain Date : January 14th , 2008 10:27 pm ( UTC ) ( Link ) OH OH OH !
I see the disconnect !
Thank you for replying !
I think I have created in your mind an image where you can only ever have conversations with Customer objects , and if you need to talk to an Address object you must proxy it .
This is not at all what I am trying to say .
We 're both agreed that if you want to talk about customers , you need to have a conversation with a Customer object , right ?
If you want to talk about addresses , you need to have a conversation with an Address object -- not a proxy through a Customer .
I hope that clears things up a bit about what I am not saying . :-)
Now then , what I * AM * saying is that if you have a mailing address here , and you 've already had the conversation with it where you set its data and it has validated itself , and now you want to add this address to a customer , that is a conversation with a Customer .
Importantly , it is NOT a conversation with a Customer 's address collection mechanism .
I guess you could be talking exclusively about validating the collection mechanism itself , but that proxies easily ; if Customer : : addAddress ( ) has no validation problems of its own , it simply returns whatever mAddressBook.addObject ( ) returns .
From there , the rest of your post is essentially a continuation of that original misunderstanding .
I generally agree with what you 're saying with just a few exceptions and / or tweaks :
- I see the 2 - line business logic as the smartest and best solution .
If there 's a business rule that says customers of type X can only have Y addresses , then some code in the controller subsystem -- the place business logic should be stored -- should check that condition and handle it accordingly .
This is a hard point to make out of context if ( and I believe this is the case ) you and I are coming from very different viewpoints .
Both of us have tight , compact solutions at either end of the system ( static design vs. runtime behavior ) and see solutions at the other end of the spectrum as wildly out of control .
If we worked at the same shop you and I would have many entertaining lunches together , I am sure . :-)
- Re : Law of Demeter .
Okay , I thought * I* was a crazy old coot .
You sir , are just plain nuts .
And coming from a crazy old coot , that may be saying something .
I 'll accept for now that you do n't see any value in it , but I implore you to dig deeper and try to find out why the Demeter crew thought it was such a good idea in the first place .
( I also welcome your response here ; I see adherence to the Law of Demeter as being equivalent to eschewing tightly - coupled , monolithic code .
Given the viewpoint shifts we already had , I suspect that you do not see it this way . )
I will say this : my adherence to the Law of Demeter has produced MUCH more decoupled , reusable , and testable code than just about any other single design principle .
- The Law of Demeter was inspired by Object - based programming , which was 20 years old by 1987 ; Programmers the world over had been shooting themselves in the foot in C for nearly a decade by then , only then it was reaching through the humble struct that was killing them .
- I find it fascinating that you detest frameworks but love modifying and customizing systems .
In my mind that 's like saying you love making bricks but people who build walls should be shot . :-)
( Another viewpoint discussion , I am sure ; obviously I can see there 's a difference between trying to make every possible kind of brick so that masons do n't have to , and making just enough brick to throw through a window . )
Anyway , thanks for writing back .
Cheers !

From what I have read so far , I believe Demeter would n't agree with your Address object .
But not important , the reason I used the Address object was to show an obvious example to explain a less obvious one .
But I will stick to the list now .
The max number of addresses was something I thought on while writing the previous post , but did n't include .
It 's simple enough , extend your own list with a MaxEntries property .
The parent class has to initialize it , but the validation is in the list it self .
Not convincing enough ?
Lets make it a little more complicated then .
You want to prevent double entries .
To do so you will have to compare all fields in your address against all the fields of the other addresses .
That 's another 10 lines of code you will have to include in every AddToList proxy according to Demeter .
I could go on with extending the list with like multiple indexes , filters , searches , smart loading , etc .
Every addition will add to the current and following projects at no extra price , where as Demeter will stick at copy / pasting the same basic rules .
In his defense , he did n't know about events , interfaces or callbacks , so you cannot blame him for being obsolete .
Use any of those method and you still can have the business object specific code in the parent object .
Your viewpoint about bricks is almost correct , but I do n't want to shoot wall builders , but the other brick makers .
See it as most new languages are comparable to a box of Meccano .
It 's supposed to build anything , but it 's hard to use and everything created with it will look like a bunch metal plates screwed to each other .
Then you get 3rd party additions , more boxes of Meccano .
Not much changed , at best you need a few less screws .
What we should have is Lego .
Anyone can use it , and if you are crafted enough you can build entire cities people from all over the world will want to see .

A group of more than 50 masked protesters gathered yesterday outside of the Church of Scientology of Boston headquarters on Beacon Street to demonstrate against the policies of the church .
Protesters said the event was part of a worldwide demonstration against the church by Anonymous , an informal Internet - based group .
Donning Guy Fawkes masks modeled after those worn in the 2005 film " V for Vendetta , " or face coverings improvised with T - shirts or scarves , participants began to assemble in front of the building at the corner of Beacon and Hereford streets around 11 a.m .
The story of Fawkes , an Englishman sentenced to death for attempting to blow up the House of Lords with kegs of gunpowder in 1605 , was revived in the fictional " V for Vendetta , " in which a crowd of people wear identical masks to challenge the government .
Yesterday , the group , chanting slogans and holding signs bearing anti-Scientology messages , urged passing cars to honk in support .
In a statement , the Church of Scientology of Boston said that Anonymous is " a group of cyberterrorists who hide their identities behind masks and computer anonymity " and target Scientology " for no reason other than religious bigotry . "
Gerard Renna , director of the Church of Scientology of Boston , said in an interview yesterday that church services were not affected by the protest .
Members of the church continued to enter through the front entrance as two Boston police officers stood outside the door .
The church hired four officers for private details to ensure that parishioners and people in the neighborhood were safe , according to a Scientology spokesperson .
The group Anonymous has never protested in front of the Boston location before , Renna said .
The Detriot Free Press reported on its website that members of Anonymous protested in front of a Church of Scientology in Farmington Hills , Mich .
About 200 protesters gathered outside a church in Clearwater , Fla. , according to the Associated Press .
Nearly all Boston protesters interviewed said they did not know anyone else at the event , or know who was leading the group .
" That 's Anonymous .
There is no hierarchy .
Everyone is in charge of themselves , " said a 20 - year - old from Cape Cod who declined to give his name .
Five of six people interviewed refused to give their names , saying they feared retribution from Scientologists .
One protester , Netanel Ganian , a 24 - year - old student at Berklee College of Music , said he did not like some of Scientology 's practices and defended Anonymous .
" It 's a bunch of people .
It 's a convenient bubble to form under .
There 's no leader , " he said .
Word about the event spread through online videos on YouTube , message boards , and websites critical of Scientology , protesters said .
The 20 - year - old said he attended " to protest the greed of the church and how the church acts towards its members . "
None of those interviewed said they knew why so many attendees were wearing the Fawkes mask .
" I can't say , not having contact with the inner circle - wherever they are , " said one protester who declined to be named .
" But I can say the image of people marching towards Parliament in the spirit of protest , that wall of masks , had a certain resonance amongst those who held negative feelings about organizations such as Scientology but also towards the government . "
No arrests were made in connection with the protest , according to Boston police .

Gary Kirsten played 101 Tests and 185 one - dayers for South Africa
He has signed despite some reservations about the attitude of the players , and the Board of Control for Cricket in India confirmed his role on Wednesday .
" It will be a great honour to coach the game 's most passionately supported team , " said the 40 - year - old Kirsten .
" I can't wait to take on what I know will be one of the biggest challenges of my ongoing career in cricket . "
Kirsten , interviewed on 26 November , will join up with the India team for the last two Tests of their upcoming visit to Australia , which start on 16 and 24 January .
" I 'll be with the team during the third and fourth Tests to facilitate the transition , " he said .
606 : DEBATE
" A plan will also be made for me to meet with the Indian team before they leave for Australia on 17 December . "
Kirsten 's first full series in charge will be when his home country tours India after he officially takes up his position on 1 March .
" I can't tell you how much I 'm looking forward to that .
It will undoubtedly be a special series for me , " he said .
India have been without a full - time overall coach since Greg Chappell resigned after their early World Cup exit in March .
Ironically , they have enjoyed a fine run of success since then with specialist fielding and bowling coaches , and a team manager .
They won a Test series in England , the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 and beat Pakistan in a home one - day series .
They currently lead Pakistan 1 - 0 in an ongoing Test series .
I have no concerns what the players think about my appointment
Gary Kirsten
After retiring from international cricket in March 2004 , Kirsten set up his own cricket academy in Cape Town , and has been doing consultancy work for various sporting bodies .
He has also been a batting coach for the Warriors in Port Elizabeth but has never been overall coach of a team , let alone a Test side .
Many names have been linked to the India role in the past few months .
Graeme Ford and John Emburey were interviewed in June , but neither wanted the job .
Since then , Maharashtra coach Chandrakant Pandit , former Queensland academy boss Richard Done , Leicestershire coach Tim Boon , former Test batsman Kepler Wessels , Queensland coach Terry Oliver , Canterbury coach Dave Nosworthy and former New Zealand captain Martin Crowe have applied .
Kirsten 's appointment was put in question when he appeared to have doubts over whether he would get the support of India 's players .
But the obstacles to his appointment have now been ironed out with the Board of Control for Cricket ( BCCI ) in India .
" I have no concerns what the players think about my appointment , " added the veteran of 101 Tests , who held numerous national records when he stopped playing .
Talking to Strangers
In Beyond Fear I wrote : “ Many children are taught never to talk to strangers , an extreme precaution with minimal security benefit . ”
In talks , I ’m even more direct .
I think “ do n’t talk to strangers ” is just about the worst possible advice you can give a child .
Most people are friendly and helpful , and if a child is in distress , asking the help of a stranger is probably the best possible thing he can do .
This advice would have helped Brennan Hawkins , the 11 - year - old boy who was lost in the Utah wilderness for four days .
The parents said Brennan had seen people searching for him on horse and ATV , but avoided them because of what he had been taught .
“ He stayed on the trail , he avoided strangers , ” Jody Hawkins said .
“ His biggest fear , he told me , was that someone would steal him . ”
They said they had n’t talked to Brennan and his four siblings about what they should do about strangers if they were lost .
“ This may have come to a faster conclusion had we discussed that , ” Toby Hawkins said .
In a world where good guys are common and bad guys are rare , assuming a random person is a good guy is a smart security strategy .
We need to help children develop their natural intuition about risk , and not give them overbroad rules .
Also in Beyond Fear , I wrote :
As both individuals and a society , we can make choices about our security .
We can choose more security or less security .
We can choose greater impositions on our lives and freedoms , or fewer impositions .
We can choose the types of risks and security solutions we ’re willing to tolerate and decide that others are unacceptable .
As individuals , we can decide to buy a home alarm system to make ourselves more secure , or we can save the money because we do n’t consider the added security to be worth it .
We can decide not to travel because we fear terrorism , or we can decide to see the world because the world is wonderful .
We can fear strangers because they might be attackers , or we can talk to strangers because they might become friends .

Surprise find : A king crab in the Antarctic deep
Robo - sub grabs crab
Crabs are poised to return to the Antarctic shallows , threatening creatures such as giant sea spiders and floppy ribbon worms , says a UK - US team .
Some have evolved without predators for tens of millions of years .
Bony fish and sharks would move in if waters warm further , threatening species with extinction , they say .
In the last 50 years , sea surface temperatures around Antarctica have risen by 1 to 2C , which is more than twice the global average .
Loss of species
Speaking in Boston at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) , the researchers said global warming could fundamentally change the ecosystem , leading to the loss of some species .
Antarctic sea life has developed a delicate equilibrium
The water only needs to remain above freezing year round for it to become habitable to some sharks , and at the rate we 're going , that could happen this century
Prof Cheryl Wilga
Professor Wilga said the arrival of sharks and shell - crushing bony fishes would lead to dramatic changes in the number and proportions of species found there .
Shrimp , ribbon worms and brittle stars are likely to be the most vulnerable to population declines .
Dr Sven
Thatje of the National Oceanography Centre at the University of Southampton , UK , said animals living in shallow water in Antarctica were unique on Earth today because they evolved in a very cold environment over tens of millions of years .
Extreme conditions
" In the course of a process we call Antarctic cooling that started about 40 million years ago , all major seafloor predators such as sharks and crabs went extinct in Antarctica because they were not able to cope with these extreme conditions , " he told BBC News .
Species have evolved without predators for millions of years
Antarctic creatures
The researchers say urgent local and global actions are needed to protect this last pristine environment .
" We have to act now in Antarctica as elsewhere to save the diversity of the planet , " said Dr Richard Aronson of Dauphin Island Sea Laboratory in Alabama .
He said measures were needed to stop alien species being brought in through ships ' ballast water .
" The local actions are to control ship traffic and control dumping of ballast waters , " he told the BBC .
" The global actions are what we 've been saying for all other environments - we have to control emissions of greenhouse gases . "
Strange creatures
Animals that live on the seafloor of Antarctica are some of the strangest creatures on Earth .
The extreme cold and lingering darkness has presented huge challenges to marine life over the passage of time , leading to the evolution of fish equipped with anti-freeze proteins in their blood , and a proliferation of filter feeders on the seabed .
Fast - moving shell - crushing animals such as crabs and ocean - going sharks that are normally key predators have long been kept at bay , as their bodies cannot cope with very cold conditions .
This has led to a dominance on the Antarctic seafloor of soft - bodied , slow - moving invertebrates , similar to those found in ancient oceans prior to the evolution of shell - crushing predators .
WASHINGTON ( AP )  Record illegal drug production in Afghanistan supplies the Taliban insurgency with money and arms and the U.S. - backed government must take direct , prompt action against poppy growers , a State Department report said Friday .
Afghan farmers grew more poppies for opium in 2007 than ever before , the second year in a row of record production in the nation the United States invaded after the Sept. 11 , 2001 terror attacks .
The drug trade deters progress toward a stable , economically independent democracy , the report said .
" The counterinsurgency nexus is both real and growing , " said Assistant Secretary David Johnson , the State Department 's top drug enforcement officer .
The International Narcotics Control Strategy Report says the largest and best - known insurgent group — the hard - line Taliban — benefits with money and weapons while offering protection to growers and traffickers .
" Eliminating narcotics cultivation and trafficking in Afghanistan will require a long - term national and international commitment , " the State Department said in the report , which added : " The Afghan government must take decisive action against poppy cultivation soon to turn back the drug threat before its further growth and consolidation make it even more difficult to defeat . "
The report noted that Afghan President Hamid Karzai considered limited aerial spraying to eradicate opium poppies last year , but opted not to do it .
Such action would have been extremely dangerous and highly unpopular .
Afghanistan grew 93 % of the world 's opium poppy last year , according to United Nations figures cited in Friday 's report .
The haul , worth an estimated $ 4 billion on the illegal world market , represented more than a third of Afghanistan 's combined total gross domestic product , or GDP , of $ 11.5 billion .
Production was up 34 % above 2006 levels and was nearly double the total for 2005 .
Land under cultivation for poppies increased 17 % in 2007 and good weather helped increase production on land already under cultivation , the report said .
Johnson welcomed some projections that say Afghan drug production will fall in 2008 .
The report measures foreign drug production and efforts to fight it .
The report does not examine drug production , interdiction or eradication in the United States .

Sulzberger told me he was surprised by the vehemence of the reaction .
But Kristol is a particularly polarizing figure in a polarized age .
While he holds the full range of conservative Republican views on economic and social issues , he is most identified today with ardently pushing for the war in Iraq , a war sold to the American people on the basis of weapons of mass destruction that did not exist , though a fair reading of Kristol ’s statements includes broader arguments .
Today , the public widely sees the war as a mistake , but Kristol remains its aggressive , unapologetic champion .
In his first column last Monday , he warned against electing a Democratic president who would “ snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory in Iraq . ”

Rosenthal said : “ Some people have said we should n’t have hired him because he supports the war in Iraq .
That ’s absurd . ”
That is not why I think Sulzberger and Rosenthal made a mistake , and I agree with their effort to address an Op - Ed lineup that , until Kristol came aboard , was at least six liberals against one conservative who is n’t always all that conservative .
I ’ve heard all the arguments against Kristol  he is “ wrong ” on Iraq , he is overexposed as editor of The Weekly Standard and a regular commentator on Fox News with nothing new to say , he is an activist with the potential to embarrass
The Times with his outside involvements  and one of them sticks with me :
On Fox News Sunday on June 25 , 2006 , Kristol said , “ I think the attorney general has an absolute obligation to consider prosecution ” of The New York Times for publishing an article that revealed a classified government program to sift the international banking transactions of thousands of Americans in a search for terrorists .
Publication of the article was controversial  my predecessor as public editor first supported it and then changed his mind  but Kristol ’s leap to prosecution smacked of intimidation and disregard for both the First Amendment and the role of a free press in monitoring a government that has a long history of throwing the cloak of national security and classification over its activities .
This is not a person I would have rewarded with a regular spot in front of arguably the most elite audience in the nation .
Kristol refused to talk with me about this issue , or an earlier statement that The Times was “ irredeemable , ” or the reaction to his appointment  an odd stance for someone who presumably will want others to talk to him for his column .
Rosenthal said Kristol ’s comment about prosecution bothered him .
It was , Rosenthal said , “ a heavy accusation that put him in a category other than a journalist . ”
But he said that Op - Ed columnists are not necessarily traditional journalists , and he did not think that “ holding one opinion ” should be the basis for selecting or rejecting a columnist .
Sulzberger said The Times wanted “ a columnist who brought to our pages a deeply held and well articulated point of view in line with what you might call the conservative Republican movement .
...
Our Op - Ed page is a marketplace of ideas .
He ’ll strengthen the discussion . ”

The 80th anniversary edition of the Academy Awards , dominated by European stars and films that played poorly at the box office , averaged 32 million viewers , entering the record books on Monday as the least watched Oscar telecast ever .
The national viewer tally reported by Nielsen Media Research for ABC ’s live , three - hour - plus telecast on Sunday was down about 1 million viewers from the previous record low , set in 2003 when the Oscars were presented just after the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq had begun .
The 2003 program was hosted by Steve Martin and featured the musical “ Chicago ” as best picture .
Sunday ’s broadcast , with comedian Jon Stewart making his second appearance as Oscar host , now ranks as the smallest U.S. TV audience for the Oscars since 1974 , when actual viewer totals first became available .
The household rating , 18.7 , also marks the lowest level by that measure going back to the first televised Oscars in 1953 .
By contrast , the most watched Oscar broadcast on record was the 1998 show , when the box - office blockbuster “ Titanic ” sailed off with a record - tying 11 awards , including the prize for best picture .
Some 55 million Americans tuned in that year .

Even that figure pales in comparison to the audience that tunes in annually to the National Football League championship Super Bowl game , which this year drew 97.5 million viewers .
“ American Idol , ” the most popular U.S. series , averages 30 million viewers a week with its Tuesday night broadcast .
It debuted this season with 33.5 million .
LOW RATINGS , NO SURPRISE
The weak ratings for Sunday ’s Oscar broadcast came as no surprise given that many movies showcased this year -- “ There Will Be Blood , ” “ Michael Clayton , ” “ Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street , ” -- generated little enthusiasm among moviegoers despite critical raves .
The night ’s big winner , the grim , violent crime drama “ No Country For Old Men , ” which claimed four awards including best picture and best drama , grossed a modest $ 64 million at the North American box office .
Only one movie among the five nominated for best picture , breakout comedy “ Juno , ” crossed the $ 100 million box office market domestically .
That film managed just one win for best original screenplay .
The Oscar ratings likely also suffered from the fact that all four acting awards this year went to European performers whose names are fairly obscure for American audiences and who appeared in movies that relatively few moviegoers saw .
The Oscars generally have drawn a bigger U.S. television audience in years when the big crowd pleasers at the multiplex , like “ Titanic ” and “ The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King , ” figured prominently in the awards race .
Oscar producers already were bracing for low ratings due to an overall viewership slump in network TV this broadcast season , exacerbated by a glut of reruns and reality shows triggered by the recently settled Hollywood writers strike .
Still , the Academy Awards show ranks as the year ’s highest - rated entertainment special and a cash cow for Walt Disney Co. ’s ABC , which raked in an average of $ 1.8 million for each 30 - second spot , up 7 percent from a year ago .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Iraq war may not dominate U.S. news reports as the carnage drops , but a new report underscores the financial burden of persistent combat that is helping run up the government ’s credit card .

“ Funding for U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and other activities in the war on terrorism expanded significantly in 2007 , ” the Congressional Budget Office said in a report released on Wednesday .
War funding , which averaged about $ 93 billion a year from 2003 through 2005 , rose to $ 120 billion in 2006 and $ 171 billion in 2007 and President George W. Bush has asked for $ 193 billion in 2008 , the nonpartisan office wrote .
“ It keeps going up , up and away , ” Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad said of the money spent in Iraq since U.S. troops invaded in 2003 .
“ We ’re seeing the war costs continue to spiral upward .
It is the additional troops plus additional costs per troop plus the over - reliance on private contractors , which also explodes the costs , ” said Conrad , a North Dakota Democrat who opposed the war .
Since the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States , Congress has written checks for $ 691 billion to pay for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and such related activities as Iraq reconstruction , the CBO said .
There are around 158,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and 27,000 in Afghanistan .
$ 11 BILLION A MONTH
Of the total , the CBO estimated that $ 440 billion had been spent on fighting in Iraq launched with the goal of ousting President Saddam Hussein from power and securing weapons of mass destruction that were never found .
All of the Iraq and Afghanistan war money -- about $ 11 billion a month -- is effectively being put on a government credit card at a time when U.S. government debt has skyrocketed to more than $ 9 trillion , up from around $ 5.6 trillion when Bush took office in January 2001 .
Bush has opposed paying the cost of waging war in Iraq and Afghanistan with tax increases or other specific offsets .
That means that nearly every penny spent gets added to the U.S. debt .
The CBO estimated that just the interest payments on the debt would total $ 234 billion this year , more than the likely $ 250 billion budget deficit for the year .
These annual deficits and steep interest payments on borrowing all get rolled into the running tally that is the government ’s debt -- the more - than - $ 9 - trillion figure .
The debt problem snowballs long - term , especially if the escalating costs of government - run health care and retirement programs are not reined in and if the United States maintains a large long - term military presence in Iraq .
Interest payments on the debt will total an estimated $ 2.7 trillion over the next decade , the CBO said .
Congress is expected to pass another round of money for the war in May or June , despite repeated attempts by Democrats to bring the fighting in Iraq to an end .
Republicans have defended the costs of the Iraq war , saying it has helped to stave off new attacks on the United States .
But Conrad said the deficit spending on the war was “ another negative trend among many negative trends ” in the budget .
Laziness is Beyond Your Control
Everyone , at least on some levels , is lazy .
I work my ass off , but am still lazy about doing things I do not enjoy doing .
If my wife asks me to wash the dishes the hand of God strikes upon me a mean streak of laziness .
It is outside my control , I swear ;)
Right now I am trying to write a sales letter , which has made me lazy , and instead made me want to write this post .
Laziness Leads to Productivity Gains
I do n't like having to think some things through too much if they can be automated .
And so tools like keyword list generators are made .
I recently found a sweet affiliate program in a field where no other affiliates existed .
For the right keywords , click value was about $ 12 a click , and I was paying like 60 cents a click .
With under an hour of work , I made hundreds of dollars in daily profit with virtually no effort .
Find Something You Love And Make it Your Own
I just logged in today and saw that my conversion stats dropped to virtually nothing over the past couple days .
Odd .
So then I searched , and like 10 affiliates ( or , more likely , 1 competing affiliate 10 times ) launched ads showing for many of the keywords I bid on , with many of them stealing my exact ad copy - word for word .
They loved my ad copy and made it their own .
Slimming Profit Margins
Bidding Wars Reduce Profits
So what is the solution ?
Maybe I increase my bids again .
But then they will increase their bids again .
A bigger and bigger piece of the profits get shipped to Google , while these clowns and I eventually compete for crumbs .
One of the reasons Google does not care if others steal your ad copy ( or all the content on your website ) is because at the end of the day they know it erodes the value of copyright and creates a bidding war that deposits more money in their bank account .
Quick Paydays
PPC affiliate marketing and arbitrage works that way , where you find a payday , hold it for a few weeks or a few months , then someone competes and the profit margins drop , unless you have a higher visitor value it keeps costing you more time to make less , until the opportunity cost exceeds your profit potential , and then you are off hunting for the next big idea .
Competitive forces make it hard for this strategy to build long - term value unless you are operating in a small market or are using a technique that is pretty dirty .
Super Affiliate Secrets
One of my friend that was doing well with PPC affiliate stuff got up to about $ 1,000 a day of profit for an affiliate network .
He ran it for about a year , then his affiliate network decided that they would find something they love and make it their own - they cloned his account and he is now making $ 0 for uncovering all the great keywords for them .
If you do n't own the supply chain or have a distribution chain that is hard to replicate your competitors consist of
other affiliates
the search engines
quality scores and algorithmic changes
the companies you affiliate with
anyone else interested in the keyword you are buying
SEO Loves Your Profit Margins
This is why I like SEO so much more than PPC .
Most people are too lazy to spend years researching their topic , years building a brand , years building links , and years building social and customer relationships .
We are afraid of failure , afraid of success , and afraid that we are investing too much in one place .
But , if someone sees me ranking in the organic results they can't just clone it unless they know SEO well , and are committed for the long haul .
In many cases , knowing SEO well means having capital , time , passion , and a lot of marketing knowledge .
Emotionally Engaged Brand Evangelists
Off the top of your head , how many people or brands in the SEO space can you think of ?
How many give you some sort of emotional response ?
How many helped you change your life for the better ?
Even in some of the most competitive and most saturated marketplaces there is not much real competition .
Thanks for the Laziness , PPC Affiliate Dude !
SEO separates out real businesses from 95 % of the people buying PPC ads .
The guy stealing ad copy is too lazy to compete at that level .
I 'll enjoy the logarithmic growth in profits ( which have been at least doubling every year ) while he keeps stealing table - scraps from Google and other affiliates until his accounts get banned .
Find Something You Love And Make it Your Own !
( LifeWire ) --
It 's a beautiful day in the neighborhood -- except your neighbor 's not exactly Mr. Rogers .
Mr. Rogers would n't let his cat use the building 's hallways as a litter box .
" I never know when I 'm going to step in a pile of poop , " says Michael Peinovich , a Web developer whose Brooklyn , New York , building houses the feline in question .
" Everybody complains , but the landlords wo n't get involved . "
As neighborly nuisances go , the kitty seems quaint compared with Catzie Vilayphonh 's Philadelphia story .
It was one thing when her neighbor kept losing her keys and getting locked out , says Vilayphonh , an editorial fashion director .
But one day , Vilayphonh fell asleep without bolting her door , and awoke to the sound of metal clinking : " I found her in my apartment , wrapped in a bedsheet , looking for quarters .
" I broke my lease and moved out . "
And bad neighbor stories are n't confined to apartment life .
Author Bill Adler Jr.'s toddler played in the backyard of his house in Washington , D.C. 's leafy Cleveland Park neighborhood , but a neighbor 's pet made the situation unsafe -- and unsanitary .
" Their dog would roam around and relieve itself , " says Adler .
" Our daughter was 2 years old .
We did n't want to have to worry about her in our own yard . "
Cybersnitching on neighbor
So what do you do when landlords wo n't listen and you feel like a prisoner in your own home ?
Brant Walker turned to the Web after he and his girlfriend settled into their new home in San Diego .
" There was this odor coming from next door , " he says .
" The tenants clearly knew about it because they'd try to air out the place by opening their door , which made it worse . "
The problem gave Walker an idea :
What if you could find out about problem neighbors before moving in ?
He created RottenNeighbor.com , where users can flag their local nuisances on a map -- anonymously or not -- and post complaints for the world to see .
The first post , in August , was Walker 's own , but within weeks a local media outlet ran a story on the site .
The next day , he woke to dozens of posts added in California .
Today , RottenNeighbor.com has " about 100,000 " posts worldwide , and Walker 's still in shock .
" I 've realized it 's universal , " he says .
" Everybody 's had a bad neighbor . "
Two sides to every story
Although his site 's current setup can enable a free - for - all for those looking to rant or badmouth others , Walker plans to expand RottenNeighbor.com in a few key ways , including taking the process offline with a real - world mediation service between sparring parties .
" We really want to turn this into a positive thing , " he says , " to help resolve issues between neighbors and make people happier where they live . "
Adler agrees that getting neighbors to appreciate each other 's point of view is the most effective step to resolution -- something he and his wife learned the hard way when that dog crept into their yard .
" We did n't deal very well , " he says .
" We made mistakes we regretted . "
He figured others could learn from his mistakes , and penned the book " Outwitting Neighbors : A Practical and Entertaining Guide to Achieving Peaceful Coexistence with the People Next Door . "
No matter what category your particular complaint is in -- and there are many , with noise topping the list --
Adler says nuisance neighbors fall into one of two groups : " those who are rude , brutish and just do n't care , and those who are simply ignorant of your side of the story . "
Adler stresses that communication is key to keeping the problem from getting downright ugly : Neighbor disputes are the No. 1 reason , in some cities and small towns , why Americans go to court , he says .
He offers these tips for coping with bad neighbors before they -- or you -- wind up before a judge ( or online ) .
Five tips for keeping the peace
1. Know your neighbors .
Upon moving in , knock on doors , introduce yourself and establish a rapport .
That way , when a problem does arise , you 'll both want to resolve it peacefully .
2. Bring problems up immediately .
Do n't delay .
The longer you wait , the bigger the problem can get -- literally , in some cases ( a new puppy , a tree that blocks your sunlight , an add - on to property ) .
3 . Ask around .
Most problems bother more than one neighbor .
Gather support to build your case , and consider talking to the offending party as a group .
4 . Be nice .
Bring your neighbor cookies or a bottle of wine .
It sets the stage for an amicable discussion .
And if you 've been confrontational , apologize .
Nothing 's more powerful -- and chances are , they 'll apologize back .
5 . Be proactive .
Try to deal with conflict on your own before taking things to the next level .
Unless the offense is truly egregious , reporting a neighbor to the police or another relevant agency is the wrong first move .
Baltimore is trying to give police more tools to deal with problems like noisy neighbors .
The city recently passed a law that allows police to order residents to leave a property for up to one year if police determine the inhabitants are creating a " neighborhood nuisance " ( such as creating excessive noise or using loud profanity ) twice over a six - month period .

Black Eyed Peas Create Obama ' Yes We Can ' Music Video
have given their celebrity endorsement to Democratic presidential candidatein perhaps a way that not many can .
They have incorporated one of his speeches into a song Yes We Can .
Created by Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas , the video is directed by Jesse Dylan , Bob Dylan 's son .
The singer said he was captivated and inspired by the speech that Obama made on the evening of the New Hampshire primary .
MANCHESTER , New Hampshire ( CNN ) -- With Tuesday 's New Hampshire primary fast approaching , Sen. Barack Obama has opened a double - digit lead over Sen. Hillary Clinton in the state , a CNN - WMUR poll found Sunday .
Obama , the first - term senator from Illinois who won last week 's Iowa caucuses , led the New York senator and former first lady 39 percent to 29 percent in a poll conducted Saturday and Sunday -- a sharp change from a poll out Saturday that showed the Democratic front - runners tied at 33 percent .
Support for former Sen. John Edwards , who edged out Clinton for second place in Iowa , dropped from 20 percent in Saturday 's poll to 16 percent .
On the Republican side , Sen. John McCain leads former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney by a narrower margin -- 32 percent to 26 percent , the survey found .
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee -- whose upset win in Iowa came after being outspent by millions of dollars by Romney -- passed former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to gain third place .
In Saturday 's poll , Giuliani had 14 percent and Huckabee had 11 percent ; those numbers were reversed on Sunday .
The results suggest that Huckabee 's win in Iowa , which saw him win strong support among evangelical Christian voters , is giving him momentum in more secular , libertarian - oriented New Hampshire , CNN Political Analyst Bill Schneider said .
Among other Republicans , anti-war Texas congressman and onetime Libertarian Party presidential nominee Ron Paul was in fifth place at 10 percent in the poll , with Rep. Duncan Hunter of California and former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee both at 1 percent .
The poll , conducted by the University of New Hampshire , surveyed 341 Democrats and 268 Republicans likely to vote in Tuesday 's New Hampshire primary .
It had a sampling error of 5 percentage points .
Watch how the candidates rank in polls »
" The Iowa caucus results have convinced growing numbers of Granite State voters that Obama can really go all the way , " CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said .
" In December , 45 percent thought Clinton had the best chance of beating the GOP nominee .
But in Saturday 's poll , Clinton and Obama were tied on that measure , and now Obama has a 42 percent to 31 percent edge over Clinton on electability . "
And CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider said the poll " strongly suggests an Obama surge in New Hampshire . "
Watch the differences between Iowa and New Hampshire caucuses »
" Obama 's gaining about three points a day , at the expense of both Clinton and Edwards , " Schneider said .
" Obama 's lead has now hit double digits going into the home stretch . "
New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson ranked fourth among the Democratic contenders with 7 percent , while Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich trailed at 2 percent .
Former Alaska Sen . Mike Gravel had less than one half of 1 percent support .
Crucial to the outcome in New Hampshire are the state 's independent voters , who make up around 40 percent of the electorate , and who can vote in either party 's primary .
The poll indicates that a growing number of registered Independents say they will vote in the GOP contest , which is a switch from just a month ago .
" That should be bad news for Obama , who was generally considered the favorite of Independents , but after the Iowa caucuses the Illinois senator has been building his support among registered Democrats and now leads Clinton among registered Democrats as well as Independents , " says Holland .
Obama also appears to be pulling even with Clinton among women , a voting bloc that she once dominated in the polls .
And when asked which candidate has the best chance of beating the Republican presidential nominee , likely Democratic primary voters now choose Obama over Clinton 42 percent to 31 percent .
That 's a dramatic reversal from the last CNN / WMUR New Hampshire poll taken after Christmas and just before the Iowa caucuses , when Clinton beat Obama in electability by a two to one margin .

All About New Hampshire • U.S. Presidential Election
Let the witch hunt begin .
Are you now or have you ever been an illegal immigrant ?
Are any of your friends illegal ?
Relatives ?
The last place you ’d expect to encounter a chilling moment is at a presidential debate sponsored by National Public Radio .
But on Tuesday , there was the NPR moderator , Steve Inskeep , asking the Democratic candidates whether American citizens have an obligation to turn in people they suspect are illegal immigrants .
It was not just a question asked in passing .
Mr. Inskeep pressed the issue .
He asked Senator Chris Dodd , for example , about the hypothetical situation of a “ citizen ” interviewing for a nanny .
“ You interview a number of applicants , ” Mr. Inskeep said .
“ They all seem very nice .
They seem like they would take care of the kids .
But it would appear that their documents may not be in order .
What would you want an American to do ? ”
If you are tired of reading long explanations and confused by tricky photo techniques , here you can have it short and sweet .
Arranged by topics , each subject takes less than 60 seconds to read .
Once you ’ve read the ideas and tips , picture in your mind some photographs you have already taken .
Think of how they could have been improved by applying what you have learned here .
Visualize how you might have taken your photos differently .
Already your photography is improving !
Light | Landscaping | People | Color | Composition | Being Ready
Light
Dancing with light
Light from the side brings out shapes , textures and structures .
That ’s why early morning and evening are rich times to photograph .
With the sun behind your subject , you get some of the most dramatic visual effects … but exposure could be tricky to get right .
Try it anyway !
When the sun is high and the light is hard , do n’t fight it to try to get it all .
Concentrate on exposing the bright parts properly and work with the shapes of shadows .
For light and shadow effects you need the sun , of course , but colours are often more intense on half - sunny or overcast days .
The color of color
Natural light is white , while artificial light is often shades of yellow , orange or green .
Our eyes naturally adjust to colored or tinted light sources to make them appear white and so will your digital camera but only within certain limits
If you want warm - colored pictures work earlier or later in the day when natural light tends to be more orange .
This image shows warm light from an evening sun but bluish shadows from the cloudless sky
Mastering flash
Balance the flash with day light for stunning results .
Your camera may offer a ‘ slow flash ’ or ‘ synchro flash ’ or ‘ daylight synchro ’ setting .
Direct flash on groups of people produces better - looking images than direct flash on a single person .
The latest cameras allow you to set high ISO speeds e.g. ISO 800 which can help avoid using flash altogether .
Avoid red - eye by turning up or providing more light in the room .
If you use your camera ’s red - eye reduction setting when taking flash photographs of people you avoid red-eye , but there ’s a delay in taking the shot which may cause you to miss the moment .
Choosing your time
Low or cross lighting at dawn or dusk produces wonderful lighting and colors .
At dawn and dusk there are natural shadows to help give depth and form to your subject .
For early evening shots , you will need longer shutter times i.e. longer exposure to make up for the low light .
This makes it likely your photographs could be blurry due to camera shake , so lean your camera on something – anything steady – to keep still during exposure .
Do n’t be afraid to point the lens at a setting sun , but whatever you do avoid looking at the sun directly , especially through the viewfinder of your camera .
Landscaping your photos
Composition essentials
It ’s best to keep your horizons level in your photographs , otherwise your shots will appear crooked ( unless that ’s what you want ! ) .
Keep the main points of interest away from the centre , and from the extreme edges – better , still , try placing them in different parts of the image and see which works best .
Do n’t shoot everything from a standing position .
Look for unusual angles by changing yours ( and the camera ’s position ) .
Better to avoid completely empty space in your photos .
Framing the lines
Do n’t be afraid to use take portrait photographs – that is , with the camera on its side .
Use natural features in the environment to create a frame for your subject or to lead the eye through the image .
Zoom in to create a sense of intimacy .
Remove from your shots elements like the sun or the sky , which give a feeling of open space .
Experiment with framing .
Try framing your shots with lots of foreground and very little sky , or lots of sky and very little land .
Zooming around
Zooming - out allows you to capture more of the view .
A wide - angle lens will keep everything in focus while helping to maximise the ‘ depth of field ’ , or feeling of depth in your shots .
Zooming - in will flatten the sense of perspective and make distant objects appear closer together .
Zooming - in will also affect the amount of your picture that is in focus allowing you to isolate details against an out - of - focus foreground and / or background .
Be careful to avoid camera shake when zoomed right in , as tiny movements in your hands become magnified .
Prospecting the perspective
Create perspective by using the lines and shapes within the shot to draw the eye .
Tall buildings can appear to ‘ lean back ’ when photographed .
Getting something in the foreground of your shot helps balance this .
Increase the sense of perspective by using a wide - angle lens and adding foreground interest .
A low viewpoint and wide - angle setting helps to contrast the size and shape of objects in interesting ways .
Foregrounding
Foreground is the area that is closest to the camera : the stronger it is , the stronger the rest of the image .
An object in the foreground first invites the eye , then lead the viewer deeper into the photo .
Include foreground objects to add a sense of scale and perspective
Experiment with allowing the foreground to totally dominate the photo
Cool proportions
The central part of your scene usually draws the camera like a magnet so it ends up in the centre – try resisting that tendency
Place the main point of interest towards the sides of your photographs for more dynamic compositions
Place your horizon near the top or bottom of your shots to add emphasis to the ground or to the sky
In this picture you can see there is a smallish amount of sky while the rocks have been placed high in the image to allow the silhouette of the trees to be significant .
People with you
Lighting faces
The soft light you get on overcast days is especially good for photographing people , as it delivers the best skin tones
Side or ‘ cross ’ lighting is more interesting because it gives depth and form to your portrait sitter
Keep backgrounds and other distractions to the minimum so that the viewer can concentrate on the face
In this picture , soft light from a window lights the faces of the girls from the side , while a zoomed - in setting throws the foreground face out of focus .
Depth of feeling
Use your zoom lens to shorten the ‘ depth of field ’ ( depth sharpness ) in your photograph , and throw the background out of focus .
This adds emphasis to your subject .
Use your zoom lens to fill your photograph , rather than leaving your main point of interest floating in space .
Zooming in will flatten perspective , which generally produces a more flattering shot of your subject .
In this picture , a zoomed - in setting focuses on the girl , throwing the foreground objects out of focus .
Natural frames
Use a person ’s surroundings to be a natural picture frame the photo
People will often smile and pose stiffly for their portrait : if you do n’t want a smile take two or more pictures – a second or two after a smile , the pose relaxes and you have a more natural shot .
Look for the natural junctions of the human body ( where it seems natural to ‘ cut - off ’ ) if you are not including the whole person in the shot .
Soft light is easiest to work with : try sitting your subject near a window .
Childish tricks
Get the children used to you and the camera by firing off lots of shots first .
For small children , pre-focus the camera .
This is done on most digital cameras by pressing down halfway on the shutter button .
Then move yourself backwards and forwards with the child to keep the shot in focus .
Get down on your hands and knees to stay level with your subject and appear less intimidating .
Use something to draw the child ’s attention away from the fact that they are having their photograph taken .
Coloring the essentials
Bolder colors
Redder colors will create a warmer feel for your shots than blues or greens .
color affects the way we look at pictures , so try to use color creatively in your shots .
Look for images that contain contrasting colors , such as red and green or yellow and purple , to add tension or drama .
Using shades of the same colors will create a sense of harmony .
The best light is free
Bright sunlight gives colors a more intense or ‘ saturated ’ feel .
Midday light has a bluer quality , which can give photos a harsher feel .
Try to place strong colors against large areas of even tone or color – this helps bring out their intensity
Look for color contrasts – red with blues and greens , for example .
Photographs taken at the beginning or end of the day will have a warmer tone due to the natural orangeness of the light .
Emotional colors
Different dominant colors lead your viewer towards different emotions which impacts on the way your shot is experienced
Yellow is associated with happiness , but orange may moves us toward concern – hence the use of amber as a warning light .
Red is the universal color of warning .
Use it with caution – a little bit of red in your shot goes a long way !
Greens and blues usually have a calming effect , hence their association with landscape
The many colors in this shot are held together by the large areas of yellows , giving it an unmistakeable sunny Mediterranean mood .
Composition
Lines of force
You can create a sense of direction using naturally occurring lines .
Slanting or ‘ oblique ’ lines imply movement , action and change .
Curved lines or S - shaped lines imply quiet , calm and sensual feelings .
Lines that converge imply depth , scale and distance , for example , the outer edges of a road converge as it disappears into the distance , giving a two - dimension image three - dimensional depth .
Repetitive elements create a sense of rhythm , which is often more interesting if the rhythm is broken by a missed element .
Thirds
Imagine two horizontal and two vertical lines equally dividing your shot , then place subjects on the lines or where they intersect with each other : this can be a help in deciding on compositions
Place your horizon on the top or bottom line to add emphasis to the ground or to the sky respectively .
In this picture , the composition combines color contrasts with proportions closer to another principle , the Golden Section , which gives pleasing proportions .
Just pushing your composition slightly to one side so it feels a little uncomfortable can give your photos a dynamic it would n’t otherwise have .
Focusing away
The human eye is drawn to elements that are in focus , and this will influence how your photo is seen .
Auto - focus ( standard on most digital cameras ) will focus on what is in the centre of the frame .
Use pre-focus to move your subject away from the centre of the frame .
( This is done on most digital cameras by pressing down halfway on the shutter button . )
Use your zoom lens to reduce the ‘ depth of field ’ ( sense of depth ) and throw the background out of focus .
This will emphasise any in - focus element in the foreground .

Being ready
Drive your motor
Take lots of pictures .
With digital cameras shots cost you hardly anything at all .
Move around as you photograph to experiment and give yourself plenty of choice later .
Stay alert for that chance - of - a - lifetime shot : keep your camera turned ON , keep your mind switched to ON .
In this picture , the golden eagle put its wing on the falconer for only a few very short seconds , and the falconer grinned for even less time !
Vantage points
It is almost always worth clambering up a wall or steps to get a little higher – but do n’t get yourself into trouble with authorities .
You may also have to wait for the best light .
And you might have to wait for a composition of passing people to arrange itself
The best position may depend on the zoom setting that you choose .
In this picture , I had to wait nearly thirty minutes for everyone to get themselves into position .
Shutter lag
Shutter lag is the time a digital camera needs to capture a picture after you have pressed the shutter button .
Reduce shutter lag by focusing beforehand , hold the shutter button down half - way or half - pressure and wait for the moment .
Reduce shutter lag by turning off any unnecessary automatic features such as red - eye reduction .
In this picture , the only way to catch the air force jets at the right instant was to release the shutter just before they reached their ideal positions .
Always ready
If you see a good picture you may be early : an even better one may come in a few seconds
Get your exposure and focusing and framing set up while you wait for the perfect shot
Hold the camera to your eye all the time ; in the half - second it takes lift the camera you could miss the shot
In this picture , I spotted the shepherd from a car , screeched / skidded to a halt , got the car to disappear and waited for the flock to approach me – using the time to work out the best viewpoint to meet them .

I majored in physics engineering for five years before I realized that I did n't like it .
I had always wanted to know what made the world tick and thought science would tell me .
But after repeatedly being told that the laws I learned the previous quarter were not really true and what I was to learn the current quarter was the real skinny , I gave up in disgust and searched desperately for another major .
Since I had always done well in mathematics , I searched my soul and devoured books on philosophy to find some justification for studying mathematics .
At the time I saw mathematics as a tool of science , not an end in itself .
Gradually , like a cult leader , I convinced myself that mathematics is indeed a worthy subject .
Here was my argument .
Science invents a theory to explain physical phenomena and then designs experiments which either disprove the theory or add to its plausibility .
The musings of G. H. Hardy notwithstanding , science proves nothing .
On the other hand , proof is everything in mathematics .
A theorem proved in freshman calculus is still true after graduation .
What a comfort !
Armed with the zeal of a Moonie , I switched majors to mathemaics and hounded everyone I could to give me mathematical problems to solve .
You know first hand how irritating that can be .
One buddy , to shut me up , gave me the following problem .
For integers n > 1 , n4 + 4 is not a prime .
I worked on this problem for days , applying in vain all the number theory I knew or could learn .
Finally , sufficiently humbled now , I asked the buddy how to solve this problem .
He said " Dummy , the polynomial factors ! " .
And indeed it does .
It is the difference of two squares in disguise :
n4 + 4 = n4 + 4n2+ 4 - 4n2 = ( n2 + 2 ) 2 - ( 2 n ) 2 = ( n2 + 2 + 2 n ) ( n2 + 2 - 2n )
My " irrational exuberance " was quelled and I learned my first painful lesson in humility .
John McCain , who won New Hampshire in 2000 , seems to be closing in on Mitt Romney there .
Rudy is trying hard .
If he can tear himself away from being on one national TV show after another , Iowa GOP caucus winner Mike Huckabee will campaign there .
But without the large cadre of resident ....
The next big test comes Tuesday in New Hampshire , where the libertarian - like license plate -- Live Free or Die -- gives Paulunteers hope they might score an even larger surprise .
Everybody except good ol ' boy Fred Thompson has put serious efforts into the Granite state .
OK , he did n't get the third place that Ron Paul said he thought his campaign might reach in Iowa .
He got fifth , 10 % .
Which , as we noted earlier , is better than the 4 % that Rudy Giuliani got .
But then like most Americans , Rudy did n't put that much effort into campaigning in Iowa .
Christian evangelicals he had in Iowa , he 's trailing and hanging on , hoping for Baptist help come South Carolina .
But before the Big Vote comes the Big Debate .
Fox News has invited five famous Republicans to a modified house trailer for a televised debate Sunday .
They did not invite Rep .
Paul , which has infuriated many people and not all of them Paul supporters , as you may have read in hundreds of comments on this blog recently .
The Manchester Union Leader , New Hampshire 's major newspaper , ran a front - page editorial Thursday by its publisher , Joseph McQuaid , criticizing media that do not invite all serious candidates such as Paul because then it's big media and not regular New Hampshire voters making the decision .
Fox does n't return phone calls or e-mails seeking an explanation for excluding Paul , probably because it 's very difficult to explain how you invite Giuliani , who 's already lost one election to Paul , and the more - famous Thompson , who ran ahead of the lesser - known Paul in Iowa but trails him in New Hampshire polls .
And , frankly , Paul probably leads all Republicans in fourth - quarter fundraising with his nearly $ 20 million haul .
But you wo n't be able to hear him on Fox Sunday where he would be the only Republican candidate to oppose the Iraq war , advocate pulling our troops home from all around the world to save money for domestic needs and slashing numerous federal departments .
While personally pro-life , Paul , an ob - gyn , would leave abortion or anti-abortion laws to the individual states as part of his strict constitutionalist approach .
Paul 's followers see the Fox News exclusion as part of a broader corporate conspiracy by the mainstream media to squelch the 72 - year - old , 10 - term Republican representative .
That does n't explain how this item and this item and this item and this item , among many others , got into this blog .
But that does n't really matter because no one will hear Paul speak in the debate on Fox News Sunday .
Fox says the trailer is too small for more candidates .
Ron Paul supporters have deluged feedback@foxnews.com with complaints .
They are urging a boycott of all Fox advertisers and are exploring some kind of alternative event on Sunday .
Maybe they could rent a larger trailer and invite Chris Wallace and the five famous Republicans over for a chat .
And if those people do n't show up , the Paul folks could set out empty chairs and pitch their own platform for the entire program .

Without insurance cancer often found later By Yvonne S. Lee
CNN Medical Producer
The late stages of cancer are brutal .
I remember an ugly tangle of tubes around my grandmother 's body , her desperate , humiliating struggle for each breath , her body slumped over as sweaty white skin hung off the emaciated body of this once - mighty woman .
She was the family matriarch , a woman who had fed three hungry children and a half - dozen nieces and nephews through the worst days of the Korean War .
She started smoking because she was hungry .
She got her first cigarettes from American soldiers stationed in Korea during the war .
She said they helped her feel less ravenous .
Doctors were n't able to save her .
Advanced lung cancer was hard to detect and just was n't curable in the late 1970s .
It still is n't .
Only 16 percent of cases in the United States are detected in Stage 1 , when tumors are still confined to the lung .
It turns out that thousands of patients in the U.S. have to endure what my grandmother did - trying to survive after their cancer is diagnosed at a late stage .
But many of those people find out they have advanced cancer because they do not have health insurance - something my grandmother did have - and therefore have limited access to health care and early cancer screening .
A new American Cancer Society study published in the journal Lancet looked at 3.7 million cancer patients - the largest study of its kind - and found that uninsured and underinsured patients are twice as likely to learn about their cancer in its late stages of cancer as people who have private insurance .
When I read this , I thought about all the people who have to watch their loved ones die of cancers that could have been successfully treated had the disease been caught earlier .
It seems tragic that if they'd had insurance , perhaps they would have gotten pre-screened for breast , colon and other cancers .
Catching these cancers early means you 're much more likely to live longer .
If colon cancer is diagnosed in Stage 1 , you have a 93 percent chance of surviving five years .
This drops to 8 percent if it 's found at Stage 4 .
According to the study , uninsured people were twice as likely get their diagnosis at an advanced stage of colon cancer versus an early stage .
The statistics were n't any better for breast cancer .
Women without insurance were nearly three times as likely to learn they have cancer at a later stage rather than an earlier stage .
If breast cancer is diagnosed late , your chance of surviving five years goes down by 80 percent .
These are scary numbers when you consider that 47 million Americans do n't have health insurance .
That 's 47 million people who are taking a chance , whether by circumstance or because they have no choice , that they wo n't become seriously ill ; 47 million who may have to rely on emergency rooms if they do ; 47 million who do n't have the luxury of calling their family doctor to ask about a pain in their chest , or a lump in their breast .
They just have to grin and bear it , or hope that it 's nothing .
I think about having five more years with my grandmother .
I would have asked her what it was like to live during the Japanese colonization of Korea , when she escaped with her family to China , or how she was able to feed her children during the Korean War , with only a sack of rice to get through most weeks .
For me , health insurance is not a political issue , it 's a moral issue .
Poverty should n't mean that you are more likely to die from diseases that we can treat effectively if caught early .
It should n't mean you get less time with your kids , or grandkids - not in the richest country in the world .
Are you uninsured or on Medicaid ?
Was your cancer diagnosed at a later stage because you did n't have insurance ?
Tell us your story .

The Smell of Space
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey drew congressional fire on Wednesday for refusing to rule on the legality of waterboarding , and said the CIA may again seek to use the harsh interrogation method .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey and President Bush at the White House , December 12 , 2007 .
Mukasey faces a clash on Wednesday with Senate Democrats after he rejected demands to rule on the legality of an interrogation technique known as waterboarding REUTERS / Jim Young
But Mukasey said before any CIA resumption of waterboarding , a simulated drowning technique condemned by much of the world as torture , he or his successors would determine if it is lawful and the matter would go to the president .
“ Those steps may never be taken , but if they are I commit to you today that this committee will be notified , ” Mukasey told the Senate Judiciary Committee .
The Bush administration has come under heavy scrutiny from critics at home and abroad over harsh interrogation methods used on terrorism suspects since the September 11 attacks .
The CIA used waterboarding soon after it began interrogating people captured in President George W. Bush ’s war on terrorism .
The president has said the United States does not torture .
Waterboarding is prohibited in the U.S. military .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , a Vermont Democrat , opened Wednesday ’s hearing by saying , “ This administration has so twisted America ’s role , law and values that our own State Department , our military officers and , apparently , America ’s top law enforcement officer , are now instructed by the White House not to say that waterboarding is torture and illegal . ”
“ Never mind that waterboarding has been recognized as torture for the last 500 years , ” Leahy said .
“ Never mind that President Teddy Roosevelt properly prosecuted Americans soldiers for this more than 100 years ago . ”
Following nearly four hours of grilling of Mukasey by committee members , Leahy closed the hearing , saying the moral authority of the United States was at stake .
FINAL PRESIDENTIAL SAY
The Senate narrowly confirmed Mukasey in November to replace Alberto Gonzales as chief U.S. law enforcement officer .
Many voted no largely because of Mukasey ’s refusal to say if waterboarding is torture and therefore violates U.S. law .
Mukasey promised during his confirmation hearing that he would review the legality of interrogation techniques used by the CIA if he became attorney general .
He testified on Wednesday he had been authorized to say what had already been reported -- that waterboarding is not currently used by the CIA .
Therefore , he said , he would not rule on its legality .
Mukasey ’s comments irritated lawmakers , and prompted Sen. Edward Kennedy , a Massachusett Democrat , to ask him , “ Would waterboarding be torture if it was done to you ? ”
“ I would feel that it was , ” Mukasey replied .
But the attorney general added , “ This is an issue on which people of equal intelligence and equal good faith and equal vehemence have differed . ”
Lawmakers praised Mukasey for ordering a federal probe this month into the CIA ’s destruction of videotapes of the harsh interrogation of two terrorism suspects in 2002 .
Yet senators voiced frustration that Mukasey did not commit to investigate whether CIA personnel who had used waterboarding violated the law .
Mukasey said he first wanted to see the results of the investigation of the destroyed tapes , which may disclose how questioning of detainees was conducted .
Mukasey became attorney general after Gonzales resigned in September under pressure from Democrats and Republicans who questioned his competency and honesty and accused him of having become a political tool of the White House .

ECONOMISTS and other humans do n’t always see eye to eye .
“ Economists tend to think people are crazy because they wo n’t sell their houses for less than they paid for them — and people think economists are crazy for thinking things exactly like that , ” said Professor Christopher Mayer , director of the Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate at Columbia Business School and an authority on real estate economics .
With house prices falling in many markets around the nation , this particular quirk of the human psyche might end up costing the economy a great deal , Professor Mayer says .
Classical economics can’t explain this behavior .
That ’s because people who refuse to sell their houses for less than they paid for them are violating a cardinal rule of the market : stuff is worth what it ’s worth .
It does n’t matter what you paid for it .
But when Professor Mayer and his co-author , David Genesove , a professor of economics at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem , studied the Boston condominium market in the 1990s — scene of one of the biggest real estate busts in recent American memory — the actual patterns of human behavior did not seem to follow the standard rules at all .
From 1989 to 1992 , prices in Boston fell sharply , with condominium prices dropping as much as 40 percent .
For a great many of those who bought condominiums during that period , selling could be done only at a significant loss .
And , basically , many people refused to sell .

Reportáž z ú stavu , který vzbudil rozruch v Británii
To není klec .
To je dětská postýlka .
Muži v ní je dvaadvacet let .
| Foto : Ludvík Hradilek
Liběšice - Je krátce před polednem a v Ústavu sociální péče v Liběšicích většina ze 140 klientů čeká na oběd .
Osmnáct z nich však leží zavřeno v posteli obehnané mřížemi .
Reportéři Aktuálně.cz navštívili zařízení , kde britská BBC natočila skrytou kamerou záběry dětí v klecích .
Přečtěte si podrobnosti : Češi pořád zavírají lidi do klecí , zjistila BBC
Zákon platící od roku 2007 neumožňuje klecová a síťová lůžka používat .
Některé ústavy , mezi nimi i Liběšice , se s tím však popasovaly po svém .
Místo do klecí zavírají klienty do míst , která nazývají " postýlka " .
Princip je však úplně stejný - postel je ze všech stran obehnaná kovovými tyčemi do takové výšky , aby se z ní klient nemohl dostat .
Některé uživatele dokonce před zraky reportér ů Aktuálně.cz zaměstnanci znehybňovali ortopedick ými pomůckami .
Za mřížemi s ortézami na rukou
V prvním patře starého zámku žijí lidé s nejtěžším postižením .
Dva pokoje se však od ostatních liší .
Podél stěn stojí jedna klec vedle druhé .
Žijí v nich děti v rozmezí od 7 let , ale i dospělí lidé kolem 20 let .
Důvod je jediný : strach personálu , že by uživatelé spadli a obava z většího množství práce .
" Jsou to dětské postýlky , které normálně nabízejí v katalogu , i my jsme je měli doma , " říká vrchní sestra Blažena Pešková .
" Je to pro jejich dobro .
Z normálních postelí by mohli spadnout , proto musí být takto chráněni . "
O tom , že 18 lidí z tohoto ú stavu žije zavřeno v prostoru o rozloze 1 x 2 metry za kovovými mřížemi , nerozhodoval žádný lékař .
Pro zam ěstnance ú stavu je to běžná praxe .
" Není potřeba , aby o tom někdo rozhodoval .
Pokud to brání úrazu , tak to podle nás není restriktivní opatření , které by měl někdo schvalovat , " říká paní Pešková .
" Podle mě je lepší , když jsou tam zavřeni , než aby si ublížili .
Stejně jsou imobilní , tak je v ničem neomezujeme .
Kdybychom to neměli , tak by je personál musel hlídat . "
Zatímco vrchní sestra popisuje výhody " postýlek " , další sestra uvazuje jednoho z uživatelů do podivného postroje , který upevňuje jeho ruce k tělu .
Některé děti ležící v kleci mají na obou rukou ortézy .
Vrchní sestru to nepřekvapuje .
" To tady dáváme tak deseti uživatelům , " říká .
" Je to proto , aby se sami nepoškozovali .
Ten , co má ortézy na rukou , si často sahal do pusy a vyvolával zvracení , tohle mu zabrání , aby si na obličej dosáhl . "
Ústav prý dosud nikdo za jejich postupy nekritizoval .
" Byl tu i kraj na kontrole a nic nám nevytkli , " říká vrchní sestra .
" A my necítíme potřebu to měnit .
Myslím , že to tu není špatné . "
Je mi to líto
Právě tento ústav byl jedním z osmi , které navštívili britští novináři , a ve kterém pořídili skrytou kamerou záběry dětí v kleci .
" Vydávali se za Holanďany , kteří nám chtěli dát peníze , " říká vrchní sestra Pražáková .
" Pořád se ptali , kde máme ty postele , ale neřekli na rovinu , že je chtějí vidět . "
O tom , že byli natáčeni se dozvěděli až dnes .
" Nemám špatný pocit , nic nepřekračujeme , " je si jistá paní Pražáková .
" Jen je mi to líto , pořád se tu snažíme něco s uživateli dělat a nikdo nám neřekl , že tohle je špatně . "
Postýlka nebo klec ?
Podle Evy Pogodové , expertky na tuto problematiku , která školí zaměstnance , jak pracovat s klienty ústavů bez používání omezujících prostředků , je však jednoznačné , že takto se s lidmi zacházet nesmí .
" Toto je absolutně nepřípustné , " říká Eva Pogodová , ředitelka Asociace průvodců v problematice rizikového chování .
" Pokud klienti nemají možnost vyjít odtamtud o své vůli , natož pokud jsou imobilní , jde o restrikci , kterou zákon v žádném případě nepovoluje . "
V dětských postýlkách navíc podle ní nemají co dělat lidé ani děti starší tří let .
V Liběšicích žijí ve světě obehnaném mřížemi děti od 7 let i dospělí .
Laciné triky
S tím ale nesouhlasí ministr práce a sociálních věcí Petr Nečas .
" Je to normální , mé děti taky byly do tří let v postýlce s postranicemi , " řekl Aktuálně.cz ministr .
" Není důležité , že těm klientům je dvacet , důležitý je jejich mentální věk . "
Dokument : Ministerstvo vydalo dnes odpoledne k situaci tiskovou zprávu , kterou si můžete přečíst ZDE
Reportáž BBC pak označil za manipulaci .
" Je to klasická novinářská manipulace , " řekl Nečas .
" Zajímá mě ta problematika , mám o to starost , ale odmítám skákat na laciné a hloupé triky BBC . "
Podle Nečase je totiž používání těchto " postelí , " ve kterých klienti tráví i celé dny , v souladu se zákonem .
" Je možné je používat se souhlasem lékaře a opatrovníka , " říká .
" Nevím , jestli v Liběšicích toto dodržují , pokud bude existovat podezření , že by mohla být porušena práva uživatelů , pak to musí být prověřeno . "
Ministerstvo proto vyšle do ústavů zmíněných v reportáži BBC kontrolu .
As I mentioned yesterday , I got slightly obsessed with researching oscilloscope hacks yesterday , after seeing this jaw - dropping graphic demo released at Assembly 2007 :
The author released the audio files ( FLAC and WAV ) , allowing other people to try it on their own hardware or software scopes and post the results .
Digging around for oscilloscope art led me to one of the first video games ( but not the first ) , William Higinbotham ’s Tennis for Two from 1958 .
Though it looks like Pong , its controls were more complex , letting the player set the force and trajectory of their stroke .
Here ’s a simulator for Windows , if you want to try it yourself .
Since oscilloscopes are X - Y vector displays , it ’s not surprising that people have attempted to play classic vector games on their scopes .
Moose hacked MAME to render frames as audio to the PC soundcard , letting him play Asteroids and Star Wars on his Cole S1001 scope .
Clones of Pong , Breakout , Snake , The Game of Life , and Duck Hunt have all been ported to oscilloscopes , but I think my favorite is Scopetris .
In “ Altercations , ” Ray Sweeten uses an oscilloscope and a tremendous amount of noise in real - time performance art .
This one ’s for fans of Merzbow .
Finally , this is more of an audio visualization of a software hack , but Mike Kan created a real - time visualization of a Mac OS booting up and accessing the filesystem and memory .
Beautiful .
For more oscilloscope fun , see Phil Torrone ’s great roundup on Make , and related coverage .
You can use freely - available software to make your own oscilloscope , or hack together one with a PIC controller , an old hard drive , or an old TV .
P.S. I typed this entry on an oscilloscope terminal .
February 15 Update : Inspired by this post , Matt Comi wrote a Ruby script called Oscillofy that turns any image into an oscilloscope - ready audio file .
February 14 , 2011 : NintendoScope plays GameBoy games on an oscilloscope .
Jamie Zawinski's public service backup announcement starts off with a bang :
Option 1 : Learn not to care about your data .
Do n't save any old email , use a film camera , and only listen to physical CDs and not MP3s .
If you have no possessions , you have nothing to lose .
This is obviously meant as satire , but it 's disturbingly close to reality for me .
I suppose everything in my life that 's worth capturing ... well , let me put it this way : you 're reading it .
When I said make it public , I really meant it .
Still , I 'm fairly sure Jamie was kidding , and while Google may be a great service , it 's only a so - so backup mechanism .
Let 's proceed to option 2 , which goes something like this :
1 ) You have a computer .
It came with a hard drive in it .
Go buy two more drives of the same size or larger .
If the drive in your computer is SATA2 , get SATA2 .
If it 's a 2.5 " laptop drive , get two of those .
Brand does n't matter , but physical measurements and connectors should match .
2 ) Get external enclosures for both of them .
The enclosures are under $ 30 .
3 ) Put one of these drives in its enclosure on your desk .
Name it something clever like " Backup " .
If you are using a Mac , the command you use to back up is this : sudo rsync - vaxE -- delete -- ignore - errors / / Volumes / Backup /
If you 're using Linux , it 's something a lot like that .
If you 're using Windows , go f*ck yourself .
Yeah !
Take that , Windows users !
Hey , wait a second .
I use Windows .
Did I mention that Jamie is a funny guy ?
Moving on .
I 've long been a fan of inexpensive hard drive enclosures .
Jamie 's advice confirms my long held opinion that multiple hard drives are the most effective and easy backup process you 'll ever find .
The rsync command is more than a simple copy ; it actually does a block - by - block comparison , only copying the differences .
So instead of backing up the entire contents of your hard drive ( again ) , you only back up the parts that changed since your last backup .
This is commonly known as incremental backup .
Incremental backups only have value if you 're doing them regularly , so it 's only natural to schedule this as a recurring task .
4 ) If you have a desktop computer , have this happen every morning at 5 AM by creating a temporary text file containing this line : 0 5 * * * rsync -vaxE -- delete -- ignore - errors / / Volumes / Backup / and then doing sudo crontab -u root that - file
If you have a laptop , do that before you go to bed .
Really .
Every night when you plug your laptop in to charge .
5 ) If you 're on a Mac , that backup drive will be bootable .
That means that when ( WHEN ) your internal drive scorches itself , you can just take your backup drive and put it in your computer and go .
This is nice .
6 ) When ( WHEN ) your backup drive goes bad , which you will notice because your last backup failed , replace it immediately .
This is your number one priority .
Do n't wait until the weekend when you have time , do it now , before you so much as touch your computer again .
Do it before goddamned breakfast .
The universe tends toward maximum irony .
Do n't push it .
7 ) That third drive ?
Do a backup onto it the same way , then take that to your office and lock it in a desk .
Every few months , bring it home , do a backup , and immediately take it away again .
This is your " my house burned down " backup .
What I like about Jamie 's approach is that it 's totally KISS , yet it touches all the cornerstones of a solid backup strategy :
Pick a simple backup strategy you can live with .
Make incremental backups a part of your daily routine .
Include an off - site backup in your strategy .
And for the dissenters , although I can't imagine too many with the minimalist backup process Jamie outlined , there 's this bon mot :
" OMG , three drives is so expensive !
That sounds like a hassle ! "
Shut up .
I know things .
You will listen to me .
Do it anyway .
I 'm not sure Windows users have a direct equivalent of rsync .
There is , of course , RoboCopy , and it looks like someone has ported rsync to Windows .
But let 's face it .
I 'm a Windows user .
When I have a problem , I buy software .
That 's why , after hearing so many great things about it , I recently purchased a copy of Acronis True Image .
Acronis does a lot of things , but most of all it 's drive imaging software , a fancy GUI over the rsync command .
With Jamie 's recommended two external hard drives in tow , I can use Acronis to create a bootable mirror image of my hard drive .
If anything at all goes wrong , I simply swap hard drives , and I 'm back in business .
I can even create those backup images incrementally and on a schedule .
You do n't even technically need a second or third hard drive ; if you have a large enough primary drive , Acronis will allow you to create a new , hidden partition to store a complete backup image .
You can restore these disk images from within Windows proper , during pre-boot , or from bootable USB or optical media .
It is very cool , a logical evolution of the more primitive drive imaging products I 've used for years .
Of course , as much as I am enamored of it , you do n't have to spend thirty bucks on Acronis and even more for two external hard drives to have a decent backup strategy .
Lots of people use completely internet based backup services , like Mozy , Carbonite , or JungleDisk , with varying degrees of success .
One thing 's for sure : until you have a backup strategy of some kind , you 're screwed , you just do n't know it yet .
If backing up your data sounds like a hassle , that 's because it is .
Shut up .
I know things .
You will listen to me .
Do it anyway .
A summit in Delhi has highlighted statistics compiled by WaterAid in India which show that just 15 % of rural people have access to a toilet .
( Photos : WaterAid )
Many people are still forced to go to the toilet on the side of a road or by water which will then be used for cooking , cleaning and washing .
In India alone , more than 700 million people have no access to toilets with proper waste disposal systems .
Because open defecation is widely practised in India , WaterAid along with government agencies and other NGOs are embarking on a comprehensive latrine building programme .
But to do this , difficult cultural barriers have to be overcome .
Illiterate rural people need to be educated as to why they need to use latrines , and the importance of hygiene .
Progress has been made .
WaterAid and other NGOs have developed methods to ensure more and more rural people are gaining access to safe , sustainable and affordable latrines .
Sanitation committees comprising local people have been formed across the country to ensure that once the latrines have been constructed , they remain clean and hygienic .
" No one was hygienic or clean before , " says Fulbati .
" We were all living in unclean conditions .
Malaria , diarrhoea , fever , vomiting ; they were common .
Now it 's not so bad . "
" I can now go to the toilet on my own , " says eight - year - old Sonu .
" Before when I needed to go in the night I had to wake my father up to come with me as I was scared . "

What are these ?
BILL MOYERS : She was a spark plug in my PBS series on Genesis , her books are best sellers , " The History of God " , " The Battle for God " , " Jerusalem " .
She 's written a biography of Buddha , and a short history of Islam .
Soon we 'll have her new memoir of her life after the convent where she spent seven years as a nun .
Joining me now is one of the world 's foremost students of religion , Karen Armstrong .
Thank you .
KAREN ARMSTRONG : Thank you Bill .
BILL MOYERS : If you were God , would you do away with religion ?
ARMSTRONG : Well , there are some forms of religion that must make God weep .
There are some forms of religion that are bad , just as there 's bad cooking or bad art or bad sex , you have bad religion too .
Religion that has concentrated on egotism , that 's concentrated on belligerence rather than compassion .
MOYERS : And so much of religion has been the experience of atrocity .
ARMSTRONG : But then you have to remember that this is what human beings do .
Secularism has shown that it can be just as murderous , just as lethal , uh , as religion .
Now I think one of the reasons why religion developed in the way that it did over the centuries was precisely to curb this murderous bent that we have as human beings .
MOYERS : You get September 11th ... you get the Crusades , you get ... do you remember the young Orthodox Jew who assassinated Itzhak Rabin ?
I can see him right now , looking into the camera , and he says , everything I did , I did for ...
ARMSTRONG : For God. MOYERS : ... for the glory of God. ARMSTRONG : Yes .
Yes .
Well , this is ... this is bad religion .
Compassion is not a popular virtue .
Very often when I talk to religious people , and mention how important it is that compassion is the key , that it 's the sine - qua - non of religion , people look kind of balked , and stubborn sometimes , as much to say , what 's the point of having religion if you can't disapprove of other people ?
And sometimes we use religion just to back up these unworthy hatreds , because we 're frightened too .
MOYERS : Fear ?
ARMSTRONG : There 's great fear .
We fear that if we 're not in control , other people will cut us down to size , and so we hit out first .
From the beginning , violence was associated with religion , but the advanced religions , and I 'm talking about Buddhism , Hinduism , monotheism , the Hebrew prophets , they insisted that you must transcend this violence , you must not give in to this violence , but you must learn to recognize that every single other human being is sacred .
MOYERS : That 's what we 're taught when ... growing up , you know , Jesus loves the little children .
All the children of the world , red and yellow , black and white , they are precious in his sight .
Jesus loves the little children of the world .
But as soon as they grow up , they go for each other 's throats .
ARMSTRONG : Yes .
And a lot of this talk about love and compassion can be on the rather sloppy level .
Or rather easy , facile level , where compassion is hard .
It 's nothing to do with feeling .
It 's about feeling with others .
Learning to put yourself in the position of another person .
There were years in my life when I was eaten up with misery and anger , I was sick of religion but when I got to understand what religion was really about , uh , not about dogmas , not about propping up the church , not about converting other people to your particular wavelength , but about getting rid of ego and approaching others in reverence , I became much happier .
But you have to go a long journey , a journey that takes you away from selfishness , from greed .
And that leads you to value the sacredness in all others .
I 'm thinking of Abraham in Genesis  there 's a wonderful story , where Abraham is sitting outside his tent and it's the hottest part of a Middle Eastern afternoon , and he sees three strangers on the horizon .
And now most of us would never dream of bringing a total stranger from the streets into our own homes , strangers are potentially lethal people .
But that 's exactly what Abraham does .
He runs out , he bows down before them , as though they were kings , and brings them into his encampment , and makes his wife prepare an elaborate meal .
And in the course of the ensuing conversation , it transpires quite naturally that one of those strangers is Abraham 's God , that the act of practical compassion led to a divine encounter .
In Hebrew , the word for holy , kadosh , means separate , other .
And sometimes it 's the very otherness of a stranger , someone who does n't belong to our ethnic or ideological or religious group , an otherness that can repel us initially , but which can jerk us out of our habitual selfishness , and give us intonations of that sacred otherness , which is God.
MOYERS : What happened in your case ?
You said that you came to this insight that you were n't a good person .
ARMSTRONG : After I left the convent , for 15 years I was worn out with religion , I wanted nothing whatever to do with it .
I felt disgusted with it .
If I saw someone reading a religious book on a train , I 'd think , how awful .
I had no job at all , and I was asked to do a television series on Saint Paul , and I was working with an Israeli film company ... I went to Jerusalem .
And there , very importantly , I encountered Judaism and Islam .
And up until that point , my religious life had been very parochial , been very Catholic , and I 'd never thought of Judaism as anything but the kind of prelude to Christianity , and I 'd never thought about Islam at all .
But in Jerusalem , where you see these three religions jostling together , often very uneasily , even violently , you become aware of the profound connections between them and it was the study of these other faiths that led me back to an appreciation of what religion was trying to do .
MOYERS : What appealed to you about Islam ?
Because in the context of 9/11 ... there 's so much talk about Islam as a violent religion .
We saw those suicide bombers , heard those suicide bombers invoking the name of Allah , saying they were doing this in the name of ... of God , and the name of their own faith .
So you 're saying , there are good things about this religion , that helped you rediscover your own spiritual journey .
ARMSTRONG : Ironically , the first thing that appealed to me about Islam was its pluralism .
The fact that the Koran praises all the great prophets of the past .
That Mohammed did n't believe he had come to found a new religion to which everybody had to convert , but he was just the prophet sent to the Arabs , who had n't had a prophet before , and left out of the divine plan .
There 's a story where Mohammed makes a sacred flight from Mecca to Jerusalem , to the Temple Mount .
And there he is greeted by all the great prophets of the past .
And he ascends to the divine throne , speaking to the prophets like Jesus and Aaron , Moses , he takes advice from Moses , and finally encounters Abraham at the threshold of the divine sphere .
This story of the flight of Mohammed and the ascent to the divine throne is the paradigm , the archetype of Muslim spirituality .
It reflects the ascent that every Muslim must make to God and the Sufis , when I started talking ...
MOYERS : The mystical sect .
ARMSTRONG : The mystical branch of Islam , the Sufi movement , insisted that when you had encountered God , you were neither a Jew , a Christian , a Muslim .
You were at home equally in a synagogue , a mosque , a temple or a church , because all rightly guided religion comes from God , and a man of God , once he 's glimpsed the divine , has left these man-made distinctions behind .
MOYERS : How do you explain the hatred in the world of Islam toward the west , toward America in particular ?
ARMSTRONG : Well , uh , all fundamentalist movements , that 's whether they 're Jewish , Christian or Muslim or Buddhist , all begin as an intra-religious debate , an intra-religious struggle .
Then , at a later stage , fundamentalists sometimes reach out towards a foreign foe and hence the Muslim feeling that American foreign policy is ... is holding them back .
MOYERS : Why do they think American foreign policy is the root of their ills ?
ARMSTRONG : This was very much an Arab feeling .
They feel that they are fighting a holy war ... that America fights Muslims , has killed Muslims , in Iraq , that America is still continuing to bomb Iraq ...
MOYERS : And yet in Bosnia , we went to the defense of Muslims there .
ARMSTRONG : Exactly , exactly .
There 's a running sore of the Arab - Israeli conflict , which has been festering for so long , and has become symbolic of everything that Muslims feel that is wrong with the modern world .
Just as here , in the United States , fundamentalists have symbolic issues , abortion , uh , and evolution , which they can't see rationally , but they 've become symbolic of ... of the evils of modernity .
The state of Israel , which meant that Palestinians lost their home , has become for Muslims a symbol of their impotence in the modern world .
It was n't always like this .
At the beginning of the twentieth century , every single leading Muslim intellectual was in love with the west , and wanted their countries to look just like Britain and France .
Some of them even said that the Europeans , they did n't know about America yet , that the Europeans , uh , were better Muslims than they themselves , because their modern society had enabled them to create a fairer and more just distribution of wealth , than was possible in their pre-modern climates , and that accorded more perfectly with the vision of the Quran .
Then there was the experience of colonialism under Britain and France , experiences like Suez , the Iranian revolution , Israel , and some people , not all by any means , uh , some people have allowed this ... these series of disasters to corrode into hatred .
Islam is a religion of success .
Unlike Christianity , which has as its main image , in the west at least , a man dying in a devastating , disgraceful , helpless death .
MOYERS : On a cross , crucified .
ARMSTRONG : The cross , crucified , and that turned into victory .
Mohammed was not an apparent failure .
He was a dazzling success , politically as well as spiritually , and Islam went from strength to strength to strength .
But against the West , it 's been able to make no headway , and this is as disturbing for Muslims as the discoveries of Darwin have been to some Christians .
The Quran says that if you live according to the Quranic ideal , implementing justice in your society , then your society will prosper , because this is the way human beings are supposed to live .
But whatever they do , they cannot seem to get Muslim history back on track , and this has led some , and only a minority , it must be said , to desperate conclusions .
MOYERS : You said once that you felt the fundamentalists were trying to restore God to the world .
ARMSTRONG : Yes , all fundamentalists feel that in a secular society , God has been relegated to the margin , to the periphery and they are all in different ways seeking to drag him out of that peripheral position , back to center stage .
MOYERS : They drag God back into the political world by denying democratic aspirations .
ARMSTRONG : Yes .
MOYERS : I mean , do you think democracy and fundamentalism are , uh , can co-exist ?
ARMSTRONG : Fundamentalists are not friends of democracy .
And that includes your fundamentalists in the United States .
Every fundamentalist movement I 've studied in Judaism , Christianity and Islam is convinced at some gut , visceral level that secular liberal society wants to wipe out religion .
Wants to wipe them out .
Jewish fundamentalism , for example , came into being ... came really to the fore in a new way after the Nazi Holocaust ...
And some fundamentalists in the Muslim world have experienced secularism , not as we have , as a liberating process , but so rapid and accelerated that it 's often been an assault .
The Shahs of Iran used to have their soldiers go out with their bayonets out , taking the womens ' veils off , and ripping them to pieces in front of them , because they wanted their society to look modern , never mind the fact that the vast majority of the people had not had a western education , and did n't know what was going on .
On one occasion in 1935 , Shah Reza Pahlevi , gave his soldiers orders to shoot at hundreds of unarmed demonstrators in one of the holiest shrines of Iran , who were peacefully protesting against western dress , uh , obligatory western dress , and hundreds of Iranians died that day .
Now , in a climate like this , secularism is not experienced as something benign , it 's experienced as a deadly assault .
MOYERS : When fundamentalism experienced its rebirth in this country , a quarter of a century ago , political rebirth , it was because the federal government , the Internal Revenue Service , had , uh , denied their parochial religious schools tax - exempt status ...
ARMSTRONG : Yes .
MOYERS : ... if they segregated .
ARMSTRONG : That 's right .
MOYERS : And the fundamentalists became alarmed at that , and fearing that they were going to be annihilated .
ARMSTRONG : Exactly so .
And similarly , in the famous Scopes Trial , which I think tells us a lot about the fundamentalist process in 1925 , you 'll remember , fundamentalists tried to ban the teaching of evolution in the public schools , and there was a celebrated trial , in which the fundamentalists were really ridiculed in the secular press .
After the Scopes Trial , after the ridicule , they swung to the extreme right , and there they 've remained .
MOYERS : The inequality gap in this country is larger , I believe , than in any other industrial society .
ARMSTRONG : Yes .
MOYERS : What does that say about the most religious country in the world ?
And that 's your definition .
America 's the most religious country in the world , and yet it 's the most unequal economically .
ARMSTRONG : It 's ... and this should trouble us all .
It should trouble us all .
Religious people should join hands , and fight for ... for greater equality .
Try and see if you can introduce Christian , Jewish or true Muslims values into society .
Not trying to force other people , but bringing to bear that respect for the sacred rights of others that all religions , at their best , three very important words , at their best , are trying to promote .
MOYERS : Where are you in your own journey ?
You 're not a practicing Catholic , are you ?
ARMSTRONG : No .
I usually call myself these days a freelance monotheist .
I draw nourishment from all three of the religions of Abraham , uh , I spend my life studying these faiths , in a sense I 'm still a nun .
I live alone , and I 've never married , and I spend my life writing and talking and reading and studying spirituality and God .
And I can not see in essence any one of these three faiths as superior to any of the others .
I suppose one of my hopes in life is to try to get Jews , Christians and Muslims to realize the profound unanimity , the unanimous vision that they share , and to join hands together to stop the kind of cruelty , violence and obscenity , moral obscenity that we saw on September the 11th .
MOYERS : Thank you , Sister Karen .
ARMSTRONG : Thank you , Bill .
No humans allowed on Mars ?
There are ways around such a ban .
How to beat the ban of humans on Mars For NASA and Mars , it ’s no humans allowed .
As reported by the Mars Society and other space enthusiasts , Congress is finally clamping down on the menace of human life on Mars ( see “ Why ‘ Save Mars ’ is worth the effort ” , The Space Review , November 12 , 2007 ) .
The House of Representatives version of HR 3093 , the bill that determines NASA ’s funding for 2008 , effectively bans the study of an entire planet : Provided ,
That none of the funds under this heading shall be used for any research , development , or demonstration activities related exclusively to the human exploration of Mars .
The House committee report mentions the proposed prohibition : Finally , bill language is included prohibiting funding of any research , development , or demonstration activities related exclusively to the human exploration of Mars .
In 2006 , there was an attempt to implement a Mars ban by Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) : None of the funds made available by this Act may be used for a manned space mission to Mars .
Frank was also arguing against humans and Mars back in 2005 : I agree about what was said about aeronautics ; it is so important .
I agree with space experimentation , primarily unmanned .
But sending human beings to Mars , which this bill unfortunately endorses , is an extravagance …
The chief motivation behind the ban is the old , predictable anti-human - spaceflight routine .
Robots are better for science , therefore we should have a robot - only space policy .
The counter - arguments are ignored : that establishing human / Earth life beyond Earth is progress for humankind , and that a both - robots - and - humans policy is fair to all sides .
Mars was targeted because banning other places is not yet politically feasible .
If the lunar exploration program was n’t already established , the ban would have included all destinations outside Earth orbit .
The long - term objective is to emulate the old British model and eliminate all human spaceflight , even though Britain is considering relaxing its astronaut ban .
The bill is still in Congress , and has n’t made it into law yet , but it ’s worthwhile to be prepared for a prohibition on Mars .
There are ways for NASA to continue its human spaceflight research and development without technically breaking the law …
Human exploration of places very close to Mars The Mars ban would draw a legal border between Mars and the rest of the universe .
Exploring the rocky surface of Mars would certainly be illegal , and being in the Martian atmosphere would also presumably break the law , but the ban says nothing about orbiting Mars .
If the Mars ban becomes law , it should be accompanied by a mysterious surge of interest in the human exploration of the Martian moons , Phobos and Deimos .
As long as the astronauts keep clear of the Martian atmosphere , they can explore Phobos and Deimos to their hearts ’ content .
Humanoid exploration of Mars
But the exclusive nature of the law allows a human mission to Mars to take place , if the mission also does something else .
If the hardware used to explore Mars was also used to explore the Moon , then that ’s acceptable .
The ban permits robots to explore Mars .
But the law does not specify the exact size and shape of the robot concerned .
If the robot just happened to have the same physical dimensions as a human being — if it was a humanoid robot , or android — then it could be sent to Mars using the same launch vehicles and modules as the human mission .
The robot could be equipped with biochemical functions to test the mission ’s life support systems .
And if legislators decide to lift the Mars ban , NASA could simply swap the humanoid robot with an actual human , and immediately begin a manned mission .
Inclusive exploration of Mars
The wording of the Mars ban may provide another loophole .
The ban covers activities that are “ related exclusively to the human exploration of Mars ” .
The word “ exclusively ” was necessary , otherwise activities ranging from the human exploration of the Moon to the robotic exploration of Mars could be linked to humans on Mars , and subsequently banned .
The exclusive language helps narrow down the ban .
But the exclusive nature of the law allows a human mission to Mars to take place , if the mission also does something else .
If the hardware used to explore Mars was also used to explore the Moon , then that ’s acceptable .
Most importantly , if the mission to Mars included both humans and robots , then that could also go ahead .
A humans - and - robots mission would not violate the law because it is not exclusively human .
So the law intended to enforce an anti-human , robot - only space policy may end up enforcing a both - humans - and - robots policy , which is what NASA and space enthusiasts have wanted all along .
If the anti-human - spaceflight community is serious about eliminating humans in space , it should write a better law .
And no messing around this time : Provided ,
That no funds shall be used for anything that has , does or will directly result in humans , human - derived beings or human - like objects existing at an altitude higher than 100 kilometers above sea level on planet Earth .

DOM Inspector not shipping in Firefox 3
DOM Inspector is not going to ship as a optional component in Firefox 3 .
Currently it 's available in the installer as a optional component .
This will not be the case in Firefox 3 .
The reasons for this are very good :
- it forced users to select custom install just to get the DOM Inspector
- it forced users to install Firefox again just to get the DOM Inspector if they did n't choose it on the first install
Instead it will be made available as an extension on addons.mozilla.org .
See bug 271812 for more information .
Personally I think it 's the right decision .
I just hope that it will be available very soon on addons.mozilla.org

Wannabe Jedi Knights are advised to brush up on their lightsaber techniques , dust off their copy of the Jedi Handbook , and get down to Surrey , where two Star Wars aficionados have announced their intention to open a training centre dedicated to promoting the popular alternative religion .
The plan is the brainchild of Daniel Jones , aka Morda Helol , and bruv Barney ( Jonba Hehol ) who helped start the first UK branch of the " church " in their native Anglesey and have now set their sights on a Home Counties community hall for the centre of the UK 's first Jedi academy .
Leading the worship will be 21 - year - old Master Ajec , who has not revealed his real name , according to local press reports .
Accolytes will be expected to have a copy of the aforementioned code before attending chapter meetings at which they 'll either wear Obi-Wan Kenobiesque robes or the black trousers and black t- shirt which make up Jedi civvies .
Morda Helol explained : " We are not extremists , we are not psychotics and we are not a cult .
This is a treatment plan to better your life .
It is exploiting the best parts of your life .
You can follow it completely or at you own pace .
We open our doors to anyone . "
Training to become a Jedi Master can apparently take up to two years , during which time disciples will have to master the lightsaber , study technology , martial arts and meditation and " learn the importance of neuro - linguistic programming " - something which is reckoned to act as a substitute for Jedi mind - control powers .
According to Mr Helol , he 's had offers from Brazil , France , Spain and the US to establish similar chapters .
He declared : " This is going worldwide . "
Local paper
The Courier does not provide any details as to where and when Surrey will benefit from the Jedi training centre , but rest assured we 'll provide full details as and when they become available . ®
Long before drive by shootings and police stabbings , our ancestors used some truly badass weapons against each other .
Our ancient ancestors seemed to have a knack for finding the most gruesome and painful ways to attack each other – you could even argue that no modern weapons come close to being able to inflict the same level of suffering as these ancient weapons .
You might even be forgiven for being thankful for guns with their quick deaths when you read this list of top 10 badass weapons .
This is a list of the most badass weapons in ancient history .
This list excludes weapons beyond the medieval period .
10 Culverin
Culverins were medieval guns .
These were often used by horsemen in a medieval kind of drive - by shooting .
The hand culverin were made of a simple smoothbore tube , closed at one end except for a small hole designed to fire the gunpowder .
The tube was held in place by a wooden piece which could be held under the arm .
The tube was loaded with gunpowder and lead bullets .
The culverin was fired by inserting a lighted cord into the hole .
In the image above , the hand culverin is between two small canons .
These hand culverins soon evolved into heavier portable culverins , around 40kg in weight , which required a swivel for support and aiming .
Such culverins were further equiped with back - loading sabots to facilitate reloading , and were often used on ships – a precursor to the modern canon .
9 Caltrop
A caltrop is a weapon made up of two ( or more ) sharp nails or spines arranged so that one of them always points upward from a stable base ( for example , a tetrahedron ) .
Caltrops serve to slow down the advance of horses , war elephants , and human troops .
It was said to be particularly effective against the soft feet of camels .
In modern times Caltrops have been used at times during labor strikes and other disputes .
Such devices were used by some to destroy the tires of management and replacement workers .
Because of the prevalence of caltrops during the Caterpillar strike of the mid-1990s , the state of Illinois passed a law making the possession of such devices a misdemeanor .
Iron caltrops were used as early as 331 BC at Gaugamela according to Quintus Curtius .
They were known to the Romans as tribulus or sometimes as Murex ferreus , meaning ‘ jagged iron ’ .
The Roman writer Vegetius said :
The Roman soldiers rendered [ the armed chariots ] useless chiefly by the following contrivance : at the instant the engagement began , they strewed the field of battle with caltrops , and the horses that drew the chariots , running full speed on them , were infallibly destroyed .
A caltrop is a device composed of four spikes or points arranged so that in whatever manner it is thrown on the ground , it rests on three and presents the fourth upright .
Punji sticks and caltrops were used in the Vietnam War , sometimes with poison or manure on the points .
8 Boiling Oil
Back in the day , you had to scale the walls of a city or castle before you could rape and pillage .
This led someone to the brilliant idea that you could pour boiling oil on top of the people trying to climb in .
Oil was not difficult to come by as the women would all donate their cooking oil ( a small price to pay to keep their privates private ) .
If the town ran out of oil , they would use boiling water , or other easily obtainable things like sand .
Castles were often built with special holes in the sides to make it easier to pour this blistering liquid on unsuspecting climbers .
They were so effective that they were called murder - holes .
These holes were also useful for firing arrows at attackers or throwing rocks .
Similar holes , called machicolations , were often located in the curtain walls of castles and city walls .
The parapet would project over corbels so that holes would be located over the exterior face of the wall , and arrows could be shot at , rocks dropped on , or boiling water poured over , any attackers near the wall .
Various sources claim that molten lead was also used as a weapon in this way , but there is no historical evidence to support that view .
7 Arbalest
We all know that crossbows are badass – but what about the arbalest ?
The Arbalest was a larger version of the crossbow and it had a steel prod ( “ bow ” ) .
Since an arbalest was much larger than earlier crossbows , and because of the greater tensile strength of steel , it had a greater force .
The strongest windlass - pulled arbalests could have up to 22 kN ( 5000 lbf ) strength and be accurate up to 500m .
A skilled arbalestier ( arblaster ) could shoot two bolts per minute .
Arbalests were sometimes considered inhumane or unfair weapons , since an inexperienced crossbowman could use one to kill a knight who had a lifetime of training .
The use of crossbows in European warfare dates back to Roman times and is again evident from the battle of Hastings until about 1500 AD .
They almost completely superseded hand bows in many European armies in the twelfth century for a number of reasons .
Although a longbow had greater range , could achieve comparable accuracy and faster shooting rate than an average crossbow , crossbows could release more kinetic energy and be used effectively after a week of training , while a comparable single - shot skill with a longbow could take years of practice .
Crossbows were eventually replaced in warfare by gunpowder weapons , although early guns had slower rates of fire and much worse accuracy than contemporary crossbows .
This weapon was so badass , that Pope Innocent II ( pictured to the left ) banned them at the second Lateran Council in 1139 :
We prohibit under anathema that murderous art of crossbowmen and archers , which is hateful to God , to be employed against Christians and Catholics from now on .
Today the crossbow often has a complicated legal status due to the possibility of lethal use and its similarities with both firearms .
6 Hunga Munga
The Hunga Munga is an iron fighting tool named by the African tribes south of Lake Tchad ; also called “ danisco ” by the Marghi , “ goleyo ” by the Musgu , and “ njiga ” by the Bagirmi .
It is handheld weapon and has a metal pointed blade with a curved back section and separate spike near the handle .
The weapon can be used in hand to hand combat ( Melee ) although it is normally thrown with a spinning action .
These African iron weapons are thrown with a rotatory motion ( similar to an Australian boomerang ) , and cause deep wounds with their projecting blades .
They come in many shapes and sizes and they were ( and are ) used across Africa from the Upper Nile on the east through Central Africa by Lake Tchad to the Africans of the Gaboon in West Africa .
In parts of Central Africa , these weapons are shaped like a bird ’s head .
This weapon is used in the Role - Playing game Mage The Ascension by the Euthanatos characters for their magical rituals .
Buffy ( from Buffy the Vampire Slayer – image to the right ) used one of these from time to time to battle demons that enslave their victims and force them to give up their identities .
The hunga munga was used in the opening credits of the show .
5 Morning Star
The Morning Star ( also sometimes called the goedendag or Holy Water sprinkler ) is a term used for a variety of club - like weapons with one or more sharp spikes sticking out of it .
It would normally have one big spike poking out of the top with a bunch of smaller ones around the sides .
These are often thought of as peasant weapons , but there were also very high quality ones made for the rich guys .
These weapons were most effective when you hit someone on the head with them .
The Holy Water sprinkler , was a morning star popular with the English army from the sixteenth century and made in series by professional smiths .
Some of them were over 6 foot long !
This was the favored weapon of King John of Bohemia who was blind – he would just sit on his horse and swing the thing until he hit someone ( preferably one of the bad guys ) .
In the game Mortal Kombat Deception , the character Havik ( in the picture to the right ) weilds a morning star in his form of armed combat .
The Morning Star is considered to be a Holy Weapon in Dungeons and Dragons .
Of course , when not engaged in battle , this was a useful tool for keeping thine wyfe and kids in line , or as a backscratcher .
Badass !
4 Dead Bodies
One of the upsides to siege warfare in the middle ages was the huge number of dead bodies from people who had died of plague or other mysterious illnesses .
A very handy use for these bodies was biological warfare !
Most towns would barricade themselves behind huge walls that could not be breached by the enemy – but they often relied on outside sources of fresh water .
This is where the bodies come in .
You could dump a few bodies in the rivers leading in to the town and all you had to do was wait !
A perfect opportunity to sit back and watch some jousting .
After a while , the plague would infect the town and you have a great victory !
Obviously you can’t rape and pillage too soon , but at least you did n’t lose any men ( except maybe the poor guys that had to carry the bodies to the river ) .
In the image to the left , we see Jane Godbotherer being treated for the plague .
She will eventually end up being used as a biological weapon .
Plague infection in a human occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has been infected by biting a rodent that itself has been infected by the bite of a flea carrying the disease .
This type of warfare was used before the advent of catapults which were more much more effective at infecting towns with disease .
3 Trebuchet / Catapult
With the advent of the trebuchet ( a very high powered catapult ) came the realization that plagued bodies were no longer needed to slowly kill people in a fortified town or castle – you could simply catapult a rotting or diseased animal over the ramparts – or for truly fast results , you could fling over a few beehives .
Dead horses were a popular weapon in this form of biological warfare , though anything filled with disease would do the trick .
The counterweight trebuchet appeared in both Christian and Muslim lands around the Mediterranean in the twelfth century .
It could fling three - hundred - pound ( 140 kg ) projectiles at high speeds into enemy fortifications .
Trebuchets were invented in China in about the 4th century BC , came to Europe in the 6th century AD , and did not become obsolete until the 16th century , well after the introduction of gunpowder .
Trebuchets were far more accurate than other medieval catapults .
The trebuchet could launch projectiles a distance of over half a mile ( over 750 m ) .
2 Greek Fire
Picture , if you will , a slow day on the seas .
The water is calm , the sky is blue , when suddenly , from out of nowhere , it starts raining fire !
You discover that you have just been engaged by a Greek warship and they have flame - throwers !
Yes – that ’s right , the Greeks used flame - throwers in their naval battles from around 670 AD .
So what do you do when you are being fired on by flame - throwers ?
According to one witness :
“ Every time they hurl the fire at us , we go down on our elbows and knees , and beseech Our Lord to save us from this danger . ”
In other words , not much !
The recipe for Greek fire was a closely guarded secret – even now no one really knows what it was made of .
Modern scientists have ventured a few guesses : petroleum , niter , sulfur ; or naphtha , quicklime , sulfur ; or phosphorus and saltpeter .
Regardless of the recipe , the stuff was heated in a cauldron on the ship and squirted out a giant syringe at the enemy .
But … the Chinese beat them to it
In the 3rd century BC , a flammable liquid substance was found in the Gao Nu County , located in the northeast portion of what is now the Shaanxi Province .
This “ flammable liquid ” ( called Meng Huo You ) was probably petroleum that had seeped through the ground and was floating above the local waters .
Ever the ingenious people , the Chinese put it to good use in destroying towns built with timber .
In 900 AD , the Chinese also invented the Pen Huo Qi – a piston based naphtha flamethrower .
The double - piston pump flamethrower was carefully documented and illustrated in the Chinese military manual known as the Wujing Zongyao ( image on the right ) .
It was , of course , used in siege warfare .
1 Scythed Chariot
I am sure most will agree that it does n’t get more badass than this .
A scythed chariot was a war chariot with one or more blades mounted on both ends of the axle .
The scythed chariot was pulled by a team of four horses and manned by a crew of up to three men , one driver and two warriors .
Theoretically the scythed chariot would plow through infantry lines , cutting combatants in half or at least opening gaps in the line which could be exploited .
It was difficult to get horses to charge into the tight phalanx formation of the Greek / Macedonian hoplites ( infantry ) .
The scythed chariot avoided this inherent problem for cavalry , by the scythe cutting into the formation , even when the horses avoided the men .
The blades extended horizontally for a meter on the sides of the chariot .
Xenophon , an eyewitness , describing the scythed chariots at the battle of Cunaxa says , “ These had thin scythes extending at an angle from the axle and also under the driver ’s seat , turned towards the ground ” .
A scythed chariot can be seen in the chariot race of the movie Ben Hur , operated by Messala ( here called a “ Greek chariot ” or a “ beaked chariot . ” ) .
Scythed chariots are seen in the first Colosseum scene in the movie Gladiator .
In the film Alexander by Oliver Stone , scythed chariots are shown charging into Macedonian phalanx during the beginning of Battle of Gaugamela scene .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Killer robots could become the weapon of choice for militants , a British expert said on Wednesday .
Noel Sharkey , professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at the University of Sheffield said he believed falling costs would soon make robots a realistic option for extremist groups .
Several countries and companies are developing the technology for robot weapons , with the U.S. Department of Defense leading the way .
More than 4,000 robots are deployed in Iraq .
“ The trouble is that we ca n’t really put the genie back in the bottle .
Once the new weapons are out there , they will be fairly easy to copy , ” Sharkey will tell a one - day conference organized by Britain ’s Royal United Services Institute on Wednesday .
“ How long is it going to be before the terrorists get in on the act ?
With the current prices of robot construction falling dramatically and the availability of ready - made components for the amateur market , it would n’t require a lot of skill to make autonomous robot weapons . ”
Sharkey said a small GPS - guided drone with autopilot could be made for about 250 pounds ( $ 490 ) .
THE FACTS
Stretching  long promoted as a way to prevent injury , to reduce soreness and to speed post - exercise recovery  may not fulfill its promise .
Over the years , scientists have found that stretching before or after a workout has little effect on either risk of injury or what is commonly known as delayed onset of muscle soreness , the discomfort that comes a day or more after challenging physical activity .
Numerous studies have reached this conclusion .
One of the most recent and extensive reports was published in October in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews .
The report reviewed 10 randomized studies , which over all looked at the impact of stretching before and after exercise , in repeated sessions and in intervals ranging from 40 seconds to 10 minutes .
The authors concluded that stretching had little or no effect on post - exercise soreness .
Image Credit ... Leif Parsons
Another systematic review , by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , was published in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise in 2004 .
It looked at multiple studies and found that stretching “ was not significantly associated with a reduction in total injuries , ” but also concluded that more research was needed .
WACO , Tex . 
Playing on anxieties about national security , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has produced a “ red phone moment ” advertisement that suggests she would be better able to respond to a crisis than Senator Barack Obama .
“ It ’s 3 a .m. and your children are safe and asleep , ” says a narrator as threatening music surges over dark black - and - white images .
There ’s a world crisis and the White House phone is ringing .
“ Your vote will decide who answers that call , ” the narrator says .
“ Whether it ’s someone who already knows the world ’s leaders , knows the military  someone tested and ready to lead in a dangerous world . ”
It ends with a photo of Mrs. Clinton wearing glasses and picking up the phone .
Mr. Obama , responding to the ad during a stop in Houston , said it raised “ a perfectly legitimate question . ”
ESA ’s orbiting gamma-ray observatory , Integral , has made the first unambiguous discovery of highly energetic X - rays coming from a galaxy cluster .
The find has shown the cluster to be a giant particle accelerator .
The Ophiuchus galaxy cluster is one of brightest in the sky at X - ray wavelengths .
The X - rays detected are too energetic to originate from quiescent hot gas inside the cluster and suggest instead that giant shockwaves must be rippling through the gas .
This has turned the galaxy cluster into a giant particle accelerator .
Most of the X - rays come from hot gas in the cluster , which in the case of Ophiuchus is extremely hot , at 100 million degrees Kelvin .
Four years ago , data from the Italian / Dutch BeppoSAX satellite showed a possible extra component of high - energy X - rays in a different cluster , the Coma cluster .
“ Two groups analysed the data .
One group saw the component but the other did not , ” says Dominique Eckert , Integral Science Data Centre ( ISDC ) , University of Geneva , Switzerland .
So Eckert and colleagues from ISDC launched an investigation into the mystery .
They turned to Integral and its five - year , all - sky survey and found that ESA ’s orbiting gamma-ray observatory did show an unambiguous detection of highly energetic X - rays , coming from the Ophiuchus cluster of galaxies .
These X - rays can be produced in two ways , both of which involve high - energy electrons .
The first option is that the electrons are caught in the magnetic field threading through the cluster .
In this case , the electrons would spiral around the magnetic field lines , releasing synchrotron radiation in the form of X - rays .
advertisement
The electrons would be extremely energetic , carrying over 100 000 times the energy of the electrons in the alternative scenario , which is that the electrons are perhaps colliding with microwaves left over from the origin of the Universe and now bathe all of space .
In such collisions , the electrons lose some energy , emitted as X - rays .
Determining which of these scenarios is correct is the next job for the team .
They plan to use radio telescopes to measure the magnetic field of the galaxy cluster .
They also plan to use the High Energy Stereoscopic System ( HESS ) in Namibia .
This giant telescope looks for the brief flash of light generated when highly energetic gamma rays collide with particles in Earth ’s atmosphere .
If HESS sees such flashes coming from Ophiuchus , then the astronomers will know that the synchrotron scenario is correct .
Either way , the electrons themselves are most likely to be accelerated to high energies by shockwaves travelling through the cluster gas .
The shockwaves are set up when two clusters collide and merge .
The question is how recently Ophiuchus swallowed its companion cluster .
In the synchrotron scenario , the highly energetic electrons cool very quickly .
If the team find this to be the case , then the collision must still be in progress .
In the case of microwave scattering , cooling takes a long time and the collision could have taken place at any time in the past .
Once the scientists know , they will be able to properly understand the history of the cluster .
One thing is already certain ; nature has transformed the galaxy cluster into a powerful particle accelerator , perhaps 20 times more powerful than CERN ’s Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , which begins operation in Switzerland this summer .
“ Of course the Ophiuchus cluster is somewhat bigger , ” says Stéphane Paltani , a member of the ISDC team .
While LHC is 27 km across , the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster is over two million light - years in diameter . ”
Journal reference : ' Integral discovery of non-thermal hard X - ray emission from the Ophiuchus cluster ' by D. Eckert , N. Produit , S. Paltani , A. Neronov and T. Courvoisier is to be published in a forthcoming issue of Astronomy and Astrophysics .
Commentators are talking , and rightly so , about how young voters are flocking to Barack Obama .
Their overwhelming support gave Obama his Iowa margin , kept him just a few points behind in New Hampshire and Nevada , and contributed to his massive South Carolina victory .
Young voters have n't always turned out historically , but they 're responding to Obama 's message , and together with his equally massive support from African Americans and strong appeal to independents , their passionate enthusiasm could help him expand the Democratic base enough not only to win in November , but to win decisively .
Obama also offers the chance to make this new generation part of an enduring Democratic coalition -- because once young voters support a particular party a few times in a row , they 're likely to gravitate toward that party for the rest of their lives .
That so many young Obama supporters are turning out to rally , volunteer and vote suggests that he might be one of those watershed candidates who really can bring a new generation into politics and help shape their long - term loyalties , permanently enlarging the Democratic share of the electorate .
But because of Hillary Clinton 's attacks on Obama , she risks destroying this shift just as it's beginning to emerge .
Look at the historical patterns :
Studies from the past fifty years find that party loyalties tend to form early -- for Republicans , Democrats , and independents alike .
It was true for the FDR generation , for those who came of age during the anti-war activism of the late Vietnam era , and with the young adults who helped cascade Reagan into office and whose compatriots have remained more conservative ever since .
Major historical events like wars and economic depressions can shift this .
So can political scandals and personal crises and conversions .
Systematic organizing efforts can also shift voters ' worldview and context , particularly for those politically detached , which is one reason unions matter so much .
Still , some major patterns get set early on , and that 's likely to keep being true .
Generations need several elections to cement the pattern .
The votes of 18 - to 29 - year - olds started shifting back in the Clinton years .
Young voters gave Clinton an initial 9 point margin and increased it the next round , but their turnout dropped from the highest since 18 - year - olds got the vote to the lowest in the same period ..
In 2000 , Gore led Bush among this group buy 3 % , with Ralph Nader bleeding off another 5 % .
Led by increases in young African American and Latino voters , they were the only generation to favor Kerry , and did so by a ten percent margin .
These shifts accelerated in 2006 .
Fueled by the Bush administration 's myriad disasters , young voters played a critical role , supporting Democratic congressional candidates over Republicans by a massive 60 % to 38 % difference .
They did so in every region of the country , from a three to one split in the East to a three point margin in the South .
They provided the critical margin for Senators Tester , Webb and McCaskill , and fed the victories of the four other victorious challengers .
Had it been up to young Americans alone , the Democrats would have also won Senate campaigns in Tennessee , Arizona , and Nevada ; Ned Lamont would have defeated Joe Lieberman in Connecticut , and a slew of additional House seats would have changed hands .
The Democrats would have elected Senators from 26 states , with Republicans carrying just four .
The passion of young people for Obama 's campaign is fueled by the Iraq war , an uncertain economy , major concerns about the environment and global warming , and the religious right 's attacks on sexuality .
But more than anything it's also fueled by Obama 's eloquent insistence that change is possible and that ordinary citizens can play a key role .
It 's fueled by the sense that Obama 's personal story anticipates the story of an America that moves beyond its divisions and tackles our fundamental problems .
This group also seems to resist the idea that a presidency can simply be handed down like a dynastic succession .
Participating in numbers we have n't seen in decades , these new voters fervently want Obama to win .
They 're reaching out to enlist their peers and volunteering to help reach others .
They can be a powerful force to help him prevail .
But if Hillary Clinton is nominated , this momentum will likely crumble .
The young women and men who 've been flooding the Democratic primaries and caucuses will feel betrayed by a candidate who 's just finished doing her best to destroy the person they 've invested their hopes in .
And as a result , they may simply stay home .
It 's not just that Hillary is running against Obama .
That would be fine .
It 's that she and Bill and their surrogates have relentlessly assaulted Obama 's character , in a scorched - earth style worthy of Karl Rove .
I 've devoted an entire article to documenting just a fraction of these instances : her lying about his record ( and her on ) on critical Iraq and Iran votes , and his votes on abortion choice ; her unleashing surrogates like civil rights activist turned WalMart pitchman Andy Young to explain how Obama really was n't black enough or Black Entertainment Television CEO Robert Johnson ( a virulently anti-union corporate head who 's backed Bush on issues like the estate tax and privatizing Social Security ) to refer to Obama 's youthful cocaine use , with Clinton standing next to him at a South Carolina rally .
When Hillary says Obama has no right to build up " false hopes , " and Bill calls Obama 's vision of history " a fairy tale , " how can Obama 's young supporters not feel attacked in their own hope and dreams ?
Had Clinton run a less - harsh campaign , like that of John Edwards , she might expect to inherit Obama 's passionate young voters -- and volunteers .
But given the virulence of her attacks , I just can't see them suddenly turning on a dime and enthusiastically supporting her .
Young voters are historically the least likely to participate .
The failure of the Democrats to stop Bush 's Iraq war has already made many cynical .
Obama has reversed this cynicism , but if Clinton crushes the dreams of his supporters , a great many will stay home in disgust .
Or , if they do end up voting , they certainly wo n't work to turn out their peers .
As a friend said of his community college students , " the most active ones in my class say they wo n't even vote for her if she 's nominated . "
The same is true , of course , of African American voters .
The Clinton campaign 's attempts to cage Obama in a racial box ( for instance by Bill Clinton 's dismissing his massive South Carolina victory as just an echo of Jesse Jackson 's 1984 and 1988 campaigns ) could have an equally disastrous impact on African American turnout if Hillary Clinton is the nominee come November .
Clinton also risks the defection of people who fit neither demographic , but are simply so furious at her support for Bush 's Iraq and Iran policies and her massive corporate ties , that they simply cannot let themselves vote for her .
I get those responses every time I write on the subject .
Taken together , if these groups stay home ( and Republicans mobilized by Hillary - hatred turn out ) , it 's easy to see how a candidate like John McCain could transform a prime Democratic opportunity into yet another needless defeat .
If the youth vote affected only the upcoming election , the stakes would be massive .
But it 's worse yet because Clinton 's nomination would likely shift the future votes of a generation .
If I thought Barack Obama were simply an empty suit , I 'd be skeptical too .
Like any political leader , he has his weaknesses .
I wish he 'd deferred less to the senior Senate leadership on issues like Iraq .
But then I look at his record engaging and bringing together once - powerless individuals and communities , speaking out against the war , and linking our health care crisis to his mother dying of cancer while her insurance company tried to throw her off their rolls .
I value his stress on empowering ordinary citizens to act .
I see enough actions of courage and vision to suggest his presidency might just be able to equal the sum of his powerful words .
Then I look at Clinton and wonder why she 's fighting so fiercely against her fellow Democrats , after doing so little to fight Bush 's destructive policies when he was riding high in the polls .
I think this is part of what the young voters sense too and why their hopes have soared with Obama 's campaign .
If we dash them now , we may be paying for this choice for far longer than the next four years .

LATEST VERSION : 5.31 b LAST UPDATE : 12/04/2020
Based on the well - known original memtest86 written by Chris Brady , memtest86 + is a port by some members of the x86 - secret team , now working at www.canardpc.com.
Our goal is to provide an up - to - date and completly reliable version of this software tool aimed at memory failures detection .
Memtest86 + was , is and will always be a free , open - source software .
The original Memtest86 is now handled by PassMark® Software Pty Ltd .
Memtest86 + is released under the terms of the Gnu Public License ( GPL ) .
No restrictions for use , private or commercial exist other than the ones mentioned in the Gnu Public License ( GPL ) .
Texts about the original version was taken from the original website and written by Chris Brady .
PS : A newsletter for memtest86 + updates is available / Donation for Memtest86 + welcome .
Please support free GPL software .
-= History =-
The first version of Memtest86 + was released on early 2004 , based on memtest86 v3.0 that was not updated since mid-2002 .
Our main challenge was to provide an up - to - date version of this useful tool , as reliable than the original .
Our work started when we got the first AMD64 system .
Unfortunatly , the original memtest v3.0 did n't run at all .
After looking at the source code , we fixed the bug .
After some days , I saw lot of other things like chipsets or CPU that were not correctly detected or not detected at all .
As I 'm the chief - editor of a french hardware website ( www.x86-secret.com now integrated into www.canardpc.com), I have access to lot of recent hardware and I can test and debug on quite all available motherboards on the market .
After adding detection for all current CPUs , I 've added detection for all current chipsets ( SiS , VIA , n Vidia , Intel ) and ECC Polling for AMD64 , i875P and E7205 .
Then , I decided to display some useful settings for the most popular chipsets .
For exemple , on i865 PE /i875P series , memtest86 + will now display FSB & Memory frequency , PAT status , memory timings , ECC status and the number of memory channels .
Next version will perhaps contain several enhancements and bug - fixes .
-= Change Log =-
Here is all the latest change logs for memtest86 + :
*** Enhancements in v5.31 b : ***
After a long hiatus without updates and following numerous requests , I 've started compiling many codes branches to release public builds again !
Here is Memtest86 + 5.31 b , with many bug fixes in the core functions .
This build is not ready for production yet , because it lacks some feedbacks from beta - testers .
Additional features and updated detection code will follow soon , as soon I have access to my lab with all the reference test platforms .
It 's currently inaccessible due to the COVID19 lockdown .
If you find a bug or regression in this build , please send your feedback to memtest ( - A -) memtest.org .
