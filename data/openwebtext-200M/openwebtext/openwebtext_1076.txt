Baltic Dry Index has worst week since October meltdown as Chinese demand slows
The Baltic Dry Index , which tracks shipping costs and is viewed as leading indicator for commodity prices , has had its worst week since the peak of the financial crisis last October , as Chinese demand slowed .
NORTH MITROVICA , Kosovo —
Displaced by conflict and stranded by bureaucratic inertia , dozens of Roma families remain on toxic land 10 years after they were relocated there by the United Nations following the Kosovo war .
Osterrode Camp and Chesmin Lug Camp were established by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 1999 as a temporary measure , when the 9,000 - member Roma or gypsy neighborhood on the southern shore of the Ibar River was burnt down by Albanians in the dying days of the Kosovo conflict .
The Albanians had accused the Roma of collaborating with the Serb army , a charge the Roma dismiss as unfounded .
Whatever the truth behind the charges and denials , almost everyone agrees that moving Roma families near the now closed Trepca mining and smelting complex , onto land highly contaminated with lead , zinc , arsenic and other metals , has resulted in severe health problems in the community .
When the World Health Organization tested the Roma 's blood for lead in 2004 , the readings for 90 percent of the children were off the scale , higher than the medical equipment was capable of measuring .
Such children fall into the category of " acute medical emergency " and require immediate hospitalization .
Instead they have remained in the camps , ingesting lead through the air , the dirt they play in and through their clothes dusted with lead tailings while drying on laundry lines .
Even before their birth , lead enters their bodies from drinking water consumed by their mothers .
According to internationally accepted benchmarks drawn up by the United States Center for Disease Control , 10 micrograms of lead per deciliter causes the beginning of brain damage .
The measurements from the camps were much higher than in the surrounding population and at levels that exceeded any region WHO had previously studied .
Twelve children had exceptionally high blood lead levels , greater than 45 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood , more than four times the amount that causes brain damage .
" The Roma are victimized by lead , " said Thomas Hammarberg , European commissioner for human rights .
" It is sad the international community has not found a solution 10 years later .
It is the single most major environmental disaster in Europe . "
Zoran Savich , a pediatrician with the Health Center of Kosovo Mitrovica , saw more than 300 patients in Osterrode and Chesmin Lug between 2005 and 2008 .
In that time , Savich said , 77 people died of lead poisoning , many of them children .
" I treated as many I could but they were living in the same conditions and absorbing lead , ” Savich said .
“ When the treatments stopped , their levels went back up .
It was useless . "
Kosovo has been administered by the United Nations since June 1999 , after the NATO bombing campaign on the troops of then - president Slobodan Milosevic , aimed at halting Belgrade 's repression of the majority ethnic Albanian population seeking independence .
" In 1999 , we had to respond to an emergency and found the camps as a temporary facility , " said Francesco Ardisson , senior protection officer of the office of Chief of Mission , UNHCR .
" Unfortunately , we have been unable to find an alternative site because neither the Albanians and the Serbs want them . "
Within the U.N. , however , questions have been raised about its handling of the Roma .
“ The U.N. put the Roma in camps even though the U.N. knew the place was poisoned , ” said Ilija Elezovic , the health department director for the U.N. Mission In Kosovo , northern Mitrovika .
“ The place where the camps are , the U.N. had a plan to build a fence around it and say , ' danger . '
But they did n't do that .
Instead they put the Roma there . "
Mercy Corps , an American aid organization , has budgeted $ 2.4 million to resettle 50 Roma families — about 250 individuals — this year in either north or south Mitrovica away from the contaminated sites .
Most of the budget would be used to build new housing although treatment for lead poisoning is also included , said Catherine Rothenberger , mission director for Mercy Corps in Kosovo .
" Other donors are interested and could affect 30 to 50 more additonal families , " Rothenberger said .
" Resources are not an issue but a clear plan is .
Donors are risk adverse .
People are reluctant to invest unless it results in productive resettlement .
We are in regular discussions with other donors telling them here are the gaps in services but nothing is assured . "
Meanwhile , after years of waiting , the Roma continue to wait .
" I feel myself losing power , " said Muhamud Smajliji , a father of nine children in Chesmin Lug .
" I get nervous , start to shake , and it takes a long time to calm down .
I am losing concentration .
I feel like collapsing . "

Expelled from Sudan
Can Tajikistan weather the storm ?

BBC News , Bamako
Tens of thousands of people have protested against the new law
The president of Mali has announced that he is not going to sign the country 's new family law , instead returning it to parliament for review .
Muslim groups have been protesting against the law , which gives greater rights to women , ever since parliament adopted it at the start of the month .
President Amadou Toumani
Toure said he was sending the law back for the sake of national unity .
Muslim leaders have called the law the work of the devil and against Islam .
More than 90 % of Mali 's population is Muslim .
Some of the provisions that have proved controversial give more rights to women .
For example , under the new law women are no longer required to obey their husbands , instead husbands and wives owe each other loyalty and protection .
I have taken this decision ... to ensure calm and a peaceful society , and to obtain the support and understanding of our fellow citizens
President Amadou Toumani Toure
To love , honour and obey in Mali Women get greater inheritance rights , and the minimum age for girls to marry in most circumstances is raised to 18 .
One of the other key points Muslims have objected to is the fact that marriage is defined as a secular institution .
Tens of thousands have turned out at protests in Bamako in recent weeks and there have been other demonstrations against the law across the country .
It is a political defeat for President Toure , who was a strong backer of the new law .
It has only been the continuing angry protests by Muslim groups that have forced him to send the law back to parliament .
In his statement on national television the president was forced to admit that the population is yet to be convinced by the new code .
" After extensive consultations with the various state institutions , with civil society , with the religious community and the legal profession , I have taken this decision to send the family code for a second reading to ensure calm and a peaceful society , and to obtain the support and understanding of our fellow citizens . "
It was clear from his speech that the president also thinks there has been a lot of false information circulating about the code and the government will no doubt also try to address this in the coming weeks .
The head of Mali's High Islamic Council says he was pleased with the president 's decision .
Women 's groups are heartbroken - they have been trying for more than 10 years to get the law changed .
Your comments : Women deserve 2 be treated as equals not as slaves .
Felix Musonda , Chingola , Zambia
I think the president is in the right position to put this law under serious review .
Its true women need the right but not to this extent , this right has to be checked .
They still remain a man 's responsibility and despite all efforts there is something about their position in the society that can not be changed .
Magdalene Sirri , Douala , Cameroon
This is disgraceful - what a bunch of weak cowards these men are - hiding behind religion " ideals " to use women for whatever they want and keep them subservient .
How pathetic they appear , and how frightened !!
They only hurt themselves and the society at large , in the end .
I feel sorry for the women AND the men .
A Howson , Boston , MA I think these whole thing about ' women 's right ' is just an attempt to turn the order things upside down .
if they say that a woman does not need have to obey her husband , then it is like saying the citizens of a country do not need to obey the constitution of the country as symbolised by their leader .
in a place when there is no need for someone to obey the other , chaos is the result .
Islam does not oppress women so they do n't need freedom !
Olatunde Oloyede , Lagos , Nigeria
I think the president has taken the good decision by sending the new low in second reading .
Diab , Bamako , Mali
The president should stand by that law .
women need 2 be free from the slavery their religion puts then in .
women have the right to do and become what ever they want .
this Muslim men should know better .
Pamela Martin , ABUJA , NIGERIA
The president should have been man enough .
I can not think with any stretch of imagination that in this day and age some people will continue to take women as sub humans when in fact , women are proving to us men that they are equally capable as we are .
Please Mali , unshackle yourself from this archaic mentality of keeping women as domestic servants .
Ballah , Monrovia
I 'm very please for the refusal of the President , because it is not allow in Islam , woman should n't equal to a man rather as her husband , in Islam religion a woman is always behind a man .
Abdourahman Sey , Dakar , Senegal
This change only reflects the sensitivity of Malian 's government .
Nevertheless , civil right groups , women groups should not relent by this outcome .
Someday they shall overcome .
Kunle , Nigeria
This kind of leader that we need in Africa , the one who listens to the voice of the citizens he / she leads .
Bravo President Amadou Toumani .
You are the man .
Kakaki , Addis Ababa , Ethiopia
When the status of women is strengthened , the society as a whole is improved and enriched .
I believe President Toure should have stood his ground .
Revisiting the issue will now be more difficult and the opponents of equality more emboldened .
Patricia Reardon MD , Scotland , CT USA
This is a disappointment though politically expedient given the wake of the usually small % but loud narrow minder interprets that constantly misrepresent the noble teachings of the Prophet Muhammad , peace be upon him .
The Qur'an itself in fact and spirit gives equal protection and rights to both genders .
It is up to those in authority in any age to ensure the application of its noble and spiritual teachings .
And the prophet in his traditions is many time reported the lofty position of mothers and wives in the social order .
My prayer is that their congress will override the president 's lack of leadership in this instance .
And not to bow to the continued rants of the reactionary minority in their country .
Muslims are not monolithic by any means and what is obvious to the majority should not be stifled by those who claim holy superiority by decree of their understanding .
Muhammad Ali-Salaam Mahmoud DeSousa , Cabo Verde | USA
I think this law is so controversial that it must be abandoned because you can not jump so high with very traditional and almost uneducated society with very high illiteracy especially among women the supposed stake holders .
By trying to adopt such law the parliamentarians and the human rights activists are provoking the sentiment of Muslim and playing in the hands of the fundamentalist groups .
I am afraid this law to back fire and results in creating more conservative groups on the edge like ( boko haram ) of Nigeria .
Changing society is not an easy thing and can not be done through jurisdiction only and the very positive thing in Mali that it is a democratic country and change can come by time when these values of human dignity and equity regardless of the gender are deep rooted in the society and when more enlightened interpretations of Islam are given chance .
NO easy walk to society change .
Mousa , Sudan , Port Sudan
Its is a good idea for the president to take that step .
But on the other hand , women need to be protected and well taking care of .
Every human came through a woman .
But it should be done in a way that there wo n't be crises in the country .
When crises starts it is hard to stop it .
Compare with what is happening in Sudan now .
The president is a wise man .
It should go through the second reading and lets see what they have for the country .
Kingsley Itiose , Benin , Edo State , Nigeria .
It is time for the men in Mali to realize that women are human beings who deserve equal rights to respect irrespective of how God created a man and a woman .
Nelson Omoya , Kitgum , Uganda
Am sorry to say this Mr. President , but i think you should not allow your political selfishness to mislead you so as to am abandon the cause of women in Mail , because you known very well how women are mistreated in Africa and for once let them also enjoy some of the rights our so - called African Men are enjoying .
Fatoumata Baldeh , Kanifing , The Gambia Let 's hope President Toure knows about Robert the Bruce and his spider , and can be likewise inspired not to give up .
Some changes are so major that they must be carried out in stages , even though , ideally they should take place overnight .
It 's a pity that reactionary groups are so afraid of the future .
It WILL come !
Sue Martin , Malmberget , Sweden I am male from Nigeria & I do understand the politics going on here in Africa , its all about complex , fear & wanting to be the boss & bully in the house .
Talk about religion , in the beginning The almighty God created man & woman in his own image , then who told man that he is superior to the woman .
Its a shame that Africans refuse to grow .
Was it only the men that voted for the president ?
The women voted for him also .
If he passes the law , he will become a hero & set a good precedence for other African shameless leaders .
Mr Koko Meeky , Lagos , Nigeria .
This law really needs to be amended .
Women were created to be a support of the man hence they need to accord them with the maximum respect no matter who they are .
It is very wrong for women to be given the right to disobey their husbands .
Any woman who thinks she cannot obey her husband should remain unmarried .
Mavis Agbakli Mawuse , Obuasi , Ghana
In order to keep the peace and ensure order throughout society , it is better to follow the reasoning and the opinions of the majority of the population , rather than impose a democratic law from above .
Western - inspired laws apparently create havoc and disorder , and potentially bloodshed and civil war .
I must reject this .

Another abandoned Affliction bout has found a home .
Ben Rothwell and Chase Gormley will make their Octagon debuts in a heavyweight bout at UFC 104 on Oct. 24 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles , according to a source with knowledge of the negotiations .
The matchup had originally been scheduled to take place at Affliction “ Trilogy ” on Aug .
1 . However , Affliction Entertainment cancelled its anticipated third event 10 days out , after main event fighter Josh Barnett tested positive for an anabolic steroid in a pre-fight test .
Rothwell ( 30 - 6 ) rebounded from a third - round knockout loss to Andrei Arlovski at Affliction 1 in July 2008 to submit Chris Guillen with elbows in the first round at Adrenaline MMA 2 last December .
An IFL standout , the Wisconsin native has won 16 out of 18 bouts since 2004 , including victories over Roy Nelson Ricco Rodriguez , and Krzysztof Soszynski The 25 - year - old Gormley was an NAIA All - American Wrestler for Lindenwood University .
Gormley ( 6 - 0 ) earned a unanimous decision against former super heavyweight Eric Pele at MFC 16 in June 2008 .
Well , Blizzcon 2009 is about to get underway ( look for the big news from the keynote in a few hours ) and given how fast it sold out I 'm sure there are still many rabid fans interested in what Blizzard might have to say that do n't want to shell out the $ 40 for Pay - Per - View access .
So , to that end we have interviews scheduled tomorrow with the teams from Starcraft2 , Diablo III , World of Warcraft , and Battle . net .
If there is anything you wish to know about the progress or juicy details from any of these teams please leave it in the comments below .
We 'll try to parse through for the best questions and get you answers during our interview slots tomorrow .
The usual Slashdot interview rules apply .

The comprehensive nature of the list of problem solving strategies allows individuals to use a checklist approach to problem solving .
It also could facilitate training others in problem solving .
The classification of the strategies into types may facilitate the development of new strategies that fit into a specific category .
The explanations and examples given could serve as a valuable supplement to other explanations and examples available in books and on the web .
The strategies on this list are in themselves not original .
The original aspects of this list are :
Clarify the problem
It is easier to solve a specific problem than a vague one .
So clarify the problem before you start looking for a solution .
If your problem is that your spouse tells you that you are not supportive enough , find out what he or she means by supportive .
If your problem is that your mother can't get the new software to work , determine what does n't happen that she wants to happen .
If your problem is a math homework question , read carefully the question ( usually at the end ) :
Is the answer supposed to be in metres or centimetres , rounded or not , square or not , etc .
Identify key elements of the problem Problems come to us with varying amounts of important and useless information .
Focusing on useless information distracts us and wastes time .
So identify the key elements of the problem before you start looking for a solution .
If the problem is that of a couple who come to you for counselling because they argue continually , ask them what they argue about , when , and where .
If the problem is that your bike squeaks when you ride it , determine what part squeaks .
Visualize the problem or a relevant process or situation Sometimes we can see the problem and all its important details right in front of us .
This helps us understand the problem .
Other times we can't see important elements because they have already occurred or are not visible .
In these cases , it is valuable to visualize important elements of the problem .
So , if you want to predict the future of the universe , visualize the big bang and the ensuing events .
If you want to open a lock without a key , visualize the lock mechanism .
If you want to determine how a murder was committed , visualize events that would explain the physical evidence .
Draw a picture or diagram of the problem or a relevant process or situation isualizing a problem can aid understanding .
However , we can keep only some much visual information in our minds at once .
Hence , it is often useful to draw a picture or diagram .
So , if you want to calculate when two airplanes will collide , draw their paths and speeds .
If you plan to assault a house where a terrorist holds hostages , draw a picture of the room , doors , windows , hostages , etc .
If you want to speed up delivery of goods to retailers , draw a diagram showing the steps in the process .
Create a model of the problem or a relevant process Creating a model of a problem or relevant process helps us focus on essential elements and gives us the potential to alter the model and see what happens .
For instance , if you want to minimize harm to individuals in auto accidents , create a computer model of the structures and forces involved .
If you want to build a Mars rover , build a model .
If you want to reduce international strife , create a model of causes .
Imagine being the problem , a key process , or the solution Imagination can help us understand a problem by visualizing it .
More understanding can occur in some cases if we go farther and imagine being the problem , a key process , or the solution .
So , if you want to understand space and time , you can imagine , as Einstein did , riding a light beam .
If you want to help a person who is very paranoid , you can imagine being that person and seeing the world as he does .
If you want to get a hit in a big baseball game , you can imagine going up to bat , seeing the ball clearly , and swinging crisply while you step into the pitch , etc .
Simulate or act out a key element of the problem Understanding complex or vague problems can be difficult .
Simulating or acting out some key element of the problem can be productive .
For instance , if you are calculating probabilities of some event happening , you can simulate the situation and observe outcomes yourself .
If you want to help someone become more socially successful , you can act as that person does and observe the consequences .
If you want to determine why a spacecraft exploded , simulate its flight , and try ways of recreating the explosion .
Consider a specific example Problems often come to us in the abstract .
Creating a concrete example helps us explore the problem just as we might explore a specific example of dinosaur bones to understand dinosaurs .
So , if you want to determine what makes a person psychotic , consider real people who have become psychotic .
If you want to learn how to calculate the volume of a sphere , use a specific radius , such as one metre , and apply the formula .
If you want to determine why frogs are dying right and left in your community , examine dead frogs .
Consider extreme cases Considering extreme cases is a type of considering a specific example .
Here the example is chosen to test the limits of a relevant parameter .
Sometimes this gives insight into important processes .
So , if you want to determine whether level of intelligence affects retention on a police force , consider officers with the highest and lowest intelligence on the force .
If you want to determine what happens to black holes in the long run , consider black holes that continue for infinitely long or black holes that suck up everything in the universe .
If you want to determine how temperature affects the flow of electricity , consider a temperature of absolute 0 .
Acquire knowledge of relevant domains Acquire knowledge about relevant domains .
If you want to understand and solve an electrical problem , it may be necessary to learn about electrical systems .
If you want to solve the problem of how to keep humans free from solar - wind harm on the way to and from Mars , you may need knowledge of various domains of science , engineering , and medicine .
Great knowledge of relevant domains sometimes helps experts solve problems that others cannot .
Change perspective Change perspective .
If you want to reduce crime in a community , look at crime from the perspective of criminals and victims .
If you want to convince a hostage taker to surrender , take that person 's perspective .
If you want to avoid being bitten by a vicious dog , take the dog 's perspective .

Facing what they called an “ avalanche ” of right - wing legislation this session , 17 activists with the North Carolina chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NC - NAACP ) gathered at the state assembly ’s doors on Monday and joined hands in prayer , then refused to leave .
The group , eight of them ministers according to an NC - NAACP advisory , held vigil to protest the Republican - dominated legislature ’s progress on cutting unemployment benefits , cutting taxes for the wealthy while increasing taxes on the poor , rejecting the Affordable Care Act ’s expansion of Medicaid , and moving to pass a restrictive voter ID law that will dial down turnout among minorities , the elderly and students .

“ The decision to engage in civil disobedience is not one we take lightly , ” Rev. William Barber , NC - NAACP ’s president , said in prepared text .
“ But the extremists are acting like the George Wallaces of the 21st century .
They are pursuing a cruel , unusual and unconstitutional agenda reminiscent of the Old South .
What happens in North Carolina does not stay in North Carolina .
It has national implications .
North Carolina is ground zero in a national struggle to defend democracy for all . ”
The group says the arrests are just the beginning of their campaign of civil disobedience , and more are prepared to get arrested until the legislature stops adopting measures that harm poor and minority communities .
“ We call on all people of good will to examine the tools of the non-violent moral movement to expose the hurtful , immoral , unconstitutional policies being discussed and passed in the Peoples House , ” an open letter ( PDF ) published on the NC - NAACP ’s website explains .
“ These policies are similar to those by repressive regimes in other countries , who see their own citizens as part of the problem , rather than part of the solution .
If we are truly moral leaders , we must expose with our words and deeds these shameful attacks on the poor and working people of North Carolina . ”
“ This much is clear : the Republican - led legislature is standing in the way of progress and passing laws that violate fundamental constitutional rights , ” Barber ’s prepared statement concluded .
“ As leaders of moral conscience , we must draw the line somewhere .
That is what this direct action is all about . ”

George Sodini killed three women and injured at least ten others at a Pittsburgh - area gym before shooting himself yesterday .
His online diary reveals an obsession with " hoes " who refused to date him — and a connection to more " mainstream " misogynists .
Advertisement
Sodini was a member of the LA Fitness in Collier , Pennsylvania , and neighbors described him as " a bit of a recluse . "
Allegheny County police superintendent says Sodini " did what he set out to do , and I think nobody could have stopped him . "
Moffatt did not confirm a report that Sodini 's ex-girlfriend was one of his victims , but the killer 's website ( now offline ) shows a bitter frustration with women in general .
On December 24 , 2008 , he wrote ,
Moving into Christmas again .
No girlfriend since 1984 , last Christmas with Pam was in 1983 .
Who knows why .
I am not ugly or too weird .
No sex since July 1990 either ( I was 29 ) .
No shit !
Over eighteen years ago .
And did it maybe only 50 - 75 times in my life .
Getting to think that a woman now would just , uh , get in the way of things .
Isolated . [...]
I know nothing will change , no matter how hard I try or what goals I set .

And on December 29 , 2008 :
Just got back from tanning , been doing this for a while .
No gym today , my elbow is sore again .
I actually look good .
I dress good , am clean - shaven , bathe , touch of cologne - yet 30 million women rejected me - over an 18 or 25 - year period .
That is how I see it .
Thirty million is my rough guesstimate of how many desirable single women there are .
A man needs a woman for confidence .
He gets a boost on the job , career , with other men , and everywhere else when he knows inside he has someone to spend the night with and who is also a friend .
This type of life I see is a closed world with me specifically and totally excluded .
Every other guy does this successfully to a degree .
Flying solo for many years is a destroyer .
Yet many people say I am easy to get along with , etc .
Looking back , I owe nothing to desirable females who ask for anything , except for basic courtesy - usually .
Looking back over everything , what bothers me most is the inability to work towards whatever change I choose .
And on June 5 , 2009 :
I was reading several posts on different forums and it seems many teenage girls have sex frequently .
One 16 year old does it usually three times a day with her boyfriend .
So , err , after a month of that , this little hoe has had more sex than ME in my LIFE , and I am 48 .
One more reason .
Thanks for nada , bitches !
Bye .

Does it make sense to think of this as a misogynist crime ?
It 's worth noting that Sodini 's diary also includes some racist ramblings ( " Black dudes have thier choice of best white hoez " ) , but both his racism and his sexism are heavily overlaid with insanity and despair .
On May 4 , 2009 , he wrote :
I know I will never enjoy life .
This is an over 30 year trend .
Some people are happy , some are miserable .
It is difficult to live almost continuously feeling an undercurrent of fear , worry , discontentment and helplessness .
I can talk and joke around and sound happy but under it all is something different that seems unchangable and a permanent part of my being .

Sodini was clearly disturbed , but his bilious diary displays an extreme version of a type of grievance misogyny that is all too common .
His conviction that all the " desirable single women " in the country are collectively rejecting him , even though he is not " too weird " seems at first like the antithesis of the bluster of pickup artists and " game " aficionados , but a glance at repugnablog Roissy in DC reveals a connection .
In a post about the shooting , Roissy writes ,
When men kill women , the underlying reason is almost always an unfulfilled psychosexual need .
This goes for spree shooters , rapists , and serial killers .
I 'm not surprised Sodini has n't had sex in nearly 20 years .
As I 've written before , to men celibacy is walking death , and anything is justified in avoiding that miserable fate .
Advertisement
Roissy 's contention that " anything is justified " to help men avoid celibacy is terrifying , but more subtly disturbing is his assumption that Sodini 's rampage was directly caused by women refusing to sleep with him .
Like Sodini himself , Roissy assumes that Sodini shot up a gym because women rejected him , not that women rejected him because he was the kind of guy who would one day shoot up a gym .
Roissy continues ,
If Sodini had learned game he would have been able to find another woman and gotten laid after his ex dumped him .
He would n't have spent the next 20 years steeped in bile and weighed down by his Sisyphian blue balls , dreaming of vengeance .
Game could have saved the lives of the women Sodini killed .
[...] we are going to see a growing eunuchracy of involuntarily celibate betas and the marginalized men in their ranks decide that exiting in a blaze of hot lead beats living in loveless obscurity .
And ex-girlfriends are target # 1 .
Advertisement
So basically if Sodini had only read Roissy 's blog he would have been totally fine and never killed anyone , because all of his problems were caused by not knowing how to manipulate women .
And women had better submit to such manipulation , unless they want to get shot .
Despite his alpha - male swagger , Roissy basically endorses the tenets of grievance misogyny — that women are shallow creatures who reject perfectly good men , forcing them to endure the " walking death " of celibacy .
Though his solution to this problem is domination through subterfuge and insults , rather than murder , his commenters are less charitable .
One writes ,
Finally a mass murderer writes a relatively coherent manifesto .
Could be better , but at least it is implied that feminism is to blame and he is taking a last stand .
I had been waiting for this ( almost thinking I had to do it myself ) and I am impressed .
Kudos .

After George Tiller 's murder , many asked whether conservative commentators were to blame for stirring up fringe elements of the anti-abortion camp .
Similarly , AlterNet 's Eric Boehlert called out Fox News for giving airtime to the conspiracy theorists who inspired murderer Richard Poplawski .
Roissy and his pickup - artist ilk do n't advocate the murder of women .
But the worldview they promulgate does appear to inspire murderous thoughts .
We do n't know if Sodini visited misogynist websites during the long period in which he was planning his crime .
We do know that he lived in a society where some people view hatred and even murder as a normal response to dating difficulties — if Roissy 's violent " eunuchracy " ever comes to pass , these people will bear some of the blame .

An Asshole ... now you know what one looks like !
According to someone , you should most likely be happy .
Or maybe not .
Here are some quotes
from my personal stash
of such nonsense to get
you thinking about your
own happiness :
SAN FRANCISCO --
The recession has left Lisa Gautier with an abundance of hair -- 18,000 pounds , to be exact .
She did n't grow it herself .
Mrs. Gautier runs Matter of Trust , a San Francisco nonprofit that recycles human hair scraps into small mats that can be used to clean up oil spills .
Human hair is naturally cut out for the job because the strands have lots of nooks and crannies that make it easy for oil to cling to .
But ...
Images of people carrying guns outside of President Barack Obama 's recent health care reform town halls shocked people who did n't realize it was perfectly legal to have a weapon in such close proximity to the president .
Now , Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton wants to change that -- both in the District and nationwide .
Norton has asked the Department of Homeland Security and Secret Service to stop people from carrying weapons openly or concealed in and around the areas where the president and cabinet officials appear .
Currently in the District , people are allowed to have a registered handgun in their homes , but not in public .
But a recently filed lawsuit could allow residents and visitors to carry concealed guns in public for self - defense throughout D.C. , even if the guns are registered elsewhere .
" I seek no change in the local laws of other jurisdictions , and ask only respect for gun laws in my own district , " Norton said .
" However , it is clear that if the Secret Service can temporarily clear all aircraft from air space when the president is in the vicinity , the agency has the authority to clear guns on the ground that is even closer to the president . "
Norton said about 10 to 12 people were seen carrying weapons at Monday 's Obama town hall in Arizona .
The Brady Campaign , which works to prevent gun violence , issued a statement to MSNBC's First Read after reading reports about guns at the event :
" Bringing loaded firearms to any Presidential event endangers all in attendance .
Even though our weak national and state gun laws may allow this dangerous behavior , we should use a little common sense .
Individuals carrying loaded weapons at these events require constant attention from police and Secret Service officers , thus stretching their protective efforts even thinner .
The possibility that these weapons might be grabbed or stolen or accidentally mishandled increases the risks of serious injury or death to all in attendance .
The National Rifle Association and other ' gun rights ' groups need to send a message about ' gun responsibilities ' to their members and all gun owners .
Loaded weapons at political forums endanger all involved , distract law enforcement , and end up stifling debate .
Presidential protesters need to leave their firearms at home -- no exceptions . "
It is not clear how Norton 's proposed ban on guns near the president and cabinet would be enforced .
GM first began regular production in China in May 2001
General Motors has signed up to a 2bn yuan ( $ 293 m ; £ 180 m ) joint venture with the Chinese state - owned carmaker FAW to make light trucks and vans .
The vehicles will initially be sold in China under the FAW brand , but could in future be exported under the GM brand .
They will be produced at existing FAW facilities in the cities of Changchun and Harbin .
GM sold 818,442 vehicles in China in the first six months of 2009 , compared with 1,094,561 in the whole of 2008 .
Demand was particularly strong for its minivans and other small vehicles .
" For us in China , this is an important complement to the rest of our portfolio , " said Kevin Wale , managing director of GM's Chinese operations .
" We are well established in passenger vehicles and mini commercial vehicles and we have n't had a presence in the truck segment . "
GM makes Buick , Chevrolet and Cadillac vehicles in a joint venture with Chinese manufacturer SAIC Motor Corp .
It also makes minivans , pick - up trucks and the Spark compact car in a venture with SAIC and Liuzhou Wuling Automobile .
GM has recently emerged from bankruptcy protection in the US and has seen its sales fall year - on - year in most of its Western markets , so China is a key area of growth .

We ’ve all heard the stories of how Xavier basketball player , Jordan Crawford , had dunked on LeBron at his Skill Academy a couple weeks back .
Nike did their best to confiscate the evidence of the event , but apparently someone captured the dunk on mobile phone camcorder , and thanks to TMZ the world now has proof that LeBron James is human .
To be honest , I dont see what the big deal is .
It ’s not like LeBron has never gotten dunked on before .
Jordan Crawford even said that LeBron did n’t think he was going to dunk it and LeBron jumped late .
I ’m not trying to take any credit from Crawford , but it happens .
Hell , even Shaq gets dunked on from time to time and if all you have on LeBron is getting dunked on then I ’ll take it .
Hopefully now that a video has been released Nike will grow a pair and release the confiscated videos .
It ’s nice that a video is out now , but the quality of the video does n’t do it any justice .
I hope that since there is a video out now that people lay off LeBron , I mean the guy got dunked on , it ’s not like he raped a girl .
Exhibit A1
" If you are free of violence in yourself the question is , ' How am I to live in a world full of violence , acquisitiveness , greed , envy , brutality ?
Will I not be destroyed ? '
That is the inevitable question which is invariably asked .
When you ask such a question it seems to me you are not actually living peacefully .
If you live peacefully you will have no problem at all .
You may be imprisoned because you refuse to join the army or shot because you refuse to fight , but that is not a problem ; you will be shot .
It is extraordinarily important to understand this " ( Freedom From The Known , J Krishnamurti )
Exhibit A2
( The Life and Death of Krishnamurti , Mary Lutyens )
Exhibit B1
Exhibit B2
... the Krishnamurti Parties acknowledge that the documents they sought to recover from the Rajagopal Parties in the prior lawsuits are , in fact , Rajagopal ’s documents and may be kept by Rajagopal .
( Case No. 79918 , D. Rajagopal , et al. v. J Krishnamurti et al. , Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Ventura ) .
Exhibit C1
So are we , the elder people , prepared to bring about through education a good human being , a human being who is not afraid - afraid of his neighbour , afraid of the future , afraid of so many , many things , disease , poverty - fear ?
And also are we prepared in the search of the good , or in establishing the good , prepared or help the child and ourselves to be integral - integrity ?
The word ' integrity ' means , to be whole , and integrity also means to say what you mean and hold it , not say one thing and do something else .
Integrity implies honesty .
And are we prepared for that ?
Can we be honest if we have got any illusions , any romantic , speculative ideas , or ideals .
If we have strong beliefs , can we be honest ?
( First public Q&A meeting of J Krishnamurt in Ojai , 1980 )
Exhibit C2
( Jiddu Krishnamurti : His Life and Thoughts , C V Williams )
Exhibit C3
Q : Still , I must admit that , for me at least , I have to believe in the integrity of the teacher .
K : Wait a minute , Sir .
What do you mean by integrity ?
How do you know ?
Q : Well let me put it this way .
What the teacher teaches must be applicable to what happened to him .
K : How do you know ?
Wait a minute .
Let ’s see .
How do you know ?
Q : I do n’t know but I feel that this has to be true for me to feel motivated by his teaching .
K : Ah , ah .
I ’m not interested .
I am only interested in the teaching .
Nothing else - who you are , who you ’re not .
Whether you ’re real or honest .
It is my life that I am concerned with , not with your life .
Q : Well , but this is a teaching that states things about human beings .
The man who made these statements must know of what he speaks by his life .
K : Apparently .
No .
What I am trying to say is this , Sir .
How do you know whether he is honest or dishonest ?
Wait .
I ’m just going seriously into this .
How do you know whether what he is saying is out of his own life or he is inventing ?
Inventing in the big sense ?
Or he ’s leading a double life ?
Q : Let me put it the other way round .
I ca n’t know whether he is leading a double life , but if at any moment I believe that he is , that affects his teaching for me .
Do you see the difference ?
K : I understand .
I would say : “ Please , leave the personality completely alone . ”
Epilogue
Generally speaking , the anger that the various saints , sages and seers have come out with from time to time has been designated as ' Divine Anger ' , for example , and I was allowing the possibility that any anger displayed by Mr. Jiddu Krishnamurti may have thus been exempt from the normal or garden variety .
Specifically written into the question is , basically , that there is the ideal ( sitting together as two friends under a tree discussing matters ) and there is the reality ( taking out several lawsuits to obtain legal possession of a former associate 's documents ) of course there is implicit in the question that anger was involved ... it is anger that clouds clarity .
Which is why I suggested that you look again at what I wrote because the issue I was addressing is the distinction between the ideal ( under a tree ) and the reality ( a litigious relationship ) and the distinction between the ideal ( having eradicated anger ) and the reality ( of pacifistically sitting out a war ) .
I was drawing a parallel by providing an example to demonstrate the issue in action in real - life ... and a pacifist is a person who changes their behaviour in lieu of eradicating the anger ( or aggression , hatred and etcetera ) which causes the behaviour in the first place .
As law and order is everywhere maintained at the point of a gun a person that is free of malice and sorrow can both utilise physical force / restraint ( be involved in a war ) and take out lawsuits ( be involved in litigation ) where clearly applicable ... there is no difference in kind between the physical force used in a war and the physical force used in a court - case .
Lastly , what is indeed ' hypocritical ' is advising others to do what one has not done oneself .
Vis. : [ Hermann ] : 'K , when asked during WWII to condemn the enemy , always advised the questioners to look into themselves and eradicate anger there .
Not many people listened '. [ emphasis added ] .
And it is the ' not many people listened ' statement which is the telling comment ... Mr. Jiddu Krishnamurti did not listen to his own ' Teachings ' .
But , then again , he oft - times distanced himself from the ' Teachings ' ... as do the many and varied saints , sages and seers ( popularly phrased as do not look at the finger but look at what the finger is pointing to ) .
Mr. Jiddu Krishnamurti made it very clear where his peace lay ... the ' answer ' to all the ills of humankind is not to be found in the world : [ quote ] : ' I have found the answer to all this [ violence ] , not in the world but away from it '.
( page 94 , Krishnamurti ' His Life And Death ' ; Mary Lutyens ; Avon Books : New York 1991 ) .
Eastern spirituality is fundamentally all about avoiding re-birth ... not about peace - on - earth .
( From a discussion on the Listening - L mailing list about J Krishnamurti , written by Richard circa 2001 )
K was persuaded not to go to India that winter because of the state of Emergency which had been declared by Ms Gandhi in June ; during this , nothing could be published or publicly spoken without submission to the Censorship Committee .
The last thing K was prepared to do was to water down his denunciation of authority and tyranny ; there was no point in going if he did not speak and a real danger of imprisonment if he did .
After the Brockwood gathering , therefore , he returned to Malibu , spending every weekend at the Pine Cottage , talking to the parents and teachers of the Oak Grove school .
Meanwhile , Krishnamurti's once close relationship with the Rajagopals had deteriorated to the point where Krishnamurti took D. Rajagopal to court in order to recover donated property and funds , publication rights for his works , manuscripts , and personal correspondence , that were in Rajagopal 's possession .
( Wikipedia article on J Krishnamurti Following this , Roslaind 's letter , written in June , was an account of her and Krishna 's former relationship and was sent in a sealed envelope to Vanda Scaravelli for Krishna to read in her presence .
Krishna handed it to Mary Zimbalist to read and she made a note of the scene in her diary , saying the letter was titled , " A Sad , Sad Story " .
Mary wrote that it was a self - serving account and a justification of what Rosalind might be " driven in desperation " to say in court .
Regarding an accusation in the letter that Krishna was a " congenital liar " , Krishna told Mary that he had lied " they " attacked and brutalised him .
he was revolted by the letter , saying it was " unclean " .
Mary said that she felt sickened by its tone and would never have anything to do with " these two people " after the case had ended .
The letter was later reported to have been torn up in front of Vanda . ( when asked why he hid his relationship with Rosalind Rajgpoal , the wife of his friend D Rajgopal .
This was a relationship involving multiple surreptitious abortions , as detailed in the book by Rajgopal 's daughter , Radha Rajgopal Sloss .
Charities have reported a rise in domestic violence during the recession Women staying in refuges after fleeing domestic violence are still technically homeless , the Law Lords have ruled .
The judgement means that women staying in shelters must be given urgent help by local authorities to find a permanent home .
Law Lord Baroness
Hale said it established an " important principle " .
Helen Jackson , from the charity Shelter , said councils " must now offer women priority housing to help them rebuild their shattered lives " .
Wednesday 's ruling overturns a decision which was made in the case of Sharon Moran - a woman who fled her home in Manchester in 2006 because of her partner 's violence .
She went to stay at a women 's refuge , but was evicted within weeks because of her behaviour towards staff .
At the time , the law stated that a refuge was formally classed as " accommodation " in which a woman could reasonably be expected to stay .
As a result , anyone living there was not defined as homeless and not given " priority need " status .
Manchester County Council took the view , therefore , that in being ejected Ms Moran had become intentionally homeless from adequate accommodation and so was only entitled to short - term care while she took steps to find a new home for herself .
Her case is illustrative of the extreme difficulties that women have to face
Adam Fullwood
Lawyer for domestic violence victim Sharon Moran ' Extremely vulnerable ' Lawyer Adam Fullwood , who represented Ms Moran , welcomed the ruling .
" This is a just decision for victims of domestic violence and vital for the refuge movement as a whole , " he said .
" Ms Moran was extremely vulnerable and her case is illustrative of the extreme difficulties that women , often with children , have to face when fleeing from an abusive partner . "
Mr Fullwood said Ms Moran was no longer directly affected by the case because her circumstances had changed , but the decision will apply in most situations similar to hers from now on .
Baroness Hale , sitting with Lords Hope , Scott , Walker and Neuberger , said : " The important principle established here is that in most cases a woman who has left her home because of domestic , or other , violence within it remains homeless even if she has found a temporary haven in a women 's refuge . "
Organisations helping victims of domestic violence say they have seen a rise in reported abuse coinciding with the economic downturn .
Ms Jackson said : " Many already vulnerable women who have turned to local authorities for help after fleeing violent partners have been told they are not homeless or have made themselves homeless .
" Today 's ruling means that in most cases a local authority can no longer refuse a woman 's homelessness application because she is staying in a refuge or other emergency accommodation .
" Local authorities must now offer women priority housing to help them rebuild their shattered lives . "

In 2006 , Colin Beavan , the author of two works of popular history , was casting about for a book idea .
Beavan was living in lower Manhattan , near N.Y.U. , and that winter there was a weird heat wave that sent bevies of coeds out onto the streets in tank tops .
He did n’t know much about global warming , but the sight of all those bare - armed girls in January got him thinking .
Maybe his next project should be “ about what ’s important . ”
Over lunch at a pricey midtown restaurant , he told his agent that he wanted to “ find a way to encourage a society that emphasizes a little less self - indulgence . ”
His agent reacted coolly .
“ The way you talk about it is a bummer , ” he said .
“ How will I be able to convince a publisher that people will spend twenty - four ninety - five on a book that tells them how screwed up they are ? ”
The latest publishing fad features ecology as an extreme life style ; the focus is on wacky misadventure , not global cataclysm .
Illustration by Arnold Roth
At a second lunch a few weeks later ( presumably at another restaurant ) , Beavan came back with another idea .
What if , instead of encouraging society to change , he set about changing himself ?
For a year , he and his family would attempt to live , in his words , “ as environmentally as possible . ”
They would not be satisfied with well - meaning but relatively easy measures , like switching to compact - fluorescent light bulbs and diligently recycling , or even with wildly ambitious , fantastically difficult ones , like eliminating their carbon emissions .
No , they would try to live in a ninth - floor apartment in Greenwich Village without producing any environmental impact whatsoever — “ zero carbon . . . also zero waste in the ground , zero pollution in the air , zero resources sucked from the earth , zero toxins in the water . ”
All the while , Beavan would write a blog about it .
This time , his agent was intrigued .
“ One guy tries to save the world ? ” he asked .
“ Like Superman or Spider - Man ? ”
“ How about No Impact Man ? ” Beavan responded .
Beavan ’s stunt , or , as he likes to refer to it , his “ experiment , ” is now complete .
He , his wife , Michelle , and his young daughter , Isabella , spent twelve months striving , under increasingly trying circumstances , to reach zero .
As planned , Beavan has chronicled their efforts , and named the book after his favorite superhero , “ No Impact Man : The Adventures of a Guilty Liberal Who Attempts to Save the Planet and the Discoveries He Makes About Himself and Our Way of Life in the Process ” ( Farrar , Straus & Giroux ; $ 25 ) .
The basic setup of “ No Impact Man ” is , by this point , familiar .
During the past few years , one book after another has organized itself around some nouveau - Thoreauvian conceit .
This might consist of spending a month eating only food grown in an urban back yard , as in “ Farm City ” ( 2009 ) , or a year eating food produced on a gentleman ’s farm , as in “ Animal , Vegetable , Miracle ” ( 2007 ) .
It might involve driving across the country on used cooking oil , as in “ Greasy Rider ” ( 2008 ) , or giving up fossil fuels for goats , as in “ Farewell , My Subaru ” ( 2008 ) .
All of these stunts can be seen as responses to the same difficulty .
Owing to a combination of factors — population growth , greenhouse - gas emissions , logging , overfishing , and , as Beavan points out , sheer self - indulgence — humanity is in the process of bringing about an ecological catastrophe of unparalleled scope and significance .
Yet most people are in no mood to read about how screwed up they are .
It ’s a bummer .
If you ’re the National Academy of Sciences or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , or the Pope or Al Gore , you can try to fight this with yet another multivolume report or encyclical .
If not , you ’d better get a gimmick .
On the first morning of his experiment , Beavan wakes up with a stuffy nose .
Back in his high - impact days , twelve hours earlier , he would have just used a Kleenex and tossed it in the garbage .
But the initial challenge he has set for No Impact Man is eliminating trash .
After wandering around the apartment for a while in his underwear , he has an inspiration .
He will blow his nose in a cloth napkin , and then throw the napkin in the wash .
No sooner has this problem been solved than another presents itself .
Isabella , awakened by his honking , wants to get out of her crib .
Beavan finds that she has a wet diaper .
This eventuality , too , he seems not to have anticipated .
He puts her in a new disposable diaper and throws away the old one .
Isabella next demands milk .
Beavan pours her a sippy - cupful , only to discover that he now has an empty milk carton to deal with .
Yet another unforeseen complication !
At this point , maybe fifteen minutes into the project , a less persistent person might well have given up .
But No Impact Man plows on .
He spends a day scouring the city for a net shopping bag of the sort he has seen in Paris , so that he can tote home his tofu without using paper or plastic .
No store in New York seems to carry net bags , so he ends up ordering Mexican takeout .
Eventually , he reconciles himself to ordinary tote bags , starts supplying his own containers at restaurants , and comes up with a system of buying grains from bins at the local natural - food store .
He cancels his newspaper subscriptions and takes to writing on the back of used pieces of paper that he collects from his publisher .
He orders cloth diapers for Isabella .
“ My family ’s trashcan and even our recycling bin is yawningly empty , ” he writes happily a few weeks into the experiment .
To make the project manageable ( and narratable ) , Beavan divides his effort into phases .
Phase I , no trash , is followed by Phase II , “ no carbon - producing transportation . ”
This part of the project means renouncing flying , thus putting an end to trips to visit the in - laws in Minneapolis .
It also means no driving , which in Beavan ’s case means giving up taxis , and no subways or buses .
( Michelle works in midtown ; Beavan buys her a scooter and she gamely propels herself to work . )
The biggest difficulty arises from the fact that No Impact Man lives on the ninth floor .
Since elevators operate by electricity , they , too , must be excluded .
The family dog , Frankie , needs to be walked at least three times a day ; this entails climbing up and down a minimum of fifty - four flights of stairs .
When Beavan ’s other trips — to the store , to drop Isabella off at her babysitter ’s — are added in , the total number of flights often comes to twice that .
“ My record for a day would ultimately be 124 flights — nine more than the Empire State Building , ” he writes .
As the year goes on , Beavan introduces further restrictions .
He insists that the family give up toilet paper and keeps hassling his wife to forswear tampons .
He decides that they can eat only seasonal food grown in the Northeast , which eliminates coffee .
Michelle , a devotee of Starbucks quadruple shots , develops a debilitating caffeine - withdrawal headache .
Beavan spends a lot of time worrying about the family ’s — i.e. , Michelle ’s — lapses .
When he finds a Sunday Times lying on the table , he accuses her of betrayal .
“ Are you taking this project seriously ? ” he demands .
“ Are you buying newspapers when I ’m not around ? ”
Finally , he screws up his courage and flips the circuit breakers .
No electricity in the apartment means living without a refrigerator .
( To keep Isabella ’s milk from spoiling , No Impact Man tries to construct a sort of cooler out of clay pots and wet sand , but it does n’t work , so his wife ends up cadging ice from a neighbor . )
No power also means no electronic entertainment ( they learn to love charades ) and no lights ( they use a lot of candles ) .
Laundry gets done by sloshing the clothes around in the bathtub .
Beavan ’s apartment building is heated by oil or natural gas — he never specifies — so he decides to turn off the radiators .
Fortunately , his neighbors ’ apartments are so warm that heat flows out of their homes into his .
Sometimes it gets so hot that , even when it ’s frigid outside , he has to throw open the windows .
Seven months into the project , Beavan announces that “ everything is pretty much in place ” and “ all we have to do is continue to live this way for five more months . ”
By this point , he and Michelle are climbing the stairs to eat cabbage slaw in the dark .
On July 4 , 1845 , Henry David Thoreau moved into the tiny cabin he had built at Walden Pond .
Except for a night in jail , a sojourn in Maine , and , as critics like to point out , frequent trips home to visit his parents in Concord , he lived there for the next two years .
In a field that he cleared near the cabin — the land belonged to his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson — Thoreau planted beans and potatoes and turnips .
He made a little money — $ 13.34 , he reports — by “ surveying , carpentry , and day - labor of various other kinds , ” and spent the bulk of it — $ 8.74 — on staples like rice , molasses , and lard .
For a while , he made bread , which he baked on an outdoor fire , but later he decided that yeast was too much trouble , and so subsisted on a sort of rye - meal matzo .
Thoreau referred to his time at Walden as his “ experiment of living . ”
As Robert Sullivan points out in his new book , “ The Thoreau You Do n’t Know : What the Prophet of Environmentalism Really Meant ” ( Collins ; $ 25.99 ) , it could just as easily be called something else .
“ It was a stunt , plainly put , ” Sullivan writes .
When Thoreau moved to Walden , he was just shy of twenty - eight .
He had tried his hand at teaching and also at pencil - making — his father owned a pencil business — but he really wanted to be a writer .
A few years earlier , while serving as a tutor on Staten Island , he had tried to break into the New York publishing world , with little success .
( “ My bait will not tempt the rats ; they are too well fed , ” he wrote to his mother . )
Living out by the pond , doing occasional odd jobs and baking flatbread , gave him plenty of time to work on his first book , “ A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers . ”
It also provided material for the second .
Thoreau ’s voluntary asceticism struck his contemporaries as ridiculous , and this suited him just fine : “ The greater part of what my neighbors call good I believe in my soul to be bad , ” he wrote .
The goal was to strip life down to the “ true necessaries , ” which were few : “ Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys , which distract our attention from serious things . ”
His acts of self - denial , he claimed , denied him nothing ; while the townspeople toiled away , slaves to their debts and accumulated furniture , he was free to roam the woods .
( According to “ Walden , ” the furnishings of his cabin amounted to “ a bed , a table , a desk , three chairs , ” and “ a looking - glass three inches in diameter . ” )
“ I go and come with a strange liberty in Nature , ” he wrote .

The nouveau Thoreauvians have picked up from “ Walden ” its dramaturgy of austerity .
Their schemes require them to renounce ( if only temporarily ) various material comforts — cars , elevators , Starbucks — that their neighbors take for granted .
Renunciation sets them apart and organizes their lives in the name of some higher purpose .
The trouble — or , at least , a trouble — is that it ’s hard to say exactly what that purpose is .
Consider Alisa Smith and James MacKinnon ’s “ Plenty : Eating Locally on the 100 Mile Diet ” ( 2007 ) .
Smith and MacKinnon , freelance journalists who live together in Vancouver , are concerned about their “ ecological footprint . ”
They consult a computer program that asks people to punch in basic information about their housing , transportation , and diet , and , in return , reckons the number of acres ’ worth of resources they consume in a year .
“ To drive the point home , the software then alerts you to the number of Earths we human beings would need if everyone on the planet consumed in the same way you do , ” they write .
“ It ’s usually a shocker — nine planets is a typical figure for a standard - issue North American . ”
Smith and MacKinnon decide that they will spend a year eating only food produced within a hundred miles of their apartment .
Eating locally , as it has become known , has many virtues : it reduces greenhouse - gas emissions , helps small farmers , and probably encourages a healthier diet .
( Who really knows where Doritos come from ? )
Even setting a limit of , say , a hundred miles as a rule of thumb makes sense .
But to insist that everything be produced within that limit brings with it challenges that , while essential to the structure of the book , are in all other ways pointless .
Smith and MacKinnon can’t turn up any local flour , so they drive out to visit a farmer who had grown wheat the previous summer and found no market for it .
He lets them help themselves to his year - old wheat berries , which , they discover , are generously laced with mouse droppings .
Separating the berries from the turds proves to be so time - consuming that the wheat just sits in a bag in the corner of the living room until , eventually , MacKinnon notices weevils crawling out of it .
He ends up throwing the entire bagful into a dumpster , while Smith washes down the walls of the apartment with bleach .
Smith and MacKinnon also can’t find any local salt , so in the final scene of the book they make a twelve - hour journey — by car , by ferry , by steamer , and , finally , by rowboat .
“ A blue horizon , forever and ever to Japan , ” they write .
“ The open Pacific Ocean rushing in as clear and clean as the air . ”
They fill a huge stainless - steel pot with salt water , which they carry back to shore and boil down .
The journey is made to sound poetic , but from an ecological perspective it would have made a lot more sense for them to walk around the corner and buy some Morton’s .
MacKinnon wants us to know that he recognizes the futility of the undertaking .
“ I am acutely aware that efforts like the 100 - mile diet are readily dismissed as ‘ the new earnestness , ’ which is currently enjoying a very temporary cool , ” he writes .
“ And I am not deluded enough to feel that I ’m making a difference or being the change I want to see in the world . ”
( The italics are his . )
He is unwilling even to attempt a reasoned defense of the project : “ My actions are abstract and absurd , and they are neither saving the rain forests nor feeding the world ’s hungry . ”
Vanessa Farquharson , an entertainment reporter for Canada ’s National Post , is the author of “ Sleeping Naked Is Green : How an Eco - Cynic Unplugged Her Fridge , Sold Her Car , and Found Love in 366 Days ” ( Houghton Mifflin Harcourt ; $ 13.95 ) .
Farquharson opens her book with the proposition that it is better to take small steps on behalf of the planet than to do nothing at all .
She transforms this sensible idea into a book - worthy stunt by resolving to make one “ green ” life - style change every day for a year ( all the while posting her resolutions on her blog ) .
At twenty - eight , Farquharson is almost exactly the age that Thoreau was when he set off for Walden Pond .
And she ’s a lot like him , too , if he ’d been the type who , as she writes of herself , enjoys blowing a “ month ’s savings on a bottle of pink Veuve Clicquot and pairing it with back - to - back reruns of ‘ America ’s Next Top Model . ’ ”
Farquharson ’s “ green- ovations ” range from the significant ( “ sell my car ” ) to the useful ( “ turn down my thermostat , ” “ fix things rather than replace them ” ) to the downright ditzy ( “ go to eco - friendly spas , ” “ shop at green malls , ” “ use a natural lubricant instead of K - Y ” ) .
The day after she resolves to “ use no more toothpicks , ” Farquharson is shown a house that ’s for sale not far from her apartment in Toronto .
It ’s newly renovated , with three stories , and , in terms of Farquharson ’s ecological footprint , represents an awful lot of toothpicks .
She immediately buys it .
( “ I must have this house , ” she writes . )
Meanwhile , even though flying is pretty much the most carbon - intensive activity possible , Farquharson is constantly taking to the air .
At one point , she flies to Banff for a writers ’ workshop .
At another , she flies to Portland , Oregon , to undertake , of all things , a sustainability - oriented bike trip .
( During the trip , she sleeps with one of the trip ’s leaders , and so a few weeks later he flies to Toronto to stay with her . )
She flies to Tel Aviv to visit another guy she will eventually sleep with .
Finally , she flies to New York , where she seeks out Beavan , because , as she puts it , there ’s “ no way ” she is going to go all the way to Manhattan “ without confronting my competi — . . .
I mean , meeting my fellow green blogger . ”
They rendezvous , at Beavan ’s suggestion , at the Grey Dog ’s Coffee , on University Place , which , Farquharson sniffs , does n’t seem “ especially green in any way . ”
Naturally , the talk turns to shit .
Air Conditioner units clinging to the sides of buildings are a regular sight these days , especially in humid parts of the world , and as such generally exist without so much as a glance from passers - by .
It ’s only when you step back and actually focus on the ( usually ) creamy beige boxes that you begin to realise just how common they are and just how sweaty the general population of these parts would be without them .
We came across a photo today ( the first one below ) that actually blew our minds ( no pun intended ) and resulted in a search for more examples of buildings seemingly under attack from exterior A/C units .
So , to celebrate these urban barnacles , here are just a few examples of Extreme Air Conditioning .

Knossos and the Prophets of Modernism by Cathy Gere University of Chicago Press , 277 pp. , $ 27.50
The masterpieces of Minoan art are not what they seem .
The vivid frescoes that once decorated the walls of the prehistoric palace at Knossos in Crete are now the main attraction of the Archaeological Museum in the modern city of Heraklion , a few miles from the site of Knossos .
Dating from the early or mid-second millennium BC , they are some of the most famous icons of ancient European culture , reproduced on countless postcards and posters , T - shirts and refrigerator magnets : the magnificent young “ prince ” with his floral crown , walking through a field of lilies ; the five blue dolphins patrolling their underwater world between minnows and sea urchins ; the three “ ladies in blue ” ( a favorite Minoan color ) with their curling black hair , low - cut dresses , and gesticulating hands , as if they have been caught in mid-conversation .
The prehistoric world they evoke seems in some ways distant and strange — yet , at the same time , reassuringly recognizable and almost modern .
The truth is that these famous icons are largely modern .
As any sharp - eyed visitor to the Heraklion museum can spot , what survives of the original paintings amounts in most cases to no more than a few square inches .
The rest is more or less imaginative reconstruction , commissioned in the first half of the twentieth century by Sir Arthur Evans , the British excavator of the palace of Knossos ( and the man who coined the term “ Minoan ” for this prehistoric Cretan civilization , after the mythical King Minos who is said to have held the throne there ) .
As a general rule of thumb , the more famous the image now is , the less of it is actually ancient .
Most of the dolphin fresco was painted by the Dutch artist , architect , and restorer Piet de Jong , who was employed by Evans in the 1920s ( and whose watercolors and drawings of archaeological finds in Athens , Knossos , and elsewhere were featured in a 2006 exhibition at the Benaki Museum in Athens , curated by John Papadopoulos ) .
The “ Prince of the Lilies ” is an earlier restoration , from 1905 , by the Swiss artist Émile Gilliéron ( see illustration on page 60 ) .
In this case it is far from certain that the original fragments — a small piece of the head and crown ( but not the face ) , part of the torso , and a piece of thigh — ever belonged to the same painting .
The records of the original excavation suggest that they were found in the same general area of the ancient palace , but not particularly close together .
And despite Gilliéron ’s best efforts , the resulting “ prince ” ( there is , of course , no evidence beyond the so - called “ crown ” for his royal status ) is anatomically very awkward ; his torso and head apparently face in different directions .
The history of the “ ladies in blue ” is even more complicated .
This painting was first recreated by Gilliéron after the discovery of a few fragments in the early …

Visions of Europe in 2030 A Postmodern Middle Ages
In the future , globalization will further weaken the nation - state .
A long transition process toward global government will be , like the Middle Ages , a time of great insecurity .
But Europe 's governance structure will prevail , even in the United States .
It will buy its way to peace and its model will be copied across the globe .

Cry No More
US Patent Issued
In 2000 Tiny tots often cry for no reason that we adults can discern , at times that said adults might find inconvenient , such as on an airplane or in a restaurant .
But that 's what babies do .
That 's why they are so darn adorable , so we can't stay mad at them too long .
Every parent is aware that a pacifier will … well … pacify the baby , that is until she decides to spit it out .
Then , their little mouths are free to let loose with a gurgle or a scream , the later being not as desirable as the first .
But we have a solution to their pacifier spittin ' shenanigans , the Cry - No - More strap - on pacifier !
This devious device firmly affixes the pacifier to baby 's face by looping security straps around her little ears !
The Cry - No - More looks good in theory and it may work for about ten seconds , until she reaches up and rips it off .
And you can be thankful that the wee one can't talk yet , or you may get an earful once the cork has been popped .

It ’s unclear if this is what Sarah Palin had in mind , said Mark Sappenfield in The Christian Science Monitor , when she pledged to “ effect change ” from outside the governor ’s office .
But Palin's Facebook comment that her parents and son Trig , who has Down syndrome , would have to face “ Obama ’s ‘ death panel ’ ” to decide whether they deserved treatment under the Democrats ’ health - care plan certainly “ put her in the national conversation ” on health - care reform .
And not in a good way , said Timothy Egan in The New York Times .
Not only is Palin ’s “ lunatic fringe ” charge about ObamaCare “ death panels ” just “ pure fantasy ” — apparently a distortion of a provision in one House bill to fund counseling for terminally ill patients — it ’s also “ poison ” for the free exchange of honest information that ’s crucial to democracy .
Palin “ should know better . ”
No , Sarah Palin ’s right , as is ex–House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who ’s backing her up on this , said Warner Todd Huston in Stop the ACLU .
Gingrich points out that Obama is “ asking us to ‘ trust the government ’ ” to use “ communal standards ” in determining who ’s “ worthy enough ” to get health care — and that “ euthanasia is a likely outcome ” of such bureaucratic meddling .
That ’s a “ dangerous road , ” no matter who ’s in power .
The problem is , there ’s nothing like that in any of the proposed legislation , said Jazz Shaw in The Moderate Voice .
Look , there ’s “ more than sufficient ammunition ” to oppose the Democrats ’ ObamaCare plan on its merits .
These “ pointless bits of screaming hyperbole ” about “ death panels ” only discredit those doing the screaming .
To lend some context to this review , I was a big fan of the first Transformers film .
Sure , it was loud and the camera shook too much , but it was a great summer film and a solid take on the idea that alien robots wanted nothing more than to turn into Earth vehicles and fight each other .
Peter Cullen came back to voice Optimus Prime , and just when the human characters became intolerable , there was another battle scene .
I went into Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen with high hopes that this film would offer more of the same , and thinking the critics were merely being snobs when they panned it .
Boy , was I wrong .
This is what happens when the first film in a series becomes a monstrous hit , and no one at the studio dares to say no to you .
The movie is over two - and - a - half hours long , and about half of the film could have been cut with no harm to the narrative , such as it is .
You see the mother from the first movie eat pot brownies and go completely insane .
Why ?
I have no clue .
There is a female Transformer whose job it is to seduce Sam Witwicky , and in one scene she grows a tail .
Why ?
So we can see her underwear .
There are new Transformers , but they are introduced only to do nothing for most of the movie , and then die .
For some reason , in this film the Transformers spit ... often .
They spit on characters .
They spit when they 're talking .
One character spits on two people in a lingering shot that shows how scary it is to have a menacing character spit on you .
There are two new Autobots who seem to wrap up every racial stereotype from a nightmarish Larry the Cable Guy routine into horrific vocal and character design , and the movie gives them nearly as much time as Optimus Prime .
One has a gold tooth .
The special effects may have been amazing in the first film , but they take a major step backwards here ; the robots barely seem to interact with the space they 're in , and rarely seem to be lit from the same light sources as the " real " characters .
The answer to this seemed to be setting some scenes in completely computer - generated backgrounds and settings .
The movie might as well have been animated in many places .
A few revelations do n't make much sense , either .
The Transformers and Decepticons are machines — but they 're grown in organic egg sacs ?
The story makes very little sense , and introduces so many strands and subplots that by the end it 's nearly impossible to care about anything .
The humans pepper everyone with machine gun rounds for very little reason , as it never seems to do anything to anyone .
The human characters have very little to do , and no reason to be near each other ; there is n't a single relationship that is used for dramatic purposes in a believable way .
Megan
Fox reprises her role so she can stand around and look hot , jiggling in the appropriate ways when she runs endlessly in slow motion .
During one scene , her new pet Decepticon humps her leg as she smiles at him .
I guess we know where those egg sacs come from now .
We learn that Barack Obama dislikes the Autobots , and becomes something of a bad guy when he uses bureacracy to try to stop them .
We learn that while StarScream is Megatron 's lackey , Megatron is also the lackey of a character called The Fallen , who glowers menacingly throughout the film , and looks like a Lego Bionicle character gone tragically wrong .
The movie is based on a line of toys , so there were plenty of parents who brought their young kids ... who proceeded to cry every time one of the characters was brutally murdered .
Remember , if you spray coolant and not blood , you get to keep your PG - 13 rating !
By the end of the movie you 're stuck in an interminable firefight where dozens of Autobots and Decepticons die , and you 'll be trying to figure out which is which .
I tend to be a compulsive note - taker when I 'm tasked with reviewing something , but nothing about the new Transformers film made me feel the need to get my pen out .
I can barely remember anything about the movie hours later , other than it was loud and went on forever .
I do have one , lone note : " parachute poop . "
The movie wants to point out that even machines have bodily functions , and it does so every chance it gets .
At one point you see a robot 's swinging testicles , and a character remarks on them .
The audience laughs .
The editing is a mess , the jokes are low - brow , the racial humor is cringe - worthy , and the film meanders forever until we find out that the lion had courage all along .
There is an item that can bring characters back to life , but of course it can't be used when it really counts .
The end of the movie sets up the inevitable sequel , which will likely cost $ 1 billion , be filmed entirely in slow motion , and still not make a lick of sense .
Almost all processed food , from bread to pastries to salad dressings , use emulsifiers and stabilisers to stop fat and water from separating
Millions of dieters have been offered hope after scientists discovered a way to modify everyday foods such as cakes and pastries to make diners feel full for twice as long .
British researchers have discovered that simply modifying a common ingredient in almost all processed food can double the time it takes to leave the stomach – and so stave off hunger pangs for twice as long .
The beauty of the breakthrough , by the Institute of Food Research and Nottingham University , is that it is so simple and uses food additives already used by the food industry .
Almost all processed food , from bread to pastries to salad dressings , use emulsifiers and stabilisers to stop fat and water from separating .
But some of those additives break down when they come into contact with the acid in the stomach and some do not .
Researchers found that by choosing the more stable version of the ingredient , it takes twice as long for the stomach to process the food and twice as long for people to be hungry again .
“ This could mean that you have your cream cake but then not want a snack afterwards , ” said the senior research Richard Faulks at the Institute of Food Research .
Volunteers were fed a fatty test meal of olive oil and water comparable in volume to a large conventional meal and which was flavoured as a coffee milkshake - style drink .
One set used a kind of stabiliser called Tween 60 , which is widely used in cakes and pastries , and the other used one called Span 80 .
The two are chemically very similar , but Tween keeps the oil and water stable in the stomach , while Span allows it to break into a layer of water and a layer of oil .
The volunteers ’ actual fullness , sense of fullness , appetite and hunger was monitored at hourly intervals for twelve hours with a scanner and by interviews .
After one hour , there was twice as much volume in the stomachs of people who had drunk the stable mixture .
This is because when the water separates , it leaves the stomach much more quickly , but when it stays mixed with the oil , it stays in the stomach for longer .
The stable emulsion meal also made subjects feel fuller , less hungry and have less appetite compared to the unstable meal .
The study was published in the British Journal of Nutrition .
:: Obesity can make asthma drugs less effective , a study by the National Jewish Health organisation has found .
A study in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology found that obesity itself does not make asthma worse but it can reduce the patient ’s response to steroids used to control symptoms .
A subgroup of 183 patients taking inhaled steroids for their asthma were classified by body mass index and various lung function measurements were taken ,
The patients with a body mass index – calculated by dividing weight by height squared – of less than 25 , defined as lean , performed better than those classed as overweight .

Millions of internet users who use
Skype could be forced to find other ways to make phone calls after parent company eBay said it did not own the underlying technology that powers the service , prompting fears of a shutdown .
The internet auction company paid a total of $ 3.1 bn for the telephone service between 2005 and 2007 and is now locked in a legal battle with the technology 's owner , Joltid , a company owned by Skype 's founders .
That may make it impossible for eBay to follow its plan to float Skype on the stock market next year – and give one of Skype 's creators , Niklas Zennström , the upper hand in any negotiations .
Zennström has been angling to buy the company back .
Skype is a big money - earner for eBay .
It has more than 480 million registered users and revenues of $ 170 m for the last quarter .
It does not need telephony systems as people 's own computers route traffic over the internet ; its only significant costs will be payments to telephone operators where calls exit the internet , for which Skype 's customers pay .
e Bay says that it filed a claim against Joltid in the English high court in March , and that Joltid , which owns the key technologies for Skype , then " purported to terminate the licence agreement " .
Without the licence , Skype may be worthless to eBay because it will be unable to run it legally – or might have to pay swingeing licence fees to keep it going .
However , eBay 's legal counsel insisted that " our plans to separate Skype have not changed " .
There was no other comment from eBay on the litigation .
The case has arisen because Joltid , set up in 2001 by Zennström and Janus Friis – who both went on to found Skype in 2003 – licenses its software to Skype , which enables the company to build its huge internet telephony system , which connects millions of computers .
Whereas most systems only connect a couple of computers , Skype 's distributes the call among thousands of machines , making it extremely robust .
Joltid alleges that Skype " should not possess , use or modify certain software source code " and that eBay has disclosed some of that code in US patent cases following US court orders .
It is seeking to revoke Skype 's licence on the basis of copyright infringement and misuse of confidential information .
Although the case is not scheduled to be heard until June 2010 , it leaves eBay at the mercy of Zennström and Friis in any attempt to float or sell off Skype .
Without Joltid 's licence , Skype would have to develop a new software system while not disturbing its existing half - billion users .
Friday I attended a Symposium on hyperinflation at the American Institute for Economic Research .
Participants were Thomas Glaessner of ICG at Citigroup , Peter Heller of the International Monetary Fund , Gerard Caprio , Professor of Economics at Williams College , and Joshua Rosner of Graham Fisher & Co . [ Thanks to Virginmedia.com for the image of Zimbabwe 's 100 - trillion dollar notes . ]
Glaessner had much experience with the hyperinflations of Brazil and Argentina ; Heller did also but from the angle of the IMF .
Rosner gave his own analysis , and Caprio served as moderator .
Glaessner and Heller both felt that hyperinflation was only a remote possibility due to the strength of various factors within the U.S.
They both expect inflation at some point , but think that the Fed will somehow pull it off .
Glaessner pointed out that the EU was in no better shape , in fact was worse off , and that the euro was not a real competitor to the dollar .
Rosner was more pessimistic in that he felt the Fed had lost some credibility and that the underlying problems that got us where we are today have not yet been addressed .
He had predicted our current trouble well before it began , but no one would take him seriously .
He now expects another strong deflationary downturn before things get better but also thinks inflation is a distinct possibility once the next downward swing has had a chance to run itself out .
After questioning , he did agree that there existed a possibility that there might be a flight from the dollar .
They all agreed that China might just find another medium of exchange with some of its trading partners .
Rosner pointed out that the securitization market had become the principal avenue of financing over the last dozen or so years , and he thinks that the recovery will depend upon the revival of this market , because the banks must accumulate capital and are not in a position to take back that function .
They all agreed that the reforms of the OTC marketplace will be helpful if they are done correctly ( and useless if done incorrectly ) , and the major OTC market participants are very active currently in trying to see that it is done well .
Gold was only mentioned in passing and time ran out before I could bring it up , which is a pity .
I 'd have liked to ask whether they thought there might be some more action .
In my view , this deflationary cycle is the result of the previous inflationary cycle , and trying to buck the trend to preserve the price level is not going to solve the problem , but in fact make it worse .
Judging from past idiotic government attempts to do so , such frontal conflict with deflationary momentum always ends in distortions , and I do n't see why this time will be any different .
What does this mean ?
It means that the deflation will continue until the market finds its sea legs again , but because the underlying problem has n't been solved , the market will not get those legs until the toxic cancer has been cut out and the financing channels are reestablished .
When that will be is anyone 's guess .
Meantime , government meddling with interest rates , the dollar , spending , and credit will backfire as usual .
The interesting part will be to observe what happens this time .
The country and the world might just not accept another inflationary spiral as they did in the 1950s , the 1960s , the 1970s , the 1990s , and the 2000s .
Then again , I suppose there is a chance they will .
Rosner argued that there were too many debtors in the country who would all be quite happy with inflating their debt away .
But I argue that this only works when wages rise , and I do n't think businesses will let wages rise this time , all the more because unemployment does n't look like it'll moderate any time soon and it'll be an employers ' market ( except on Wall Street ) .
Non-banking business is getting too savvy about inflation .
Rather than pass through any profits to labor , the extra cash will flow back to speculating ( as it has already started to do ) , and we 'll get even more disequilibrium between Main Street and Wall Street .
( Seen those bonuses ? ) We are in a 1929 situation with 2009 tools and a 2009 government mindset , but also with a 2009 public and business mindset .
Whatever we get , whether it be deflation , inflation , or a mix of the two with or without hyperinflation , this is going to be interesting .

The Supreme Court will consider two new cases on the scope of individuals ’
Second Amendment right to have guns at its first Conference for the new Term , on Sept. 29 , according to the Court ’s electronic docket .
Both petitions challenge a Seventh Circuit Court ruling that the Amendment does not restrict gun control laws adopted by state , county or city government , but applies only to federal laws .
The cases are National Rifle Association v. Chicago ( 08-1497 ) and McDonald v. Chicago ( 08 - 1521 ) .
The so - called “ incorporation ” issue is the most significant sequel issue raised in the wake of the Court ’s 2008 decision in District of Columbia v.
Heller , recognizing for the first time a personal right to have a gun for self - defense , at least in one ’s home .
If the Court agrees to hear the new cases after its first look , that could be announced as early as the day after the Conference — that is , on Wed. , Sept. 30 .
The first Conference of a new Term customarily is held in advance of the Term ’s formal opening ; this year , the Term starts Oct. 5 .
The Court has not yet scheduled a time to consider another pending case on the Second Amendment issue — Maloney v. Rice ( 08-1592 ) .
The response in that case is now due on Aug. 28 .
The new Justice , Sonia Sotomayor , took part in the Maloney case when she was on the Second Circuit Court .
Like the Seventh Circuit , the Second found that the Second Amendment only applies to federal laws .
When the Justices consider the Maloney case , Sotomayor is not expected to take part .
The fact that she had taken part in a ruling on the issue in one case , however , would not require her to withdraw from considering cases from other Circuits , like the Chicago cases .
The Rev. Jesse Jackson became the latest public figure to offer an opinion on the future of Michael Vick .
Jackson said he wondered whether there had been collusion among N.F.L. owners to keep Vick out of the league .
“ I want to make it an issue , ” Jackson said Thursday in a telephone interview .
“ I want teams to explain why they have a quarterback who has less skills but is playing or at least is on the taxi squad , and a guy with more skills ca n’t get into training camp . ”
Two years ago this month , Vick pleaded guilty to felony charges related to his participation in an unlawful dogfighting ring and was indefinitely suspended from the N.F.L. Vick was sentenced to 23 months in federal prison in December 2007 .
He was conditionally reinstated to the league last month by Commissioner Roger Goodell .
Under terms of the reinstatement , Vick can take part in preseason practices , workouts and meetings and may play in the final two preseason games  if a team signs him .

It is hard to have an overriding " theme " at an event as large as O'Reilly 's Open Source Convention ( OSCON ) , but during the 2009 convention , one subject that came up again and again was increasing the number of connections between open source and government .
There are three basic facets to the topic : adoption of open source products by government agencies , participation in open source project development by governments and their employees , and using open source to increase transparency and public access to governmental data and resources .
Though much of the discussion ( particularly in the latter category ) sprang from the new Obama administration 's interest in open data and government transparency , very few of the issues are US - centric : the big obstacles to government adoption of open source technology are the same around the world , from opaque procurement processes to fears about secrecy and security .
O'Reilly CEO
Tim O'Reilly was the first to broach the subject , in his Wednesday morning keynote , and over the next three days , no fewer than three talks and three panel discussions dealt with government and open source interaction .
The Open Source Initiative 's ( OSI ) Danese Cooper led the " Open Source , Open Government " panel , which addressed all three dimensions of the issue turn by turn .
Deborah Bryant of Oregon State University 's Open Source Lab ( OSL ) led the panel discussion " Bureaucrats , Technocrats and Policy Cats : How the Government is turning to Open Source , and Why , " which focused on adoption and transparency .
Adina Levin of Socialtext led the " Hacking the Open Government " panel in a discussion centering on open data access .
Clay Johnson 's " Apps for America " session dealt with open source adoption and open data , courtesy of Sunlight Labs ' involvement in the US government 's Data.gov service .
Gunnar Hellekson of Red Hat emphasized government participation in his " Applying Open Source Principles to Federal Government " talk , and the " Computational Journalism " session by Nick Diakopoulos and Brad Stenger dealt with practical examples of turning open access government data into a usable form .
Finally , Sunlight Labs led all - day hackathon sessions Wednesday through Friday , helping attendees build applications that use government data sources .
Government usage of open source
The open source community has two reasons to encourage increased usage of open source code by government agencies : because it believes in the inherent value of open source , and because using free software instead of proprietary software means less taxpayer money is spent on IT infrastructure .
Several of the OSCON sessions addressed the barriers to entry faced by open source as a product .
Some are well - known , such as long - time government contractors ' larger presence in the bidding process and the lingering perception that open source code leaves no one to blame when problems arise .
Other issues , however , are less frequently raised but just as real .
For example , several panelists at " Open Source , Open Government " agreed that some government entities put up fierce resistance to free software because they do not want to run afoul of ethics laws that prohibit them from accepting gifts — if free software has value , then government officials are not allowed to receive the code without paying for it .
That objection elicited a small amount of laughter from the audience , but all on stage agreed that it is a genuine concern .
Solutions to these barriers to entry involve both new ideas and old - fashioned legwork .
OSI 's Michael Tiemann observed that government 's distinctive buying habits permit open source some additional advantages over proprietary software , for those who are looking for them .
He cited the example of product retirement : government agencies are often restricted in how and when they can dispose of old technology ( for security and budgetary reasons ) .
In contrast , open source products that are deemed failed experiments or simply no longer needed can be disposed of easily .
Hellekson concurred , noting that the US Department of Defense has recently acknowledged that breaking projects into smaller , modular chunks is more successful than the traditional large contracts .
As O'Reilly pointed out in his keynote , though , getting open source products considered during the bidding process for most government contracts is primarily a challenge of persistence .
There are many people with the skills to navigate the procurement processes , he said , but considering the specialization required , few are able or willing to make selling to a single customer ( such as a national government ) their entire career .
Government contributions to open source
Once a government agency has adopted an open source package for its own internal use , there is often another battle to get the agency to participate in the open source development model , sending patches or even bug reports back upstream .
Digium 's John
Todd noted that , in his experience with the Asterisk project , public employees often are not permitted to contribute code to open source projects , or they find that there is no process in place to get approval to contribute .
Bryant responded to Todd 's story by saying that OSL had some resources that could prove useful in talking to public employees .
OSL also hosts the Government Open Source Conference ( GOSCON ) , which emphasizes participation in open source development .
Hellekson cited several examples of government agencies that are participating in open source development , notably NASA 's CoLab , the Department of Energy , the US Navy , and the National Consortium for Offender Management Systems , a coalition of state correctional agencies .
Enhancing government with open source
Using open source software to improve government transparency and access was the most popular aspect of the government / open source connection — in large part encouraged by the recent appointment of two open source - friendly people to prominent technology positions in the US government : Aneesh Chopra for Federal Chief Technology Officer and Vivek Kundra for Federal Chief Information Officer .
" Open government " as a political principle is not specific to software , but many of the speakers and panelists at OSCON centered in on the areas where open source software could contribute to the broader goal : namely , making government - produced and government - collected data easier to access and mine , and building mash - ups and other applications on top of government sources that expose new information to the public .
Several of the speakers , including the Sunlight Foundation 's Greg Elin , emphasized that the new US administration 's present interest in open data is a valuable opportunity to showcase the useful public applications that open source software can produce — but that the window of opportunity will not remain open for long , thanks to re-election cycles and waning interest .
By the end of 2009 , said Johnson , if open source coders have not build demonstrable success stories on top of the government 's open data , it will be harder to persuade Washington D.C. to open up additional data sets .
Sunlight Labs ' focus is building applications that take advantage of Data.gov , a new initiative that makes raw data catalogs publicly available in machine - and human - readable form .
The initial data sets released are collected from 18 agencies such as the US Geological Survey , Environmental Protection Agency , Patent and Trademark Office , and even the Department of Homeland Security .
Sunlight is sponsoring a development contest that will award $ 25,000 in prizes to open source application developers that use Data.gov .
The various OSCON panels discussed what tools and infrastructure are needed to better take advantage of the data that governments do provide — including query pre-processors to enable better searching , document - to - data conversion utilities , reusable encapsulation APIs in popular languages like Python and Ruby , and good simulation and prediction models to analyze the data itself in more than a historical context .
Hellekson summarized what the open source community can do to better work with government agencies making their first forays into open source collaboration .
His three points were to remember that " government agencies " are actually just people , to allow those people to make mistakes and learn from them , and to celebrate their successes .
Hobbyist , to enterprise , to government
From an open source developer 's perspective , local , regional , and national governments represent potential users , customers ... and developers .
Much of the OSCON discussion about open source and government moved beyond such practical technical considerations to touch on philosophy , too — open content from governments should lead to more transparent processes , greater accountability , and better democracy , so the argument goes .
However one feels about that question , though , working more closely with government agencies can be a huge win for open source projects and communities .
Excitement over the possibilities was on display at OSCON ; with luck the increased engagement with the public sector will be just as fruitful as it has been with the enterprise sector over the past few years .
LAS VEGAS ( Fortune ) --
It began as the most ordinary of fender - benders .
Cynthia Johnson , an office manager for a real estate company , was driving to work on Interstate 15 near the Las Vegas strip when a fellow commuter clipped the rear bumper of her Toyota Avalon , propelling it into the truck in front .
No one seemed hurt , and the drivers exchanged information .
The accident , on June 12 , 2002 , might have been forgotten .
But Johnson woke up the next day with back pain .
She went to her regular doctor but was told that she'd have to pay all her treatment costs upfront , since a car accident could result in lawsuits and her health insurance might not cover her .
Worried about the costs , she consulted a physician friend , who pledged to find someone to help her .
No more than 30 minutes later she got a call from a man named Howard Awand , who said he was in the business of handling such cases .
Awand ( pronounced AY - wand ) managed to get her an appointment that night with one of the busiest spine surgeons in the country , Mark Kabins .
After examining her , the surgeon referred her to several other doctors and said that Awand had also arranged for her to see one of the town 's most prominent plaintiffs attorneys , Robert Vannah .
All for a routine accident on the way to work .
Johnson could n't believe her luck .
Better still , she did n't have to pay any money upfront .
On her first visit to Vannah 's office , she signed a medical lien .
Such agreements mean injured parties pay nothing unless they collect a settlement ; if that happens , the person holding the lien ( which could be a plaintiffs lawyer , a doctor , or a hospital ) is then paid from the settlement .
" Over the next six weeks , I had so many doctor 's appointments that I could n't keep up , " recalls Johnson , who was grateful for the attention but also confused by a directive from Vannah 's office :
Do n't mention Howard Awand 's name to anybody .
As Johnson underwent cortisone injections and physical therapy , her pain began to ease .
Yet each time she saw Kabins , she says , he urged her to undergo spinal surgery .
The doctor asserted that if she did n't , her pain would be 20 times worse in 10 years , she recalls .
Meanwhile , her lawyer , Vannah , filed suit against the driver who hit Johnson , asking for a minimum of $ 200,000 in damages .
Unbeknown to Vannah , the driver was a federal prosecutor who had been in his car on government business .
This detail meant nothing to Johnson .
But it would come to mean everything to her lawyer : Instead of facing a local defense attorney , Vannah was squaring off against Ruth Cohen , a seasoned lawyer in the U.S. attorney 's civil division .
Almost immediately , Cohen sensed something strange .
For a minor traffic accident , Johnson had seen no fewer than eight doctors and racked up more than $ 40,000 in medical bills .
Working late one Friday night , Cohen called a former colleague , William Turner , who was then managing attorney for the Las Vegas office of Farmers Insurance .
As she described the case and listed the doctors involved , Turner interrupted , saying , " They 're all connected to Awand . "
" Who ? " Cohen asked .
She had never heard of the man .
But she had stumbled into the middle of what prosecutors would later allege was a massive conspiracy whose participants , witnesses told the FBI , dubbed themselves the " medical mafia . "
Prosecutors charge that a group of top Las Vegas plaintiffs lawyers and doctors , with the 64 - year - old Awand at its center , conspired in an audacious fraud .
The participants appeared to act independently but instead colluded .
Unwitting accident victims were recruited as plaintiffs and then persuaded to undergo serious , sometimes needless , surgeries .
The procedures , in turn , helped inflate the size of personal - injury claims .
The result was multimillion - dollar insurance settlements , even for dubious cases , and lucrative fees for the doctors , the lawyers , and , of course , Howard Awand .
The alleged scheme began in 1999 and lasted for at least six years , prosecutors charge .
Business and court records and local press reports suggest that the group -- which numbered about 30 -- colluded in hundreds of suits that yielded hundreds of millions in settlements .
According to government evidence , the group coordinated their testimony as expert witnesses , lied under oath , protected one another from malpractice lawsuits -- even after the surgeries left a few patients paralyzed -- and ate away at the plaintiffs ' settlement money with kickbacks disguised as contingency fees .
For prosecutors , the alleged conspiracy was almost impossible to detect -- and maddeningly difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt .
After all , the process looked remarkably like American - style justice : crusading plaintiffs lawyers forcing corporate deep pockets to pay big for injured clients .
So far Awand and his associates have thwarted prosecutors .
After five years of FBI investigation , three indictments , a highly publicized trial , and testimony from two complicit surgeons given immunity , no one has been found guilty .
A judge dismissed indictments against Awand and one plaintiffs lawyer because a key witness would n't testify .
( The government is appealing the dismissal . )
Though prosecutors have declined to share information not already public while their investigation continues , the saga 's details were gleaned from interviews with 40 people -- including two admitted participants -- and a review of thousands of pages of trial testimony and evidence , as well as nonpublic government records .
For his part , Awand asserts his innocence and dismisses the medical mafia as " nonexistent . "
Kabins has also proclaimed his innocence , and Vannah , who has not been charged with anything by the government , says he has done nothing wrong .
Vannah and others claim the real collusion in the case is between the prosecutors and the insurers .
Awand says he has proof that he has been railroaded by the government , but adds , " Basically my attorney has advised me not to say anything . "
The lawyer , Harland Braun , calls the case against Awand " totally phony " and asserts that his client did nothing wrong .
What the government paints as " collusion , " Braun says , was nothing more than cooperation among professionals .
Because Awand was beating the insurance industry in court , the government concluded " it must be a conspiracy , " says Braun .
" What Awand did is level the playing field . "
Needless to say , the insurers see it in starkly different terms .
As one executive puts it , " This is a horror movie .
In your wildest dreams you 've never seen anything like this . "
The consultant
One month after Cynthia Johnson 's accident , Howard Awand threw open his sprawling lakefront home in Big Bear , Calif. , to Las Vegas ' A - list professionals .
Kabins and Vannah , the doctor and the lawyer in the Johnson case , were there , along with 200 other top doctors , lawyers , judges , and their spouses and kids .
The event , including a buffet dinner of filet mignon and lobster , was a fundraiser for two Las Vegas judges who faced reelection ; some $ 30,000 in checks piled up in two crystal bowls , several partygoers recall .
But it was also a showcase for Awand , who played the welcoming host .
A self - proclaimed " medical consultant , " he was short and bespectacled , with a slight mustache and a paunch .
With his boastful patter , he projected a smug sense of power .
Some guests would later tell the FBI they were afraid of him because they thought he had connections in the military and intelligence worlds .
Awand fed that impression by alluding to high - level work on national - security matters he could n't discuss .
A framed case of military and intelligence medals reinforced this story .
Other people at the party , though , thought he was a brain surgeon or a lawyer .
Awand 's background was almost impossible to pin down , and the truth of it was considerably less glamorous than he let on to his guests .
A former Army medic , he had bounced around from Alaska to Colorado assessing personal - injury claims for insurance companies before setting up shop in Las Vegas in the late 1980s .
Deeper into the house , though , was a clue that seemed to reveal the real Awand .
A framed photograph depicted him jokingly cuddling with Kabins and Vannah .
The message was n't hard to decipher :
They were all in bed together .
( Like Vannah , the other two men in the photo have not been charged with any wrongdoing by prosecutors . )
Long before Awand 's party , insurance defense lawyers in Las Vegas had noticed a worrying pattern : Claims that should have been minor were becoming major .
Patients usually treated with a little physical therapy were undergoing drastic spine - fusion surgeries .
Insurers sent in their top lawyers , only to see them mowed down in court .
The plaintiffs ' expert witnesses testified so seamlessly they were impossible to contradict .
And in each questionable case , the name " Howard Awand " surfaced .
The insurance industry battles some $ 80 billion in fraud annually , from staged auto accidents to phantom patients and nonexistent clinics billing for procedures that never happen .
In a typical scheme , a victim might collude with his lawyer to exaggerate his injuries a little .
But in Las Vegas , the accident victims knew nothing of the alleged conspiracy .
More important , at least from the insurers ' point of view , cases they estimated would max out at $ 1 million were getting jury verdicts for seven times that amount .
" Your first reaction is , ' It 's not possible .
It ca n't be that pervasive , ' " says Nelson Cohen , an attorney for State Farm Insurance .
By 2002 , insurance defense lawyers were so concerned they held an unusual meeting .
More than a dozen attorneys for competing insurers met to compare notes .
Some who had subpoenaed Awand described getting threatening calls from his associates warning that their business would dry up if they did n't back down , William Turner of Farmers Insurance recalls .
The lawyers , he says , recounted tales of strange behavior or even intimidation .
Expert witnesses , for example , suddenly and inexplicably changed their testimony ; some doctors who refused to cooperate with Awand had been threatened with frivolous malpractice lawsuits .
By meeting 's end , the lawyers felt certain they were facing something bigger and more sinister than garden - variety fraud .
At some of Las Vegas ' booming plaintiffs law firms , Awand was hailed as a fixer with no equal .
Before he arrived in town , it could be difficult to rope in prominent doctors to serve as expert witnesses in personal - injury cases ; they did n't want to testify against fellow doctors and feared being sued themselves .
But Awand had a " magic formula to make the dogs and cats work together , " says John Thalgott , a spine surgeon and admitted former participant in the medical mafia who left the group and later was granted immunity as a government witness .
Awand offered the doctors protection , according to Thalgott and others .
Because he held sway over key lawyers , he could virtually guarantee they would never sue his doctors for malpractice .
In one e-mail to a physician , Awand described himself as a " fixer " and bragged of " saving my friends ' butts from lawsuits . "
With Awand 's doctors freed from anxiety about litigation , and with almost every patient on medical liens -- which severed them from any oversight or restriction their health insurance companies might impose -- there were almost no limits .
Awand 's patients became perfect unwitting objects for almost any procedure imaginable .
The " Kabinsectomy "
Thalgott first glimpsed Awand around 2000 .
" This little fat guy starts showing up in the office carrying [ patient ] charts , " the surgeon recalls .
" I thought it was pretty intrusive . "
Awand was there to see Thalgott 's junior partner Mark Kabins , whom colleagues describe as a socially awkward workaholic with impeccable medical credentials .
Thalgott had recruited Kabins and then temporarily handed over his practice to his colleague when Thalgott took a break after a divorce .
Once he returned , he found Kabins making three times his own salary , up to a staggering $ 750,000 a month .
There was only one notable difference between his practice and Kabins 's : Howard Awand .
And so the senior surgeon signed on .
" My greedy voice said , ' I 'll do a few cases , ' " Thalgott recalls .
Awand became a fixture in the office .
Kabins installed a dedicated phone line for his use , and the two men spoke sometimes every 15 minutes .
Awand even entered Kabins 's exam rooms and scrubbed into the operating room .
By 2000 , Kabins 's practice had become a factory producing multimillion - dollar insurance settlements , according to witness statements and interviews .
The volume was so great that Awand himself could n't keep track .
In June 2002 he wrote to Kabins , asking him to create a list of all the clients he 'd sent : " We are reaching critical mass and both of us are losing money by my failure to keep up with the referrals . "
Kabins became so infamous that insurance investigators coined a term -- a " Kabinsectomy " -- for a needless surgery in Vegas .
He often worked 20 hours a day , seven days a week , with patients prepped for surgery from 6:30 in the morning until 10:30 at night , according to several former colleagues .
Kabins would even take calls from lawyers and schedule depositions while in the operating room .
By day 's end , his hands would be shaking and his gown drenched in sweat , one of Kabins 's former surgical assistants says .
When Kabins was n't in surgery , he was often prepping for litigation .
He and Thalgott , along with a constant stream of doctors and lawyers , would meet with Awand for hours at a time .
Awand would " script " testimony , which the group would then rehearse ; he liked to tell the story of a doctor who memorized his script so perfectly that on the stand he accidentally said , " Pause for effect , " before correcting himself .
Afterward , the group would drink champagne and smoke cigars .
The medical mafia distributed millions of dollars to its members , prosecutors have charged .
Disbursements took place at fancy restaurants and parties , with lawyers handing Awand huge checks and doctors receiving envelopes of cash when their wives went to the ladies ' room .
Some doctors received referral fees for sending patients into the network .
Others took kickbacks when their cases settled for large sums , as Benjamin Venger , a neurosurgeon also given immunity , admitted under oath .
He testified that he tried to conceal six - figure kickbacks by falsely claiming to have rented Awand his plane and to have consulted on starting an imaging - facility business .
Awand , meanwhile , earned consulting fees .
He also found a second revenue stream : Almost all the patients were on medical liens , so prosecutors say he opened companies that bought liens from doctors at a reduced cost .
Once the cases settled , he collected payment in full .
All told , Awand 's taxable income was rising above $ 2 million in some years , according to tax returns cited in a government filing .
With these profits , Awand became increasingly bellicose .
In 2002 , Rick Harris , a lawyer working with Awand , attempted to save a client about $ 15,000 by trying to negotiate a 50 % discount from the company holding the liens on the client 's medical bills .
Unbeknown to Harris , the company was Awand's .
Awand responded by writing a letter asserting that it " takes a lot of balls to cut someone 's bill fifty percent ( 50 % ) without even giving them the courtesy of a kiss when you are done screwing them .
It 's obvious that you are never going to be able to handle big cases because you do n't know how to deal with the people who make you money . "
Says Harris , who subsequently became a government witness : " It was as if we had upset the Godfather . "
Call me brother
Thalgott admits that he got into the network for ego , money , and legal protection .
But it was the case of his patient Melodie Simon that made him want to get out .
In August 2000 he performed a vertebrae fusion on Simon , a former Olympic volleyball player and high school softball coach .
Then he went on a scheduled family vacation , leaving his partner Kabins in charge .
Within days , Simon developed numbness and tingling in her legs , according to her trial testimony ( she declined to be interviewed ) .
A CT scan revealed that blood clots had formed in her spine .
Without immediate surgery , she faced the prospect of irreversible damage .
But Kabins -- who was having one of his periodic " clinic " days , where he typically saw 65 to 80 patients , according to a former assistant in his office -- allegedly ignored her deteriorating condition for almost 24 hours .
By the time he finally took her into surgery , it was too late , a medical expert later testified for the government .
At age 41 , she was permanently paralyzed from the chest down .
Simon turned to one of the town 's top plaintiffs lawyers , Noel Gage , asking him , " What would you do if it was your sister ? "
Gage responded that she should call him " brother . "
But Gage would show more allegiance to Awand than to his client , prosecutors contend .
Awand arranged a secret meeting with Gage , Kabins , and Thalgott in which , according to prosecutors and Thalgott , the men agreed to pin the blame on another doctor altogether , the anesthesiologist who had drained Simon 's spine .
Gage agreed not to sue the surgeons in exchange for a lucrative case referral from Awand .
( Kabins and Gage deny any deal ; they have said the meeting was simply an opportunity to hear each side 's position . )
The depositions and evidence that Awand coordinated implicated the anesthesiologist so perfectly that his insurer had no choice but to settle the suit .
By secretly agreeing not to sue the two surgeons , prosecutors would later argue , Gage allowed a case potentially worth $ 10 million to settle for $ 2 million , netting Simon far less than she would need for a lifetime of treatment .
Awand 's hold seemed unshakable .
But on Jan. 6 , 2005 , a small item by the city 's best - known investigative reporter , George Knapp , appeared in the Las Vegas Mercury .
He mused about " doctors and lawyers , working together on a major , ongoing fraud scheme , but with help from hospital executives and a judge or two , and all centered on a shadowy , shady middleman . "
The FBI , he wrote , was " already asking questions . "
Not what they 're supposed to be
Cynthia Johnson entered the courtroom on July 21 , 2005 , for a routine procedural hearing .
Though her case was the only one on the docket , she was surprised to see the courtroom packed with men in dark suits .
Vannah seemed rattled , she says , and he complained to the judge that government lawyer Ruth Cohen had " leaked it all over the community that I 'm being investigated by her and her cronies for criminal conduct . "
At the hearing 's conclusion , a newspaper columnist rushed up to Johnson , asking , " Are you seeking to get compensation for injuries you do n't really have ? "
Johnson had no idea what was happening .
After the hearing , Vannah screamed , " Things are not what they 're supposed to be , " as he rushed across the parking lot with an associate , she recalls .
The bewildering scene made Johnson so uneasy that she told Kabins she would not undergo surgery .
Within a week , Vannah asked Johnson to come see him .
He requested that she sign a document releasing him from her case .
He claimed -- incorrectly -- that she 'd failed to disclose previous visits to a chiropractor .
If she signed , he continued , she'd owe him no attorney fees and would be responsible only for her medical costs , which had climbed into the many thousands .
As she resisted , he grew more agitated , screaming that if she did n't sign , she 'd owe him vast sums .
He stood , banging the table and yelling that she was under federal investigation and that " the government had killed people for lesser things than you 're doing right now , " she recalls .
Vannah denies any impropriety and says he is n't surprised that Johnson 's accident received extra attention from the government , given that a government employee caused it .
Vannah has not lost sleep over the protracted investigation , he says -- even though he has been subpoenaed by government investigators , has been able to dodge an ethics complaint by a client over his payments to Awand , and has been secretly taped boasting " there are five or six judges that will do anything I want . "
Still , he notes , prosecutors have not charged him with anything .
Johnson left Vannah 's office in tears that day , without signing the document .
She had several chilling realizations .
Her lawyer appeared to be under investigation , though she had no idea for what .
He was panicking .
And he'd just threatened her .
She needed help from someone she could trust .
The next day , Johnson called every local attorney she could think of -- and almost no one called back .
Her case had become radioactive .
Sleepless , depressed , and not knowing what else to do , she finally found a lawyer who steered her to Ruth Cohen , the government lawyer on the other side , who immediately called her back .
Within days , Johnson was sitting down with the FBI .
Beating the cavalry
In May 2007 , federal prosecutors unveiled indictments against Awand and Gage that charged them with conspiracy , fraud , and ( in Awand 's case ) witness tampering .
The indictments referred to six other doctors , identified by letters only , who allegedly had also been involved .
Gage and Awand pleaded not guilty .
That was just the beginning .
Some 20 doctors and nearly a dozen personal - injury lawyers were in the government 's cross hairs , the Las Vegas Mercury 's Knapp reported at the time , and prosecutors suspected harm to hundreds of patients .
" Stay tuned , " an FBI agent told the media .
It seemed the cavalry had finally arrived .
But for all the promise of the indictments , the prosecution began to run into difficulty almost immediately .
In the run-up to Gage 's trial in February 2008 , for example , all 10 federal judges in Nevada recused themselves , one of them noting that " it 's wise to stay away from cases that are local and involve attorneys . "
A U.S. district court judge from Washington State , Justin Quackenbush , was assigned and promptly threw out 13 of the 19 counts against Gage , including the core of the conspiracy charges .
The jury ended up considering a far narrower case , dealing largely with Melodie Simon .
At trial , Gage 's lawyers skewered the prosecution , arguing that the case boiled down to an accusation that Gage had netted his client only $ 1.3 million .
Moreover , they charged , the star witnesses , Thalgott and Venger , were avowed liars .
The local press corps shredded the two doctors .
One columnist wrote that Venger needed a " reputation transplant . "
The trial ended with a hung jury .
Gage staunchly maintains his innocence : " I do n't believe there is a medical mafia , and if there is , I am certainly not aligned with it . "
Calling government investigators " despicable , dishonest human beings , " he says they have not proved " one scintilla of criminality . "
Things turned from bad to worse for the prosecutors as the summer of 2008 began .
With Gage 's retrial looming , his lawyers argued that only Kabins could refute his former partner Thalgott 's testimony .
But Kabins would n't take the stand unless the government granted him immunity .
Prosecutors refused , arguing that they 'd already identified him as a target .
Last June , Judge Quackenbush ruled that Gage 's right to a fair trial would be violated without Kabins 's testimony .
The judge threw out the government 's case .
Quackenbush then dismissed the conspiracy case against Awand , also citing the absence of Kabins 's testimony .
In October the government appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals .
Oral arguments were scheduled for Aug. 11 .
Gone but not gone ?
These days Howard Awand is no longer a " medical consultant . "
In 2007 he and his wife , Linda , moved to a historic , fog - shrouded town on the Ohio River in Vevay , Ind .
There they restored a Victorian mansion , filled it with elegant antiques , and reinvented themselves as proprietors of a bed - and - breakfast called the Rosemont Inn .
Though Awand has been able to fend off the conspiracy case till now , he faces a second case : Awand and his wife were charged with four counts of misdemeanor tax evasion .
They have pleaded not guilty and the trial is scheduled for September .
Despite Awand 's departure , according to insurance lawyers , collusion continues among the members of the medical mafia .
In their appeal in the Awand case , prosecutors allege the scheme is " ongoing . "
The doctors keep testifying , and the insurers keep losing .
" They 're cockier than ever , " says Michael Hall , an insurance defense lawyer .
Ruth Cohen , who has left the U.S. attorney 's office and is now in private practice , wonders whether prosecutors arrived " too late " to change anything .
So far , the only person to receive punishment in the case is one of the doctors who admitted his role and cooperated with the prosecution .
In May the Nevada medical board sanctioned the neurosurgeon Venger , giving him a year and a half of probation and over 800 hours of community service .
Thalgott , the other doctor who cooperated -- who by most accounts was dramatically less involved than Venger -- is also facing a threat to his medical license .
The county and state medical boards have announced inquiries .
Thalgott wonders whether he is being investigated for his lapses -- or for talking about them openly .
" I 'm under an ethics investigation , and I 'm the only ethical person in the whole mix , " he says .
" I fell on my sword for nothing . "
Thalgott , who paid the former Olympic volleyball player Simon $ 1.5 million as part of his immunity deal , has taken steps to protect himself , spreading shotguns around his house .
" These guys have a lot of money , and people are getting desperate , " he says .
Meanwhile , the federal prosecutors continue to bring cases .
In March a federal grand jury indicted Kabins on eight counts of conspiracy and fraud , all relating to the case of Simon .
He pleaded not guilty .
In response to detailed questions for this article , his lawyers David Chesnoff and Martin Weinberg write that Kabins " vigorously denied the allegations that have been lodged against him . "
They also state that he has never been sued for unnecessary surgeries , has never been found liable for medical malpractice , and has an " impeccable reputation in the medical community . "
On advice from his lawyers , Kabins declined to be interviewed .
But in a deposition for Cynthia Johnson 's lawsuit he testified , " My integrity is everything ; my outcomes of my patients are everything ; I live and die with my patients ; if they do well , I 'm on top of the world .
If they struggle , I struggle . "
He also denied pushing Johnson to have surgery , saying , " My recommendation is always , if you can live with it , live with it , because surgery has inherent risks .
There 's no guarantee surgery is going to make you better . "
After entering his plea of not guilty at the courthouse in March , Kabins emerged flanked not only by his own defense attorneys but also by a number of the city 's most prominent plaintiffs lawyers .
Kabins 's lawyer Chesnoff says the gathering was an " outpouring of support " from family members , medical staff , and even a family rabbi .
They may have intended to protest what they view as the government 's war on litigators .
But marching grimly in a protective phalanx in their dark sunglasses and suits , some of them bullying the lone TV cameraman , the group seemed to resemble just the sort of cabal described by prosecutors : a gang of doctors and lawyers , with no intention of backing down .
I like to get sweaty in Finsbury Park with a bunch of men .
No , it 's not a bukkake jizzbomb explosion free - for - all of atomic proportions - its fucking about on skateboards .
Now , I skate like I make love - frenetically , with lots of weird jerky motions , a shitload of swearing , and I usually end up hurting myself .
Oh , and I 'm usually absolutley off my fucking head , talking to pink elephants , slobbering at passing ladies boobies , finding Margaret Thatcher strangely attractive shitfaced .
This one time last summer on a boiling hot fucking day , I 'm down at Finsbury Park , twatting about on my skateboard with my mates Phil and Steve .
Steve 's a bit of a Tony Hawk on the board on account of never going to school and learning how to skateboard instead .
The cunt can hardly spell his own name , but , fuck me , when he 's shooting round on a plank of wood with wheels on , he looks the fucking business .
And Steve always skates barefoot .
His weirdly long toes curling over the edge of the board - he really does resemble an incredibly well trained shaved circus chimp when he 's in full flow .
Steve says to me : " Spanky - I wanna see you ollie down that slope there .
If you can't do it , you owe me a pint later .
" I nod .
Of course .
No problem .
Well , oneproblem : I did n't have a fucking clue what an ollie was .
Phil , who 's swigging down his can of Stella says : " You do n't know what an ollie is do you , you fucking retard ?
Tell you what - if you can't make the ollie , you owe me a pint too .
" A few parents mulling about in the park tut in our general direction .
( Apparently parks are the exclusive property of people with little kids when its a nice day and they do n't like swearing , the cunts ) .
" I do fucking know what a fucking ollie is you hairless fucking freak of fucking nature , " I reason .
Phil had been getting on my nerves all fucking day .
He was - and still is - a cock .
" I 'll show you how it 's done , " says Phil , and he slams his board down and sets off at pace .
And then something miraculous happens .
I would quite happily have sold my soul to the devil if I 'd have know what was about to happen happened ...
Phil 's front wheels hit a pebble or - knowing Finsbury Park - a used condom , bloated and swollen in the hot sun , the contents churning into some weird kind of rock hard spunk cheese ; or a dirty old syringe pissing out blood and opiates - and he fell , cartwheeling through the air .
And he landed heavily on his knees , and what with him being a bit of a skater freak , he was wearing baggy skater pants -- which were rendered free from his peachy buttocks as if an invisible pervert had stepped up behind him and wrenched the fuckers down .
Several parents gasped and sheilded their childrens eyes .
Steve and I , being responsible adults ourselves , pissed ourselves laughing .
And then Steve launched himself forward , ran the twenty or so meters over to Phil while he was still a bit stunned and confused , and kicked him right up the jacksy with the sort of grace and poise you 'd expect to see from the penalty kicker on the pitch at Twickenham .
And Steve 's aim was so true , so straight , that he managed to get his foot stuck up Phil 's arse ; his big toe - Steve was barefoot - must 've acted like some kind of living butt plug ...
It was a truly remarkable sight , the ten seconds or so it took for Phil and Steve to part :
Phil on the floor , wiggling his arse , howling in pain - Steve stood over him , jerking his foot back and forth , pushing down on Phil 's head to try and break the unnatural , the unholy , the just plain wrong coupling of sphincter and toe , with Steve shouting : " AAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHH !!!
THAT'S FUCKING DISGUSTING !!!
" And Phil responding with : " AAAAAIIIIIIEEEEEEE !!!
STOP FUCKING RAPING ME YOU CUNT !!!
" They got a round of applause when they finally parted ; well - I clapped at least as Phil pulled up his jeans , Steve found a patch of grass and furiously wiped the stinky shitty chocolate starfish smell off his toe .
I wandered over to them : " If that 's an ollie , you can fucking keep it , lads .
And sod buying you a pint , I think I should buy you two a room and a packet of cigerattes to smoke after you 've finised fucking each other ... you make such a lovely couple . " ( , Thu 28 May 2009 , 14:38 , 16 replies
I hate cable clutter , but what does one do with stray cables that ca n’t be hidden behind a desk or concealed in wire loom ?
Thankfully electricians , climbers , and roadies have been dealing with cable clutter for years , and they ’ve utilized a nice technique that we can take advantage of !
The Chain Sinnet Cable Wrapping Method
The chain sinnet ( aka chain braid , daisy chain , or monkey braid ) is a cable shortening and storing method that can be used to make stray cables a little more pleasing to the eye .
You creating a chain sinnet by making a loop at the base of your cord , then pull the remaining cord into each new loop .
Be sure to keep your loops loose to avoid damaging the cord .
Ultimately , you should end up with something that looks like this :
The sinnet process can be confusing , so here ’s an uber cheesy video that shows you how to create one ; just note that the starting loop is different in the video .
In Conclusion …
I would n’t recommended using the chain sinnet technique on all the cords in your home and office , but it ’s something to consider when tidying up extension , speaker , power , and headphone cords that lie in plain view .
Anyway , leave a comment if you ’re aware of any other methods to deal with cords that ca n’t be hidden !

Vaccine should be available for half the population by the end of the year A third of the population may catch swine flu this winter and the virus could be here for up to five years , the government 's medical chief has warned .
But Sir Liam Donaldson told the BBC the deaths of people with no apparent health problems did not mean the virus was becoming more severe .
A fuller profile of the disease was emerging , he said , in which the majority were emerging unscathed .
Nearly 200,000 concerned people have contacted NHS Direct since April .
On Monday , the NHS recorded the highest number of calls yet as news of two deaths of people with the swine flu virus broke .
A post-mortem has established that GP Dr Michael Day died of causes other than swine flu , while tests are still being carried out to establish why six - year - old Chloe Buckley died .
Seventeen people with swine flu have died in the UK so far .
Death figures ' premature ' Sir Liam , who is chief medical officer for England , said it was " too early to say " whether a mortality rate of one in 200 - as suggested by some experts - was accurate .
The virus will not just be here for one winter - previous pandemics have been around three , four , five years
Sir Liam Donaldson
" We just have n't seen enough cases in this country to give an accurate figure .
" We 're tracking the pandemic very closely and scientists are looking at the virus to see is there are any signs of mutation - we have n't seen anything of that .
" It 's still an emerging profile so putting a figure on the death rate is premature .
" But the longer it goes on - as the virus passes through more and more people - you do have to be alert to it changing .
But provided it stays within the present strain then it will probably produce a similar profile of illness . "
Between 30 to 35 % of people could come down with the virus this winter , he said .
The disease was also likely to strike again in the years that followed .
" The virus will not just be here for one winter - previous pandemics have been around three , four , five years , " Sir Liam said .
But by the end of the year , there should be enough vaccine in the UK to immunise half the population , he said .
It is still unclear who will get priority when a first batch comes through in late August , but it is thought likely to be those with underlying health problems and frontline health workers .

The country of Freedonia is in the middle of a financial crisis and on the brink of revolution .
In order to gain a bail - out from the wealthy Mrs Teasdale , the government appoints Rufus T Firefly as its president .
However , Mr Firefly shuns the pomp and pretentiousness of government ; along with the prudence and rationality of it too .
Meanwhile , the neighbouring country of Sylvania is plotting to overthrow Freedonia and sends Pinky and Chicolini to spy on Firefly .
War seems inevitable .

GM , of course , declared bankruptcy today .
A number of things — bad management , poor products and screwy labor relations — hurt the company .
But in the end , the biggest problem GM could n’t solve related to the company ’s liabilities to retirees .
The company , which currently employs about 150,000 hourly workers , was responsible for the health care of over 1 million people and pension obligations for over 650,000 people .
These pension obligations were probably the largest factor in GM ’s demise and public policy should , at minimum , stop encouraging companies to take on anything like them .
The lure of pensions is obvious .
A pension is another benefit that a company can provide to its workforce and , although quite attractive ( “ We ’ll support you for life ! ” ) it imposes few up front costs .
A company that offers pensions has more money to invest in new products , pay dividends , and meet payroll while simultaneously being able to do well by its existing work force .
The problem , however , is that all companies go through a lifecycle : they start small , become big , decline , and eventually go out of business .
Of the 100 largest companies in 1900 , only 7 existed in the same form by 2000 .
And this cycle of creative destruction is accelerating , of the 100 largest companies in 2000 , by my count , at least 19 have either merged with a similarly - sized company , been bought out , gone bankrupt , or needed a government bailout to stay afloat .
To make matters worse , life expectancy continues to increase meaning that the number of retired people will also increases .
Quite simply , pensions are almost always a bad idea for any private company .
It ’s likely that a company will offer the most generous pensions when it is at the height of its power , influence , and payroll .
As things change in the company ’s market , it will end up — as GM did — with enormous obligations to people who do n’t work for it and no resources or market share to pay for them .
As a result , it would make sense , from a public policy perspective , to change the tax code to create disincentives for any promise that a corporation wants to make to its employees down the road .
Quite simply , it ’s bad for corporations , bad for the economy , and bad for employees .
Corporations should not receive any preferential tax treatment , writeoffs , or anything else for any obligations to employees beyond a year or two in the future .
A typical corporation just is n’t going to be around to make good on any promises it makes in for the distant future .
Companies that want to offer pensions or retiree health care , of course , would remain free to do so but the tax code should , at minimum , look at this with extreme skepticism .
It might well even exact a penalty on companies that chose to compensate their employees this way .
As a corollary to this , the federal government should also stop accepting new participants in the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ( the federal agency that provides partial backing for private pensions ) and look for ways to wind down its operations over time .
( Since it has promised to manage certain pension funds and creates a certain reliance interest , it would n't be fair to abolish it right away . )
At the margins , ending tax incentives for pensions and retiree health care would almost certainly increase Medicare costs and might well result in somewhat more people relying on Medicaid for nursing home care .
But the alternative — endless bailout of pension funds and the companies that provide them — seems a lot worse .
Some of the effects being seen today and cited in the report are familiar , like more powerful tropical storms and erosion of ocean coastlines caused by melting Arctic ice .
The study also cites an increase in drought in the Southwest and more intense heat waves in the Northeast as a result of growing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other climate - altering gases in the atmosphere .
Reduced mountain snowpack means earlier melt - offs and reduced stream volumes across the West and Northwest , affecting residential and agricultural water supplies , habitats for spawning fish and reduced hydroelectric power generation , the study found .
But the speed and severity of these effects in the future are expressed with less certainty in the report and will depend to some extent on how quickly the United States and other nations move to reduce emissions .
“ What we would want to have people take away is that climate change is happening now , and it ’s actually beginning to affect our lives , ” said Thomas R. Karl , director of the National Climatic Data Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a principal author of the report .
“ It ’s not just happening in the Arctic regions , but it ’s beginning to show up in our own backyards . ”
Dr. Karl said that unless the country acted soon to reduce emissions and to adapt to inevitable effects of a changing climate , the costs would be severe .
As it invites the world to play in a mysterious sandbox it likes to call " Caffeine , " Google is testing more than just a " next - generation " search infrastructure .
It 's testing at least a portion of a revamped software architecture that will likely underpin all of its online applications for years to come .
Speaking with The Reg , über - Googler Matt Cutts confirms that the company 's new Caffeine search infrastructure is built atop a complete overhaul of the company 's custom - built Google File System , a project two years in the making .
At least informally , Google refers to this file system redux as GFS2 .
" There are a lot of technologies that are under the hood within Caffeine , and one of the things that Caffeine relies on is next - generation storage , " he says .
" Caffeine certainly does make use of the so - called GFS2 . "
Asked whether Caffeine also includes improvements to MapReduce , Google 's distributed number - crunching platform , or BigTable , its distributed real - time database , Cutts declines to comment .
But he does say that with Caffeine , Google is testing multiple platforms that could be applied across its entire online infrastructure - not just its search engine .
" I would n't get caught up on next - generation MapReduce and next - generation BigTable .
Just because we have next - generation GFS does not automatically imply that we 've got other next - generation implementations of platforms we 've publicly talked about , " he says .
" But certainly , we are testing a lot of pieces that we would expect to - or hope to - migrate to eventually . "
And he hints that Caffeine includes some novel platforms that could be rolled out to Google 's famously unified online empire .
" There are certainly new tools in the mix , " he says .
Matt Cutts is the man who oversees the destruction of spam on the world 's most popular search - the PageRank guru who typically opines about the ups and downs of Google 's search algorithms .
So , on Monday afternoon , when Cutts posted a blog post revealing a " secret project " to build a " next - generation architecture for Google 's web search , " many seemed to think this was some sort of change in search - ranking philosophy .
But Cutts made it perfectly clear that this is merely an effort to upgrade the software sitting behind its search engine .
" The new infrastructure sits ' under the hood ' of Google 's search engine , " read his blog post , " which means that most users wo n't notice a difference in search results . "
Caffeine includes , as Cutts tells us , a top - to - bottom rewrite of the Google 's indexing system - i.e. , the system that builds a database of all known websites , complete with all the metadata needed to describe them .
It 's not an effort to change the way that index is used to generate search results .
" Caffeine is a fundamental re-architecting of how our indexing system works , " Cutts says .
" It 's larger than a revamp .
It 's more along the lines of a rewrite .
And it 's really great .
It gives us a lot more flexibility , a lot more power .
The ability to index more documents .
Indexing speeds - that is , how quickly you can put a document through our indexing system and make it searchable - is much much better . "
Building an index is a number - crunching exercise - an epic number - crunching exercise .
And for tasks like this , Google 's uses a home - grown , proprietary distributed infrastructure to harness a sea of servers built from commodity hardware .
That means GFS , which stores the data , and MapReduce , which crunches it .
Yes , Cutts plays down the idea that Google has overhauled MapReduce .
But just as Yahoo ! , Facebook , and others are working to improve the speed of Hadoop - the open source platform based on MapReduce - Google is eternally tweaking the original .
" The ideas behind MapReduce are very solid , " Cutts tells us , " and that abstraction works very well .
You can almost think of MapReduce as an abstraction - this idea of breaking up a task into many parts , mapping over them , and outputting data which can then be reduced .
That 's almost more of an abstraction , and specific ways you implement it can vary . "
But when pressed , Cutts leaves no doubt that Caffeine employs the GFS2 .
And as we detailed earlier this week , GFS2 is a significant departure from the original Google File System that made its debut nearly ten years ago and is now used not only for search but for all of Google 's online services .
They have a lot of reasons for believing the following groups are the guilty parties behind everything wrong with the world , and most of those reasons are very , very retarded .
Yes , wide - ranging conspiracy theories are n't limited to pulp novels reenacted by a terrible Tom Hanks haircut .
YouTube and Digg comments and countless blogs are full of people ranting about the secret elite who are out to enslave all of us .
Oh , look , they made another Dan Brown movie at some point .
Angels & Demons deals with the deep dark secret organization , The Illuminati , and their attempts to control the world , which means you 're probably going to be hearing a lot about that in the next few months on certain , paranoid websites .
5 The Trilateral Commission and the Bilderberg Conference
" We know you are ruthless .
We know you are evil .
We respect your dark power . "
- Radio talk show host Alex Jones , shouting into a bullhorn outside a Bilderberg meeting .
Who Are They ?
You 'll hear both of these come up during any hour of conspiracy talk radio .
These are two separate , private groups of powerful men ( some of them probably Jews ! ) who like to meet and talk about the state of the world , kind of like how guys will gather at the bar and talk about what the Yankees should do with their pitching rotation .

The Trilateral Commission is a club consisting of a few hundred rich guys from around the world , started by David Rockefeller in the early 70s in order to " foster closer relations " between America , Europe and Japan .
And to bone hot ladies from distant lands .
Probably .
The Bilderberg Conference or " Bilderbergers " are a different group of influential guys from America and Europe who meet once a year in fancy hotels , and they 've been doing it since 1954 .
There are a little more than 100 members and prominent politicians are known to have shown up at their meetings .
By the way , they 're called " Bilderbergers " because " Bilderberg " was the name of the first hotel where they met .
So a small change in plans could have led them to being called the Best Westerners .

Look at these guys , they 're awesome .
We 'd totally let them rule the world .
Who Thinks They Control the World ?
Former Presidential candidate Barry Goldwater believed the Trilateral Commission was planning something nefarious , and so does the John Birch Society .
There have been books written on the subject , as well as articles in several magazines , including U.S. News and World Report and Penthouse , where paragraph after paragraph on this dark organization rubbed up against some huge , fake titties .
Meanwhile , Daniel Estulin's book on the Bilderberg group is currently number one on Amazon 's bestselling conspiracy theory book list .

Why People Believe It :
The Trilateral Commission first appeared on the conspiracy community 's radar in 1976 , when freshly elected Trilateralist Jimmy Carter filled his cabinet with 26 other members of the organization .
Since then , every single administration has had Trilateralists in some of its highest positions .
The Bilderbergers are more secretive about their meetings , so in their case the paranoid are simply filling in the information void .
If they wo n't tell us why they 're meeting , they must be orchestrating a worldwide takeover , right ?
Why it 's Retarded :
The underlying claim behind both is that these groups of wealthy men have been working to create the infamous One - World Government that you 'll see pop up in most of these conspiracy theories .
They want a totalitarian regime that will enslave all of mankind , all at once .

I really do n’t have to editorialize any further than I have in the post title .
Anyone who does n’t think that Christopathy does n’t threaten greater American society need only read this to receive a wake - up call .
The Alliance Defense Fund is seeking permission to intervene in a court decision ordering the Food and Drug Administration to sell the “ Plan B ” pill to minors .
The Plan B pill , otherwise known as the “ morning - after pill , ” is a very strong dose the same hormones used in oral contraceptive pills .
Some doctors believe it could cause an abortion to an expectant mother .
Matt Bowman is an attorney with the Alliance Defense Fund .
“ This is a case where pro-abortion activist groups have put their political agenda over the health of minors by attempting to force a court to expose them to a troubling drug , ” he contends .
Bowman says there is no research on what potential medical problem the Plan B pill might cause for a minor .
He adds that most minors who take the pill do so without parental knowledge .
First .
let me say that I understand that groups like this one do not speak for most people who call themselves Christians .
Even those who are personally opposed to birth control and drugs like Plan B would not interfere with the rights of others to use them .
I ’m targeting a particular , and virulent , subset of the flock with these observations .
With that out of the way :
The claims made by the Alliance Defense Fund are , as usual , high - octane unadulterated bullshit .
First of all , anyone who uses the term “ pro-abortion ” immediately discredits himself .
No one likes abortion .
But for a host of well - established reasons , the choice must remain .
As a result of a March court decision , 17 - year - olds can buy Plan B over the counter .
Girls under 17 can only get a prescription form of the drug , consisting of the synthetic progestin hormone levonorgesterel .
Beyond that , this idea that Plan B “ could cause an abortion to an expectant mother ” is screamingly incoherent .
For one thing , Plan B is not an abortifacient–it prevents implantation from occurring at all .
For another , how many expectant mothers –that is , pregnant women who hoped to carry to term–would take this drug ?
Do men sworn to celibacy seek prescriptions for Viagra ?
Then there ’s the implicit claim that particular risks to minors are likely to exist .
This is asinine .
All ovulating females would be expected to react to the same way to this medication .
The idea that teenagers would tolerate a dose of Plan B more poorly than older women is nothing but special pleading aimed at achieving he ends of cross-eyed Bible - boppers .
Besides , it ’s not as though this is a maintenance drug–it ’s a one - shot deal , for obvious reasons .
The Alliance Defense Fund is unabashedly interfering in women ’s health issues , and doing so with the usual freshets of lies .
If its members have an aversion to Plan B , then they can simply not take it , and they can shut the fuck up about what ’s supposedly good for everyone else .
Of course , they ’ll get nowhere with this from legal standpoint , but it ’s the thought–and the intent–that counts .
These people are assholes who remind the world of two unyielding truths : Christheads venture into areas where they do n’t belong , and Christheads lie with aplomb .
From the keynote speech at the Ohio Rally for State Sovereignty , August 1
Judge Andrew P. Napolitano -
When they were debating the Constitution in the Summer of 1787 in Philadelphia , there were two great arguments - one by the Jefferson and Madison crowd and one by the Adams and Hamilton crowd .
Jefferson argued , though he was n’t physically there in Philly , as he did in the Declaration of Independence that our rights are ours by virtue of our humanity .
That as God is perfectly free , and we are created in his image and likeness , we too are perfectly free .
The big government crowd - yes they had them even in those days - argued that you ca n’t have freedom without government , and that government gives us our rights , and therefore , that government can take them away .
This is not an academic argument .
Jefferson and the natural law argument prevailed because the Constitution was written to keep the government from interfering with our natural rights .
And so , your right to think as you wish , to say what you think , to publish what you say , to travel where you want , to worship as you see fit , to keep and bear arms to defend yourself against a tyranny .
And , after the right to life , the greatest and most uniquely American of rights . . . is the right to be left alone .
We wrote a Constitution to ensure that the government would never interfere with these rights .
Think about it - if rights come from the government , then the government , by ordinary legislation , or presidential decree can take them away .
But if the rights come from our humanity , then unless we violate someone else ’s natural rights , the government cannot take our rights away .
This is not just a democrat , upper case D , or a republican , upper case R , problem .
It ’s a problem with government today .
There ’s a Republican version of big government just as assaultive to our liberties as there ’s a Democrat version of big government .
. . I was speaking to a group of congressmen . . . and they came up to me and said “ this is the first time we have heard that the Patriot Act allows federal agents to write their own search warrants . ”
Remember , in the Constitution , we put in the 4th Amendment , the right to be left alone , to make sure that if the government had a target , no matter how guilty the target , no matter how widespread is the belief in the guilt of the target , no matter how dangerous is the target , the government has to go through a neutral judge with a search warrant before it can get to that target .
These members of Congress said , “ we did n’t know that the Patriot Act allowed the government to bypass the courts and write any search warrant they wanted . ”
Then I asked them a question I knew the answer to already - did you read the Patriot Act before you voted on it ?
The answer - no .
What were you voting on ?
A summary we received .
Let me guess who wrote the summary - some lawyers in the Justice Department , right ?
Of course . . . During the civil war , Lincoln tried civilians in this state where no battles occurred , by military tribunal .
After he died the supreme court invalidated everything the military tribunals did .
During the first world war , the Wilson administration locked up 2000 people called anarchists - same thing as enemy combatants .
No trial , no charge , just jail for the duration of the war .
In world war II , FDR locked up 150,000 Japanese Americans , people born in the United States , who got no trial and had no charges , and when the war was over were given $ 25 and told to go home .
Jefferson was no saint but he was the greatest of our American presidents .
He believed that the individual was greater than the state .
He believed that the states were greater than the federal government .
And when he wrote that our rights come from our creator , and that our rights are inalienable , he forever wed the notion of natural rights to the American experience and the American experiment .
We must be vigilant about every right that the government wants to take away from us .
You ’ve heard the president say , present president and his predecessor , “ my first job is to keep you safe . ”
He ’s wrong !
His first job is to keep us free .
It is his only job to keep us free .
Shortly before he died , Jefferson lamented , that in his view of the world that is was in the natural order of things for government to grow and freedom to be diminished ; how ardently he wish that that would n’t happen .
And in order to prevent it from happening he had a very simple remedy , “ When the people fear the government , that is tyranny .
When the government fears the people , that is liberty ! ”
Here 's a fine kettle of fish .
Pfizer 's lawyers hired a detective who ended up intimidating a witness the day before he was due to testify , according to this Law.com article , Why Did Pfizer Resort to Michael Clayton Tactics at First Neurontin Trial ? : Did Pfizer , the world 's largest pharmaceutical company , cross the line on the eve of last month 's crucial test trial involving its controversial anti-seizure medication Neurontin ?
Two weeks after the trial abruptly ended with the plaintiffs agreeing to dismiss their case with prejudice , questions linger about why Pfizer sent a former CIA agent and private investigator to the home of a whisteblowing scientist the day before he was scheduled to testify .
The scientist , David Franklin , told the Am Law Litigation Daily that he and his family felt harassed and intimidated by the Pfizer investigator 's appearance at their home and are still shaken by the event .
The judge overseeing the Neurontin multidistrict litigation , Boston federal district court judge Patti Saris , issued a restraining order instructing Pfizer and the investigator to stay away from Franklin and his family .
Pfizer , which was represented in the case by Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom and Boies , Schiller & Flexner , has apologized to the court for the incident , but maintains in a newly filed brief [ PDF ] that Franklin exaggerated the facts " to attract negative media attention to Pfizer . "
Skadden and Boies Schiller lawyers say in the filing that Pfizer 's investigator followed standard protocols and was not hostile or threatening to the scientist or his family .
They have asked Saris to lift the restraining order .
As the judge puts it , though , it all has a bad feel , and she ordered the lawyers for Pfizer not to contact the witness ever again .
The witness was courageous enough to testify anyway , as I 'll show you , but the reason I bring it to your attention is this : the opening statements at trial are really outstanding , so much so I thought you 'd enjoy reading them , despite the unsavory detail about the detective , whatever the truth is about that .
The transcript of the day of the opening statements [ PDF ] , beginning on page 3 of the PDF , also includes the on - the - record sidebar discussions with the judge , so you can read how judges really talk to lawyers in real life in those sidebars we never get to hear in the SCO litigations .
Happily , we can read it all , including his testimony , because AmLaw went to the expense of obtaining the transcript from that day ( and the next ) , at which point in the trial , the case was over .
The opening statements are not to be missed .
You can't know which side is in the right from opening statements , I must caution you , because opening statements are not evidence .
They 're what the lawyer on each side intends to attempt to prove with evidence during the trial , and lawyers , as you 've observed , can sometimes really dance so fast and so expressively they virtually spin into the air in the opposite direction from terra firma .
But not here .
All you will see is great skill , on both sides .
The case is a sad one , about a woman who killed herself , leaving behind a little girl .
The estate was suing , and at issue was whether or not the Pfizer drug , Neurontin , was a significant cause .
Mark Lanier , who you can view teaching a class at Harvard on YouTube , represents the plaintiff , and he 's mesmerizing .
He 's the attorney who won a $ 253 million judgment against pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. over the painkiller Vioxx .
If you watch the YouTube video ( more Lanier videos on Harvard Law School 's Project on Law and Mind Sciences site ) , you 'll see he 's trying to be mesmerizing .
He says judges get bored , and so do juries , so it helps to try to be interesting .
And he 's effective , very skilled at explaining complicated things so they are understandable and clear .
By the time he finished speaking , I was totally hating Pfizer and wanting to give that little girl some money .
By the way , on the YouTube segment , he mentions that in Texas , plaintiffs lose on appeal 87 % of the time , that the appeals court in Texas is very , very political , and appeals judges there are voted into office and then tend to vote cases according to their party line , no matter what .
I know .
Disturbing , especially if you extrapolate to SCO .
I wonder how it is in Utah ?
Remember how SCO , when it first sued IBM , sued in state court ?
But notice in his opening statement how he takes a very difficult assignment on , to make the mother who committed suicide seem human , despite the fact that her life was deeply troubled and frankly not readily appealing .
And note particularly how he explains the difference between cause and significantly contributing cause , with his baking bread metaphor on page 5 of the PDF : MR .
LANIER : There 's a difference between something being the cause and a significant contributing cause .
If you 're baking bread even , you know , it rises in the oven - MR .
OHLEMEYER : Your Honor - THE COURT : Overruled .
MR .
LANIER : -- it rises in the oven because of yeast , but it needs more than just the yeast .
It needs the moisture and the food for the yeast .
There are contributing causes beyond just one sole cause in many events in life .
And so you 'll hear the evidence and a chance to decide whether or not this drug was a significant contributing cause .
Simple .
Understandable .
Moisture might be important , but without yeast , there 's no bread .
So yeast is significant .
Moisture less so .
Here 's a case where the issue was about whether a job was a significant contributing factor in developing carpal tunnel syndrome or not , to help you see why the definition matters , and why this attorney wanted to be sure the jury understood the distinction .
Then Boies Schiller 's guy , William Ohlemeyer , stands up , on page 12 of the PDF , and he did a very effective job of raising doubts in my mind about whether the drug was actually the significantly contributing cause , including by pointing out that the doctors will be testifying that they had no contact with any Pfizer marketing and stressing how many times the mom had already tried to kill herself .
And then the whistleblower , David Franklin , takes the stand , on page 23 , and he confirms everything that Lanier has told us about the company marketing of this drug .
That still , by the way , does n't mean that Neurontin caused this woman 's suicide .
She had tried several times before .
But with such effective opening words , I know if I were on this jury , I 'd be noticing every piece of evidence that matched what Lanier told us , because he made me care .
See what you think .
The trial stopped after three days , subject to a deal of a kind I 've never heard of happening , a friend of the family offering money to care for the little girl .
Maybe Lanier 's opening got to him or her also .
The transcript reveals that Pfizer tried to block Dr. Franklin 's testimony .
Here 's what the judge thought , after a brief sidebar discussion where Boies Schiller 's lawyer brings up a matter for the third time -- well , you know Boies Schiller guys never give up -- and then tries to get Franklin blocked from testifying : JUDGE SARIS : What ?
Let 's do it now , quick .
MR .
OHLEMEYER : Two big ones .
Number one , we 're very concerned that the ruling you made on the plea has been expanded upon in terms of talking about the amount of money in the plea .
We do n't think that should have been raised in the opening .
THE COURT : Overruled .
I found the brief that was given to me yesterday was a rehash , except it added the due process argument over the others .
I actually thought it was a fully appropriate opening statement , I was n't sure what to expect after yesterday , but it was fully appropriate .
It was n't overblown , it was only mentioned in a line or two .
I have nothing wrong with it .
What 's the next one ?
MR .
OHLEMEYER : In light of the opening statements , I think you now know from what 's been said that Dr. Franklin 's testimony is going to be about a time frame in 1996 -- let me just make my point , your Honor , please - that has no connection with the doctors in this case .
JUDGE SARIS :
You have raised this point now three times , and I 've overruled it three times .
It goes to the corporate intent .
Besides , a plea can be used to impeach someone testifying , and that the corporation 's agents are testifying .
I am not going to preclude Dr. Franklin from testifying .
It goes to corporate intent , corporate motive , the scope of the understanding of where it was being sold , so the scope of the duty .
I am not excluding the testimony .
I understand you 've now ramped it up by claiming it's a due process violation .
It 's not a due process violation .
This is n't even 404 ( b ) .
This is about this drug and the efforts to market this drug and how it may or may not relate to corporate intent .
You both did -- I 'm telling my law clerks -- two of the best opening arguments I have heard in a very long time .
The interns were here , honored to hear it .
Let 's just hear the evidence .
Let 's go .
And so they do .
The jury is n't hearing this conversation , of course , but it 's part of the record .
See how plainly she speaks ?
And how she totally gets the Boies Schiller style , and she 's just not having it .
So they lose that point and Dr. Franklin is allowed to testify .
Just before he does , on that same page 23 , the information about the private detective appears : MR .
LANIER : Judge , one last point that I do need to put on the record .
JUDGE SARIS : What ?
MR .
LANIER : David Franklin is going to testify about yesterday a private investigator calling himself a detective sent by Pfizer to his house would not leave his house until the police were called with 911 because of his persistence in trying to get Franklin to visit with the Pfizer people before he testified today , specifically blocking the driveway saying he would not leave , would not let anybody - JUDGE SARIS :
All right .
MR .
LANIER : I just want to on the record .
JUDGE SARIS : Was it Pfizer 's person ?
MR .
LANIER : His name was James Danforth .
MR .
GOODELL : James Danforth was asked to find - JUDGE SARIS : Who 's Danforth ?
MR .
GOODELL : He 's an investigator .
He was never instructed to do that .
JUDGE SARIS : Well , then you 're going to have to put him on the stand .
( End of discussion at sidebar . ) ( Jury entered the courtroom . )
Franklin then takes the stand , and he tells what happened the day before : MR .
LANIER : Your Honor , the plaintiffs at this time would call Dr. Dave Franklin to the stand .
DAVID FRANKLIN , having been duly sworn by the Clerk , was examined and testified as follows : ... Q. Would you please tell us what you personally experienced yesterday morning as you got ready to deal with this case ?
A . My wife and my daughter ... were home , relaxing .
I was anxious about this experience .
Q. How old is [ the daughter ] ?
A. Eight .
She 's eight years old .
Q. Okay .
A . So horsing around with [ his daughter ] , playing with [ her ] when my wife noticed she had a voicemail .
It was from someone who said he was a detective working on a federal case , and he was searching for someone who lived in Massachusetts that he believed she knew , and that he needed to contact this person immediately and needed to hear back from her immediately .
This came - Q . Did you have a chance to hear the message yourself ?
A. Yes , I did .
Q . What did you observe next in regards to this message ?
What happened next ?
A . She called back .
We -- the only federal case that investigators have ever contacted me about was involved with my experience working at Warner - Lambert , so we assumed it had something to do with that .
The fact that the call came in on my wife 's cell phone was unusual in that everybody else , when they try could contact me , contacts my attorney .
Q. Your wife -- did she used to work for Pfizer ?
A . She did .
Q. What -- did you ever find out who this fellow was ?
A . Yes , he called back again , called back , I was standing there with my wife and he called back and told him -- told my wife -- this time -- well , actually , let me correct that .
My wife called him and -- returning the call , and he reiterated that he was a detective working on a federal case , the federal case was Bulger v. Pfizer , and my wife is an attorney , she does n't practice any longer , but she did go to law school , and recognized that was n't the way a federal agent would identify themselves .
So she asked the person , Well , who -- you know , what agency do you work for ?
He said he did n't work for an agency .
She said , Well , who do you work for ?
He said , A large group of law firms .
And she goes , Who ultimately do you work for ?
He said , I work for Pfizer .
Q. Did this gentleman at any point in time come out to your house yesterday ?
A. Yes .
At that point my wife said I 'm sorry , I do n't have anything to say to you , and hung up on him .
He called back about 30 minutes later and insisted that he speak to her and that he had an urgent message to deliver to me and needed to see me face to face , and that he was n't going to accept no from her if she did n't put us in contact , he would -- he would not let it go , he would come to what he believed to be her home .
He would -- this was -- the quote was , you will see me , this is n't going to end .
So at that point my wife is now a combination of agitated and terrified , and hangs up on him again .
Getting to your question , later on in the afternoon , my daughter was getting ready for karate ... it was time to leave .
I was changing to meet you for the first time and noticed that there was an individual with his truck parked at the top of our driveway , and he was standing at the top of the driveway pacing back and forth , speaking on the telephone .
Now , in the context of the two earlier conversations , we were alarmed that it was him .
Q. What did he look like ?
A. Big guy .
Granted , I 'm a short guy , so everybody seemed big to me , but he was a large individual .
He had said to my wife in that second conversation that he was a police - that he had been -- he was a retired police detective , but he was a big strapping guy .
He wore black -- those black kind of aviator sunglasses that obscured much of his face .
So he was at the top of the driveway , apparently it looked like he was waiting for us , pacing back and forth .
Q. What did you do next ?
A . Well , at that point my wife was -- we were all , quite frankly , terrified .
I left Pfizer 13 years ago tomorrow , and when I was leaving , I -- we received threats that there was no way the company was going to just let this go , so after 13 years , having a Pfizer representative standing at our driveway scared the hell out of us .
Could n't believe that it was happening after 13 years .
Q. So what did you do ?
By the way , you said you left Pfizer 13 years ago - A . I 'm sorry , I left Warner - Lambert .
I left Warner - Lambert , yes .
Well , while we were trying to figure out what to do , I took [ the daughter ] upstairs immediately , we did n't want her exposed to any of this at all , and he disappeared .
What he had actually done was came down our driveway so he was so close to the house we could n't see him anymore , and so I from the second floor yelled down to my wife that the car is still there , he must be coming to the house , and my wife went to the front door and found him -- we have -- I 'm sorry -- our front door and on either side of our front door we have a stack of windows on either side , and he was looking into the windows , saw my wife and was waving his business card at her , smiling that -- he did n't say this , but he was clearly signalling that he was indeed following through with the threat that he would show up at the house earlier .
We called 911 at that point , called the police , said that there was this person doing this .
My wife explained to them that I was -- in 24 hours I was scheduled to testify here and we were scared .
The police showed up .
So my wife had 911 on the phone and actually pressed the phone -- because he was barking things at her , she held the phone up to the pane of glass that he was looking through to demonstrate to the dispatcher on the other side that this was real , you know what I mean , this guy was angry .
So she yelled at the guy -- the dispatcher - yelled at the guy that she had called the police , this was the police , the police were on their way and he needed to leave .
And he walked up the driveway , got in his car , drove away , and the police stopped him -- I did n't see this , but the police came to our house - Q .
We 're not allowed to get into hearsay of what the police told you , so I 'm going to set that aside .
A. Okay .
Q. Did you have anymore intrusions into your life from this gentleman or is that the end of your direct involvement with him ?
A . That was the end of -- he did not come back .
Q . And this is right before you and I met for the first time yesterday afternoon to discuss what you had to say to the jury today ?
A. Yeah , literally -- I noticed that he was there as I was pulling my pants up in my bedroom .
So , yeah -- we would have - Q .
You were n't doing that in front of that window pane , were you ?
A . No , but he -- he was blocking the driveway , so in just a matter of moments my daughter going to karate -- my daughter would have encountered first , she was on her way to karate , they would have encountered first .
Q. At some point in time did you hear your wife say to him something to the effect of how do you even know who I am or something like that ?
A . He was saying that he -- he described to her when he - when he called the second time , that there was -- that he knew everything there was to know about her , but seemed to be confused about whether or not we were actually married .
And so he was asking questions about whether or not she was married to me .
But he then rattled off my wife 's -- lots of details about my wife , about her business , that she was - had gone to law school , that -- so he -- he demonstrated that he did know a great deal about my wife , but he was confused about whether or not we were married .
Q. In light of all of this , as I asked you yesterday afternoon , I 'll ask you today in front of the jury in court , are you still willing to testify and tell the jury what happened about your time at Warner - Lambert ?
A. Yes -- I 've been subpoenaed , but , yes , I am .
My daughter 's afraid of the guy at the door , so we did n't get much sleep last night , but absolutely , no , I need to do this , yes .
The New York Times in 2003 interviewed Franklin about his whistleblower lawsuit against Warner - Lambert , which was subsequently bought by Pfizer , and he gave more details about the threats :
He said he felt threatened when at least one executive told him that if he talked publicly about the company 's marketing he would be made a scapegoat and be described as a rogue employee in a company that played by the rules .
That is when he went to talk to Thomas M. Greene , a lawyer in Boston , and soon filed the lawsuit .
I can't help but notice that the threat was to smear him unjustly .
So , getting back to the transcript of this case , the next day , as you might expect , the detective visit comes up again : THE COURT :
But let me just , there 's one other issue .
Is Dr. Franklin here ?
MR. FINKELSTEIN : Yes .
MR .
CHEFFO : Yes .
He 's in the back with Ken Fromson .
THE COURT : Let me just tell you what he reported to Mr. Alba .
Whatever that guy , whoever he was and whatever he said , I think Dr. Franklin is terrified , and , more importantly , I think his daughter is terrified , and we have a thousand more cases .
I can't imagine Dr. Franklin is going to travel around the country testifying in all of them , but maybe he will in a few of the lead cases .
I just do n't know .
I think we need to have a stay - away order from him from any private eye .
I do n't know who the man was , but apparently he said -- what were the words ?
I can bring him up here and have him say it himself .
THE CLERK : You may want to because he was very upset .
THE COURT : Yes .
Dr. Franklin , come on up here .
( Dr. Franklin at side bar . )
THE COURT : Hey , how are you ?
Actually , you look taller when you 're sitting up there .
( Laughter . )
THE COURT : Anyway , let me just say this to you , sir : I 'm really taken by what you told Mr. Alba this morning , so why do n't you repeat it for the -- DR .
FRANKLIN : I recognize that there are two sides to every story and that I need to be fair and balanced .
THE COURT : Do n't worry about that .
Just -- DR .
FRANKLIN : But sending a thug to my home to wave at the window at my eight - year - old daughter was unreasonable , guys .
It was unreasonable .
THE COURT : Well , let me ask you , what were the words ?
Mr. Alba said they said something about , " We know where your daughter lives " ?
DR .
FRANKLIN : On the telephone , he said , " We know all there is to know about you , " and then cited the location of my daughter 200 miles away at college .
How the hell am I supposed to remain unbiased when you do that ?
It feels like a threat .
It feels like a threat .
Look , I know that you guys did n't tell this person to do it , but you 've got to -- I believe , your Honor , that it was horribly inappropriate , and there was very few other ways of interpreting it other than really scary .
THE COURT : Dr. Franklin , this is what I 'm going to do .
This case , I do n't know if you 've heard about the resolution of it .
It 's likely to be dismissed .
DR .
FRANKLIN : Yes .
Yes , I understand .
I understand , and I do n't want to in any way complicate it .
THE COURT : But there are hundreds , maybe a thousand more cases , and you may be called upon to testify again .
What would you like me to do at this point ?
Would you like a -- DR .
FRANKLIN : I do n't know that there 's anything you can do .
I would like -- MR. CHEFFO : I can make a representation .
I can apologize to the extent -- see , I do n't know the facts , your Honor , but profusely , I mean , to the extent that that happened , and I take you at your word .
We -- DR .
FRANKLIN : This can't happen 1,200 more times .
MR .
CHEFFO : It 's not going to happen .
I 'll give you my word that that 's not going to happen .
DR .
FRANKLIN : And I 'll give you the benefit of the doubt about what happened , and I recognize -- MR .
FINKELSTEIN : May I suggest , because I think it 's not just Dr. Franklin , it 's the rest of his family , and I think it will give him comfort to be able to walk away with this -- THE COURT : I think this is what I 'm going to do right now .
Until --
I understand there are two sides to every story , and Pfizer probably needs -- DR .
FRANKLIN : And you had the right to question -- THE COURT : Has the right to question , I understand that .
But until further order of the Court , there should be a stay - away order from any private eye with respect to Dr. Franklin or his family .
And you should -- I do n't know that you want to give me the names and addresses of your family .
Let me just make it that specific .
He 's been deposed a gazillion times .
Is n't that " gazillion " your term ?
MR. LANIER : Yes , your Honor .
It 's an appropriate word .
THE COURT : And people know what he has to say , and there will be a stay - away order from anybody from Pfizer having to do with Dr. Franklin .
And you may want to do your own investigation and put your own version on the record for future -- you know , like , it may come up in Texas or Tennessee , you know , whatever .
I mean , this is not the -- but I 'm not necessarily saying that there is n't another side to the story .
I am saying I see a terrified witness .
Something happened .
So whether or not he 's overreacting or not , I do n't know , but he 's terrified , and there was a reference to his child .
And so why do n't we do this :
There will be a stay - away order until further order of the Court , and we will inform you of any -- I 'm sure you 'll want to talk to -- has anyone here talk to the private eye ?
MR .
CHEFFO : Well , we had a conversation last night , and , I mean , there are two sides to the story , but I think we 're kind of past that right now .
And , as I said , I can't say it any more , I do apologize if there was anything inappropriate .
That was never an intent .
Certainly we did n't advise that .
There will be no more private eyes .
The only thing I would ask is , to the extent that he is going to be a witness , we would like a mechanism , if he has a lawyer , a place that we can serve so there is no disputes .
THE COURT : Yes , I think Mr. Greene has historically been his lawyer , right ?
Tom Greene has been here since 1995 .
I mean , I had this case before any of you existed , so -- I think it 's been that long .
Is n't it Greene still ?
I saw him sitting back there .
DR .
FRANKLIN : Yes .
And in this case , I do n't understand why Mr. Greene was n't asked to talk .
I had already told him , I told everybody that I will talk to anybody -- THE COURT : Yes , from now on , all communications should be through Mr. Greene .
DR .
FRANKLIN : I do n't understand why a private detective showed up at my home .
THE COURT : All right , so there 's a stay - away order from you or any member of your family .
All communications should flow through counsel .
And if Pfizer , because I have n't heard the other side of the story , and if Pfizer should for the record want to put anything in and oppose this and move to vacate it , they can do that .
Okay ?
But right now , I want to respect what you 've said to me under oath yesterday and your continuing concern .
And I am going to dismiss this case , but there will be another one in January - ish , February .
As you see , Pfizer could ask the court to remove the protection order , and they did .
They did nothing wrong , they say .
This detective is a fine professional , who denies it happened as Dr. Franklin claims , etc. Detectives are used all the time .
Here is their side of the story : PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
In issuing the restraining , or stay - away ,  order on July 29 , 2009 , this Court recognized that it had heard only one side of the story 
Mr. Franklins  and that Pfizer could submit papers to clarify the record and move to vacate the order .
( See Exh .
A , 7/29/09 Hrg Tr. at 15 - 17 . )
An accurate statement of the facts , as set forth in the accompanying Declaration of James Danforth , confirms that a restraining order involving Mr. Franklin is unwarranted and unnecessary .
As this Court is aware , both Plaintiffs and Defendants have routinely used investigators in this litigation .
Pfizer certainly did not , as Mr. Franklin told this Court ,  send [ ] a thug to [ his ] home to wave at the window at [ his ] eight - year - old daughter . 
( 7/29/09 Hrg Tr. at 13:16 - 17 . )
Mr. Danforth is a 54 - year - old former police officer and an experienced and highly regarded licensed professional detective and investigator .
On the afternoon of Monday , July 27 , he made a brief and unobtrusive attempt to contact Mr. Franklin simply to determine whether he was available to speak with counsel for Defendants .
Mr. Danforth did not know , and had no basis to know , that Mr. Franklin was represented by counsel in connection with this personal injury litigation , which comes years after the separate Neurontin qui tam litigation in which he was a party .
Mr. Danforth properly identified himself to Mr. Franklins wife as a detective who was working with counsel for Pfizer in the case of Bulger v. Pfizer , and promptly left Mr. Franklins property after his wife indicated that neither she nor Mr. Franklin would speak with him and that he should leave .
( Exh. B , Danforth Decl. , at ¶¶ 12 , 17 . )
As Mr. Danforths Declaration establishes , the facts surrounding his brief contact with Mr. Franklin and his wife are not as Mr. Franklin represented them before this Court .
Nor was Mr. Franklins claimed reaction of fear reasonable based on the facts .
Rather , it appears that Mr. Franklins exaggerated account was calculated to inflame the jury against , and attract negative media attention to , Pfizer .
Indeed , as soon as they had dismissed the Bulger case on July 29 , Plaintiffs lawyers began giving interviews to the press about Mr. Franklins testimony about Mr. Danforth , undoubtedly to distract the media from the fact that Plaintiff had just dismissed the case with prejudice after only one day , and to divert questions about who paid the minor Plaintiff and why Ronald Bulger , Jr.s claims were dismissed by Plaintiff David Egilman without any payment to him .
The corrected record confirms that a restraining order against Pfizer and Mr. Danforth , based solely on Mr. Franklins inaccurate representation of the facts and unfounded claims of fear for his family , is not warranted and is likely only to unfairly impact the reputation and livelihood of Mr. Danforth .
Moreover , the order is unnecessary .
Although Pfizer believes Mr. Danforth had the right to determine whether Mr. Franklin was available and to ask to speak with him based on his reasonable understanding that he was not represented by counsel in this litigation , Pfizer will , consistent with this Courts guidance , contact Mr. Franklin only through the counsel he subsequently designated ( Thomas Greene ) , and Mr. Danforth will not attempt to contact Mr. Franklin or his family .
RELEVANT FACTS
On July 20 , 2009 , counsel for Plaintiff in Bulger indicated that Mr. Franklin , a non-party , may be called as a live witness at trial the following week .
( See 7/20/09 Hrg Tr. at 11:16 - 18 . )
In an effort to identify Mr. Franklins contact information and determine , before the start of trial , whether he was available to testify , Pfizer retained the services of Mr. Danforth , a licensed private detective .
Mr. Danforth is a graduate of Merrimack College in Andover and a former U.S. Marine .
He served as a federal agent and a detective and officer in the Fort Lauderdale Police Department before becoming a licensed detective and private investigator in Massachusetts 1994 .
( Danforth Decl. ¶¶ 3 - 5 . )
He has served as a consultant and provided expert testimony in civil and criminal cases .
( Id. ¶ 5 . ) Mr. Danforth has never been the subject of any sanction , reprimand , censure , investigation , or charge in connection with his work as a private investigator , and has never before been the subject of a restraining order .
( Id. ¶ 6 . ) He has never , to his knowledge , been described as having a threatening , intimidating , or menacing appearance or demeanor .
( Id. ¶ 7 . ) Mr. Danforth went to Mr. Franklins home in the afternoon on July 27 after he was unable to confirm , through searches of publicly available records , a business or home telephone number for him .
( Id. ¶¶ 9 - 17 . )
Mr. Danforth had also been unable to confirm Mr. Franklins address or contact him by telephoning Ann Laquerre , a Massachusetts attorney whom Mr. Danforth believed was possibly , and who indeed is , Mr. Franklins wife .
( Id. ¶¶ 11 - 13 . )
Mr. Danforth had told Ms. Laquerre over the phone that he was a private detective working for several law firms representing Pfizer in connection with a federal case and that he was trying to locate a possible witness named David Franklin .
( Id . )
During two telephone conversations with Mr. Danforth , Ms. Laquerre never confirmed that Mr. Franklin was her husband , never advised Mr. Danforth that Mr. Franklin was represented by counsel , and never told Mr. Danforth that she had given Mr. Franklin the message and that Mr. Franklin did not want to speak to him .
( Id . )
When he attempted to contact Mr. Franklin at his home , Mr. Danforth was wearing typical workday professional clothing .
( Id. ¶ 15 . )
When he arrived at the house , Mr. Danforth parked on the street , in a large space between the driveway to Mr. Franklins house and the house next to it , and made sure that his car was not blocking either driveway .
( Id. ¶ 13 . )
After confirming with a neighbor who was standing outside that he had found the correct address for Mr. Franklin , Mr. Danforth walked to the front door of the Franklin residence , rang the doorbell , presented his business card through the window to Ms. Laquerre , and indicated , through the door , that he was there to speak with Mr. Franklin , if he was available .
( Id. ¶ 15 . ) Ms. Laquerre responded that she had called the police .
Mr. Danforth then left his business card in the door , returned to his car , stood outside his car briefly to call David Chaffin , counsel for Defendants , and then drove away .
( Id. ¶¶ 17 - 18 . )
When Mr. Danforth encountered a police car driving towards Mr. Franklins street , he waved the car down , provided identification and his business card to the officer , and explained that he was a detective and private investigator and had been trying to speak with Mr. Franklin at his house .
( Id. ¶ 18 . )
The officer called Mr. Danforth a short time later , after speaking with Mr. Franklin or his wife , and Mr. Danforth advised the officer that he would have no further contact with Mr. Franklin , and should it become necessary to contact Mr. Franklin in the future , he would contact the officer or one of his colleagues to accompany him .
( Id. ) Mr. Danforth did not make any further attempt to contact Mr. Franklin and will not attempt to contact him or anyone in his family in the future .
( Id. ¶¶ 18 , 20 . ) Mr. Danforth has attested : I take my work and reputation as a meticulous , reliable , and law - abiding licensed private detective and investigator very seriously and am very concerned about the entry of a restraining order by this Court in connection with my attempt to contact David Franklin .
I was stunned to read what Mr. Franklin said about my conduct and interaction with Ann Laquerre .
I do not feel that I did anything improper or unusual in my attempt to contact Mr. Franklin .
I acted professionally at all times and followed the normal standards and procedures that I use in attempting to contact any witness .
I never acted hostilely or with malice .
I never threatened or harassed Ms. Laquerre , Mr. Franklin , or anyone in their family .
I never told Ms. Laquerre that I knew everything there was to know about her or her family or that I knew the location of their daughter in college .
What I told Ms. Laquerre is that I knew that she and Mr. Franklin had resided in the same household and that they shared business interests , in the hope of gaining her cooperation .
There you are .
This part of the filing is followed by legal arguments , and you can read them all for yourself .
The reference to the mystery about donating money is explained in this article , which at least includes a more noble response from Ohlemeyer :
He said the detective was hired to ask Franklin if he planned to testify and what he would say , a common practice during trials .
" It sounds like this did n't happen the way it should have happened , " Ohlemeyer said .
" We apologized to ( Franklin ) for what happened . "
I think if they 'd left it like that , made their record without trying to smear Dr. Franklin , it would have looked better .
It 's an appropriate thing to do , to apologize to someone who says you have disturbed and frightened him , even if you did n't mean to or think they are overreacting , do n't you think ?
In other words , I do n't think they had to demean Franklin to get the order removed .
You make your choices .
And here is who wrote the motion , or more accurately who signed it : Mark Cheffo of Skadden Arps , William Ohlemeyer of Boies Schiller , and Scott Sayler of Shook , Hardy , along with the local MA firm for Pfizer , David Chaffin of White & Williams .
He served it , so he may have written it .
Logic interferes with me fully believing the Pfizer document about the detective .
Did you notice the first story is that they just wanted an address so as to serve him ?
Then , in the document , it was that they wanted to talk to him .
But it also says the detective was trying to determine his address .
But the account about the detective says , " After confirming with a neighbor who was standing outside that he had found the correct address for Mr. Franklin , Mr. Danforth walked to the front door of the Franklin residence ... "
If he just wanted to confirm an address , there was no need to walk to the front door .
So I think we can rule out that story .
If they wanted to talk to him , the day before his testimony , then it makes more sense .
But who wanted to talk to him ?
The lawyers or the detective ?
By confirming the address with the neighbor , having already spoken to someone there by phone , his wife , he also by then knew the phone number to reach Dr. Franklin , no ?
So the lawyers had what they needed to call him any time .
The document says it was the lawyers who wanted to talk to him .
So what was the detective there for ?
Did the attorneys intend for the detective to speak with Franklin first ?
The article says the detective was to ask him about his testimony of the next day .
The lawyers would n't do that themselves ?
And speaking of logic , try putting these two sentences together in your brain simultaneously , if you can : Mr. Danforth properly identified himself to Mr. Franklins wife as a detective who was working with counsel for Pfizer in the case of Bulger v. Pfizer , and promptly left Mr. Franklins property after his wife indicated that neither she nor Mr. Franklin would speak with him and that he should leave .
During two telephone conversations with Mr. Danforth , Ms. Laquerre never confirmed that Mr. Franklin was her husband , never advised Mr. Danforth that Mr. Franklin was represented by counsel , and never told Mr. Danforth that she had given Mr. Franklin the message and that Mr. Franklin did not want to speak to him .
See what bothers me about this story ?
By the way , I found a publicly available business phone number for Dr. Franklin , but I 'll never tell you where , so he does n't get harassed .
But if I can do it , why could n't anyone ?
Maybe I should go to work for the CIA or be a private detective .
Here 's why I tend to believe Dr. Franklin , anyway .
When he 's telling about how he came to get the job at Warner - Lambert , now Pfizer , he tells how in his job interview , they asked him several times questions about how he has handled bending the rules in gray areas in his life .
He 's such a straight arrow , he can't think of ever having done so :
And so I was prepared for that type of very technical scientific conversation , even though I knew that I was applying for -- I had initially applied for a -- excuse me , a sales job .
At this point I knew that I was actually applying for the medical and scientific liaison position .
So I expected a science sort of discussion .
...
So when I got down there , the conversations were much more , in retrospect , sales oriented .
The primary theme of the -- the theme that stood out was -- everybody that I interviewed with was -- either asked me or prepared me to answer questions about times when I 've had to bend the rules .
Give me examples of when you found yourself in conflict or you found yourself in a place where you were working in a gray area , how did you handle that ?
And boy , that was n't in the how to interview book , and I really -- I had a difficult time .
I struggled with coming up with an example of a case of where I had been in a gray area or I had to bend the rules .
Q. And did this come up once ?
You called it a theme .
How often were you talking -- asked about or discussed with in this interview process bending rules or gray areas ?
A . Three separate times .
Q. What did you tell them ?...
A . So what Mike was -- he asked me directly to give him an example of where I needed to bend the rules or work in the gray area , and I struggled with it .
I did one of those awkward sort of sweating trying to come up with the -- an example .
And the example I had come up with , I had as a graduate student I had designed an exam and made the rules -- I structured the question and instructed the grading of the exam so that the student -- one of the students -- this was a microbiology class , actually figured out -- found a loophole in the way I had structured the exam so that if you did n't answer any questions , he actually got -- he would get an A .
And so he handed in a blank exam and then pointed out to me that the way I had structured the exam there was no way I could fail him , and he was correct .
He was right on that .
Q. Did you become most popular professor on campus at that point ?
A. I corrected that error quickly , and he was the only one who figured it out .
So I attempted -- I explained that , where I had created the problem and had somebody that was taking advantage of a mistake that I had made that was clearly not within the spirit of exam taking , but it clearly did not -- that kind -- that conversation of how I dealt with the student , talked to the student about him not appreciating the point of taking an exam , he might clearly -- that was not my -- what my response did not answer his question .
Is that not touching ?
He comes across as a really honest guy , who does n't even understand the question about bending the rules , so foreign a concept it is to this man .
An honest , decent person , from all appearances , caught in the maws of a large corporation 's law firms , willing to hire detectives to show up at people 's houses the day before they are due to testify .
To me , you see , it does n't matter how the detective behaved that day .
Let 's credit his account .
Showing up at * all * that day -- that is the questionable conduct to me .
And I doubt there is a human being in the world , on a jury or not , who would n't agree and who would n't think to him or herself that when a witness has a detective show up like this at the home , the witness is likely telling the absolute truth .
I know .
There 's two sides to every story .
But sometimes only one of them is so .
By the way , guess what Pfizer wanted Dr. Franklin to do ?
His testimony is that they wanted him to visit doctors and convince them that Neurontin was fabulous for things the FDA had n't approved the drug for .
I did n't know that CVS and Walmart sell their lists of what doctors prescribe to companies that then sell them to companies like Pfizer .
That 's got to ring the chimes of yuckiness pretty loudly .
But apparently that is what happens .
So he was supposed to go down the list , calling on these doctors , focusing on the ones who prescribed the most in the areas of interest .
Lanier explained how that off - label selling works in his opening :
They have a market of $ 50 million , so they start trying to figure out what they can do to expand the market .
The drug company makes a conscious decision to do something that is illegal .
The law says the drug company can only market the drug for its approved purposes .
That law does n't apply to doctors .
Doctors can write prescriptions all the time for whatever the doctor thinks is appropriate , but the drug company can't go out there and market and sell the drug for what 's called " off-label . "
Important words , if you do n't mind me just writing them down for a minute .
" Off - label . "
Off - label marketing is " illegal . "
Now , that may seem oversimplistic , and I 'm not trying to turn this into law school , but it 's illegal .
You can't do it .
The drug companies can't do it , and they know it .
The thing is , the drug company figures out there 's a world of people paying big dollars for drugs for things that Neurontin has not been approved for , but Neurontin falls into this class of drugs called antiepileptic drugs , AED .
Anti , against , epileptic , epilepsy , drugs .
And some doctors have used antiepileptic drugs before to help people with pain .
Well , that would be huge .
The pain market is big .
So what the drug company starts doing is making a deliberate effort to illegally market this drug off - label .
I do n't know what it is in your life , there 's got to be something in your life that relates this way to you .
The picture I always get in my brain is from cartoons growing up .
When I grew up , you remember we had the Bugs Bunny - some of you may be too young to remember that -- but the Bugs Bunny cartoons and all of that ?
Have you ever seen the cartoon where they have the snowball that starts at the top of the hill and it starts rolling down , and as it gathers momentum , it just gets bigger and bigger ; and then , you know , you 've got arms and legs of people in the way flying out and all , and it 's gets on down the hill .
What the drug company does is makes a conscientious decision to market this off - label in a way where it takes on a life of its own , and it becomes a massive growing snowball that nothing really is going to get in the way and stop .
They enter into an elaborate programmed plan to deliberately get doctors and people thinking that this drug is the wonder drug that will cure anything that ails you ....
Our first witness is a fellow named David Franklin , and we 'll start him with the Court 's permission before today is over , but it will take through tomorrow to finish him up with all the questions that we 've got and that they 've got .
David Franklin is an interesting fellow .
He graduated with an undergraduate degree in microbiology from the University of Rhode Island .
Then he gets his Ph.D. from there , and he 's working at Dana Farber as a cancer researcher and doing cancer work over at Dana Farber .
He gets a job going to work for the drug company .
When he gets the job , he 's being told -- now , he 's not a medical doctor .
You 'll hear all about this .
He 's just a Ph.D.
He does n't wear a stethoscope , he can't write prescriptions , but gets hired at triple his former salary so that on behalf of the drug company he can go into the doctors ' offices where he 's introduced as a doctor , never being told , well , not really a medical doctor .
And he sits there and he 's trained to teach these doctors and convince these doctors to write prescriptions for Neurontin for off - label reasons , to write prescriptions for Neurontin to cure ADD in children , to write prescriptions for Neurontin to do all sorts of different things .
I 'll ask him ; you 'll get to hear him .
He 'll tell you that that was n't the only thing ; that the drug company also told him to go out there and to convince the doctors to write what 's called megadosing .
You see , it 's not enough that the drug company is going to try and expand their profit margins by selling it off - label .
The FDA only approves it in dosages up to , I think at the time it was 1,800 milligrams , but the salespeople are told to go out there and to convince the doctors that they can do not 1,800 .
" Give them 21 , give them 25 , give them 28 , give them 31 , give them 4,000 , give them 4,800 a day , more and more and more pills .
Get it up as high as you can . "
There 's a joking memo about one woman who's on the drug who winds up trying to commit suicide , and she 's taken hundreds of them to try and do it , and the joke within the drug company was , " That was the world 's most expensive suicide attempt . "
But they 're pushing this drug in ways outside the label and at dosages not approved .
Now , there are some restrictions on how they can do this and what they can do with the doctors .
You , for example , if you 're a drug company are not allowed to pay a doctor to write a prescription , and are n't we glad ?
Would n't you hate -- golden rule , excuse me , your Honor .
It 's a good thing that drug companies do n't have the power to pay doctors behind our back to write prescriptions for us .
That 's an important public health policy .
But the drug company found what they thought was a way around that .
They would go to the doctors , and they would say , " Doctor , I can't pay you to write a prescription , but I 'll tell you what I can do .
If you 'll let me watch you write the prescription , we 'll say that I 'm learning from you .
I 'm learning how you sign your name .
I 'm learning how you write a prescription .
And I can pay you 350 bucks if you 'll let me do that .
It goes on , and I 'll never fill a prescription again as long as I live without thinking of this and wondering if I really need it or if it 's really safe .
So it 's illegal , but this honest man was being trained to do it , and his conscience troubled him .
On the stand he is asked by Lanier if he felt a letdown when he realized what the job really was : A. No -- I think the question -- that does n't capture - how do I put it ?
It was n't a letdown .
I knew I was applying -- I had applied for a sales job .
Eventually I realized that I was in a sales position .
If I had taken the sales job and found myself , you know , four months later in a sales position , I would have gotten what I expected , where the disappointment or the letdown was that the sales position -- the sales that I was responsible for were sales that were prohibited by the -- by law .
And so my letdown , if you will , was that I was selling products illegally .
So it -- how do I put it -- that -- I guess I 've answered it with a long answer , is the letdown , because I applied for a sales job , I found myself in a sales job would be -- letdown would n't actually capture that .
That would be what I actually expected .
What the letdown actually was , was that I was in a sales job where my responsibility was to sell products illegally .
So , he left , and if you read this affidavit [ PDF ] from his earlier qui tam , which means whistleblower , lawsuit regarding Neurontin , which resulted in a $ 430 million fine against Pfizer , you learn he only worked there for four months before quitting .
You can read about the earlier case , and find out what all that money in damages went to fund here :
In December of 1993 , Parke - Davis , then a subdivision of Warner - Lambert , received approval for its drug Neurontin® ( gabapentin ) by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .
The original FDA approval stipulated that Neurontin® could be used in conjunction with another drug to control epileptic seizures .
Since 2002 Neurontin® has been approved by the FDA to control residual pain after shingles .
In 1996 the manufacturer hired Dr. David Franklin , a microbiologist and former fellow at Harvard Medical School , as a medical liaison , an expert field scientist to answer prescriber questions .
Soon after Dr. Franklin started the job he had tremendous qualms about what he was doing .
Franklin says he became part of a broad mission to deceive , even entice doctors to prescribe drugs to patients whether it was scientifically justified or not . 
One of things Dr. Franklin was hired to do was to push the off - label uses of the drug Neurontin® .
Prescribers may prescribe an off - label use for a medication if it is good medical practice to do so .
However , manufacturers are prohibited from marketing medications for off - label uses .
Dr. Franklin filed a federal qui tam , or whistleblower lawsuit against Pfizer , which had acquired Warner - Lambert and its Parke - Davis division in 2000 , charging the company with violations of the False Claims Act .
Profits for sales of Neurontin® were increasing from $ 97.5 million in 1995 to $ 2.5 billion in 2003 .
Further , Warner - Lambert reported in 2000 that up to 78 % of the prescriptions for Neurontin® were for off - label purposes .
The U.S. Attorneys office in Boston intervened , brought more charges under FDA criminal statutes .
This private / public charge on pharmaceutical industry giant Pfizer forced a settlement in the amount of $ 430 million , the second largest settlement of its kind .
While Direct - to - Consumer advertising is rampant , what is more hidden is the industry tactics to influence the prescribing practices of doctors .
In this case , we are given a glimpse into the $ 20 billion spent annually on marketing and promotion by the pharmaceutical industry .
There 's a browsable Drug Industry Document Archive at the U. of California , San Francisco , made possible by that trial : The Drug Industry Document Archive ( DIDA ) contains over 1500 documents about pharmaceutical industry clinical trials , publication of study results , pricing , marketing , relations with physicians and involvement in continuing medical education .
Most of these previously secret documents were made public as a result of lawsuits against the following pharmaceutical companies : Merck & Co. , Parke - Davis , Warner - Lambert , and Pfizer .
For further information on documents connected to these lawsuits , please consult The Documents .
If you search for Franklin , David , you 'll find buckets of documents from the trial , including the complaint .
If you click on the link to transcripts , you 'll find all the filings in the case , and some depositions .
It 's a gold mine .
The author of this Annals of Medicine article actually read 8000 pages of those documents , and analyzes them , confirming Franklin 's account .
Here 's a resources page on the case , which includes a link to the Department of Justice press release from 2004 about the settlement , which included agreeing to a guilty plea by the company .
And the Journal of Medicine published an article in January , The Neurontin Legacy  Marketing through Misinformation and Manipulation about the case , which you can purchase or read if you have a prescription , or read it here .
The authors mention the legacy of this case includes this :
What is Neurontin 's legacy ?
First , we have learned that pharmaceutical marketing can be comprehensive , strategic , well financed , disguised as " education " and " research , " influential , and very effective .
Promotion of Neurontin was neither discrete , compartmentalized , nor readily apparent ; instead , it was intercalated in nearly every aspect of physicians ' professional lives , from the accoutrements of practice to lectures , professional meetings , and publications .
Although some pharmaceutical marketing may be less opaque , deceptive , and manipulative , evidence indicates that drug promotion can corrupt the science , teaching , and practice of medicine .
Second , such comprehensive marketing involved many people and institutions that apparently failed to recognize the serious ethical and legal problems with their actions .
Employees of Parke Davis , the medical - education companies it hired , and many physicians ( consultants , advisors , educators , and researchers ) all participated knowingly .
Universities , hospitals , professional organizations , and foundations also participated , and oversight agencies such as the FDA and the Department of Justice did not intervene quickly .
Apparently , there was a shared acceptance that Parke Davis 's marketing was simply business as usual .
However , Dr. Franklin stood up and refused to do it .
And when he did , he changed the world for the better .
That is the man that these lawyers have just described as some kind of dishonest media hound .
There is an intriguing detail in this document from the earlier case , Disclosure of Information by Relator David P. Franklin Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3730 b( 2 ) , in the DIDA collection : Under initial training for medical liaisons , they were told , after the video tape had been turned off , that if they were cold - calling with a sales representatives , have the representative fill out the IRF so that they would be covered .
However , when asked if sales representatives could sign the IRFs instead of the physician , Jim Parker stated that the FDA would see that as a forgery .
In a conversation on July 1 , 1996 with Dr . Franklin and John Krukor , Phil Magistro said " I checked with people way over Jim Parker 's head and it's okay to have the sales reps sign the IRF forms .
Really , do n't worry about it , nobody checks those things anyway . "
Dr .
Franklin replied , " I ca n't even get the forms themselves . "
Both Magistro and Krukar laughed and Magistro said , " See what I mean , these things are low priority , if something happens then we 'll produce ( laugh ) what they want , do n't worry . "
Krukar added , " In fact ' , I wish you guys would stop asking about this stuff , it just makes everybody anxious .
If you guys are that anal you should rethink if you should be part of this team .
We 're going places , you do n't go anywhere filling out forms .
If you want to fill out forms for a living , get a state job . "
In the entire time Dr. Franklin worked for Parke - Davis , he never possessed a Physician Information Request Form .
This is the company whose lawyers now accuse Dr. Franklin of making up stories to get media attention .
Who ya gonna believe ?
I 'm mentioning all these resources , because it 's important to make clear that Franklin 's allegations against Pfizer are not untested .
He , and the DOJ , won the case .
There is a record here as to Dr. Franklin 's believability , even if the company has had its Road to Damascus moment and has turned itself around since .
And I know how it feels to be smeared .
And I know it matters to put the truth out there to counter smears , so I wanted to put that information here , right beside the smear , all in one place , so that when people , including this ethical man 's daughters , read about this case after finding it on Google , they 'll have the entire picture .
Update 2 : In April of 2010 , there was a study that found Nerontin , as well as other anticonvulsive drugs , raise the risk of suicide .
Update 3 : In December of 2010 , allegations surfaced that Pfizer hired investigators to dig up dirt on the then - attorney general of Nigeria to pressure him to drop litigation brought against the company for testing a drug without parental knowledge on children there .
Update : Here 's Mr. Lanier 's opening statement , followed by Mr. Ohlemeyer 's , as text , and as you read them , I think you 'll see that despite the brilliance of Mr. Lanier 's performance , there was no need to send any intimidation to deal with Dr. Franklin , if that happened , as the facts were more on Mr. Ohlemeyer 's side , and he has the skill to handle whatever the other side presented without the need for any English on the ball .
But to me the most interesting thing to notice is how each of these attorneys handle an identical problem -- namely , that the jury might really dislike their client : ********************************
OPENING STATEMENT BY MR .
LANIER : MR .
LANIER : May it please the Court , good morning , ladies and gentlemen .
My name is Mark Lanier .
It 's my honor today and throughout this trial to some degree , at least , to be able to represent Regina Bulger .
Regina , would you stand up so they know who you are , please .
She 's that sweet little ten - year - old right there , who 's just finished fourth grade and is starting fifth grade in the fall .
She 's in the summer .
She 's lives with her grandmother , Grandma Pat .
Would you stand up , please , and let them know who you are .
And they wo n't be here for very much of the trial .
In fact , I 'm going to ask them to leave , if you do n't mind , at this point now that the jury has seen you , and thank you all for coming down here this morning .
You 'll get to know more about them and you 'll get to know more about why they leave as -- this gentleman who 's standing up now is Dr. David Egilman .
He teaches at Brown and is a doctor nearby , and is the legal representative for purposes of this lawsuit of the young lady that you 've just seen , Regina .
Thank you , Dr. Egilman .
This is a simple case , but it 's a very serious case .
It 's a very serious case because it involves some delicate issues , but it involves some important policy issues as well .
And those at this point , eight of you -- no , nine of you , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine of you that are left on this jury at this point are actually doing something that 's extremely important as you make your way through this case .
And what I get to do over the next 57 minutes at this point before I get the hook is , I get to tell you what I anticipate the evidence is going to be .
It 's a case that evolves ultimately around that young girl from here on out , but she 's not the main character in the past part of the story .
The past part of this story involves her mother , Susan Bulger .
Susan committed suicide , and it will be five years ago next week on August 4 .
Regina and her father , Ron , Sr. , are who found the mom dangling at the end of a wire in the basement .
It 's a tough , tough thing when you 're dealing with suicide .
Suicide is not a simple matter .
And we 're going to have to probe in this case , what is it that allows a person to kill themselves ?
It 's not something that 's common in the United States .
Oh , it happens , and I think most of us , the older we get , we can find where we 've brushed up with awareness of it somewhere in our life , but what is it that happens ?
You know , the way we 're made , the doctors will explain , we 've got within us kind of a wall of self - preservation .
There 's this will that says , " I do n't want to stick my hand in fire .
You know , it 's going to burn , it 's going to hurt .
I do n't want to do damage and destruction to my body . "
Now , some people have , some doctors call it the will to live .
Some people have a really strong will to live .
You probably heard stories about people the doctors thought were going to die in the hospital , but they just seemed to hang on .
And doctors might say they have a strong will to live or they need to let go or something like that , but there is this wall of self - preservation that we have .
And I think the evidence is going to indicate some people have a bigger wall than others , some people have a really strong will to live .
Some folks , their will to live is not as strong .
Some people have a very low wall , and those people are people who are susceptible to , in danger of something that might hurt themselves , some type of a suicide .
The evidence in this case is going to show you that Susan Bulger , Regina 's mom , had a very low wall .
She had a very , very tough life .
She had a tough childhood .
She grew up in an abusive home .
Her parents abused her verbally .
They may have abused her physically .
I do n't know .
But early in her life she got hooked up with a fellow named Ron Bulger .
He was n't the kind of guy that most parents want their daughters to hook up with , a tough husband .
And so she 's in a marriage where her husband is a drug user .
He used illegal drugs , cocaine , heroin , a number of different illegal drugs .
Susan Bulger herself lived a very tough life , did many of the same things as her husband .
She found herself addicted at one point in life to cocaine .
She found herself addicted at one point in life to heroin .
She tried to , maybe -- I mean , this is some degree of speculation , but she clearly tried to at least hurt herself and gain attention , if not actually try to commit suicide , multiple times in her life from a very early age , four , five , six times maybe , depending on how you take certain events .
She and her husband Ron , they had a son , Ron , Jr. , and you 'll hear about Ron , Jr. Ron , Jr. is now in his early twenties .
I do n't have him down here .
You 'll understand why more and more as we go through the trial .
You 'll understand my concern , and what you 're going to hear my evidence point to is what we need to do for this young lady and not really for the husband -- MR .
OHLEMEYER : Objection , your Honor .
THE COURT : Overruled .
MR .
LANIER : Not for the husband , and not even for Ron , Jr. , the older brother .
So the evidence is going to be targeted around the young lady , around Regina , and what I believe have been her damages and what we need to do to take care of her and keep her on a road to a good life that she 's on right now .
As we look at this , though , you 're going to see that the mom , Susan , and the dad , Ron , Sr. , they had a son , this older brother .
Susan tried hard to be a good mom .
I 'm sure Ron , Sr. tried hard to be a good dad .
There were limits to how good they were .
They were young for that child , and they had struggles .
They lost custody of the child for a while because of the drug abuse in their home .
It 's a sad situation to sit and learn from .
If you take that social sadness , add to it -- let me add another layer now .
There 's not just social sadness in her life .
There are lots of other physical problems she had .
Susan Bulger , the mom , had rheumatoid arthritis , painful advanced rheumatoid arthritis .
She had fifteen , sixteen , seventeen surgeries in her life .
She lost all but four of her teeth .
She had just had an elbow surgery within a few years of her suicide .
She had aches and pains that required her to be on more medicines , I 'd almost say more than Pfizer makes , but that 's not true .
I mean , just lots of medicines .
I could give you big charts with 80 gazillion types of medicines she 'd been on all of her life .
At the time she committed suicide , she 's on maybe five or six medicines , but over her life she 'd been on a ton of them to try and deal with the pain .
She was on methadone at the time of her suicide simply for pain relief .
I think she was out of tablets at the time , so she was clearly hurting actually .
But this is a woman who had physical pain .
She had emotional difficulties from childhood .
This is a woman who had a tough marriage .
She 'd been talking to some people about leaving her husband .
But she had a bright spot in her life , and the bright spot was that little girl she named Regina .
It 's Latin for " queen . "
I think the evidence is going to show you that in some way , with the pregnancy of Regina , Susan Bulger tried to turn her life around .
She went onto methadone and some other drugs while she was pregnant so she would n't be using heroin .
She did what she could do to try and make sure she did n't lose this child the way she 'd lost her son .
You do n't -- you know , there 's the old expression , " You do n't turn a battle ship on a dime . "
Well , you do n't turn your life around generally -- I know historically there have been a few roads to Damascus , but you do n't generally turn a life around on a dime .
But you 'll clearly see that there were efforts made .
There were n't suicide attempts anymore .
There were n't issues of abject drug usage , illegal drugs , cocaine , heroin , that kind of stuff .
You 've got a woman who 's trying to do her best who 's a good mother to the child , who loves the child .
And my hope will be the Judge will let us put Regina on the stand , and you 'll get to see what a wonderful young lady she is .
And that 's going to be your task .
The stand is back here in the courtroom .
I pointed the wrong way .
But you 'll get to judge that credibility , and I want you to .
I want you to hear from her , and I want you to see what kind of girl you sit in judgment on .
And that 's the kind of evidence that we 've got , so what happens ?
Why are we here ?
Suicide is an unfortunate thing , but you can rightly say to me , " Lanier , what does that have to do with Pfizer ?
It sounds like it's got to do with everything unfortunate in this woman 's life , but how does Pfizer enter into the picture ? "
Let me explain that to you .
You 're not asked as jurors to decide what the cause was of Susan Bulger 's suicide .
The issue that you 're going to have before you is whether or not the conduct from Pfizer and its predecessor company , conduct was outside the boundaries of what 's right and wrong based on what the Court tells you .
You make that decision , and then you decide whether or not it was a significant contributing cause .
There 's a difference between something being the cause and a significant contributing cause .
If you 're baking bread even , you know , it rises in the oven -- MR .
OHLEMEYER : Your Honor -- THE COURT : Overruled .
MR .
LANIER : -- it rises in the oven because of yeast , but it needs more than just the yeast .
It needs the moisture and the food for the yeast .
There are contributing causes beyond just one sole cause in many events in life .
And so you 'll hear the evidence and a chance to decide whether or not this drug was a significant contributing cause .
And when you start reading that evidence or hearing the evidence -- you 'll get to read it because there are documents , as well as hear it from the witnesses , and maybe from some videotapes that might play of witnesses that are unavailable -- you 're going to hear an interesting , sordid tale .
I 've told you a sordid tale about the Bulger life .
Let me tell you the tale as it stems from this drug .
It 's the drug Neurontin .
Some of you may have some familiarity with it , some of you may not , but it 's a fascinating story .
The story starts with a drug company called Parke - Davis , which is actually the oldest pharmaceutical company in America .
It was started in the 1800s right after the Civil War .
But Parke - Davis at the time that we 're interested in is owned by Warner - Lambert , Warner - Lambert , the makers of things like Listerine and other things like that .
Warner - Lambert buys Parke - Davis in 1970 , I believe .
And so Warner - Lambert is the company .
Now , in this case we 're suing Pfizer because in the year 1999 , effective , I think , January 1 of 2000 , Pfizer bought Warner - Lambert and bought the right to Parke - Davis .
So all of the issues that were part of Warner - Lambert are now going to be part of Pfizer , and we 'll look at that .
And Pfizer , I think the Court will tell you , will ultimately have the responsibility for the actions before as well as the actions after that merger , and we 'll look at both of them seamlessly .
I sometimes will refer to it as Pfizer .
That 's just my shorthand way of not getting us all jumbled up , but I 'll try to be as deliberate and careful as I can .
It does n't really make a legal difference , I guess is what I 'm driving at .
So you 've got a company called Parke - Davis , a division of Warner - Lambert .
They discover a drug in the early '90s that they call Neurontin .
It 's got a plain scientific name called gabapentin .
And if you buy now a generic version , for example , the pharmacist will sell you gabapentin , and you 'll save some bucks .
But Neurontin was the real name , and for the first , oh , ten years or so the drug was sold there were no generics , so it was really just Neurontin .
As long as the patent existed on the drug , nobody could make a generic .
And so you 've got Neurontin .
And before a company can start selling a drug they invent , the company has to go to the Food and Drug Administration , the FDA .
They have to say , " FDA , we 'd like to sell this drug , " and the FDA says , " Well , show us what you want to do . "
And there 's an elaborate , six - , seven - , eight - , ten - year process of shepherding a drug through the FDA .
And what the company has to do is say , " Here 's what the drug is . "
You walk through animal testing , and then you walk through human testing , and ultimately the FDA will either approve the drug and approve it for certain uses , the label , or the FDA wo n't approve the drug .
Now , the FDA might say , " We 'll approve the drug , but you 'd like the drug to work for all four of these things .
We 're only going to say it 's approved for one . "
It 's all a question of what the FDA chooses to do .
The FDA did an evaluation of this drug , and as the FDA did an evaluation of the drug , they said , ultimately , " We 're going to approve the drug , but we 're going to approve the drug as a second - line epileptic drug . "
A second line , what does that mean ?
It means doctors should n't use it as the primary drug .
It should n't be the first go - to drug because it does n't seem to work as well as the other drugs on the market for epilepsy .
But there may be circumstances where the better - working drug does n't work for a particular individual , and in that situation , or maybe the best working drug would work better in tandem with Neurontin , it 's a second - line drug .
It 's a drug that can work along with , and it 's approved for that in the epileptic market for epilepsy , for the convulsant type of seizures , a certain kind that are epileptic seizures .
That 's how the drug was approved .
Before the actual approval goes out , the FDA submits -- and you 're going to get a lot of exhibits .
I do n't have many to show you during my opening because I want you to focus on the story .
The documents you 'll get from the witnesses , and we 'll go through the documents in great detail .
I think the documents are critically important .
The problem is , anytime someone starts to show you a document in the opening , you do n't get the whole thing .
You get the snippets .
See , I 'm going to show you some snippets from this document , and ultimately you need the whole document , you need witnesses so you can find out what 's on the pages I did n't show you to see if I was being fair and up front about it .
So I 'm careful about using documents with you , but I do want to show you a couple of snippets from this document .
MR .
LANIER : Your Honor , with your permission , if I could use the Elmo ?
THE COURT : Yes .
Now , for those of you sitting in the back row , pull up -- it 's like an airline tray table right in between there .
Pull it up .
You all get screens .
This is a high - tech courtroom .
Pull it all up .
And you 'll be using these a lot .
I think for the public , is it working back there ?
MR .
LANIER : Yes , your Honor , this screen is on .
THE COURT : That screen is on ?
Good , so everyone can see ?
MR .
LANIER : Now , let 's see if it 's working .
We 'll ask it this way by putting something up .
THE COURT : Is everyone seeing ?
Yes , all right .
MR .
LANIER : So , for example , this is a document that -- THE COURT : I just want to make sure , everybody 's screen is up ?
Good , all right .
MR .
LANIER : This document you 'll see is from the Division of Neuropharmacological Drug Products .
This is a combined review that deals with the medical and the statistical materials that Pfizer gave the FDA .
It deals with NDA , that means a new drug application , and it gives it .
It 's that drug Neurontin which has the name gabapentin .
You 're able to see that , I hope .
The snippets I want to show you from the review by McCormack that was originally received January 31 of 1992 , the snippets that I want to show you deal with the issue of suicide .
Ultimately the question becomes , one of the questions you 've got to deal with is , does Lanier have any evidence that Pfizer had a warning or had reason to warn , or reason to study , or reason to investigate , any reason at all they might suspect this drug could have problems related to suicide ?
And so we look at this document , and we 're going to see -- let 's see if I can figure out how to make it a little bigger .
These are a summary of the serious adverse events that occurred in the gabapentin , which is Neurontin , treated patients .
These are ones that are considered possibly or probably drug- related by the investigator .
So they want to look and see what they are .
They separated them out .
There 's a category of " neurological . "
That 's the epilepsy itself .
Maybe this causes epilepsy or enhances it .
They want to know .
They look , though , at an area called " psychiatric . "
Psychiatric means -- well , this is the area we want to go to to question the issue of depression and suicide and things like that .
You 'll see that they 've got the number of each patient .
They 're going to have the age and the gender , the dosage the patient is on and how long the patient was on the drugs .
They break all of that out .
But then they give information about the event .
And so if we go over to the events , you 'll see that there was this one person who was depressed and attempted suicide .
You 'll see here 's another person who was depressed .
The depression resolved when they reduced the dose .
This was not treatment - emergent because they want to note that the plaintiff had had depression in the past , so this was n't the first time this patient was depressed .
That 's important .
You do n't know if the drug is causing it , or if the drug is bringing it back out , or if it 's just there and the drug is a coincidence .
There 's another person who was depressed with suicide ideation .
That means they actually thought about killing themselves .
They improved on tapering .
That means , as the drug was being removed from their system , they got better .
And they did n't have -- or the DC , and discontinuation .
So their condition improved , but then the depression with suicide ideation recurred on rechallenge .
What that means is , you 've got this person .
They 're taking the drug .
They 're depressed .
They 've got suicide ideation .
They 're thinking about suicide .
The doctor tapers them off the drug , and as he does so , it goes away .
And then he puts them back on the drug , and it comes back .
You 're going to hear evidence from some people that that is an absolute key test and a huge warning sign that the literature even writes up because it 's very serious when you have someone having a reaction they 've never had before when they 're on the drug .
They take them off the drug ; the reaction leaves .
They put them back on the drug ; the reaction comes back .
They 've got folks who tried to drug overdose .
They 've got people with depression and attempted suicide .
They 've got drug overdose .
All of this is happening before the drug has ever been approved .
Pfizer -- well , Warner - Lambert is what they were called at the time -- gets this information to the FDA because they 're required under law to submit the NDA , the new drug application .
It 's reams and reams and hundreds of boxes ' worth of material .
They give all of this to the FDA , and the FDA works through it .
The FDA ultimately has what they call a section in here entitled " Discussion of selected serious safety findings . "
Discussion of selected serious safety findings , and these are certain adverse events that emerged as both serious and frequent .
So we 've got serious and we 've got frequent adverse events .
Due to the nature of the reporting process , it was initially difficult to determine the magnitude of these ; therefore , how much of a safety issue they represent .
These include , the serious and frequent ones include seizures and status , depression / suicide / overdose , and cancers .
And so the medical statistical analysis by the FDA gives us this indication , gives it out and gives it out early before the drug was even approved .
As we continue , they actually break out those serious events in sections .
So there is a section for the depression , the suicide ideation , which is idea , thinking about or contemplating , and the actual attempted suicide .
It says , in the total exposed population -- that means out of everybody who 's taken this drug in the study group -- 78 of them , over 5 percent , 5.3 percent to be precise , of the patients reported depression as an adverse event .
This included one subject in a phase one study .
There were seven reports of depression as serious adverse events , and nine patients who withdrew from the study because of depression .
Now , they also go on to say that there may be some underrepresentation of certain categories .
It may not have as many people as there actually were .
It goes on .
For example , in some cases depression was reported as a serious adverse event , particularly if it resulted in hospitalization or was associated with suicide .
You know , you go to the hospital because you 're that depressed , they reported it , or suicide ideation .
But , however , numerous examples were identified among the CRFs -- those are the case reports -- where a patient developed treatment - emergent depression .
That means depression that was oncoming after they started taking the drug where pharmacological intervention was required , drug intervention , and a report of a serious adverse event was not made .
In other words , we got 5.3 percent suffering this problem , but there may even be more .
If you get to the conclusions section of this document as you work through it , or working toward the conclusions -- you 'll see it on Page 117 .
It 's where the section is on the drug .
It 's conclusions for the toxic issues .
It says it does n't look like it 's got hepatic -- that 's blood -- or bone marrow toxicity .
In other words , it 's not going to kill your bones or your bone marrow .
It says , " Less common but more serious events may limit the drug 's widespread usefulness . "
Now , these words are critical in this case .
One of these is , " Seizures may become worse . "
It 's what you 're giving it for .
A second is malignancies .
But look at the third .
A third is that " Depression , while it might not be an infrequent occurrence in the epileptic population --" in other words , epileptics probably are depressed anyway to some degree " -- but it may become worse , and it may require intervention , and it may lead to suicide , as it has resulted in some suicide attempts . "
So this is the information that the drug company has that 's issued by the FDA 's review of their product back in 1992 before it 's ever approved .
What does the FDA do ?
Oh , they approved the product for epilepsy as a second - line treatment .
That 's the key .
They issue -- and they say , " Okay , look , guys --" and it makes sense .
You 'll hear the evidence about this .
Epilepsy is a tough situation .
There are not a lot of good drugs out there for epileptics , so the FDA is always tending to approve drugs that -- I think that you 'll see that they will approve a drug more readily if there 's a limited usefulness and there 's not a lot of drug availability .
So , yes , they approved this drug .
And they 've got all the standard language that it 's safe and appropriate for approved uses , blah - blah - blah , within the caveats or the warnings or the exceptions that are provided .
What happens from here ?
Neurontin is approved for epilepsy .
Warner - Lambert does an internal study trying to figure out how much money they 're going to make off this drug .
So they do their market analysis , how big is the market for epilepsy , and how much do you think we can make ?
And they figure that they 're looking at making maybe $ 50 million a year , maybe not ; maybe not that much , maybe a little more .
I think that sounds like a lot of money to us .
If you take fifty of us , that gets us each $ 1 million , you know , $ 50 million .
But in the world of drugs , that 's not a big one .
It 's not what they call a blockbuster .
You 've got to top the billion - dollar mark for a blockbuster .
I 'd love to show you the difference in stacks of money between $ 50 million and a billion because it's a huge difference .
Okay , we just think in terms of the words and they both sound like a lot of money , but , I mean , it 's the difference between a -- it 's big .
Do the math and you 'll just start -- it 's lots of millions .
It 's a thousand millions instead of fifty .
It 's the difference between having $ 50 and $ 1,000 .
They have a market of $ 50 million , so they start trying to figure out what they can do to expand the market .
The drug company makes a conscious decision to do something that is illegal .
The law says the drug company can only market the drug for its approved purposes .
That law does n't apply to doctors .
Doctors can write prescriptions all the time for whatever the doctor thinks is appropriate , but the drug company can't go out there and market and sell the drug for what 's called " off-label . "
Important words , if you do n't mind me just writing them down for a minute .
" Off - label . "
Off - label marketing is " illegal . "
Now , that may seem oversimplistic , and I 'm not trying to turn this into law school , but it 's illegal .
You can't do it .
The drug companies can't do it , and they know it .
The thing is , the drug company figures out there 's a world of people paying big dollars for drugs for things that Neurontin has not been approved for , but Neurontin falls into this class of drugs called antiepileptic drugs , AED .
Anti , against , epileptic , epilepsy , drugs .
And some doctors have used antiepileptic drugs before to help people with pain .
Well , that would be huge .
The pain market is big .
So what the drug company starts doing is making a deliberate effort to illegally market this drug off - label .
I do n't know what it is in your life , there 's got to be something in your life that relates this way to you .
The picture I always get in my brain is from cartoons growing up .
When I grew up , you remember we had the Bugs Bunny -- some of you may be too young to remember that -- but the Bugs Bunny cartoons and all of that ?
Have you ever seen the cartoon where they have the snowball that starts at the top of the hill and it starts rolling down , and as it gathers momentum , it just gets bigger and bigger ; and then , you know , you 've got arms and legs of people in the way flying out and all , and it 's gets on down the hill .
What the drug company does is makes a conscientious decision to market this off - label in a way where it takes on a life of its own , and it becomes a massive growing snowball that nothing really is going to get in the way and stop .
They enter into an elaborate programmed plan to deliberately get doctors and people thinking that this drug is the wonder drug that will cure anything that ails you .
There 's actually a joke that 's made by the drug company bosses telling their salespeople to go out and sell the drug for a myriad of diseases .
You know , we saw that it looks like it may cause depression , you saw that in the document .
They got their salespeople out telling the doctors it 's a cure for depression .
It may cause different -- they 've got them out there telling them it works for -- " Oh , write it for this , that . "
In fact , the drug company executives themselves say , " When you show this next slide to the doctors as you 're selling them on it , you 've got to warn them ahead of time , ' Hey , this looks like a snake oil salesman approach , ' off of the old snake oil salesmen , you know , that had the snake oil that was a cure for everything .
They said , " Warn them .
Otherwise , the doctors when they see that we 're claiming it might cure all these things , they 'll laugh you out of the room .
But if you warn them ahead of time and say , ' Hey , I look like a snake oil salesman when I show you this next slide , but it's the truth , ' they wo n't laugh you out of the room . "
Our first witness is a fellow named David Franklin , and we 'll start him with the Court 's permission before today is over , but it will take through tomorrow to finish him up with all the questions that we 've got and that they 've got .
David Franklin is an interesting fellow .
He graduated with an undergraduate degree in microbiology from the University of Rhode Island .
Then he gets his Ph.D. from there , and he 's working at Dana Farber as a cancer researcher and doing cancer work over at Dana Farber .
He gets a job going to work for the drug company .
When he gets the job , he 's being told -- now , he 's not a medical doctor .
You 'll hear all about this .
He 's just a Ph.D.
He does n't wear a stethoscope , he can't write prescriptions , but gets hired at triple his former salary so that on behalf of the drug company he can go into the doctors ' offices where he 's introduced as a doctor , never being told , well , not really a medical doctor .
And he sits there and he 's trained to teach these doctors and convince these doctors to write prescriptions for Neurontin for off - label reasons , to write prescriptions for Neurontin to cure ADD in children , to write prescriptions for Neurontin to do all sorts of different things .
I 'll ask him ; you 'll get to hear him .
He 'll tell you that that was n't the only thing ; that the drug company also told him to go out there and to convince the doctors to write what 's called megadosing .
You see , it 's not enough that the drug company is going to try and expand their profit margins by selling it off - label .
The FDA only approves it in dosages up to , I think at the time it was 1,800 milligrams , but the salespeople are told to go out there and to convince the doctors that they can do not 1,800 .
" Give them 21 , give them 25 , give them 28 , give them 31 , give them 4,000 , give them 4,800 a day , more and more and more pills .
Get it up as high as you can . "
There 's a joking memo about one woman who's on the drug who winds up trying to commit suicide , and she 's taken hundreds of them to try and do it , and the joke within the drug company was , " That was the world 's most expensive suicide attempt . "
But they 're pushing this drug in ways outside the label and at dosages not approved .
Now , there are some restrictions on how they can do this and what they can do with the doctors .
You , for example , if you 're a drug company are not allowed to pay a doctor to write a prescription , and are n't we glad ?
Would n't you hate -- golden rule , excuse me , your Honor .
It 's a good thing that drug companies do n't have the power to pay doctors behind our back to write prescriptions for us .
That 's an important public health policy .
But the drug company found what they thought was a way around that .
They would go to the doctors , and they would say , " Doctor , I can't pay you to write a prescription , but I 'll tell you what I can do .
If you 'll let me watch you write the prescription , we 'll say that I 'm learning from you .
I 'm learning how you sign your name .
I 'm learning how you write a prescription .
And I can pay you 350 bucks if you 'll let me do that , watch you write the prescription .
Be clear , I 'm not paying you for writing it .
I 'm paying for the honor of learning how you do it . "
Or , " Hey , Doctor , would you like to be a paid consultant for our drug company ?
Here 's what we 're doing .
We 're going to have a phone conference coming up , and you can participate as a paid consultant .
We 'll pay you 750 bucks to be in on this phone conference .
Now , if you want to do it , though , the people on the conference are consultants , and what that means is , you need to write a couple of Neurontin prescriptions so that on the phone conference you can say that ' Hey , I 've written some prescriptions , ' and tell whether or not they 're doing any good .
We 'll pay you money to do that . "
And then the drug company goes to these doctors .
Now , they 're not doing this to every doctor .
The drug company has the information that enables them to know which doctors are writing the biggest number of prescriptions for pain , for depression , for all the different things they 're looking for .
And they find those doctors , they target those doctors , and then they monitor through the record service that they have how many prescriptions that doctor is writing for Neurontin versus other drugs .
And so they keep very clear tabs , and they target specific doctors .
Oh , they 'll go to the doctors and say , " Doctors , we can not pay you to write a prescription for Neurontin , but would you like to come to a seminar ?
It will be an all - expense - paid trip for you and your family . "
Let 's say the Olympics were in Atlanta in 1996 .
" Why do n't you come down to Atlanta .
We 'll get you into some Olympic games .
You can stay at the Chateau Elan , " which is this wonderful spa resort .
I mean , it looks like a castle .
" You can have all the massages you want .
Do n't pay for a thing .
Just write ' Parke - Davis ' on the ticket .
We 'll pick up the tab .
And then what you 'll need to do is to sit in to an hour or two or three of doctors ' presentations on how wonderful the drug Neurontin is for reasons it 's never been approved for off - label . "
I 've got a list of things they did .
I had n't covered half of it .
You 're going to hear this from David Franklin .
It 's the effort to get that snowball rolling down the hill with some momentum .
Oh , here 's one .
Doctors listen to other doctors to get ideas on medicines , so the sales force was trained to go to one doctor and to say , you know , " Can I get you to do it ? "
And when that doctor does it , then they'd go to the next doctor , almost like a door - to - door book salesman , the same technique , and say , " Hey , Dr. Smith , you know , Dr. Jones down the hall , your buddy , he 's writing these Neurontin prescriptions , so excited about it .
We want to give you a chance to get on the bandwagon too . "
And then they 'd go to Dr. McDonald : " Dr. McDonald , Dr. Smith and Jones , you know those two guys , they 're doing this , and , man , this is the bandwagon you need . "
And they'd do this like an intense spiderweb , you know , interweaving of all of the different doctors together .
Then that not being enough , they -- doctors not only listen to other doctors , but doctors , some , read the literature .
So they 're thinking , " How do we get in the literature , the medical journals , information that says our drug is really good in all these areas where the FDA never said it was good ?
We did n't have enough proof for the FDA to get it approved for any of these areas , but how can we get the doctors to think it 's good for them anyway ?
We need some people to write some articles . "
So what the drug company did is , they hire a PR firm , and they figure out how to write these articles , and then they go find doctors and they pay doctors to put the doctor 's name on the article so it can be published under the doctor 's name , with no reference to the PR firm or to the drug company that really authored it .
So they 're seeding the literature with that .
Now , I say seeding .
" Seeding " has a buzz word in their industry because they also did what 's called a " seeding study , " and they called it that internally .
Please understand , you 're not going to have a lot of documents on this stuff because you will hear David Franklin explain that the people in his job , he was told , " Do not be putting much of this stuff we 're doing in writing . "
As one of the coworkers said , " It just takes one phone call to turn us all in . "
They 're not allowed to leave the slide , the snake oil salesman slide , they 're not allowed to leave those presentations with the doctors .
They go to seminars where they 're taught how to do this , and they 're handed tablets , and across the tablets it says " Ladies and gentlemen of the jury " to remind them what kind of trouble the company can get in if people write stuff down .
So any note that they would take they would take understanding ultimately a jury may get to see it one day .
So a lot of what was done was done by phone , it was done face - to - face .
Or there was a time where they were taught how to give a fair and balanced presentation on a videotape .
And so the videotape plays , and as the videotape plays , the executives stop the videotape , and they say to everybody , " Okay , now , ignore everything you just heard , and let me tell you how we 're going to do it .
We were required to show you that . "
This is what happens , and as it happens -- oh , the seeding study , I got distracted .
Excuse me .
The seeding study , what they do -- we think of studies , I hope , as the scientist writing and devising a very clear study with safety parameters .
When somebody is in a study for a drug , an experimental study , we 're supposed to have a full disclosure of what that study is for , and what are the possible consequences , and that we have read it and we understand it and we 're agreeing to be the guinea pig .
And the scientists are supposed to set it out with very clear standards so that the results can be very clear and can be adequately analyzed and calculated .
That 's the scientific process that should be producing these drugs to our benefits , or at least produce drugs that might benefit us with a clear and fair warning so that we and our doctors can make an adequate assessment of whether or not we want to gamble and risk taking the drug .
No , they 've got their marketing people devising some of their studies .
The marketing people devised the step study .
This is one that they internally called a " seeding study " because it 's like sewing seeds hoping for that bumper crop .
You know , the seeds off of one ear of corn ought to be able to produce enough to feed a family .
They 're going to seed , they 're going to plant the seeds and just watch it grow .
Here 's what they did :
They 'd go find doctors and say , " Doctors , would you like to participate in our step study ?
You could be one of the doctors .
Here 's all you need to do .
Just put a couple of people , we'd like you to put ten , but put some people on Neurontin and keep up with them for a period of time , and we 'll pay you for each one of those people in the study .
If at the end of the study you decide Neurontin is helping them and you 're going to keep them on Neurontin , we 'll pay you a bonus . "
This is what the drug company would consider a study , but it 's not a study .
That 's not a fair , rigorous scientific study .
Trust me , nobody signed a consent form saying , " Yes , I 'll take this drug knowing I 'm a guinea pig by the marking department to see if they 're going to be able to sell more of these drugs by getting the doctors used to writing the prescriptions and the patients used to taking the drugs , " but that 's what we have .
Now , David Franklin figures this out and after four months says " no " and quits .
He 's what 's called a whistleblower .
And he went out and he sought legal help , and he brought a complaint against at the time Warner - Lambert .
Pfizer buys them in the middle of this mess , and so we can start using the term " Pfizer " now .
And ultimately Pfizer is fined and signs a guilty plea .
But their fine is 400 and some odd million dollars .
Meanwhile , this drug has started selling billions of dollars .
Just between the time Pfizer bought the company in 2000 and the time that the drug goes off patent , Pfizer sells $ 10 billion of this drug , the drug that has a market of $ 50 million .
Oh , that market expanded .
A couple of the tests that Pfizer did , or Warner - Lambert , showed that the drug might also have some pain relief help for a condition we call " shingles . "
The doctors call it " postherpetic neuropathy . "
Neuropathic pain is a pain that 's deemed to be part of the nerve system .
You 're doing the hook at fifteen after ?
THE COURT : Yes .
MR .
LANIER : Okay .
You 're going to hear tons about this at a later time , but I will tell you , I want to take advantage of this format to plug you into one more thing on that issue as I get close to summing up , and that is , there is a whole area of pain that 's called " neuropathic pain . "
I 'll abbreviate it as " neuropain , " and it even gets that abbreviation in the industry .
They 'll call it NP sometimes , neuropathic pain .
One kind of neuropathic pain carries the abbreviation PHN .
It 's post , meaning after , herpetic , it comes from herpes because it's the herpes virus of sorts , postherpetic neuropathy , or neuropain .
Now , that 's one kind of neuropathic pain , and ultimately the drug company is able to get approval for using this drug Neurontin in that one area , that slim part of neuropathic pain , as well as in epilepsy , seizures .
Now , that 's it .
That 's all this drug ever gets approved for .
Boy , Pfizer takes it on the road .
Look what Pfizer does .
This is from Pfizer 's 2001 U.S. operating plan .
And , again , I 'm nervous about showing you an exhibit when you do n't get to see the whole thing .
I 'll tell you why in a minute in more detail , but I can only show you a little bit right now .
I 'll ask the Court to let this whole exhibit go back into evidence .
The 2001 U.S. Operating Plan of Neurontin -- this is by Pfizer at this point in time -- if we look on Page 503 by the Bates number , your Honor , for the record , here 's what we see :
The medical strategic plan for Neurontin in 2001 is a neuropathic pain filing .
They want to ask the FDA to let them use it for neuropathic pain , but here are the tactics they 're going to use .
To get it for neuropathic pain , they 're going to develop a relationship with the American Pain Society .
They 're going to publish and present new data at key pain congresses .
They 're going to have a so - called independent group working .
They 're going to develop and publish diagnostic tools .
They 're going to do things that try to push this drug for the whole neuropathic pain category , not simply folks suffering from shingles .
And the drug company continues to do it .
They continue to sell this to people who never had epilepsy , who never had shingles .
That 's the minor part of their market .
The major part of the market is all this other stuff .
They make a lot of money ; they do a lot of damage .
I think we 're going to get into evidence some information where the FDA continued to monitor some things , and we 'll be able to show you that Pfizer themselves are guilty of marketing it off - label illegally .
MR .
OHLEMEYER : Objection , your Honor .
There will be no evidence of that .
THE COURT : As I said , this is not a substitute for evidence .
MR .
LANIER : And the Judge will throw me in jail if I say it 's evidence because it 's not .
I think that 's what the evidence will show .
I think that 's what you 'll sea .
You hold me accountable .
You can write it down .
If I can't show it , I can't show it , but I think you 'll see the evidence of it .
I think ultimately you 're going to see the FDA finally catches up and figures out what 's going on because the FDA finally reports , the FDA finally says , " All of these antiepileptic drugs , these eleven that we looked at , all of these seem to have some effect on depression and suicide ideation and suicide . "
And the FDA ultimately will say , " Antiepileptic drugs are associated with increased risk of suicidality .
The effect appears consistent among the group of eleven drugs . "
Oh , they 're going to come in and say , " No , no , no , no , the FDA , they were a bit dim - witted on that .
They did n't realize that these two drugs seemed to be the bad guys and that we are innocent because ours was n't . "
No , we 'll sort th
An explosive device has killed an Albanian official from one of the country 's small political parties 10 days before general elections , police said on Thursday .
Police said an explosive device was used in the attack against the 34 - year - old Aleksander Keka , regional head of Albania 's Christian Democratic Party in the northern city of Shkodra .
Keka was fatally injured while traveling in his car .
The head of his party said the attack was politically motivated , while police suggested organized crime groups may have been involved .
The election campaign in the tiny western Balkan country has already been marred by pre-election violence .
Last week , a political activist from the opposition Socialists shot and killed a supporter of the governing party .
In early May , an opposition lawmaker was also killed .

Not 100 % finished flash game - DSDefense
The flash game I developed ( recently mentioned ) is now - since the main menu was finished this weekend - ready to be played .
It would be nice if you could try this out and give me your feedback .
Simply click the link below to start the game directly here on my blog or start it in a big bigger resolution on the Darkness Springs website
The game is a mixture of real - time strategy and defense game , and settled in the Darkness
Springs universe for a simple reason : I was able to simply reuse the graphics of Darkness Springs .
It also shares the iso rendering , menu system and AI code with that role playing game , so it was n't that much work .
But I 'm not sure about the gameplay yet , so any constructive feedback is welcome .
If there is some interest , I 'll also write some blog posts about the technical details of that game in a following blog post .
thirteen comments , already :
pretty nice for a ‘ prototype ’ !
Have to play it a bit more now …
puh - 17 08 09 - 16:42
You ’re right , I corrected the title a bit :)
niko - 17 08 09 - 18:14
It would be nice to read those posts about the technical details … :)
lobo_tuerto ( link ) - 17 08 09 - 18:24
Very Very cool .
Great work for a single person .
kinjalkishor - 17 08 09 - 18:58
I would also like to read something about the technical details .
It ’s always interesting to see how the different parts in a game work together :)
julien - 17 08 09 - 19:39
very nice .
What about doing a mmorpg using Stratus ( http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/strat..) ?
stef_ - 17 08 09 - 20:05
Very nice work .. here is a list of bugs i found and features i thought should be in there ..
1 ) A tower between two buildings is unselectable .. here is an example : http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y298/ko..
the fire tower in the middle is unselectable
2 ) The camera moves on the click bases not on the ( what i expected to be normal ) point and drag movement ..
This is especially problematic as towers are a bit tricky to select and then the camera focuses on the miss clicked point which can be annoying ..
3 ) You can sell a previous building and still build a new one or its towers .. for example if i sell the fire guild but have already built one ice guild then i can still make an ice tower and ice guild .. that is supposed to be like this ?
BTW a very nice game i got hooked to it already :D..
Rapchik - 18 08 09 - 16:39
Hi .
I think that it ’s a good game , but i have some things to comment :
– I think it would be better if the camera move when you move yout mouse to bounds , because sometimes it ’s difficult to move correctly when you move fast the camera .
– it ’d be great if you can choose the towers ’ target , for example , the mages or something similar .
Juanxo - 19 08 09 - 03:41
thanks for the feedback !
it ’s now already a bit improved ( selecting buildings for example ) , but I ’m going to improve it further
niko - 19 08 09 - 08:48
Nice game .
It would be nice to have the choice to keep the castle that was built up .
sam123 - 19 08 09 - 14:20
Funny game
A tower in a northern corner is unselectable ( when surrounded by walls to the south - western and south - eastern side ) .
When deleting a wall ( between two other wall elements ) I could not build a tower there instead ( it tells me that there is no space )
Andi - 19 08 09 - 14:24
hm , strange andi , both works for me … but i’ll retry later :)

Well , you can't say Andrew Breitbart does n't have an active imagination .
The Hollywood right - winger went on Glenn Beck 's Fox News show yesterday -- guest - hosted by Judge Napolitano -- and proposed the following conspiracy theory :
The White House is collecting e-mail addresses so it can send out " netroots gangs " to physically attack and intimidate its critics .
Breitbart :
Well , what people need to understand here is that they 're being community organized .
And the White House absolutely understands how the Internet works , and understands that there are countless blogs , Media Matters , the Daily Kos , which are collecting information and putting out the disinformation .
What the White House wants to do is create a hierarchy of who its enemies are .
Every week , or periodically , they meet with the netroots .
And the netroots acts as an action gang that can go out there and attack the enemies of the president and attack the enemies -- the , the , the people who would attack his plan .
So it is vital for this White House to find out who its enemies are , and then to sic its gang of netroots people on the American people .
Breitbart goes on to contend that the non-prosecution of two Black Panthers for polling - place violations was connected to this conspiracy :
Breitbart :
That sends a direct message to the netroots people out there :
Do n't worry , this administration has our back .
Those people that would community organize on behalf of the president and his initiatives will be protected .
Yeah , I should have guessed that black - radicals / liberal geek connection from the Black Panthers booth at Netroots Nation last week .

(1) Large sections of still attached exterior walls not crushed , nor explosively fragmented in little pieces , lying on ground .
Peeled over , toppled in large sections .
Floors failed first then column assemblies toppled .
Columns not crushed or CD'd .

(4) Pancaking floors overpressure expels dust and debris out of windows .
No crushing of columns as floors collapse inside past the columns .
Overpressure plumes continuously steady , not explosively large and then diminishing .
If plumes were explosions , columns would have been ejected at the same time , but they remain in place until exterior columns topple .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2yKp39khqI&NR=1
THREE .
Perimeter and core columns , not crushed nor exploded , subsequently toppled to the ground .
" The way the towers were really brought down was a series of 3 - story controlled demolitions .
Around 25 to 30 controlled demolitions every three stories . ”
- Tony Szamboti on Kevin Barrett 's radio show , 10/30/07
The following visual facts prove that after the floors pancaked past , the perimeter columns ( 36 foot long , 10 foot wide , three column , three story bolted at base plates ) and core columns toppled .
(1) Pictures of large connected sections of exterior columns , not exploded , spandrels undamaged .

Audio / Visual Facts For What Did n’t Happen :
ONE - No expected CD loud detonation sounds
(1) Inside WTC1 lobby as WTC2 collapses 100 feet away .
No CD loud detonation sounds .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NzSx...om=PL&index=40
(2) Victim taped call to 911 , 5 minutes before and during collapse of WTC2 .
No explosives sound .
TWO .
No evidence for expected explosives / thermite damage to columns or spandrel plates .
Evidence of large sections of connected , unexploded , unshattered toppled core and perimeter columns .
For explosives / thermite to have been used in the CD of the exterior columns , only two hidden places were available : ( 1 ) The plenum space between the lay - in ceiling tile directly under the floor trusses and the floor deck above .
Explosive / thermite charges would be visible within this plenum , and ( 2 ) the hand access holes at the base / head locations of the columns .
(1) Picture of floors and spandrel plate at this location .
Note access construction holes for bolting ends of columns .
http://www.911hoax.com/911Blogger_1-...ter-column.jpg
(2) The hand access holes provided at the head and base of each 36 foot column to install the columns four connecting bolts .
Picture of holes at 6 feet above the floor below , 36 feet oc .
Placement of explosives / thermite inside of columns .

http://images.quickblogcast.com/8119...erior_wall.jpg
(3) WTC2 columns impaled in Bankers Trust building ; no CD damage to WTC2 columns bases or spandrels from explosives / thermite .
Columns toppled .
http://www.studyof911.com/gallery/al...ingcolumns.jpg
(4) Picture of large whole , unshattered columns assemblies from WTC1 wall toppled at Winter Garden .
Columns assemblies topped .
http://www.911myths.com/assets/images/columns.jpg
(5) From the two pictures above we conclude the following :
No evidence of explosives / thermite damage / decapitation above the column ends , undamaged ends with bolt holes visible .
No explosives damage to spandrel plates .
Large sections of toppled attached column assemblies prove column assemblies not shattered by CD into small pieces , three stories tall .
THREE .
CD explosives - ejected perimeter columns should have outdistanced the dust cloud behind them , they did not .
“ Niels Harrit : “ We do not know if the thermite that we have found is the same thermite which has been used for melting the beams .
It ’s very , very possible that different varieties were used , and I personally am certain that conventional explosives were used too , in abundance . ”
Russia Today : “ When you say “ in abundance , ” how much do you mean ? ”
Niels Harrit : “ Tons !
Hundreds of tons !
Many , many , many tons ! ”
http://www.russiatoday.com/Best_Vide...WTC.html/print
(1) Since we know from the above visual evidence that explosives / thermite were not placed inside the columns at the hand access holes or near the spandrel plates , the purported explosives could only have been placed in the ceiling lay - in tile plenum offset from the face of the columns a sufficient distance ( and still discoverable ) and with the necessarily large enough quantity of explosives to have explosively propelled the columns horizontally hundreds of feet .
“ Girders [ sic ] from the North Tower of the World Trade Center weighing about four tons each were found in the Winter Garden 600 feet away after the towers collapsed .
How fast must they have been thrown to land that far away …
The girders [ sic ] were blown out … by explosive charges that were set in the building ahead of time . …
You might try pondering how four ton girders [ sic ] ended up 600 feet from the base of the World Trade Center . ” – David Chandler video below .
Here is the answer - large sections of attached , toppled column assemblies at Winter Garden that David Chandler claims below were exploded 600 feet distant are seen instead wholly attached and toppled onto the ground reaching the Winter Garden .

(2) Proximity and relative height of WTC1 to WTC7 ( in picture directly to the left of WTC1 ) and Winter Garden .( in picture directly below WTC1 )
http://www.debunking911.com/wtc1heli.jpg
(3) From this video of WTC1 stop it two seconds after failure ( at 33sec ) .
The plumes on the right side are about 60 feet from the building .
Stop the video two seconds later ( at 35 sec ) .
The plumes are about 120 feet from the building .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVDaAufKnLc
(4) David Chandler calculates that at this failed floor WTC1 ( 96th floor ) , the explosive velocity of the columns propelled 600 feet horizontally onto the Winter Garden would be about 50 mph .
At two seconds after failure , this would put the exploded columns at 73 fps x 2 seconds = 146 feet away from the building , outdistancing the dust plume ( 60 feet ) and should have been visible in the video .
They are not .
At four seconds after failure , this would put the exploded columns at 73 fps x 4 seconds = 292 feet away from the building , outdistancing the dust plume ( 120 feet ) and should have been visible in videos .
They are not .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUKLOlIhang
(5) Since the expelled columns ahead of the dust plume are not visible , the columns could not have reached 600 feet by the use of large explosive charges in the ceiling plenum , or elsewhere for that matter , they reached 600 feet by toppling , David Chandler , Tony Szamboti , et al CTs are wrong .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESaIEVxLnK4
" If you do n't like these conclusions you can reject the theories , but you can't reject the facts . "
- David Chandler .
Conclusion :
All the visual facts confirm the gravity collapse of the Towers .
All the visual facts refute the use of explosives / thermite in the collapse of the Towers .

Auf Wiedersehen Recession Economic Freefall Ends in Germany and France

Signs of economic green shoots bolstered the euro -- and surprised both policymakers and economists .
The euro zone economy , however , continues to contract .
Remixing and recompiling for different hardware
The PS3's Cell CPU has a very different architecture from a 45nm Intel Core 2 Quad CPU ( pictured ) , but getting a game to work on both CPUs is now just a job for a recompiler
You do n't need to be a 1970s stand - up comedian to know that there 's a large lexicon of monosyllabic , four - letter words for describing something you do n't like – but only PC gamers use the word “ port ” with such a fervent degree of repulsion .
Common complaints about console ports include meagre graphics options , dodgy third - person camera angles , poorly thought - out controls and sparsely distributed save points .
Making games for multiple platforms can't be easy though .
After all , each current gaming platform has radically different processor architecture , as well as completely different controllers and graphics APIs .
That 's before you 've even considered storage , memory and online abilities .
Just how do you develop a game for so many different types of hardware , and is it possible to make a great game across three consoles and the PC ?
Let 's start with the different CPU architectures .
PCs use CPUs with Intel 's x86 instruction set , the Xbox 360 and Wii use CPUs based on IBM 's PowerPC architecture , and the PlayStation 3 uses the Cell architecture .
You'd think that generating code for each CPU would be a job for master coders , but there 's apparently little work involved here .
This is because a huge chunk of the code for a game is written using a high - level language , such as C or C ++.
This is where the core code for the actual game is written , often using a number of industry - standard tools , such as Microsoft 's Visual Studio , or specifically developed in - house tools .
A particularly popular language is Lua , which has a C API and is used by plenty of developers , including Bioware , LucasArts and Telltale .
In fact , the developers we spoke to estimated that around 90 per cent of the game code is shared between platforms , so what sort of game features are included in this huge block of code ?
Volition 's Dave Baranec , the system architect on the PC version of Red Faction : Guerilla , explains that this includesOnce the basic code is written , it goes through an automated process of recompiling , which is often created in - house by a developer as a part of its tools pipeline , in order to make it run on other processor architectures .
In this case , compiling refers to the process of transforming high - level source code into low - level code that can be understood by the processor .
After that , there 's usually a bit of tweaking in machine code ( the native language of the processor architecture ) or assembly code ( a low - level , symbolic representation of numeric machine code ) , but this apparently occurs less frequently now .
explains Visceral 's Colin ' Bozz ' Boswell , technical director on Dead Space , adding that As the game is written in C++ for all platforms , Bozz says that .
Telltale Games ' co-founder Kevin Bruner describes a similar process for porting Telltale 's recent episodic adventure gamesandfrom the PC to the Wii and the Xbox 360. says Bruner , but adds , However , the recompiling process is now so efficient that it 's not a major issue .
That said , even though the bulk of the code is shared , developers often have to hop between different tools for different platforms .

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has criticised leaders of the G8 industrial nations for failing to make deeper commitments to combat climate change .
On Wednesday , the leaders , meeting in Italy , agreed to cut emissions by 80 % by 2050 , but Mr Ban said big cuts were needed sooner rather than later .
The leaders are set to meet their counterparts from emerging economies to discuss a new deal on global warming .
US President Barack Obama will chair the session , in the city of L'Aquila .
ANALYSIS Richard Black , BBC News
Now G8 leaders will try to persuade some major developing countries to halve global emissions by 2050 .
Governments such as China's , that are concerned about climate impacts , may find the figure desirable .
But they are unlikely to be impressed with what they see as fine words from the West unmatched by real short - term commitments .
Unmatched , too , by money .
Of the major developing nations , India especially has long argued that it will not compromise its economic growth by agreeing to climate curbs .
So if the West wants the developing world to go through its own energy revolution , it is going to have to fund a lot of it .
Are G8 climate targets realistic ?
The second day of the summit has begun , opening up its discussions to take in the so - called G5 nations - Brazil , China , India , Mexico and South Africa .
Egypt is a special invitee .
The G8 leaders said on Wednesday they had agreed to try to limit global warming to just 2C ( 3.6 F ) above pre-industrial levels .
See how global temperatures have risen
That is the level above which , the United Nations says , the Earth 's climate system would become dangerously unstable .
The G8 leaders also said rich nations should cut emissions by 80 % by 2050 while the world overall should reduce them 50 % by 2050 .
But correspondents say emerging nations appear reluctant to sign up and tough negotiations lie ahead .
' Moral imperative '
Mr Ban said Wednesday 's agreement was welcome , but the leaders needed to establish a strong and ambitious mid-term target for emissions cuts by 2020 .
" This is politically and morally imperative and a historic responsibility for the leaders ... for the future of humanity , even for the future of Planet Earth , " he told the BBC .
Mr Ban said the leaders also had to come up with financial incentives for poorer countries to reduce pollution and aid to help them mitigate the effects of climate change .

President Obama will chair the Major Economies Forum meeting on Thursday afternoon .
The countries represented there account for some 80 % of the emissions of gases that are blamed for global warming .
' Still time '
The BBC 's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins , in L'Aquila , says the talks with India and China will be difficult .
China 's president has headed home to deal with the ethnic violence in Xinjiang , so there are now questions whether his delegation will be more cautious .
G8 KEY ISSUES / TIMETABLE THURSDAY : Climate Change Brazil , China , India , Mexico , South Africa , Egypt join talks 1230 GMT - Junior G8 1300 GMT - Major Economies Forum meeting FRIDAY : Development 0630 GMT - crisis ' impact on Africa with African leaders attending 0830 GMT - food security 1100 GMT - final news conference G8 members : Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Russia , US
At a glance : summit agenda Mr Berlusconi's G8 Party Climate change around the world Climate targets : Global pledges
Our correspondent adds that India is already complaining that the G8's long - term targets for 2050 are too long - term and that G8 countries are ducking interim targets for 2020 which would make their 40 - year ambitions more credible .
But in a meeting with Brazilian President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva , Mr Obama said there was still time to close the gap between developed and developing nations before UN talks on a new climate change treaty in Copenhagen in December .
The summit host , Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , has said a deal should be all - inclusive .
" It would not be productive if European countries , Japan , the United States and Canada accepted cuts that are economically damaging while more than five billion people in other countries carried on as before , " he said .
The G8 summit began in L'Aquila on Wednesday , with the first day largely taken up with discussion of the fragile state of the global economy .
The leaders also issued a statement reaffirming that they were " deeply concerned " by Iran 's nuclear programme and condemning North Korea 's recent nuclear test and missile launches .
African leaders will join the summit on Friday to push for a new initiative to fund farming in the developing world and tackle global hunger .

VIVIAN BLAKE’S WAR
In the late 1970s , a young Jamaican man named Vivian Blake , a scholarship kid from the Tivoli Gardens ghetto of Kingston , arrived in New York as part of a traveling cricket exhibition , stuck around , and began selling marijuana .
One of the last great political proxy fights of the Cold War was then unfolding in Jamaica :
Both the left - wing party , friendly to Castro , and its right - wing opponents built violent electioneering posses to persuade friendly voters and attack unfriendly ones — 800 Jamaicans died .
Blake was affiliated with the right - wing Shower Posse .
He helped funnel pot and , later , cocaine to the United States and sent guns back home to help the posses intimidate voters .
After the election , the new government tried to drive the posses off the island , and many arrived in New York and Miami , fully formed , violent organizations , deprived of their political purpose and looking for something to do .
In 1985 , it was still possible to describe crack as confined to three cities — New York , Los Angeles , and Miami .
But police elsewhere soon noticed two new phenomena : crack , and the Jamaican gangs who would soon control up to 40 percent of the East Coast market .
Blake ’s posse had built markets in Roanoke and Houston , Renkers Posse ran Philly and DC , and Kansas City and Des Moines were Waterhouse .
The early traffic was thus partly a creature of Cold War politics :
Blake and his contemporaries built the model for a national drug trade — the overweight , nondescript women couriers , the rented Volvos .
After the cops clamped down , they discovered that the Crips and the Bloods had aped the Jamaican model , and taken over .
THE CHAMBERS BROS ’ WAR
In 1986 , it dawned upon the police chief of Marianna , Arkansas — a tiny , mostly black , cotton - cropping Delta town — that four brothers who ’d relocated to Detroit three years earlier were recruiting away all of the town ’s teenagers .
Willie Lee , Billy Joe , Larry , and Otis Chambers ran half of Detroit ’s crack trade , supplying 500 crack dens and operating 200 more ; one scholar called their operation an “ alternative to Little League . ”
Prosecutors found one Marianna teen working 24 - hour days , passing parcels to addicts through a hole in the wall , caring sleepily for her baby when things got slow .
The country kids were enmeshed in new rivalries , in shootings and murders .
Then , in 1988 , the empire abruptly dissolved : The Chambers brothers were convicted , and as their unemployed foot soldiers trickled home , Marianna ’s police recorded new violence , and the appearance of crack .
Back in DC , the episode made clear that even the country ’s obscure corners were vulnerable .
JOE TOFT’S WAR
On September 29 , 1994 , a former DEA agent named Joseph Toft , well known in Colombia for his starring role in Pablo Escobar ’s death the previous year , sat down with some TV reporters in Bogotá .
Toft had just retired , and felt newly free to speak his mind .
Escobar ’s takedown , he said , was a sham ; the whole operation — its politics , its execution — was designed to benefit the Cali cartel , whose leaders had enlisted the government to murder their top rival .
The country , Toft said , was a “ narcodemocracy . ”
American taxpayers had spent billions to transfer wealth from one thug to another .
Colombians from Gabriel García Márquez on down were outraged , but president Ernesto Samper , whom Toft had accused of corruption , was strangely , almost poetically plaintive .
“ Our tragedy , ” he said , “ is that we live in Technicolor , and the United States judges us in black and white . ”
Washington ’s response was similarly measured :
Toft no longer worked for the government , officials explained , but they declined to address the substantive point .
Over time , the reason became clear : Samper , it is now alleged , had taken $ 6 million in campaign contributions from the Cali cartel , while Los Pepes , the patriotic hit squad formed to hunt Escobar , was chiefly composed of Cali soldiers , who got back to business once the unit disbanded .
One , a notorious enforcer called Don Berna , would become one of the world ’s most powerful cocaine kingpins .
Toft retired to Reno , disillusioned .
His former bosses had always talked a two - prong strategy : policing to stem drug imports , and hard domestic work — rehab , economic initiatives — to cut demand .
“ It ’s not a matter of the government putting out a few booklets , sending a few CDs to the schools , ” Toft told me .
“ I ’ve been very disappointed in the fact that we ’ve never had a true effort where the US as a whole says , ‘ We ’re going to reduce demand . ' ”
JESUS AMEZCUA’S WAR
To the Mexican smugglers hired to run drugs across their northern border , the cocaine trade had long seemed cruelly weighted against them .
The crossing was by far the riskiest step , and the one that added the most value to the product , yet the Colombians paid meagerly .
The Mexicans could n’t grow their own coca , so they felt in perpetual hock to the Andean kingpins .
But in the early ’90s , a low - level Mexican trafficker named Jesus Amezcua stumbled upon a solution .
During his trips to Southern California he ’d discovered a growing market for methamphetamine .
Here , Amezcua realized , was something he could produce himself .
By 1992 , he ’d built an international supply network , buying the chemical precursors from countries including India , Switzerland , and Czechoslovakia .
It was an opportune moment :
In the United States , the pharmaceutical industry was fighting efforts to restrict these chemicals , used to make cold remedies .
Amezcua was able to feed the new demand , synthesizing meth in vast Mexican mountain laboratories , peasants openly hauling sacks of the stuff along dirt roads .
DEA agents chasing the supply found themselves at factories in China and India , pondering a new reality .
The game was no longer about cocaine .
The organizations were breeding something more lasting : entrepreneurs .
JOHN CARNEVALE’S WAR
In the late 1990s , John Carnevale , longtime budget director for the Office of National Drug Control Policy , was asked to devise a metric to assess anti-drug tactics .
Drug policy had long been consumed by moral bickering , with conservatives arguing for law and order and liberals for legalization , but up to that point , nobody really knew what worked .
Carnevale focused his algorithm on three measurable outcomes : Washington wanted to jack up drug prices , stifle imports , and reduce drug - related crime and health costs .
Crunching the numbers , he determined that spending on domestic law enforcement was cost - effective , while policing efforts in Mexico and Colombia provided little bang for the buck .
Some demand - side programs worked well , particularly ones that diverted hardcore addicts from jail into treatment .
Others , notably ad campaigns intended to change the habits of young , casual users , did not .
The tragedy of Carnevale ’s initiative was its timing .
Barry McCaffrey , the Clinton drug czar who ’d commissioned the study , opted to expend his political energy in a grandstanding attempt to fight medical marijuana in California .
Then George W. Bush took over drug policy and , Carnevale told me , “ shifted back to an ’ 80s - style budget , ” heavy on overseas interdiction and anti-drug advertising — the least effective programs .
Carnevale ’s evidence - based approach never stood a chance .
TEO ’S WAR
Drug trafficking has evolved in fits and starts , punctuated by periodic brainstorms from entrepreneurs like Blake , Amezcua , and recently Teodoro García Simental — a midlevel Tijuana drug enforcer .
Teo ’s brainstorm was that his particular skill set — intimidating people on behalf of the traffickers , kidnapping them , and , when the need arose , eliminating them — had grown so refined that he no longer needed the drug trade .
He abandoned his cartel following an April shoot - out with his old bosses that left 14 dead on a Tijuana expressway .
He aimed to turn pure violence into profit .
The plan was simple : Kidnap the rich , for ransom .
By May 2008 , so many of the city ’s doctors had been snatched — some speculated that Teo ’s organization was running through the phone directory — that they called a general strike .
In January , police finally captured one of Teo ’s lieutenants , whom they accused of dissolving 300 bodies in vats of lye .
Teo ’s insight was that corruption had so crippled the state that he could operate freely .
His mere presence — tauntingly beyond the reach of police , who ca n’t even find a decent mug shot for wanted posters — suggests the scale of the task the Obama administration faces .
Not long ago , it was still possible to talk about fixing our mutual problems with smart drug policy — targeted policing , better border security , and strategies to cut demand .
But so corroded is Mexico ’s government now that its problems — in Tijuana at least — may require a wholesale resurrection of the state .
These are the conditions that gave rise to Teo .
The traffic has created , once again , a thousand children , ambitious , talented , and hungry for opportunity .
Scores of Israelis rallied in front of the American Consulate in Jerusalem today , voicing their disapproval at President Barack Obama , whom they labeled “ the most anti-Semitic American president . ”
Their outrage stems from Obama ’s calls for Israel to stop expanding settlements in the West Bank , and an apparent ultimatum presented to the Netanyahu government earlier in the week .
According to reports , Obama met briefly with Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak yesterday , and told him that he expects the Israeli government to provide an “ updated position ” regarding the West Bank settlements and its overall stance on the two - state solution to the conflict by July .
The Israeli government has repeatedly rejected the administration ’s calls to halt settlement expansion , calling the demand “ unfair ” and insisting that they would continue the expansion as they did under President Bush , with whom they had “ understandings . ”
It has also previously suggested that it wo n’t support a two - state solution to the conflict with the Palestinians , and has mocked the Obama plan as “ childish and stupid . ”
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman has insisted that the US will accept whatever position Israel takes on the matter .
The other day I had a bunch of devices on my desk , and in between posts and the like , I ...
WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan group of U.S. House lawmakers is asking President Barack Obama for an investigation of the Federal Reserve , ratcheting up the pressure on the central bank coming from Capitol Hill .
Three Democrats and 14 Republicans wrote in the letter to Obama that the Fed should n't be granted any new authority amid questions about its role in fostering Bank of America Corp .'s acquisition of Merrill Lynch & Co. The White House 's regulatory reform proposal would give the Fed broad new authority to contain systemic ...
A while back I decided to take some time off and now I ’ve finally done it !
I ’ve spent most of the last few weeks working on a long - gestating “ dream ” project of mine , which is to build my own pinball machine from scratch .
Since my time off is coming to a close , I thought I would my show progress from these last few weeks .
Shown above is the main cabinet that I built last week , as well as the illuminated backbox .
As many of you know , the theme of the pinball machine is Bill Paxton – a fine American actor who has thrilled audiences with a variety of characters over the years .
Why Bill Paxton ?
Well it ’s as good a theme as any – I guess I could have gone with a more obvious geek choice like Bruce Campbell but to be honest , Paxton ’s more interesting and has made movies people have actually seen .
In the end what this project is really about is building something very complicated from scratch , so the engineering is the real star .
I should make clear that this is a personal , non-commercial hobby project for myself , since it clearly contains artwork and sound from movies , it could never legally be resold .
But considering how few projects I actually build and keep ( this would be the 3rd , after the original VCSp and my Neo Geo Arcade ) I deserve to make myself something cool every once in a while !
For some more pictures and info , click below .
You can also see some making off stuff on my YouTube channel .
My current plan is to have this completed in time for demonstration at the 2010 Midwest Gaming Classic in Milwaukee , WI – let ’s see how I do !
In spring 2005 I decided to build a pinball machine .
Several minutes later I came up the theme “ Bill Paxton Pinball ” and several minutes after that I knew exactly what I wanted on the side panels .
It ’s Bill paxton as “ Simon ” , the sleazy , womanizing used - car salesman from True Lies , driving his ’ 59 Corvette .
I had a helluva time getting the screen cap to look decent blown up to this size ( not only do I not own True Lies on Blu - Ray , the DVD I have is n’t even anamorphic ! ) but several Photoshop filters later and it became pretty good .
The idea with the pinball is to have the modes based off popular Bill Paxton movies , for instance , in “ True Lies ” mode , you ’ll need to shoot combos and multipliers to I guess get into Jamie Lee Curtis ’ pants .
Some current other mode ideas :
Titanic : Probably a ramp shot , then the ball rolls down a miniature “ sunken Titanic hallway ” with a chance at 3 exits for x1 , x2 or x1 multiplier .
This fills a “ Heart of the Ocean ” light matrix near the flippers ( hung around the neck of Britney Daniels from Club Dred ) that gives a big bonus when full .
Aliens : Hitting the 4 position drop target cues “ Hudson , run a bypass ” .
There will be ( 2 ) 2 digit LED counters near the drop targets , representing the ammo in the Alien guns ( starting at 99 each )
At random intervals gunfire is heard ( aliens being shot ) and the counters drop .
The goal is to clear all drop targets before they reach zero , if successful , you get points equal to the counters X 1000 .
Twister : Probably not much for this one as there already exists a Twister pinball .
Mostly quotes , and one of the metal rails will probably be vaguely tornado - shaped .
If the ball goes down the drain the game will play a mode - specific negative comment , for instance , in “ True Lies ” mode , Paxton would probably say “ I got a little dick , it ’s pathetic ! ”
Look it ’s Bill Paxton ’s family from the weird HBO show “ Big Love ” !
Instead of multiball this game has BIG LOVE MODE , in which you must juggle 3 balls at once – fitting , eh ?
Also notice above the moon ( “ Apollo 13 ” ) there is a greasy pork sandwich being served in a dirty ashtray .
The square hole is where the speakers are going to go – I did n’t want to “ use up ” space on the backglass with speakers so I put them here instead .
Should sound fine .
Temp playfield made from high - density foam .
I ’ll use this to fine tune the shots and see how the game is working before I rout a final wooden board .
You can see the “ Aliens ” drop targets on the left , I may need to rotate that counter - clockwise if those shots prove too easy .
I ’ll be honest , I do n’t want this game to be THAT difficult because it ’s more about having fun and getting a laugh from the cheesy dialog , but I do n’t want a cakewalk either .
Main backglass .
I did this over a year ago , and I started wiring the LED matrix in 2005 !
It ’s kind of a struggle to make parts go together , well , not physically , but when it takes so long to build you get kind of “ stuck ” with your old engineering .
The backglass contains the following references :
Can of Hamm ’s – he drinks it in several movies .
Alien holding a Fish Head – 3000 years ago Paxton directed a Barnes & Barnes video called , well , Fish Heads , about , well , Fish Heads .
Blob of crap from Weird Science .
Axe from Fraility .
Cow / truck from Twister .
Skyline of Paxton ’s hometown in the background .
Crew of Apollo 13 .
Plane from Slipsteam .
Mountain / photo from Vertical Limit .
ROV from Titanic .
Some wives from Big Love .
From a design standpoint , all objects are facing / going inwards to draw attention to the main photo of Bill Paxton .
Inside the backbox .
I was able to light it with a single flourescent bulb , as well as using extra white vinyl to make a light bounce .
As usual this contains the Ben Heckendorn special “ vent holes covered with 2 layers of plastic screendoor material ” .
Back of the unit .
It ’s a little rougher than the rest but hey – it ’s the back , who cares ?
Note the data , power and speaker wire bundle coming out of the backbox .
Well that ’s about it for now .
Gotta return to my usual Xbox 360 , custom controllers kind of work , but I ’ll keep you all posted on the progress of this as well .
Until next time …

A Nile monitor lizard has produced an offspring without ever performing sexual intercourse or coming in contact with male monitor .
This is the first time parthenogenesis has been witnessed among this particular species .
The 10 - year - old , 4.5 feet ( 1.4 m ) long lizard named Nice , came from the African nation of Ghana as a hatchling .
It is currently housed in a reptile zoo in Kilkenny , Ireland .
This species of Monitor lizard is common to West and Central Africa .
The discovery was reported by James Hennesy , in charge of the lizards at Reptile Village Zoo in Kilkenny .
Nice is one of the two female monitors kept at the zoo .
Nasty is the other .
When both monitors laid eggs , they were put in an incubator together .
Hennessy said , " both the lizards lay eggs most years , but we usually just throw them out .
I decided to put the eggs in an incubator and see what happened .
I 'm still not one hundred percent sure why I did it this year , but I 'm glad I did . "
Unfortunately the baby monitor was too weak to fully hatch from its egg and died before it could .
Hennessy knew there was a problem when the egg failed to hatch within the normal 180 day period .
When he opened one of the eggs , he found the baby monitor lifeless , but fully formed .
The baby lizard 's remains have now been preserved in the zoo .
" It 's a huge deal , " Hennessy said , " It 's just absolutely amazing .
It 's still quite hard to believe , but I 'll be keeping a close eye on the eggs from now on .
My theory behind it would be that I ’ve a female here who has never seen another male in her life .
As far as she is concerned , she ’s in a habitat where it looks to her like there are no males around .
She needs to keep her species going , so she needs to repopulate . "
In May of 2007 , it was reported that blood samples taken from a Hammerhead shark , born in 2001 , located in Omaha Nebraska at the Henry Doorly Zoo was the product of a " virgin birth " .
The mother shark was in a tank with three other hammerheads , all female , and the baby shark was also born in the same tank .
Tests on the DNA from the baby shark show that there was no " chromosomal contribution " of a male shark present in the blood , something that is required in order for mating to have taken place .

I have been thinking recently that it would be so cool if there were a Mastering CPAN book , both for CPAN users and for CPAN authors .
The best way to get the job done with CPAN is sometimes just so non-obvious .
Such a book would be useful both for newcomers who still feel intimidated by CPAN as well as for more experienced users looking to learn some neat advanced techniques .
A sample Table of Contents may look like this :
Part I : Using CPAN
Basics - what is CPAN , who hosts it , who contributes to it , etc .
Finding stuff on CPAN
Installing stuff from CPAN , CPAN.pm and CPANPLUS .pm , other shells , manual installation , PPM packages and repositories , .deb and .rpm packages , ActiveState Perl vs Strawberry Perl , compiling modules on Win32 with AS Perl and Visual Studio Express , understanding the overwhelming output of the cpan shell and figuring out which messages are important , failed tests and forced installs
Structure of a CPAN distribution , info you can find in META.yml , finding usage examples in the tests directory

Controversy Over Bare Buttocks German Green Party Defends ' Racist ' Campaign Poster
A German campaign poster featuring the buttocks of a black woman is stirring controversy .
Some local people in the western town of Kaarst , where the Green Party put up the poster , have called it racist and tasteless .
Choosing the right company to meet all of your paving needs can be complex .
The quality of the contractor is key to ensuring that you get the job finished well , but given that most people know very little about the overall process , it can be tough to even know what to ask as you get bids for your project .
Here are a few questions you ’ll certainly want to ask :
1. How Long Have You Been in Business ?
Understanding exactly how long the company in question has been working with asphalt paving is important .
It not only signals the company ’s experience in the field , but it is also a good indicator of whether or not they ’ll be there when you need repairs or even future paving projects .
2. What ’s Included in the Bid ?
As with any project , you need to know exactly what the paving company will do for you before you start comparing bids .
You ’ll want to make certain that those details are in writing so that neither of you have any questions as the project begins to move forward .
3. Are There Challenges Ahead ?
Not every job is the same , and yours may project particular challenges from the outset .
For example , overlay projects often mean the contractor must check for bad spots in the old pavement , then deal with those before they can actually get started .
Drainage can also sometimes be an issue .
Understanding exactly what any contractor handling your project may be facing is important , as you can see how each one may address the same possible issues .
4 . Are you Licensed , Bonded , and Insured ?
If you ’ve ever hired a contractor of any type , you ’ve probably asked this question more than once , and for good reason .
Licensed contractors are required to have a certain amount of experience in the field .
They ’re also required to pass industry - relevant testing .
Those who are bonded are guaranteed to perform the work , and those who are insured can fix any problems that come up during the paving process .
All of these factors spell one thing for you – real protection .
5. What Other Services Do You Offer ?
Choosing someone who offers the paving services you need is great , but you may need additional services in the future , so make certain there are some add - on services available .
For example , you may be looking for parking lot striping , seal coating , or even cleaning services .
Having a company who can handle all of it is a must .
As you search for the right asphalt paving services to meet your needs , look no further than http://www.bennettpavingtx.com.
The only way to get exactly what you need again and again , Bennett Paving is the one asphalt contractor who can help , no matter what the project .

She 's getting on in years .
She uses up too many of our resources .
And the federal government says society would be better off without her .
No , not your grandma .
In this case , the plug is about to be pulled on a greenish - blue 1997 Dodge Caravan with 122,000 miles on the odometer , a few rust spots over the wheels and the sort of well - scuffed interior that comes from more than a decade of family service .
Let 's call her Old Blue .
Somewhere out there , the family that scuffed her up is driving around in a spanking - new Nissan , the cost of which has been defrayed by $ 3,500 to $ 4,500 from the Car Allowance Rebate System , popularly known as Cash for Clunkers .
I had come to Armory Nissan in Albany to watch Old Blue 's demise after my own mechanic offhandedly mentioned how " weird " this aspect of the clunker program had proven to be for some of his colleagues .
By vocation , mechanics are in the business of fixing cars , not putting them down like so many elderly hound dogs .
But the automotive equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath ( " First , do no harm to a smooth - running engine , " perhaps ) has been suspended for as long as the clunker program lasts .
While the federal government touts its ability to get fuel - inefficient cars off the road for good , dealers across the nation are ecstatic at its ability to replace those vehicles with new product .
And while mechanics love the challenge of keeping a well - worn car alive , they love being employed even more .
This conversation had put me in mind of my own first car purchase in 1989 , when I bought a 10 - year - old BMW with almost 100,000 miles under it from an accountant who had taken meticulous , borderline - compulsive care of it .
His wife had just delivered their first child , and he was about to get a station wagon .
" You 're taking my baby away , " he said as he handed me the key .
I spent the next six years beating the car to death on the steep , frequently unpaved roads of Wyoming and Vermont .
I 've often wondered if he would have sold it to me , had he known the torments that lay in store .
Jim Huskie , a master service technician at Armory Nissan in Albany , did n't sound overly sentimental as he drained Old Blue 's engine oil in the dealership 's garage .
" There 's been a few cars that could have been saved , but they 're coming off the road for a good reason , " he said .
The clunker program got off to a fast start last month , and burned through its initial $ 1 billion outlay in a week ; it was speedily re-upped with another $ 2 billion that should keep it going through the end of August .
The initial financial frenzy ran in parallel to uncertainty over just how dealers would go about decommissioning the traded - in clunkers .
Did they have to be crushed , or would drilling a hole in the engine block suffice ?
One local dealer tried running a car without oil ; it certainly did the job — the engine fried from excess friction — but created a big mess .
After bringing Old Blue down off the lift , Huskie piloted the van out of the garage on the last trip it would ever take under its own power , to a corner of the Armory lot that over the past few weeks has turned into a sort of automotive death row .
There are about 30 vehicles waiting for a tow to the junk yard , including a few wearing scrawled editorial comments like " Take that , big oil . "
SUVs predominate , although you 'll also find a Saab turbo and a custom van that 's probably been in service since the Reagan Era .
A few have been semi-stripped by their final owners of items ranging from radios to grilles .
About 40 other clunkers have already been towed off the lot .
Huskie popped Old Blue 's hood and brought out two bottles of sodium silicate , or liquid glass .
After pouring the contents in the engine , he got back behind the wheel and turned the ignition .
He ran the engine high at 2,000 rpm , heating the silicate and causing it to harden — a process that , in human terms , would be like swallowing concrete .
After less than a minute , Old Blue 's engine gave a brief yelp and seized .
Huskie wiped the excess silicate from the engine and applied a sticker identifying Old Blue as well and truly dead .
An hour later , he would have to walk back out to clunker row and give the key one more turn just to make sure that she had n't triumphed over chemistry and miraculously come back to life .
After a final check of her VIN number — the car 's dental records , as it were — she would be ready for the scrap heap .
" It 's not dramatic at all , " Huskie said .

Every kid knew it : lunchboxes meant something .
And it was n't just that you were a fan of whatever it was that you sported on your lunchtime luggage .
It was your proclamation of identity .
A window into your third - grade , paste - eating soul .
So the question was this : with what are you aligning yourself ?
Star Wars ?
Marvel Comics ?
Dukes of Hazzard ?
Care Bears ?
Muppets ?
Pele ?
They all made a statement -- especially the bad ones , the thoughtless ones , the downright inappropriate ones .
So , here , the 10 Worst Lunchboxes Ever , and what they said about the kids who carried them .
10 . Disco
What it says : " You might think this is a lame lunchbox now , but just wait until you 're a gay kitsch - collector in the late 1990s . "
9. Wags and Whiskers
What it says : " " This dog is obviously being abused , and this kitty is silently pleading you to help , help for the love of god .
But you can't , because it's my lunchbox . "
8. Junior Nurse
What it says : " I 'm either very into entering the medical profession someday , or I really like playing doctor .
Want to meet me behind the gym after school to find out which ? "
7. Laugh -In
What it says : " Hey , here 's a show my parents watch that I do n't understand !
Because I 'm six . "
6. Pro Sports / Campus Queen
What they say : " My mom has no clue what I actually like , but thinks that this looks like a generic idea of what I might enjoy based on clichéd gender roles and utilizing an early crude form of clip art . "
5. Rambo
What it says : " Nothing is over !
Nothing !
Well , except maybe that point in my childhood where it 's still appropriate for me to still be carrying a lunchbox . "
4. Bee Gees
What it says : " What I really wanted was a DISCO lunchbox . "
3. Exciting World of Metrics
What it says : " I do n't get nearly enough math in class , so I enjoy looking at the same conversion - facts all through my lunch hour , too .
It 's also fun to count the number of punches I get each day , multiply that by the number of Indian burns , titty twisters , and swirlies I receive , and then tabulate just exactly how much my life sucks on the metric scale . "
2. Hi !
What it says : " Hi !
I 'll give you an apple if you 'll touch my belt . "
1. Blank
What it says : " My mom hates me . "

Sulaiman Al Fahim claims to have taken full control of Portsmouth after months of speculation .
Businessman ' sole owner ' at Pompey
Sulaiman Al Fahim claims to have taken full control of Portsmouth after months of speculation about the club 's future .
The businessman 's attempted buy - out appeared to have fallen through earlier this month and chief executive Peter Storrie decided to front his own consortium in a bid to bring stability to Fratton Park .
Pompey have endured a difficult summer when they have been forced to sell many of their top players but manager Paul Hart stated at the weekend that an announcement over the club 's ownership was imminent .
Portsmouth have yet to issue an official statement but it seems an agreement is in place for Al Fahim to become the club 's sole owner .
" Devondale Investments , the current owner of Portsmouth FC , and Al Fahim Asia Associates Ltd. ( AAA ) , a company fully owned by Sulaiman Al Fahim , Chairman of the Board of Portsmouth FC , have reached an agreement whereby AAA has become the new sole owner of the club , " read a statement from Al Fahim 's representatives .
" Sulaiman Al Fahim welcomed this agreement and looks forward to helping the club build on its impressive history and achieve new successes in the Premier League .
" The chairman of the club would like to extend his gratitude to the players , staff and the supporters of Portsmouth FC who have shown an extraordinary level of commitment and loyalty to this great club . "
If you ’re serious about personal development you ’ll soon face a challenge : the tension between who you are and who you want to be .
Between your current development level and the next one .
Between your present and your future status .
One of the most interesting challenges of personal development is the approach to the question “ I can be better ? ” .
Keeping Your Identity
I guess every personal development technique will teach you to accept yourself .
I do n’t think I found any serious self improvement material teaching me to reject myself .
Accepting yourself is normal , is one of the fundamental keys to a balanced performance in every area of your life : relationships , career or money .
But if you want to be “ better ” , you ’ll automatically reject your current being in favor of a future one .
Or at least this is how it ’s happening .
Being better than you are today means ditching who you are today .
Am I the only one seeing a serious logical conflict here ?
How can you be better than you are and not lose your identity ?
How can you create a better version of yourself , but keep all your features ?
How can you upgrade your inner operating system but keep all your filesystem intact ?
This was on my mind for quite some time .
When I first tried to explain this to myself , I came up with this model : you ’re not actually changing yourself , you ’re getting closer to your real nature .
You are born a beautiful person , but somehow , during your life , you get derailed and you spend all your life regaining your initial heavenly innocence .
So , becoming better , means in fact becoming more “ you ” .
But this model could n’t explain why we experience new stuff in our lives .
If our existence will be only a path to our initial point , then how we define novelty ?
How can we learn ?
How can we evolve ?
At this point I confess I had a headache .
Trying to explain this logical conflict proved to be much more difficult than I thought .
I had to stop for a while and try a different perspective .
Seeing myself as a perfect human being , compromised by some mistakes and then trying to regain my perfection just felt wrong .
It was something static .
No movement , no excitement .
Still as a stone .
But stones are dead .
And I ’m not .
The Comfort Zone
So , after a while , I realized this model was based on something called “ comfort zone ” .
There was this idea of a perfect place for which you should aim and in which you should live .
A place with a perfect proportion , with no challenges and no dramas .
A place of equilibrium and perpetual happiness .
The comfort zone .
But the comfort zone lacks some of the fundamental ingredients of what I call a fulfilled life : enthusiasm , excitement and surprise .
Of course , it has security , stability and predictability .
The comfort zone is safe .
Life is n’t .
The comfort zone has lots of achievements , rules to be respected and , as the name says , comfort .
But it has no fun .
Staying there for too long could n’t be something somebody would die for .
Because , of course , he would be already dead inside .
So , instead of taking the destination as the cornerstone of my model , I switched and tried to find the model within the traveler .
It was not the destination which was important all of a sudden , but the desire of the man who wanted to reach there .
So , what was the real trigger for being better ?
What is that thing which can make somebody leave the comfort zone ?
Again and again ?
And then it hit me .
Simple and yet so complicated .
The only reason somebody will leave the comfort zone is dreaming .
Yes , dreaming , that ability of seeing things which are not yet reality .
The capacity to first create a new version of yourself in your mind , and then acting to become like that version .
Imagination .
Creativity .
Play .
No Risk It , No Biscuit
But dreaming without action is just … well , just dreaming , It ’s nothing but a mental projection .
In order to make things happening , you have to take risks .
And that was the second ingredient of my model : the ability to take risks .
The ability to engage in new activities , without knowing from the beginning the outcome .
The ability to not play safe .
When you mix together dreaming and risk something beautiful happens in your life .
First , your comfort zone is turned upside down .
Second , you ’re in the middle of a new world , most of the time completely new , trying to build a better version of yourself .
And third , you ’re actually living .
Of course , if you ’re taking too many risks , your face may hit some punches every now and then .
Part of the game , I suppose .
Risking your current status in order to reach your dream is what makes you better .
Not the next level , which you may or may not reach .
You ca n’t always fulfill all your dreams .
But you ’re becoming better because you tried .
There was some lesson in the process which made you experience something new .
It ’s not so much about your identity as it is about your life experience .
Maybe your identity is just an illusion , and all you got in the end is just the thrill of trying something new with your life .
Reaching There
Making dream reality is one of the best things you can do with your life .
Dreaming big and then putting those dreams into real life is what makes you alive .
Not the comfort zone .
Not shyness or social complacency .
Not postponing .
Not avoiding .
It ’s amazing how much energy people are spending just to avoid what they really want ..
So , back to the first questions : is it possible to keep your identity and still be better ?
Well , the answer is a little bit complicated .
You can keep your identity but you will lose some features .
You will reach a new version , but some incompatibilities may appear .
And you know why ?
Because your dream are sometimes incompatible with other people dreams .
You ’re dreaming your own life and some of the places you dream about are outside the others reach .
Let me give you a very simple example and hopefully you ’ll have a better understanding of this .
Suppose you ’re dreaming about a new financial status for yourself and for your family .
In plain English , you want more money .
You take some risks , you engage in some new activities , forget about security and safety and , after a while , your dream is becoming reality .
You do have more money .
But what happened in the process is that you lost some of your old friends , or connections or places you use to hang out .
They ’re now incompatible with your new dream .
They ’re not good or bad , just incompatible .
They ’re from another dream .
Getting better will always have that effect on you .
Your dream will always be different and you ’re going to lose some features in the upgrade process .
But you know what ?
That ’s the beauty of it .
That ’s the thrill .
That ’s excitement and fun and evolution .
You Can Be Better ?
Do youÂ have a dream ?
Are you ready to take some serious risks in your life ?
Â
Are you prepared to mix that dream with the necessary risks to make it happen ?

Under the watchful eye of the Troll this evening , the “ real Jeff Lebowski , ” also known as “ the Dude , ” received the Key to the Universe .
Or to put it another way , Jeff Dowd got a really big plastic key .
“ It ’s great to be back in Seattle , ” he told the crowd of fans .
Originally from Seattle , Dowd was the inspiration behind the movie , The Big Lebowski .
The key was awarded by Marko Tubic , president of the Fremont Chamber , and Jon Hegeman , founder of Fremont Outdoor Cinema .
“ The Dude ’s appearance in Fremont seemed like a perfect reason to start a new tradition presenting Jeff with the first ‘ Key to the Universe , ' ” the Chamber explained .
“ Honoring him for living large and creating an enduring cultural legend that epitomizes our larger than life neighbor motto of ‘ Delibertus Quirkus , freedom to be peculiar . ' ”
Also in attendance was Nick Licata , who is running for re-election .
Dowd is here for Seattle ’s annual Lebowski Fest , which includes the showing of The Big Lebowski at Fremont Outdoor Movies tonight .
Tickets are $ 20 .
THE Reserve Bank of Australia paid $ 500,000 to a self - styled '' white witch ' ' to oversee an ultimately disastrous workplace overhaul at its bank - note printing company .
The revelation of a highly scathing investigative report into Caroline Shahbaz 's work at Note Printing Australia - fully owned by the RBA and operating under its charter - adds to concerns about the Reserve 's oversight of its currency printing operations .
The Reserve Bank of Australia paid ' white witch ' Caroline Shabaz $ 500,000 .
The report , obtained by The Age , was written in 2003 , six years before a later employer of Ms Shahbaz , the City of Port Phillip , was criticised over its payment to her of large sums .
NPA and its sister company , Securency , which is half - owned by the Reserve , are under scrutiny over payment of large commissions to foreign middlemen .
The middlemen have helped the companies win contracts from overseas governments and banks in corruption - prone countries over the past decade .
The way you imagine someone engaged in a suicide attack depends , not surprisingly , on which end of the attack you happen to be on — in cultural , if not literal terms .
In American films and pop culture , there were few acts more inexplicable or malevolent in the years of my childhood than those of Japan ’s kamikaze pilots ( and , in a few cases , submariners ) , the state - organized suicide bombers of World War II who targeted the U.S. fleet with their weapons and their lives .
Americans themselves were incapable of such kamikaze acts not because they did n’t commit them , but because , when done by someone known to us in the name of a cause we cherish or to save us from being overrun by them , such acts were no longer unrecognizable .
Under those circumstances , each represented a profound gift of life to those left behind .
In the desperate early days of 1942 in the Pacific , for instance , there were a number of reported cases in which American pilots tried to dive their planes into Japanese ships .
According to Edward F. Murphy in Heroes of WWII , Captain Richard E. Fleming , the only recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor for the Battle of Midway , was leading his dive bomber squadron in an attack on the disabled cruiser Mikuma when his plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire .
It " rocked wildly … but … soon righted itself and continued down under control .
At an altitude of only 350 feet , Fleming released his bomb .
Then he followed it straight down to the Japanese carrier . "
His hometown , St. Paul , Minnesota , later named its airport in his honor .
In the same way , " Colin " became a popular first name for boys ( including , evidently , Colin Powell ) because of war hero Captain Colin P. Kelly , Jr. , who was generally ( if incorrectly ) believed to have won the Medal of Honor for plunging his B - 17 into the smokestack of the Japanese battleship Haruna — he did n’t — in the first days of the Pacific war .
This sort of American heroism , as John Feffer , co-director of the website Foreign Policy in Focus and TomDispatch regular , indicates below , was highlighted in war films of those years .
There was even a celluloid version of kamikaze sex .
As film critic Jeanine Basinger wrote in The World War II Combat Film , nurse Veronica Lake , trapped by the Japanese on the Bataan peninsula in So Proudly We Hail ( 1943 ) , " places a hand inside her blouse … and walks slowly toward the enemy in her combat fatigues .
As she nears them , she takes off her helmet , and releases her long , very blonde hair over her shoulders .
When they come near her in obvious delight , she pulls the pin on her grenade … "
In fact , many war films of that time had a kamikaze feel to them , but as " we " were defending " home " and knew ourselves for the individuals we were , the act of diving a plane into a bridge or refusing to leave a platoon certain to be wiped out bore no relation to suicidal enemy acts .
To understand and deal with our world , it ’s often less than useful to look on the enemy , in our case today " the terrorist , " as something other than human ( whether super - human or sub - human ) rather than as another one of those strange creatures like ourselves .
But let Feffer take it from here .

Our Suicide Bombers
By John Feffer
The actor Will Smith is no one ’s image of a suicide bomber .
With his boyish face , he has often played comic roles .
Even as the last man on earth in I Am Legend , he retains a wise - cracking , ironic demeanor .
And yet , surrounded by a horde of hyperactive vampires at the end of that film , Smith clasps a live grenade to his chest and throws himself at the enemy in a final burst of heroic sacrifice .
Wait a second : surely that was n’t a suicide bombing .
Will Smith was n’t reciting suras from the Koran .
He was n’t sporting one of those rising sun headbands that the Japanese kamikaze wore for their suicide missions .
He was n’t playing a religious fanatic or a political extremist .
Will Smith was the hero of the film .
So how could he be a suicide bomber ?
After all , he ’s one of us , is n’t he ?
As it happens , we have our suicide bombers too .
" We " are the powerful , developed countries , the ones with an overriding concern for individual liberties and individual lives .
" We " form a moral archipelago that encompasses the United States , Europe , Israel , present - day Japan , and occasionally Russia .
Whether in real war stories or inspiring vignettes served up in fiction and movies , our lore is full of heroes who sacrifice themselves for motherland , democracy , or simply their band of brothers .
Admittedly , these men were n’t expecting 72 virgins in paradise and they did n’t make film records of their last moments , but our suicidal heroes generally have received just as much praise and recognition as " their " martyrs .
The scholarly work on suicide bombers is large and growing .
Most of these studies focus on why those other people do such terrible things , sometimes against their own compatriots but mainly against us .
According to the popular view , Shi’ite or Tamil or Chechen suicide martyrs have a fundamentally different attitude toward life and death .
If , however , we have our own rich tradition of suicide bombers — and our own unfortunate tendency to kill civilians in our military campaigns — how different can these attitudes really be ?
Western Jihad
In America ’s first war against Islam , we were the ones who introduced the use of suicide bombers .
Indeed , the American seamen who perished in the incident were among the U.S. military ’s first missing in action .
It was September 4 , 1804 .
The United States was at war with the Barbary pirates along the North African coast .
The U.S. Navy was desperate to penetrate the enemy defenses .
Commodore Edward Preble , who headed up the Third Mediterranean Squadron , chose an unusual stratagem : sending a booby - trapped U.S.S.
Intrepid into the bay at Tripoli , one of the Barbary states of the Ottoman empire , to blow up as many of the enemy ’s ships as possible .
U.S. sailors packed 10,000 pounds of gunpowder into the boat along with 150 shells .
When Lieutenant Richard Sommers , who commanded the vessel , addressed his crew on the eve of the mission , a midshipman recorded his words :
" ’ No man need accompany him , who had not come to the resolution to blow himself up , rather than be captured ; and that such was fully his own determination ! ’
Three cheers was the only reply .
The gallant crew rose , as a single man , with the resolution yielding up their lives , sooner than surrender to their enemies : while each stepped forth , and begged as a favor , that he might be permitted to apply the match ! "
The crew of the boat then guided the Intrepid into the bay at night .
So as not to be captured and lose so much valuable gunpowder to the enemy , they chose to blow themselves up with the boat .
The explosion did n’t do much damage — at most , one Tripolitan ship went down — but the crew was killed just as surely as the two men who plowed a ship piled high with explosives into the U.S.S.
Cole in the Gulf of Aden nearly 200 years later .
Despite the failure of the mission , Preble received much praise for his strategies .
" A few brave men have been sacrificed , but they could not have fallen in a better cause , " opined a British navy commander .
The Pope went further : " The American commander , with a small force and in a short space of time , has done more for the cause of Christianity than the most powerful nations of Christiandom have done for ages ! "
Preble chose his tactic because his American forces were outgunned .
It was a Hail Mary attempt to level the playing field .
The bravery of his men and the reaction of his supporters could be easily transposed to the present day , when " fanatics " fighting against similar odds beg to sacrifice themselves for the cause of Islam and garner the praise of at least some of their religious leaders .
The blowing up of the Intrepid was not the only act of suicidal heroism in U.S. military history .
We routinely celebrate the brave sacrifices of soldiers who knowingly give up their lives in order to save their unit or achieve a larger military mission .
We commemorate the sacrifice of the defenders of the Alamo , who could have , after all , slunk away to save themselves and fight another day .
The poetry of the Civil War is rich in the language of sacrifice .
In Phoebe Cary ’s poem " Ready " from 1861 , a black sailor , " no slavish soul had he , " volunteers for certain death to push a boat to safety .
The heroic sacrifices of the twentieth century are , of course , commemorated in film .
Today , you can buy several videos devoted to the " suicide missions " of American soldiers .
Our World War II propaganda films — er , wartime entertainments — often featured brave soldiers facing certain death .
In Flying Tigers ( 1942 ) , for example , pilot Woody Jason anticipates the Japanese kamikaze by several years by flying a plane into a bridge to prevent a cargo train from reaching the enemy .
In Bataan ( 1943 ) , Robert Taylor leads a crew of 13 men in what they know will be the suicidal defense of a critical position against the Japanese .
With remarkable sangfroid , the soldiers keep up the fight as they are picked off one by one until only Taylor is left .
The film ends with him manning a machine gun against wave upon wave of oncoming Japanese .
Our warrior culture continues to celebrate the heroism of these larger - than - life figures from World War II by taking real - life stories and turning them into Hollywood - style entertainments .
For his series of " war stories " on Fox News , for instance , Oliver North narrates an episode on the Doolittle raid , an all - volunteer mission to bomb Tokyo shortly after Pearl Harbor .
Since the bombers did n’t have enough fuel to return to their bases , the 80 pilots committed to what they expected to be a suicide mission .
Most of them survived , miraculously , but they had been prepared for the ultimate sacrifice — and that is how they are billed today .
" These are the men who restored the confidence of a shaken nation and changed the course of the Second World War , " the promotional material for the episode rather grandly reports .
Tokyo had the same hopes for its kamikaze pilots a few years later .
Why Suicide Missions ?
America did not , of course , dream up suicide missions .
They form a rich vein in the Western tradition .
In the Bible , Samson sacrificed himself in bringing down the temple on the Philistine leadership , killing more through his death than he did during his life .
The Spartans , at Thermopylae , faced down the Persians , knowing that the doomed effort would nevertheless delay the invading army long enough to give the Athenians time to prepare Greek defenses .
In the first century AD in the Roman province of Judea , Jewish Zealots and Sicarians ( " dagger men " ) launched suicide missions , mostly against Jewish moderates , to provoke an uprising against Roman rule .
Later , suicide missions played a key role in European history .
" Books written in the post - 9/11 period tend to place suicide bombings only in the context of Eastern history and limit them to the exotic rebels against modernism , " writes Niccolo Caldararo in an essay on suicide bombers .
" A study of the late 19th century and early 20th would provide a spate of examples of suicide bombers and assassins in the heart of Europe . "
These included various European nationalists , Russian anarchists , and other early practitioners of terrorism .
Given the plethora of suicide missions in the Western tradition , it should be difficult to argue that the tactic is unique to Islam or to fundamentalists .
Yet some scholars enjoy constructing a restrictive genealogy for such missions that connects the Assassin sect ( which went after the great sultan Saladin in the Levant in the twelfth century ) to Muslim suicide guerrillas of the Philippines ( first against the Spanish and then , in the early twentieth century , against Americans ) .
They take this genealogy all the way up to more recent suicide campaigns by Hezbollah , Hamas , al - Qaeda , and Islamic rebels in the Russian province of Chechnya .
The Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka , who used suicide bombers in a profligate fashion , are ordinarily the only major non-Muslim outlier included in this series .
Uniting our suicide attackers and theirs , however , are the reasons behind the missions .
Three salient common factors stand out .
First , suicidal attacks , including suicide bombings , are a " weapon of the weak , " designed to level the playing field .
Second , they are usually used against an occupying force .
And third , they are cheap and often brutally effective .
We commonly associate suicide missions with terrorists .
But states and their armies , when outnumbered , will also launch such missions against their enemies , as Preble did against Tripoli or the Japanese attempted near the end of World War II .
To make up for its technological disadvantages , the Iranian regime sent waves of young volunteers , some unarmed and some reportedly as young as nine years old , against the then - U.S. - backed Iraqi army in the Iran - Iraq War of the 1980s .
Non-state actors are even more prone to launch suicide missions against occupying forces .
Remove the occupying force , as Robert Pape argues in his groundbreaking book on suicide bombers , Dying to Win , and the suicide missions disappear .
It is not a stretch , then , to conclude that we , the occupiers ( the United States , Russia , Israel ) , through our actions , have played a significant part in fomenting the very suicide missions that we now find so alien and incomprehensible in Iraq , Afghanistan , Chechnya , Lebanon , and elsewhere .
The archetypal modern suicide bomber first emerged in Lebanon in the early 1980s , a response to Israel ’s invasion and occupation of the country .
" The Shi’ite suicide bomber , " writes Mike Davis in his book on the history of the car bomb , Buda ’s Wagon , " was largely a Frankenstein monster of [ Israeli Defense Minister ] Ariel Sharon ’s deliberate creation . "
Not only did U.S. and Israeli occupation policies create the conditions that gave birth to these missions , but the United States even trained some of the perpetrators .
The U.S. funded Pakistan ’s intelligence service to run a veritable insurgency training school that processed 35,000 foreign Muslims to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s .
Charlie Wilson ’s
War , the book and movie that celebrated U.S. assistance to the mujihadeen , could be subtitled : Suicide Bombers We Have Known and Funded .
Finally , the technique " works . "
Suicide bombers kill 12 times more people per incident than conventional terrorism , national security specialist Mohammed Hafez points out .
The U.S. military has often publicized the " precision " of its airborne weaponry , of its " smart " bombs and missiles .
But in truth , suicide bombers are the " smartest " bombers because they can zero in on their target in a way no missile can — from close up — and so make last - minute corrections for accuracy .
In addition , by blasting themselves to smithereens , suicide bombers can’t give away any information about their organization or its methods after the act , thus preserving the security of the group .
You ca n’t argue with success , however bloodstained it might be .
Only when the tactic itself becomes less effective or counterproductive , does it recede into the background , as seems to be the case today among armed Palestinian groups .
Individual motives for becoming a suicide bomber or attacker have , when studied , proved to be surprisingly diverse .
We tend to ascribe heroism to our soldiers when , against the odds , they sacrifice themselves for us , while we assume a glassy - eyed fanaticism on the part of those who go up against us .
But close studies of suicide bombers suggest that they are generally not crazy , nor — another popular explanation — just acting out of abysmal poverty or economic desperation ( though , as in the case of the sole surviving Mumbai suicide attacker put on trial in India recently , this seems to have been the motivation ) .
" Not only do they generally not have economic problems , but most of the suicide bombers also do not have an emotional disturbance that prevents them from differentiating between reality and imagination , " writes Anat Berko in her careful analysis of the topic , The Path to Paradise .
Despite suggestions from Iraqi and U.S. officials that suicide bombers in Iraq have been coerced into participating in their missions , scholars have yet to record such cases .
Perhaps , however , this reflects a narrow understanding of coercion .
After all , our soldiers are indoctrinated into a culture of heroic sacrifice just as are the suicide bombers of Hamas .
The indoctrination does n’t always work : scores of U.S. soldiers go AWOL or join the peace movement just as some suicide bombers give up at the last minute .
But the basic - training techniques of instilling the instinct to kill , the readiness to follow orders , and a willingness to sacrifice one ’s life are part of the warrior ethic everywhere .
Suicide missions are , then , a military technique that armies use when outmatched and that guerrilla movements use , especially in occupied countries , to achieve specific objectives .
Those who volunteer for such missions , whether in Iraq today or on board the Intrepid in 1804 , are usually placing a larger goal — liberty , national self - determination , ethnic or religious survival — above their own lives .
But wait : surely I ’m not equating soldiers going on suicide missions against other soldiers with terrorists who blow up civilians in a public place .
Indeed , these are two distinct categories .
And yet much has happened in the history of modern warfare — in which civilians have increasingly become the victims of combat — to blur these distinctions .
Terror and Civilians
The conventional picture of today ’s suicide bomber is a young man or woman , usually of Arab extraction , who makes a video proclamation of faith , straps on a vest of high explosives , and detonates him or herself in a crowded pizzeria , bus , marketplace , mosque , or church .
But we must expand this picture .
The September 11th hijackers targeted high - profile locations , including a military target , the Pentagon .
Hezbollah ’s suicidal truck driver destroyed the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut on October 23 , 1983 , killing 241 U.S. soldiers .
Thenmozhi Rajaratnam , a female Tamil suicide bomber , assassinated Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 .
Suicide bombers , in other words , have targeted civilians , military installations , non-military sites of great significance , and political leaders .
In suicide attacks , Hezbollah , Tamil Tiger , and Chechen suicide bombers have generally focused on military and police targets : 88 % , 71 % , and 61 % of the time , respectively .
Hamas , on the other hand , has largely targeted civilians ( 74 % of the time ) .
Sometimes , in response to public opinion , such movements will shift focus — and targets .
After a 1996 attack killed 91 civilians and created a serious image problem , the Tamil Tigers deliberately began chosing military , police , and government targets for their suicide attacks .
" We do n’t go after kids in Pizza Hut , " one Tiger leader told researcher Mia Bloom , referring to a Hamas attack on a Sbarro outlet in Jerusalem that killed 15 civilians in 2001 .
We have been conditioned into thinking of suicide bombers as targeting civilians and so putting themselves beyond the established conventions of war .
As it happens , however , the nature of war has changed in our time .
In the twentieth century , armies began to target civilians as a way of destroying the will of the population , and so bringing down the leadership of the enemy country .
Japanese atrocities in China in the 1930s , the Nazi air war against Britain in World War II , Allied fire bombings of German and Japanese cities , the nuclear attacks against Hiroshima and Nagasaki , U.S. carpet bombing in Cambodia and Laos , and the targeted assassinations of the Phoenix program during the Vietnam War , Russian depredations in Afghanistan and Chechnya , the tremendous civilian casualties during the Iraq War : all this has made the idea of conventional armies clashing in an area far from civilian life a quaint legacy of the past .
Terrorist attacks against civilians , particularly September 11th , prompted military historian Caleb Carr to back the Bush administration ’s declaration of a war against terror .
" War can only be answered with war , " he wrote in his best - selling The Lessons of Terror .
" And it is incumbent on us to devise a style of war more imaginative , more decisive , and yet more humane than anything terrorists can contrive . "
This more imaginative , decisive , and humane style of war has , in fact , consisted of stepped - up aerial bombing , beefed - up Special Forces ( to , in part , carry out targeted assassinations globally ) , and recently , the widespread use of unmanned aerial drones like the Predator and the Reaper , both in the American arsenal and in 24/7 use today over the Pakistani tribal borderlands .
" Predators can become a modern army ’s answer to the suicide bomber , " Carr wrote .
Carr ’s argument is revealing .
As the U.S. military and Washington see it , the ideal use of Predator or Reaper drones , armed as they are with Hellfire missiles , is to pick off terrorist leaders ; in other words , a mirror image of what that Tamil Tiger suicide bomber ( who picked off the Indian prime minister ) did somewhat more cost effectively .
According to Carr , such a strategy with our robot planes is an effective and legitimate military tactic .
In reality , though , such drone attacks regularly result in significant civilian casualties , usually referred to as " collateral damage . "
According to researcher Daniel Byman , the drones kill 10 civilians for every suspected militant .
As Tom Engelhardt of TomDispatch.com writes , " In Pakistan , a war of machine assassins is visibly provoking terror ( and terrorism ) , as well as anger and hatred among people who are by no means fundamentalists .
It is part of a larger destabilization of the country . "
So , the dichotomy between a " just war , " or even simply a war of any sort , and the unjust , brutal targeting of civilians by terrorists has long been blurring , thanks to the constant civilian casualties that now result from conventional war - fighting and the narrow military targets of many terrorist organizations .
Moral Relativism ?
We have our suicide bombers — we call them heroes .
We have our culture of indoctrination — we call it basic training .
We kill civilians — we call it collateral damage .
Is this , then , the moral relativism that so outrages conservatives ?
Of course not .
I ’ve been drawing these comparisons not to excuse the actions of suicide bombers , but to point out the hypocrisy of our black - and - white depictions of our noble efforts and their barbarous acts , of our worthy goals and their despicable ends .
We — the inhabitants of an archipelago of supposedly enlightened warfare — have been indoctrinated to view the atomic bombing of Hiroshima as a legitimate military target and September 11th as a heinous crime against humanity .
We have been trained to see acts like the attack in Tripoli as American heroism and the U.S.S .
Cole attack as rank barbarism .
Explosive vests are a sign of extremism ; Predator missiles , of advanced sensibility .
It would be far better if we opened our eyes when it came to our own world and looked at what we were actually doing .
Yes , " they " sometimes have dismaying cults of sacrifice and martyrdom , but we do too .
And who is to say that ending occupation is any less noble than making the world free for democracy ?
Will Smith , in I Am Legend , was willing to sacrifice himself to end the occupation of vampires .
We should realize that our soldiers in the countries we now occupy may look no less menacing and unintelligible than those obviously malevolent , science - fiction creatures .
And the presence of our occupying soldiers sometimes inspires similar , Will Smith - like acts of desperation and , dare I say it , courage .
The fact is :
Were we to end our occupation policies , we would go a long way toward eliminating " their " suicide bombers .
But when and how will we end our own cult of martyrdom ?

The late 70s was an exciting time in TV production and Marvel ‘s witty , angst ridden , everyman superhero was ripe for live action adaptation .
With that in mind , it ’s hard to understand how the producer ’s took a vibrant and exciting character and turned him into a farcical , Marcel Marceau knock off .
Written by someone who had clearly never read Spiderman , the series is far removed from the well known , wisecracking , web - slinging , super villain baiting / beating comic book character .
For a start he is nearly always mute whilst in costume , which lessens the impact of a well timed witticism , his web - slinging too is impeded by stunts and special effects which , even by the standards of the day , are man - on - a- fishing - wire poor .
His most challenging villains are basically goons , the most memorable being a cross - dressing coin thief .
In fact .
generally the show ’s criminals just need a good talking too , if only Spidey could be more vocal through his cheap spandex and velco mask .
The main problem seems to be , that in costume Spidermanlooks like a dispossessed tramp in an technicolor romper suit , leering from wires at passers - by , desperately trying to spread his web over them .
Stan Lee reportedly hated this bastardisation of his creation … nuff said .
Dr Strange ( 1978 ) “ None of us is ever alone . “
In an industrial yard behind Burbank ’s Bob Hope Airport , dozens of orange forklifts and 135 - foot - high booms stand idle , gleaming in the afternoon sunlight .
As recently as two years ago , the yard was largely empty because the equipment was busy being used to hoist cameras , rig lights and build sets for “ Iron Man , ” “ Get Smart , ” “ The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ” and other movies shooting throughout Southern California .
“ I ’ve been doing this for 25 years and I ’ve never seen such a sustained downtime , ” said Lance Sorenson , president of 24/7 Studio Equipment , who recently had to lay off two of his drivers and has imposed three - and four - day workweeks for the rest of his 44 employees .
Across town in Culver City , at the landmark studio where “ Gone with the Wind , ” “ Citizen Kane , ” “ The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet ” and “ The Andy Griffith Show ” were filmed , there ’s a similar story .
Now an independent production facility known as the Culver Studios , the soundstage complex just lost one of its largest tenants , the syndicated game show “ Deal or No Deal . ”
That program will tape future episodes in Waterford , Conn. , a suburban town known for its nuclear power plant , large state park and assortment of shops and family - owned restaurants .
The chief draw : Connecticut ’s 30 % production - tax credit .
“ It ’s a huge blow to us , ” said James Cella , president of the Culver Studios .

Others also have been hard hit by the outflow of production to other areas , known as runaway production .
At Modern Props , also in the Culver City area , nearly half the employees have been laid off , and those remaining are on 20 - to 40 - hour workweeks .
John Zabrucky , the company ’s founder , thought he ’d gotten ahead by opening a satellite office in Vancouver , Canada .
But now so many states are offering tax incentives to film and television producers that he can’t keep up .
Hundreds of small blue - collar businesses like these sustain Southern California ’s entertainment industry .
Many are struggling amid a sharp drop in local film and TV production triggered by the recession , a rise in runaway production , and the fallout from a writer ’s strike and a yearlong contract dispute between studios and the Screen Actors Guild .
According to the state Employment Development Department , jobs in movie and television production were down 13,800 in May compared with a year earlier .
On-location feature film production in the area has fallen to its lowest levels on record .
Student films generated as much activity on the streets of Los Angeles in the first quarter of 2009 , when only a few movies , including “ Fame ” and “ Alvin and the Chipmunks : The Squeakquel , ” were shot there .

California ’s share of U.S. feature film production dropped to 31 % in 2008 from 66 % in 2003 , according to the California Film Commission .
That largely reflects a falloff in the Los Angeles area , where feature filming activity in 2008 was nearly half what it was at its peak in 1996 .
Television production , which recently has been a more reliable source of jobs in the region , is also declining .
A recent survey from FilmL.A. Inc. found that 44 of 103 TV pilots this year were shot in such disparate locations as Canada , Illinois , Georgia , New York , Louisiana and New Mexico .
More than 30 states have sought to outbid one another with tax credits and rebates aimed at luring productions away from California .
Sacramento has responded with its first - ever film - tax credit program , but most analysts think the credits are too small and restrictive to have much effect .
“ L.A. is at risk of losing a good part of one of its signature industries , just like it did with the aerospace industry in the early 1990s , ” said Jack Kyser , chief economist for Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp .

Few know that better than Cella , of Culver Studios .
He previously ran Steiner Studios in Brooklyn , N.Y. , and was tapped to run Culver in 2006 after a group of investors including Lehman Bros.
acquired the 14 soundstages from Sony Pictures Entertainment for $ 125 million .
But the studio ’s business took a big hit recently when NBC Universal and Endemol USA opted to move “ Deal or No Deal ” to Connecticut .
The show brought in more than $ 1 million in rental income to Culver Studios , Cella said , adding that there was little he could do to keep the producers from leaving .
“ I could give them this space for free and it still would n’t compete with Connecticut , ” he said .

The studio , which still hosts “ The Bonnie Hunt Show ” and others , has seen its occupancy rate slide to 46 % from 85 % in the last year .
Most of “ Deal or No Deal ’s ” 250 crew members lost their jobs in the move .
“ It ’s a crying shame , ” said Lindsay Hovel , an associate producer on the prime - time version of the game show hosted by comedian Howie Mandel .
“ There are so many talented people , and they ’re just not able to work in the [ entertainment ] capital . ”
The relocation was doubly bruising for Cella because it was announced just after California approved its film - tax credit program , which Cella lobbied heavily for and helped craft .
The credits , however , do n’t cover game shows .

Still , Cella predicts that the tax deal will attract some TV shows back to California .
“ If we do n’t do something now , there ’s going to be nothing left , ” he said .
Sorenson , of 24/7 Studio Equipment , also is pinning his hopes on the state tax credits to spur business .
A major studio film can generate $ 75,000 in rental income for a company like Sorenson’s .
But this year , 24/7 has worked mostly on a few low - budget films such as Screen Gems ’ “ The Roommate . ”
His company ’s feature film business has plummeted 50 % since 2007 .
Sorenson made up for the shortfall by renting out equipment to TV shows , but even that is no longer a sure bet .

One of his customers , the HBO series “ Hung , ” filmed three months in L.A. and two months in Michigan , which offers a 42 % tax credit .
Another customer , the TNT series “ Leverage , ” has opted to film its second season in Portland , Ore. , which offers a 20 % cash rebate on qualified expenses .
“ It would be a lot different if we were smoking busy , ” he said .
“ But . . . every rental right now is like a precious jewel . ”
Local prop houses also are struggling from the downturn .
Some have recently closed and others have cut their payrolls .
Modern Props laid off 17 workers last month .
The company owns a 120,000 - square - foot warehouse that contains 80,000 props .
Advertisement
“ I was in shock , ” said Luis Peniche , 21 , a former sales assistant who lost his $ 25,000 - a- year job after two years at Modern Props .
“ I really loved working there .
It was like family . ”
Unable to pay his rent , Peniche moved into his sister ’s apartment in Van Nuys .
He also stopped taking classes at Santa Monica College because he could n’t afford the books and tuition .
“ I ’d love to work in the entertainment industry , but it ’s just so bad out there . ”
Zabrucky launched the company 32 years ago , specializing in leasing furniture , lights and electric control panels to sci-fi TV shows such as “ Buck Rogers in the 25th Century ” and eventually to some of the biggest movies in Hollywood , including “ Die Hard , ” “ Ghostbusters ” and “ Men in Black . ”
Modern Props became one of the largest prop houses in Hollywood , employing 50 people in its heyday in the late 1990s .
But the business has eroded through much of the last decade , squeezed by the growing use of digital effects ; the growth of reality television , which spends little on props ; and especially the departure of shows to other locales .
Advertisement
“ We know how to do what we do very well , ” Zabrucky said , “ but we ca n’t fight the fact that everything is just being sold right from underneath us . ”
Last summer , Modern Props lost one of its clients , the ABC series “ Ugly Betty , ” to New York .
“ Their set decorator was in every week placing orders .
That ’s $ 14,000 a month we lost , ” lamented Ken Sharp , vice president of sales and operations for Modern Props .
To highlight the plight facing his business and others , Zabrucky recently designed skateboard decks that show a pictograph of the country , with California highlighted , and distributed them to hundreds of Hollywood executives as well as city and state politicians .
The deck shows arrows pointing away from the state and the words “ do n’t run away . ”

The first shot of Curb Your Enthusiasm 's long - awaited Seinfeld reunion been released by the Home Box Office Television Channel .
Furthermore , Larry David talked to press about the scenario's inspiration , and how it will play out :
" I would say , ' No , there 's no reunion , we would never do that , it 's a lame idea ' ... but it might be really funny to do that on ' Curb ' ... and I kept thinking of how we could pull this off , and Jerry was game ... so we 're doing a ' Seinfeld ' reunion show .
...
We 'll see the read - through , parts of rehearsals , the show being filmed ... you wo n't see the entire [ mock ' Seinfeld ' episode ] ... you 'll get an idea of what happened 11 years later [ for the characters ] . "
" It was like getting on a bicycle , " David said of writing " Seinfeld " dialog again .
" Coming up with the right ideas about what they'd be doing 11 years later ... that took some thought . "
The plan the president will formally announce on Wednesday would give the Federal Reserve greater supervisory authority over large financial institutions whose problems pose potential risks to the economic system .
It would separately expand the reach of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to seize and break up troubled financial institutions .
And it would create a council of regulators , led by the Treasury secretary , to fill in regulatory gaps .
In doing so , the plan seeks to give Washington the tools to police the shadow system of finance that has grown up outside the government ’s purview , and to make it easier for regulators to head off problems at large , troubled institutions or take control of them if they fail .
“ Unfortunately the growth of the nonbank sector as well as all the complexities and financial instruments outstripped those old regulatory regimes , ” Mr. Obama said in an interview on Tuesday with The New York Times and CNBC .
Although it would strikingly reorganize the regulatory architecture , the president ’s plan results from many compromises with industry executives and lawmakers , and is not as bold as some had hoped .
Mr. Obama seemed to acknowledge as much when he posed the question : “ Did , you know , any considerations of sort of politics play into it ?
We want to get this thing passed , and , you know , we think that speed is important .
We want to do it right .
We want to do it carefully .
But we do n’t want to tilt at windmills . ”
We ca n’t believe it ’s been 11 YEARS since we danced down the aisle .
Thank you for all of the emails , messages , comments , and donations that have come from across the globe .
We love hearing how this video has given you joy and hope over the years .
Here are answers to some of the questions we get the most -
We are still happily married :)
We have three amazing kids that keep us laughing every day - two boys ( ages 9 and 6 ) , and a 3 year old girl
We are still very close to the people in our bridal party .
In the past ten years , 11 of the people in this picture have earned doctorate degrees ( medicine , law , education , ecology , physical therapy ) and we have added 22 kids to the mix !
We did NOT know The Office was going to copy our wedding .
We were watching it live on TV when it aired and were shocked

Draw Things From Captcha
Let 's make Captcha more meaningful !

Then use your favorite photo editor ( Microsoft Paint , PhotoShop , whatever ) to illustrate them any way you see fit .
" Tea Party Patriots " National Coordinator Jenny Beth Martin got a friendly little " media request " from CNBC : could you crazies maybe go crazy up a town hall somewhere ?
Sure , a ' Bagger says : how bout the guy who got the swastika ?
Martin emailed the Tea Party listserve explaining that CNBC needed " lots of energy and lots of anger . "
She asked : " where are the big events this week and where can TPP best be represented on the news ? "
Patriot and Teabagger Pat Wayman responded with a great suggestion : let 's throw a riot at a health fair sponsored by Rep. David Scott ( D - GA ) , the Congressman who got a swastika painted on his office sign last night !
Martin explained to TPM Muckraker that the Teabaggers would not be protesting that particular health fair , but the bit about CNBC specifically asking Tea Baggers to display " lot of anger " for their cameras was not disputed .
So .
There you go .
Maybe we should all join Bill O'Reilly 's fight against GE !
It actually really is a pretty shitty corporation !
Benford ’s law is one of those very weird things that we ca n’t explain , and when we discover more and more phenomena that obey the law , we became astonished .
Two people ( Simon Newcomb – 1881 and Frank Benford – 1938 ) noted the law in the same way , while flipping pages of a logarithmic table book ; they noticed that the pages at the beginning of the book were dirtier than the pages at the end .
Currently , there are no a priori criteria that say to us when a dataset will or will not obey the Benford ’s Law .
And it is because of this , that I ’ve done an analysis on the Twitter Public Timeline .
The Twitter API to get Public Timeline is simply useless for this analysis because in the API Docs , they say that the Public Timeline is cached for 60 seconds !
60 seconds is an eternity , and there is a request rating of 150 request / hour .
So , it does n’t help , buuuuuut , there is an alpha testing API with pretty and very useful streams of data from the Public Timeline ; there are many methods in the Twitter Streaming API , and the most interesting one is the “ Firehose ” , which returns ALL the public statuses , but this method is only available for intere$ting people , and I ’m not one of them .
Buuuut , we have “ Spritzer ” , which returns a portion of all public statuses , since it ’s only what we have available in the moment , it MUST be useful , and it ’s a pretty stream of data =)
So , I ’ve got the Spritzer real - time stream of data and processed each new status which arrived with a regex to find all the numbers in the status ; if the status was “ I have 5 dogs and 3 cats ” , the numbers collected should be “ [ 5 , 3 ] ” .
All those accumulated numbers were then checked against the Benford ’s Law .
I ’ve used Matplotlib to plot the two curves ( the Benford ’s Law and the Twitter statuses digits distribution ) to empirically observe the correlation between them .
You can note in the upper right corner of the video , the Pearson ’s correlation between the two distributions too .
Here is the video ( I ’ve seen only after creating of the video , but the color of the curves are the inverse as seen in the legend ) :
The video represents the 15 minutes ( 3.160 captured statuses ) of the Twitter Public Timeline .
At the end of the video , you can see a Pearson ’s correlation of 0.95 .
It seems that we have found another Benford ’s son =)
The little tool to handle the Twitter Spritzer stream of data and plot the correlation graph in real - time was entirely written in Python , I ’ll do a clean - up and post it here soon I got time .
The tool has generated 1823 png images that were merged using ffmpeg .
I hope you enjoyed =)

The iTunes App Store is a force that seemingly can’t be stopped .
Today Apple announced that the app store had surpassed over 1.5 Billion downloads and now contains more than 65,000 apps from over 100,000 developers .
Impressively , downloads from the iTunes App Store are n’t just growing , they ’re accelerating .
It took Apple about 6 months to reach 500 Million downloaded apps while the next 500 Million downloads took only 3 months .
Since then , the app store has amassed 500 Million more downloads in less than 3 months .
By way of comparison , it took nearly 3 years before the Billionth song was downloaded from iTunes .
The iTunes App Store hit the Billion milestone after just 9 months .
Granted , many of the app store downloads are free , but the sheer volume is still impressive .
In the press release issued today , Steve Jobs noted ,
One summer weekend in 1989 , Arthur Whitney visited Ken Iverson at Kiln Farm and produced — on one page and in one afternoon — an interpreter fragment on the AT&T 3B1 computer .
I studied this interpreter for about a week for its organization and programming style ; and on Sunday , August 27 , 1989 , at about four o'clock in the afternoon , wrote the first line of code that became the implementation described in this document .
Arthur 's one - page interpreter fragment is as follows :
typedef char C; typedef long I ; typedef struct a {I t , r , d [ 3 ] , p[ 2 ] ;

Super - swimmer Michael Phelps returned to big - time advertising Sunday with a TV spot for Subway titled “ Be Yourself . ”
Oh , the irony .
Surely Phelps -- 14 - time Olympic gold medalist and endorsement juggernaut -- was being only himself , only human , when he was photographed in November hitting a bong at a party at the University of South Carolina .
That photograph , first published by the British tabloid News of the World in January , resulted in a three - month competition ban and cost Phelps a reported $ 500,000 deal with Kellogg .
The swimmer promptly issued a sniveling apology , copping to “ regrettable , ” “ inappropriate ” and “ youthful ” behavior ( does n’t the latter want to excuse the former ? ) .
Phelps , 24 , has more or less cheerfully dined on PR ashes ever since , in interviews with Matt Lauer , among others .
Interestingly , the apology from the world ’s fittest stoner infuriated proponents of legal weed , who saw the episode as a missed opportunity to advance the cause .
After all , if Aqua - Man smokes bud , how bad can it be ?
This is the greatest Olympian of all time , a man chandeliered with gold medals on the cover of Sports Illustrated .
His achievements mock the moral hysteria that traditionally rains down on marijuana .
Advertisement
The Subway ad itself is nothing special .
It ’s a compare - and - contrast between Phelps ’ glamorous life as a sports superstar and that of Jared Fogle , Subway ’s former - fatty mascot .
Jared prefers the low - fat sweet - onion Chicken Teriyaki sandwich , while metabolic dynamo Phelps dares to eat the foot - long Meatball Marinara with Jalapeno , containing 1,060 calories and more than 3,000 milligrams of sodium .
Eating these will not make you an Olympic swimmer .
A floating island , maybe .
Culture deconstructionists will pick the spot apart for oblique references to the scandal .
Phelps ’ chin whiskers are kind of bro-ish , for instance .
He does look a trifle baked ( could be the chlorine ) .
AdWeek ’s Eleftheria Parpis wrote that “ you can almost hear all the blunts lighting up in support as Sly & The Family Stone ’s ‘ Thank You ( Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin ) ’ kicks in . ”
And it really is too bad that the sandwich franchise ’s website is subwayfreshbuzz.com .

Even so , the Phelps - bong scandal seems to have been safely put to bed , and now that it has , it ’s worth asking , what have we learned ?
The consequences to Phelps -- actually , the lack of consequences -- suggest that something bigger than mere endorsement dollars is in play .
It seems Phelps has moved the weed needle .
Yes , USA Swimming , the sport ’s national governing body , suspended Phelps for three months , time he used to whip himself into shape after his post -Olympic bacchanal .
( The organization also withheld its monthly stipend , an amount that probably would n’t put gas in Phelps ’ Bentley . )
Yes , Kellogg declined to re-up with Phelps , but tellingly , other endorsement deals remained intact : Speedo , Omega , Subway and Mazda China .
Subway did n’t hesitate to stand by its man ( though it did postpone the current ad campaign six months to let the agita die down ) .
Mazda required Phelps to record a minute - long mea culpa directed at the people of China -- mortifying but harmless .
In June , Phelps inked a deal with H2O Audio , maker of high - end waterproof headphones .
In other words , there were no serious consequences .
To the extent that endorsement opportunities are a rough metric of how well someone in public life is liked , admired , respected , the bong - heard - round - the - world scandal might as well never have happened .
With the benefit of hindsight , Kellogg execs might well be kicking themselves .
Advertisement
You could ascribe the missing fallout to Phelps ’ incredible personal magnetism or -- far more likely -- to the fact that advertisers saw little downside to being associated with bong - meister Phelps .
Nor should they .
Across the board , marijuana is being steadily decriminalized and de-stigmatized .
In a Field Poll in May , 56 % of Californians favored legalization , slightly ahead of the roughly half of Americans who favor such a move .
Thirteen states have legalized medical marijuana , and three more are considering it .
In a dozen states , possession of less than an ounce of marijuana is not illegal .
One hundred million Americans have smoked pot , and about 14 million use it regularly , according to federal government studies .
U.S. Atty . Gen. Eric Holder has said the federal government would no longer raid California medical marijuana dispensaries .
Ethan Nadelmann , of the legalization - advocacy group Drug Policy Alliance , told the Associated Press last month : “ This is the first time I feel like the wind is at my back and not in my face . ”
I ’m sure , given the choice , Phelps would prefer not to be a milestone on the road to the marijuana ’s mainstreaming .
Still , what we ’re witnessing is the death of a certain kind of shame .
Advertisement
Advertising -- and that ’s what celebrity - athlete endorsements are -- is a highly sensitive antenna of culture .
Because it strives to reach , hold and please the greatest number of people , it represents a special threshold of cultural acceptance , the floorboards of the norm .
The return of brand Phelps says more about us than it does about him .

If you or I made a mistake on our income tax returns , did not disclose income and then were caught we ’d certainly have to pay up , perhaps pay a penalty and maybe face charges .
Recently , we ’ve seen public officials who not only did n’t pay their taxes , but they got appoinments even though it was revealed that they misrepresented their income on their taxes .
In some cases , it involves those who write tax law .
Charles Rangel is the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , which is House Committee “ has the responsibility for raising the revenue required to finance the Federal Government .
This includes individual and corporate income taxes , excise taxes , estate taxes , gift taxes , and other miscellaneous taxes . ”
Rangel was found to have not reported income of $ 75,000 on rental property .
He said it was a mistake .
He supposedly made restitution and the case was closed … or was it ?
Now , the Wall Street Journal brings to light that the Chairman “ amended ” his 2007 returns .
He somehow overlooked at least a half million dollars in assets and income .
It may be as high as $ 780,000 .
He somehow forgot about an account with something in between $ 250,000 and $ 500,000 .
He neglected to mention accounts at JPMorgan , Merrill Lynch , Oppenheimer and BlackRock .
He neglected to mention properties own in New Jersey .
He failed to mention a fair amount of shares in YUM Brands .
He ’s under investigation for using his letterhead for fundraising for a project that came to life due to a $ 1.9 million earmark funding from Congress ….gee .. wonder how that got in there ?
Anyway , is this the guy who you want in charge of writing tax law ?
Maybe the guy just is a lousy bookkeeper .
But , on the surface it would appear that something else is afoot .
Do you ever wonder how a guy on his salary can afford all of these investments .. if he gained this wealth before or after he was elected to Congress … how a guy says he’w worth between $ 500,000 and $ 1.3 million and now he says he made a mistake and his net worth is between a million and $ 2.5 million ?
If it walks like a duck …
Weather Bottom Line :
The initial front eased into the area on Friday night as expected .
In the afternoon , there was a localized cloud burst in Northeast Jefferson county and into Oldham County that supposedly brought up to 4 inches in a short time , but I can only find one rain gauge near prospect that registered over two inches .
Snow
White called me to tell me that the sunflowers were getting all kinds of great rain yet it did n’t rain where I was downtown .
Curiously , when I came home , I saw the results of a heavy rain except in my rain gauge which was dry .
Hmmm .. a stealth rain .
Anyway , the big front comes through today .
There may be enough residual moisture to kick off some showers but probably nothing signficant .
The real story will be the temperaturess .
Look for highs for Sunday , Monday and Tuesday in the low to mid 70’s .
Overnight lows will be in the 50’s with some people I betcha getting into the upper 40’s .
The warm up after that will not be quick but only back to the low 80 ’s by the end of the week .
A cat belonging to a US and Canada Better Business Bureau exec has been granted a high school diploma .
Yes , it 's an online high school .
According to a report by msnbc.com , the two - year - old feline graduated from Jefferson High School Online ( JHSO ) , an institution so confident in its pedagogical perfection that it offers a money - back guarantee .
Oreo is the cat 's name , and she lives in Macon , Georgia .
All Oreo needed to do to earn her ersatz sheepskin was answer 14 questions to determine her " elective and life experience credits " - including questions about her level of physical activity and her favorite musical genre - then take an online quiz , which she did with the help of her favorite human , Kelvin Collins , president and CEO of the Better Business Bureau of Central Georgia .
Oh , and there 's the $ 199 fee .
JHSO does n't ask much from its students .
In the Accounting category of the life - experience questions , for example , a drop - down menu lists " Basic " as a skill level below " Balance Check Book . "
What , we must ask , could be a more - basic accounting skill than balancing a checkbook ?
Sharpening a pencil , perchance ?
The quiz includes a series of multiple - choice questions - but unlike any test you ever took in school , this one includes a " JHSO Test Wizard " that offers hints should you answer any of the exceedingly simple questions incorrectly .
Each question offer four possible answers , and you have four tries - with hints - to get each of them correct .
Should that prove too challenging , the instructions soothingly remind you that " There is no specific time limit but remember that you are online and many things can occur during the time it takes you to complete the test . "
Many things , indeed , such as deciphering how a hint such as " Don ' [ sic ] get gassy ! " relates to a simple chemistry question .
Well , possibly even high school chemistry is tough if you 're a kitty like Oreo .
Should you have any questions about the value of a diploma from JHSO , an 850 - word essay explains the value of accreditation .
but buried near the end of its high - minded verbiage is the admission that " In an effort to keep program cost down and the current motivational based format of JHSO , JHSO has not sought nor been approved by the US DOE , CHEA or DETC organizations and does not represent itself to be an ' Accredited ' program of any of these organizations . "
And although the achievement of a JHSO diploma , according to the website , " can be used to advance in life and gain proof of your accomplishments , " the JHSO administration notes that " each individual employer and institution are [ sic ] unique and you should check with them prior to completing this program to make sure they will accept it ’s [ sic ] motivational and achievement basis . "
We can only assume that Oreo - even with the smarts to achieve a high school diploma - is n't sophisticated enough to perceive the irony of the company behind JHSO , MMDS Ltd , being located in the Carribean island of St. Kitts .
But Oreo paid too much for her diploma .
Another MMDS Ltd diploma mill , Vencer High School Online ( VHSO ) , offers the exact same service for a mere $ 174 .
Oreo could have saved twenty - five bucks .

The Dilemma
The Answer
The Fine Print
The Verdict
Being a hygiene - conscious person , after using the restroom in some swanky restaurant , you wash your hands .
Looking over , you see a rack of paper towels and an electic hand dryer .
The green part of your brain now has a conundrum .
Paper towels are from trees , and could be produced sustainabily , but the hand dryer 's not filling up the landfill .
And then there 's energy .
Your hands are wet !
What 's the best choice ?
There are two good studies comparing electric hand dryers and paper towels .
Both found similar conclusions , and in both , electric hand dryers came out ahead .
The discussion of one study had a good rebuttal from a paper science professor at the University of Washington , which we 'll address down in the fine print .
First off , let 's address one common misconception : for the most part , nobody 's cutting down trees just for paper towels .
Most paper towels you find in public bathrooms are made from recycled paper , and even those that are n't are made from industrial waste created in the manufacturing of regular paper .
Now , let 's talk about the studies .
Both followed what 's called " life cycle analysis " ( LCA ) , which means that they looked at the entire energy and waste for a product , from start to finish .
So , for paper towels , they start in a forest with logging , include processing transport , usage , disposal , and degradation in a landfill .
Analysis of the hand dryers includes creation of the dryer , electricity usage during use , and disposal .
The reason hand dryers came out ahead ended up having surprisingly little to do with the actual act of drying your hands .
Most of the emissions and contributions to greenhouse gases come from decomposition of the towels in a landfill .
The graph below shows the breakdown for paper and hand dryers .
It also turns out that paper 's particularly tricky , as there are a number of different types of paper and processes used to create it .
Since hand dryers came out ahead , we used the most ecologically friendly sort of paper studied , to be in the safe side in all of our calculations .
This study , published by Salon , looked at the electricity usage of the electric hand dryer and the logging , recycling , and processing of paper , as well as the manufacture , transport , and disposal of garbage bags for the paper towel system .
For energy calculations on the electric hand dryer , the study took into account two different wattages of hand dryer , an average electrical grid , and 30 second or one minute run time .
For paper production , generic emissions values based on the whole paper industry were used .
Similarly , average energy per dollar cost data is used for garbage bag production , paper towel transport , and waste disposal .
Waste disposal is calculated purely based on cost per weight and emissions per dollar of disposal .
It was assumed that 2 paper towels constitute one use .
These results showed that depending on the dryer used and its run time , the emissions were anywhere between 9 and 40g CO2 per use ( 9 - 20 for 30 seconds , which is one button press ) .
Using two paper towels emitted 56g CO2 .
The second study was conducted by Environmental Resources Management .
It 's important to note that the report was commissioned by a manufacturer of electric dryers .
However , the study was done by an independent third party and arrived at similar conclusions to the study done by The Climate Conservancy , so we include it for completeness ' sake .
This study was similar to the Conservancy study , but also included materials for the dryer , the paper towel dispenser , and the garbage bin .
It assumed 500 uses per week , a 5 year lifespan for both systems , and a 30 second run of the hand dryer vs. 2 paper towels .
It looked at 4 different sets of paper towel data , one from the SCA Environmental Report and 3 from PEMS4 : bleached paper , unbleached paper , and ETH paper ( the type with the lowest emissions ) .
The report judged the two systems in Non-Renewable Resource Depletion , Global Warming Potential , Acidification , Ecotoxicity , Human Toxicity , Nitrification , Ozone Depletion , and Smog .
The electric dryer system won out in all categories except Resource Depletion ( paper is considered a renewable resource ) .
Professor Lewis pointed out a flaw in Climate Conservancy study : the authors did not account for the emissions saved by using recycled paper and industrial waste to produce the paper towels .
This omission does skew the results , but can we can account for it .
Since using recycled raw materials to produce paper saves about 60 % of the energy needed ( according to the US DOE ) , we can simply discount the energy used in production by 60 % .
Accounting for this improvement , when looking at Global Warming Potential , the dryer still beats out the best paper system by better than 20 % .
Like all life - cycle analyses , this one 's a bit messy , but no studies appear to support the use of paper towels over a hand dryer .
Even in the best paper cases , hand dryers come out ahead .
To top it off , if a business uses 100 % clean energy , the impact and emissions from a hand dryer become a orders of magnitude better than those for paper towels .
So the next time you 're standing with drippy hands and a dilemma on the wall , you can choose the hand dryer , and let the green part of your brain breathe freely .
That 's this week 's showdown !

Fixed the link to second study .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
The problem bank list is just about the only part of the industry that 's growing right now .
The sector 's financial problems , outlined by regulators in excruciating detail on Thursday , could speed a shakeout that already has slashed banks ' ranks by almost half over two decades .
" We could end up with a couple thousand fewer banks within a few years , " said Terry Moore , managing director of consulting firm Accenture 's North American banking practice .
" You could say we 're overbanked right now . "
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Thursday that U.S. banks lost $ 3.7 billion in the second quarter .
Bad loans are growing faster than institutions are setting aside in reserves for future losses , while total lending has declined for four straight quarters .
The list of troubled institutions -- those deemed to pose at least a " distinct possibility " of failure -- rose by more than a third during the second quarter , to 416 .
The FDIC does n't reveal the names of banks on the problem list .
Anticipating rising costs of dealing with troubled banks , the FDIC on Wednesday formalized new rules for private equity firms and other investors buying failed banks .
There has been a heavy trade in failed banks lately , given that 81 institutions have been closed in 2009 and dozens more are expected to be shut over the next year .
The quick pace of failures has already rewarded some prescient bankers .
" We were preparing for this moment for maybe two and a half years , " said Norman C. Skalicky , CEO of Stearns Bank , a closely held St. Cloud , Minn. , institution that has acquired four banks from the FDIC this year .
" The biggest mistake we made was not getting ready a year earlier . "
Bank failures are n't the only driver of consolidation .
While bank mergers fell to 89 in the first half of 2009 from their recent peak of 153 in the first half of 2007 , growth - minded banks such as First Niagara ( FNFG ) in Lockport , N.Y. , are looking for opportunities to expand .
" We are always working with our eyes wide open , " said John Koelmel , CEO of First Niagara , which last month announced the acquisition of Harleysville National ( HNBC ) of Philadelphia .
" Our shopping cart is n't full . "
The shopping spree ahead -- Moore says the U.S. could lose 2,000 banks by the end of 2012 -- is likely to claim some well known regional banks .
Colonial BancGroup of Alabama and Guaranty Financial Group of Texas have failed over the past month .
Chicago condominium lender Corus Bankshares ( CORS ) has been on death watch for some time .
Judging by stock prices , investors are still questioning the prospects of KeyCorp ( KEY , Fortune 500 ) of Cleveland , Marshall & Ilsley ( MI ) of Milwaukee and Regions Financial ( RF , Fortune 500 ) of Alabama .
But the bulk of consolidation is likely to come at the expense of smaller banks , whose numbers have been dwindling for decades in the face of deregulation and technological advances that disproportionately aided bigger competitors .
The number of banks with less than $ 100 million in assets has dropped by more than 5,000 since 1992 , according to a study released this year by banking consultancy Celent .
Even more pronounced has been the small banks ' loss of deposits .
Small banks ' share of the U.S. deposit market plunged to 2 % last year from almost 13 % in 1992 , according to Celent data .
" The world is only getting more complex , " Celent analyst Bart Narter wrote , noting ever - increasing regulatory paperwork and new businesses such as Internet banking .
" Small banks are overwhelmed . "
That said , small banks are n't going away .
Policymakers such as FDIC chief Sheila Bair have emphasized their importance in lending to small businesses , and studies have found they tend to pay better deposit rates than bigger rivals .
The FDIC on Wednesday extended a program that some community bankers credit with helping them to compete with the biggest banks .
And the smallest banks have generally performed better during the financial crisis than their bigger rivals .
Banks with less than $ 100 million in assets make up more than a third of the FDIC 's problem bank list , but have accounted for just 11 of 81 bank failures so far this year .
Like their bigger rivals , community banks are now enjoying stronger profit margins in the second quarter , as the spread between the rates banks pay depositors and those they charge to lend to borrowers widened .
" This is good news for community banks , since three - fourths of their revenues come from net interest income , " Bair said Thursday .

It is time for the international community to intervene and expresses its outrage and disgust at Israeli murder for the purpose of bodysnatching .
Palestinians are extremely outraged by the news which many of them had heard of previously , but which has now been confirmed by a neutral Swedish paper about the Israeli policy of deliberately murdering Palestinians to steal their internal organs .
This was revealed only few weeks after the arrests in the United States of several prominent Jewish figures , including rabbis , who were caught dealing in the gruesome ‘ business ’ of buying human body parts from Israel and selling them in the USA .
The Palestinian Association in Sweden which represents more than 30,000 Swedish Palestinians has sent a letter to the Aftonbladet newspaper , expressing their appreciation of its brave reporters ’ efforts in revealing yet another dark face of the Jewish fascist state .
The association also voiced its appreciation of the Swedish government ’s brave position in standing up against the standard Zionist blackmail tactics , which have seen Sweden accused of anti-Semitism ; this is a ploy used by Zionists for several decades now , but one which fortunately no longer works .
According to the Swedish paper svenska Dagebladet 65 percent of the Swedes rejects that Sweden apologize to Israel .
Sweden made it clear that the report which revealed the macabre Jewish enterprise in Palestine is part of the press freedom of Sweden .
It must be remembered that Sweden was the first European country targeted by Jewish state terrorism which killed Kunt Bernadotte the member of the Swedish royal family and the head of the UN delegation to Palestine in 1948 .
Confirming the reports carried in Aftonbladet , Palestinian researcher Al - Farawne said that the murder of Palestinians by Israelis in order to steal their organs has been going on for decades .
Al Farawne also revealed that hundreds of Palestinians ’ bodies were returned to their families days , months and some times over a year after being murdered .
When the bodies were returned , however , they were discovered to be missing vital internal organs .
The lack of morality in these crimes , as in all the crimes against humanity which Israel commits against Palestine , is obvious .
Such crimes are in concord with the Zionist culture which assumes that Jews are more worthy than non-Jews .
This is the rationale which allows Zionists to commit such crimes without any feelings of guilt .
This fits within the framework of Rabbi Abraham Koch ’s directives which state that non-Jews living under Jewish law in Eretz Yisrael ( the Land of Israel ) must either be enslaved as water carriers and wood hewers , or banished , or exterminated )
Arab Knesset Member Muhammad Baraka revealed that there are more than 600 killed Palestinians ’ bodies buried in what Israel calls ‘ the number graveyards ’ , which were created for freedom fighters Palestinians killed in combat with the Israeli army .
Baraka has demanded that Israel return the bodies to their families , but Palestinian sources expressed profound skepticism that Israel would return any of the bodies before they were entirely decomposed , since doing so before then might reveal the Israelis ’ crimes in stealing body parts from them .
In the view of the Palestinian politicians and intellectuals whom I spoke to about these crimes , it is difficult to imagine that such atrocities could take place without the consent of the higher authorities in the Zionist state .
In these prominent Palestinian officials ’ and thinkers ’ views , there must be cooperation between doctors , hospitals , transport and high - ranking military officers to carry out such acts , suggesting that such incidents are not isolated since this would involve many sectors .
If Israel thinks that these are just allegations , then it must accept an international investigation into these crimes .
Those who I spoke to , however , expressed major doubts that Israel would allow any international committee to investigate these crimes .
Precisely because of Israel ’s reluctance to allow any inquiry into these despicable acts , several Palestinian human rights organizations are demanding an immediate international investigation into this new crime .
Palestinians fear that Israel will reject any international investigation committee , just as it did in its crimes against Jenin and Gaza when it , yet again , went against international wishes in flatly rejecting any inquiry .
I asked one Palestinian politician whether Palestinians would be satisfied with an Israeli investigation .
His answer was an emphatic No .
This is a form of cannibalism and the highest form of terror .
There is no Palestinian who trusts Israel and leaving the investigation to it is like giving a murderer the right to investigate his crime .
Zionists will hide and deny it as they have with 60 years of systematic crimes they committed in Palestine .
We need the UN to investigate it before it is forgotten , the politician said , not hiding his disgust at this crime .
The reason that Israel continues committing crimes against humanity is because it knows that it can escape the international pressure that would be put on other nations for doing the same thing .
The more it evades justice , the more it murders , knowing that it will go unpunished .
Therefore the UN must send a strong message to the Zionist State that the age of Burke and Hare murder and bodysnatching is over .
Note : William Burke and William Hare are 19th century Scots murderers who killed people to sell their bodies to hospitals .

You can easily Undo mistakes in Photoshop , but that 's not the case in the real world , especially with Tattoos .
I think one of the hardest jobs is being a Tattoo Artist , because there 's simply no room for mistakes .
Tattoos are Forever and too bad for these guys ( willingly or not ) ' coz their skins are now home to the world 's most hideous tattoos !
I think this Patriots tatt was done by a 6 - yr .
Old .
I 'm not sure if his girlfriend would appreciate this .
Opposites do attract .
I feel bad for this guy .
This is some Exorcist sh*t right here .
I 'm kinda in the fence with this one , the tattoo's not that ugly , it 's drawn pretty well and the placement is SPOT - ON ( pun intended ) !
So KIDS , THINK BEFORE YOU INK !
Be Excited !
Michael Tomasky has a nice piece on what I 've come to call " the dull reality of change " :
So now , liberals have to fight hard for something they 're not terribly excited about .
A health bill will likely have a very weak public option or it wo n't have one at all .
But liberals will have to battle for that bill as if it 's life and death ( which in fact it will be for thousands of Americans ) , because its defeat would constitute a historic victory for the birthers and the gun-toters and the Hitler analogists .
In the coming weeks , building toward a possible congressional vote in November , progressives will have to get out in force to show middle America that there 's support for reform as well as opposition , even though they may find the final bill disappointing .
This is what movements do – they do the hard , slow work of winning political battles and changing public opinion over time .
It is n't fun .
It is n't something Will .i.am is going to make a clever and moving video about , and it offers precious few moments for YouTube .
It takes years , which is a bummer , in a political culture that measures success and failure by the hour .
The end of euphoria should lead not to disillusionment , but to seriousness of purpose .
I 'd go a step further than Tomasky :
The upside of health - care reform is not that it 's a defeat for the reactionaries .
Rather , the upside of health - care reform is health - care reform .
Four years ago , when the public option did n't exist as a popular policy concept , liberals would have been thrilled with the legislation we 're seeing today .
It 's better than anything the major Democrats proposed in the primary , much less anything that passed four committees in Congress .
I keep recommending this Families USA brief ( pdf , but worth it ! ) outlining the 10 most important elements of health - care reform .
The public option is one of them , to be sure , and I think there 's a substantial chance it will be present in the final legislation .
But what about the expansion of Medicaid to 133 percent of the poverty line ?
That 's a solid 20 million poor Americans who do n't have coverage now , and will soon .
What about the out - of - pocket caps , so no one goes medically bankrupt ever again ?
Or the assurance that no insurer can ever discriminate based on a preexisting condition ?
Or the subsidies for working Americans who can't quite afford coverage ?
Or the requirements that insurers spend more money on medical care and less money on premiums ?
Or the guarantee that the gruesome practice of rescission will finally end ?
Obviously , there are a hundred ways that reform is going to fall short of not only perfection , but sufficiency .
And the political compromises required to pass anything will dispiriting and inane .
But it 's worth keeping in mind that this bill is going to help a lot of people .
Tens of millions .
Hundreds of millions over the course of a few decades .
It will mean that some of the very worst things that can happen to someone -- medical bankruptcy , or a cancer that strikes when someone is uninsured -- will , by and large , simply stop happening .
That 's worth being excited about .

Every household in the country is sitting on paper losses of almost £ 1,000 so far on bailouts for Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group , it was disclosed today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
UK Financial Investments Limited ( UKFI ) , which manages public stakes in the two banks , said every household had more than £ 3,000 invested in Lloyds and RBS shares .
But the £ 34.5 billion currently invested had shrunk to £ 23.6 billion as of June 30 - a 32 per cent paper loss of £ 10.9 billion , equivalent to about £ 950 per household .
The taxpayer is still deeply in the red despite a relative recovery in bank stocks in recent months .
In February the shares were showing losses of £ 18.1 billion .
The figures came as UKFI published its first annual report and strategy for selling the public stakes in the ailing banks - although it warned an exit could take several years .
The taxpayer currently owns 70 per cent of RBS and 43 per cent of Lloyds , but after extra shares are issued under a scheme to insure the banks ' toxic debts , this will rise to 84 per cent and 62 per cent respectively .
Acting UKFI chairman Glen Moreno said : " Make no mistake - this ain't over yet .
We are a long way away from normalcy in the world 's financial markets . "
Mr Moreno said the body 's aim was to achieve " sound , prudent and profitable banks " , and added : " UKFI is not , I repeat not , a short - term investor . "
Chief executive John Kingman , the senior Treasury official who led negotiations with the banks over the rescue , said the public " rightly expected " to get their money back .

Mr Kingman said he could not " sensibly answer " questions over when the stakes would be sold , although the body was not " currently working " on any transactions .
He said that moves to sell too early would mean a poorer deal for taxpayers , adding : " This will not and can not be a short term game . "
UKFI will consider sales to major institutional investors - which can be organised quickly - and sales to private shareholders , as well as selling bonds which can be transferred into shares in the two banks at a later date .
But the annual report adds : " While there have been some encouraging signs recently , it is in our view too early to make a judgment that the conditions are right for a share sale . "
The report estimates that when additional shares relating to the asset protection scheme - the taxpayer - backed insurance scheme for the toxic debts of both banks - are included , the value of the investments UKFI manages will rise to £ 60 billion at current prices .
It warned " we may need to undertake several transactions in each bank 's shares over a period of years to complete our exit " .
But an upturn in investor demand and a return to health for the banking sector and economy as a whole " could create selling opportunities " , it said .
" Sales under these circumstances seem likely to be consistent with our objectives of delivering value to the taxpayer and of maintaining financial stability , " it added .
UKFI , which came under fire for approving RBS boss Stephen Hester 's potential £ 9.6 million pay package , said it had implemented " perhaps the most far - reaching reforms to remuneration structures of any large banks in the world " .
Mr Hester , whose pay deal included a £ 1.2 million basic salary , has said he will defer part of his payment for a further two years after concerns were raised by investors .

Tallahassee , FL – The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Florida today filed a friend - of - the - court brief opposing the state 's decision to force a pregnant woman to remain hospitalized against her will .
" Women do not give up their right to determine the course of their own medical care when they become pregnant , " said Diana Kasdan , a staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project .
" Faced with similar cases , courts throughout the country have made clear that pregnant women have a right to make decisions about their own health , including refusing medical care . "
In March 2009 , the Circuit Court of Leon County ordered Samantha Burton – a mother of two suffering from pregnancy complications – to be indefinitely confined to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital and forced to undergo any and all medical treatments deemed necessary to save her fetus .
After three days of state - compelled hospitalization , Ms. Burton suffered fetal demise and was released from the hospital .
" We should all be alarmed by Florida 's wholly unwarranted intervention in Samantha Burton 's care , " said Randall Marshall , Legal Director of the ACLU of Florida .
" Not only is it unconstitutional for the state to override a pregnant woman 's decision to refuse medical treatment , but the medical community , including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , the American Medical Women 's Association , and the American Medical Association , strongly advises against it . "
According to the ACLU 's brief , " [ I ] f the decision below stands , it invites State requests for court intervention in nearly all aspects of pregnant women 's behavior and medical judgments .
In turn , some women will be discouraged from coming to a hospital for pregnancy care if they know that any disagreement may lead to forced medical treatment .
Such a result does not advance maternal and fetal health by any measure and is not constitutionally permissible . "
The today 's brief was filed in the District Court of Appeal , First District , State of Florida , on behalf of the ACLU , the ACLU of Florida , and the American Medical Women 's Association .
Today 's case is Burton v. Florida , No. ID09 - 1958 .
Lawyers on the ACLU 's friend - of - the - court brief include Kasdan of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project ; and Marshall of the ACLU of Florida .

I guess I do n't understand the question .
Is Santa God ?
There are lots of stories surrounding the celebration of the winter solstice that have become Christianized - and there is a huge amount of tripe we feed our kids that we know is not true .
Or are you a firm believer in the tooth fairy ?
As far as kids and presents are concerned , Santa and Christ are ... unrelated .
If you 're Christian and you have children , as an experiment , ask them how the two are related .
Do you really think any kid is going to say that Santa was sent by God ?
Maybe if prompted for it - but most kids will associate Santa with presents , Santa and elves , Santa and reindeer , Santa and any number of products being hawked at the time - but not Santa and Christ , or Santa and God .
As an agnostic , yes , I celebrate Christmas , and no , I do n't tell the kids around me that Santa does n't exist .
Nor do I tell them which God to believe in .
And that 's OK because they do n't ask .
What they believe in , in the long run , is up to them .
The growing effort to couch scaling back healthcare reform efforts as some kind of solution , and remarkably as what Ted Kennedy would have wanted , brought to mind a fantastic post Jonathon Cohn wrote Monday at The Treatment , Scaling Back Reform : Dumb Policy , Dumber Politics .
He wrote it in response to Kent Conrad 's Sunday show appearances , in which he delivered the same message " he 's been delivering for a while :
It 's time to scale back health care reform .
" It 's going to have to be significantly less than what we 've heard talked about , " Conrad said . "
Still , it 's safe to assume some of the advocates for scaling back are thinking about politics , too .
And not without reason .
After a rough month in which talk of " death panels " filled the airwaves and polls showed voters growing gradually more disenchanted with the administration 's handling of health care , these people undoubtedly figure it's a safer political bet -- that a smaller reform package will ultimately prove more popular .
But would it really ?
As I 've written previously , the legislation that 's made it through committee has already been " scaled back . "
In order to keep the price tag at or below $ 1 trillion over ten years , Democrats had to write bills that would roll out reforms slowly , over several years , so that a new system was not fully in place until 2013 or later .
That 's a long time to wait for change , particularly if you 're one of the unlucky souls who ends up without insurance -- or with inadequate insurance -- when illness strikes ....
Put aside , for a moment , whether [ scaling back ] makes sense substantively .
It makes absolutely no sense politically .
Scaling down legislation basically means gutting the benefits that would go to the working and middle class .
In other words , it would help fulfill the fear many of these voters already have and that opponents of reform have tried hard to stoke :
That reform does n't have much to offer the typical middle - income American .
You can imagine why Republicans might think this is a dandy idea .
But why on earth would Democrats agree ?
Cohn 's analysis of the substance of the various pieces of legislation is very good , and I recommend you read the whole thing .
But his take on the politics is one that we see too infrequently from the analysts .
Digby has a similar , and more trenchant , take :
This is , of course , assuming the Democrats actually want to pass their own agenda .
If they do n't , this behavior is merely political malpractice , whereby they allow themselves to be trapped into opposing their own initiatives and being blamed for their failure .
In this case , you get crappy health care reform and look like a bunch of sell - out losers in the eyes of the American people .
Heads you lose , tails they win .
I 've always said that the Republicans are an extremely effective opposition party and manage to advance their agenda even when they do n't have institutional power , but this is ridiculous .
If this works , they will never have to work to win another election --- the corporate Democrats will do their dirty work for them and they can just sit on the sidelines lobbing tea bags until it becomes clear to the American people that no matter how bad the Republicans are , they can't possibly be as lame as the Democrats .
Passing a strong , comprehensive healthcare reform bill ?
Smart policy , smarter politics .
Deep in the outer realms of our solar system , well over a billion kilometers away , something bizarre happened at Saturn 's F ring .
I mean , seriously : what the hell happened here ?
This is one of the latest pictures returned from the remarkable human achievement that is the Cassini spacecraft , a probe the size of a school bus that has been orbiting the ringed planet since 2004 .
It 's returned one incredible picture after another , and lately -- as Saturn 's orbit has brought it to a point where the rings are nearly edge - on to the Sun -- things have gotten not only spectacular but also really weird .
The rings are incredibly thin , only a few meters in thickness despite being hundreds of thousands of kilometers across .
Over the past few months , as the Sun shines almost straight into the rings ( instead of down on them ) , every bump and irregularity sticks out like , well , like a tree in the desert .
Weird gravitational effects from Saturn 's fleet of moons tune and resonate the countless particles making up the rings , creating beautiful waves and ripples .
But this , this is something new .
It 's not exactly clear what 's going on here , even in this slightly zoomed shot .
But it looks for all the world - or worlds -- like some small object on an inclined orbit has punched through Saturn 's narrow F ring , bursting out from underneath , and dragging behind it a wake of particles from the rings .
The upward - angled structure is definitely real , as witnessed by the shadow it 's casting on the ring material to the lower left .
And what 's with the bright patch right where this object seems to have slammed in the rings ?
Did it shatter millions of icy particles , revealing their shinier interior material , making them brighter ?
Clearly , something awesome and amazing happened here .
My first inclination ( haha !
Inclination !
As always , I slay me ) is to say that there is n't enough material in the rings to create what amounts to a hydrodynamic wake behind a moving object .
When you move through air you leave a wake behind you , but there are gazillions of particles per cubic centimeter in the Earth 's air at sea level .
I would think that even in Saturn 's ring , the density of particles would n't be enough to support a phenomenon like this .
But apparently , I 'm wrong .
Without doing a full - blown hydrodynamic calculation it's hard to say what 's possible and what is n't .
Cassini scientists are currently doing just that , in order to better understand what this odd image is trying to tell us .
And I have to wonder : is this a common occurrence ?
Is this object on an orbit that intersects the rings so that it plunges up through them and then again down into them every time it circles Saturn ?
If so , how does that affect the rings overall , especially over millions of years ?
Or was this a singular event , some small object whose orbit was affected by a nearby massive moon , changing its path , putting it on a collision course with Saturn 's mighty and vast ring system ?
That seems awfully unlikely ... ... but when it comes to this weird , weird place , I 've learned my intuition is monumentally inadequate .
Nature , it turns out , has a far greater imagination than any mere human .
We are fated , I think , to watch Nature unfold before us and try to figure it out after the fact .
But oh , is n't that the joy of science ?
By
We ’ve been talking about how health care reform could spread to dentistry , and we ’ve learned that dentists are almost totally opposed to any sort of universal dental care plan in the U.S .
Most doctors feel nationalized dental care would lead to higher bureaucratic costs and a lower standard of care .
But that ’s not the only threat on the health care horizon .
The proposed health care reforms will have a dramatic effect on small business owners … that ’s you , doctor .
It ’s time to get ready for a tax increase …
They ’ve proposed paying for health care changes by essentially putting a surcharge of anywhere from 1 % up to about 5.4 % on your personal income .
Plus , Congress is looking at increasing your taxable base for Social Security .
Are you making $ 300 K ?
Then your taxes will go up .
Do you and your spouse pull in $ 1 M a year ?
Then prepare for up to a 5.4 % tax increase just to pay for other people ’s health care .
And the House Democrat plan would also impose a penalty of 8 % of payroll if employers do not offer health insurance .
And the more successful you are , the more you ’re penalized for growing your business and employing people .
Believe me , I feel your pain , because I ’m in the same boat myself .
This weekend , my wife Suzanne and I sat down to do a little financial planning .
Between federal and state taxes ( we live in the bankrupt state of California ) , we predict we ’re going to be paying an extra 10 % .
It seems to me that the American dream is n’t what it used to be .
It ’s getting to where the only way to make it in America is to make it BIG – that is , you ’re 120 % successful , or else you ’re squeezed into the middle class – which wo n’t be what it used to be .
When people say we should “ tax the rich , ” I know they ’re talking about me and Suzanne and other entrepreneurs like us .
We ’re proud of our small business .
We employ a number of people , and we ’ve been doing well enough that we ’ve even been hiring during the recession .
But why should we go through all this work to expand our company when we ’re going to be penalized 10 % ?
I ’ll tell you , folks – sometimes numbers like that make it hard to stay motivated !
What do you think ?
Here are some highlights from other dentists ’ comments :
“ It is really very simple — no one values what they do not have to pay for personally . ” ( Dr. Julian Gray , DDS )
“ How will the young graduates of U.S. dental programs be able to pay back their educational loans if we are under a socialized health care state ?
Will the dental education become free under Obama ’s plan ? ” ( Dr. Mark Collins , DDS )
“ What in the world happened to our country ?
Where are private property , liberty , and pursuit of happiness in this ‘ Atlas Shrugged ’ world the leftists are trying to create ?
Why does the growing entitlement class created by Democrats think they are entitled to my life ’s work and energy ?
I feel like Charlton Heston in Planet of the Apes !
Good God , what are they doing to our country ! ? ” ( Denver doctor )
Despite grim predictions , most major U.S. companies have reported positive earnings for the second quarter of 2009 .
Given how wrong past predictions have been , the fact that earnings have blown away expectations should n’t be so surprising .
Still , the numbers are genuinely impressive : More than 73 % of the companies that have reported so far have beaten earnings estimates — and stocks have rightly rallied .
Yes , profits are down sharply from a year ago , but this is in the context of ...
Major developing story : Matt Goldstein over at Reuters may have just broken a story that could spell doom for if not the entire Goldman Sachs program trading group , then at least those who deal with " low latency ( microseconds ) event - driven market data processing , strategy , and order submissions . "
Visions of swirling , gray storm clouds over Goldman 's SLP and hi- fi traders begin to form .
Back - up :
This week 's NYSE Program Trading report was very odd : not only because program trading hit 48.6 % of all NYSE trading , a record high at least since the NYSE keep tabs of this data , and a data point which in itself was startling enough to cause some serious red flags as I jaunt from village to village in what little is left of Europe 's bison country , but what was shocking was the disappearance of the # 1 mainstay of complete trading domination ( i.e. , Goldman Sachs ) from not just the aforementioned # 1 spot , but the entire complete list .
In other words : Goldman went from 1st to N/ A in one week .
Even more odd , this " disappearance " comes hot on the heels of what Zero Hedge reported could be potentially a major change to the way the NYSE provides its weekly program trading report .
Of course , Ray over at the NYSE immediately replied to Zero Hedge that all was going to be same as always ...
Odd , maybe he meant that all is back to normal except the reporting of Goldman 's trades .
Either way , it might very well be time for proactive readers to again contact the two employees publicly disclosed by the NYSE as lead - contacts on the issue .
Readers will recall that it was these same two who were previously steadfastly assuring anyone who would listen that there would be no change at all in data reporting .
Robert Airo , Senior Vice President , NYSE Euronext at ( 212 ) 656-5663 or
Aleksandra Radakovic , Vice President , NYSE Regulation at ( 212 ) 656-4144
Alas , the just released weekly data proves that either theirs was a material misrepresentation of facts , or Goldman simply suddenly decided to stop transacting with the NYSE , or , what would be even more sinister , Goldman notified the NYSE to scrap all their trading data from the prior week .
Why would they do that ?
Going back to Matt Goldstein 's story .
In a nutshell , on Friday , one Sergey Aleynikov was arrested at Newark airport by FBI agents , as he was coming back from a trip to Chicago ( maybe visiting his new employer ) , on what are basically industrial espionage charges .
Sergey , or Serge as his Linked - In account identifies him , was VP of equity strategy over at 85 Broad ( or maybe 1 New York Plaza , his detailed Bloomberg Bio page has disappeared ) had the following responsibilities at Goldman Sachs according to Linked - In :
• Lead development of a distributed real - time co-located high - frequency trading ( HFT ) platform .
The main objective was to engineer a very low latency ( microseconds ) event - driven market data processing , strategy , and order submission engine .
The system was obtaining multicast market data from Nasdaq , Arca / NYSE , CME and running trading algorithms with low latency requirements responsive to changes in market conditions .
• Implemented a real - time monitoring solution for the distributed trading system using a combination of technologies ( SNMP , Erlang / OTP , boost , ACE , TibcoRV , real - time distributed replicated database , etc ) to monitor load and health of trading processes in the mother - ship and co-located sites so that trading decisions can be prioritized based on congestion and queuing delays .
• Responsible for development of real - time market feed handlers , order processing engines and trading tools at a Quantitative Equity Trading revenue - making HFT desk .
If the allegations are true , it looks like Goldman 's hi- fi quant trading desk was thoroughly penetrated by a " spy " , and as readers will recall , Serge (y ) 's description of his job duties mirrors what Mr. Ed Canaday conveniently provided to Zero Hedge as a description of Goldman 's SLP program .
( Sources connected with the office of the United States Attorney have confirmed to Zero Hedge that Aleynikov was at one time or another a Goldman employee . " ) .
The plot thickens : per FBI agent Michael McSwain 's sworn deposition , Sergey quit a firm described as " Financial Institution " in the affidavit , which according to circumstantial evidence and according to Goldstein is none other than Goldman Sachs , on June 5 , at that time earning $ 400,000 annually .
As Matt reports , he proceeded to move to a Chicago firm engaged in " high volume automated trading " where he would make 3 x his $ 400 k salary ( Hey Getco , is it time for a formal release at least denying you guys had anything to do with this , cause if you did it might not look that hot .
No matter , we have reached out to our sources in law enforcement to confirm or deny Getco's , and Goldman 's , involvement : once we get a response we will immediately advise our readers ) .
In the 5 days immediately preceeding his departure from " Financial Institution " ( potentially GS ) , Sergey allegedly downloaded 32 megs of ultra top - secret quant trading proprietary code , that , according to Special Agent McSwain 's affidavit , he then proceeded to encrypt and upload to a website in Germany , with a UK owner .
One can only imagine the value of this " code " not only to Goldman but to the highest bidder .
After all , from the affidavit : " certain features of the [ code ] , such as speed and efficiency by which it obtains and processes market data , The Financial Institution further believes that , " Needless to say , many others are now also likely hot on the trail of the code .
What is probably most notable , in less than a month since Sergey 's departure from [ Goldman ? ] , the FBI was summoned to task and the alleged saboteur was arrested and promptly gagged : if anyone is amazed by the unprecedented speed of this investigative process , you are not alone .
If only the FBI were to tackle cases of national security and loss of life with the same speed and precision as they confront presumed high - frequency program trading industrial espionage cases ... especially those that allegedly involve Goldman Sachs .
Now the real question here is , does [ GS ? ] feel lucky ?
Because the code has supposedly been in the hands of an outsider for over a month , one might suspect that anyone who wanted to has had ample opportunity - if the holder (s ) wished to sell ...
Would that have anything to do with the even weirder than usual market action over the past 2 - 3 weeks : after all it is the very Goldman Sachs ( which may or may not be the target of this program trading industrial espionage ) which is the primary SLP on the world 's biggest stock exchange .
Another major question : do Goldman and the NYSE not have a fiduciary responsibility to announce to both shareholders and any interested parties if there has been a major security breach in their trading operations ?
Certainly this seems like a material piece of information : given that program trading accounted for 49 % of all NYSE trading last week , and Goldman as recently as one week ago represented about 60 % of all principal program trading , will this be called an issue threatening the National Security of the United States .
Should n't all market participants be aware that there is some rogue code in cyberspace that can be abused by the highest bidder , who very likely will not be interested in proving the efficient market hypothesis ?
What will happened when said bidder goes about trying to front run none other than the " Financial Institution " [ GS ] ?
The complete affidavit can be downloaded from this post here , and is also provided Scribed below as this could ( and likely should ) become a matter of National Security .
Zero Hedge will closely monitor this situation from the European hinterland and provide updates as they come .
For really interested readers , we recommend tracking any potentially new developments on the forums and message boards over at Wilmott .
major hat tip Matt Goldstein of Reuters
I ’ve been playing with Google Insights .
It ’s a great toy .
It measures ‘ search intensity ’ .
The number of searches being made for a certain term .
Off the back of the recent timeline of global media scare stories , I got curious about what searches actually look like .
For example , the search “ violent video games ” reveals a very distinct pattern .
Why that distinct pattern ?
If you add the dates , it clarifies things :
Every April and November the issue flares up .
Why ?
April 20th is the anniversary of the Columbine Massacre .
Though dimishing , the echoes of that event still reverberate through the group mind .
Not sure about the November peak ?
Maybe because Christmas video games are announced ?
Face Off
A cool thing about Insights .
You can pile multiple search terms into the interface and force them into a face off .
A bit like putting a fly and a spider and an earwig in a bottle .
You ’ve done that , right ?
I like this one for putting the Twitter hype in perspective .
It ’s also good for the settling of age old conflicts .
( Though , technically , the results for ‘ apple ’ might get some noise for people searching for the popular fruit online )
Why those big peaks ?
Hahah .
Brilliant .
Those peaks occur at the height of summer in July .
Though there was a considerable dip in 2007 .
Bad summer then ?
Maybe we could map these to global temperatures to make a more human ( and tasty ) barometer of weather fluctuations .
Maybe future super - ironic generations will use searches for “ ice cream ” as climate records ?
ANYWAY .
Insights a great fun tool for scoping patterns in data or to rate preferencess – or even to help with personal decisions .
Have a play .
Let me know any cool stuff you come up with .
Energy Storage - Methods - Efficiencies Methods of Storing different types of Energy
As an introductory comment , we will mention from the discussion below that a standard car battery can contain around 80 Ampere - hours of stored electricity , at around 12 volts , which totals around 1 kiloWatt - hour of electricity .
It might seem like a lot , but you buy 1 kWh of electricity for around a dime !
It actually costs you about 15 cents due to Delivery costs and assorted taxes , but the point here is that the spectacular claims of batteries and electric vehicles , are VERY exaggerated !
We can show why gasoline is so popular by noting that a single gallon of gasoline contains about 40 kWh of chemical energy in it .
So we might start by noting that a single gallon of gasoline might be compared to FORTY car batteries regarding gross chemical energy storage !
Somewhat different than most people think !
For comparison purposes , we will consider an amount of energy equal to one million Btus or 300 kWh .
This is about the amount of heat energy needed to heat a medium - sized home in a northern climate for one cold winter day , or for about ten days of electricity for a house ( NOT heated with electricity ! ) .
First , let 's consider the " normal " ways of storing energy ( essentially all fossil - fuels ) :
Material , fuel energy per unit number of units needed Home heating oil 140,000 Btu / gallon 7 gallons ( 7 gal * $ 3/gal ) ( $ 21 ) Natural gas 1040 Btu/cubic foot 950 cubic feet ( 1.5 cent / cu.ft . * 950 ) ( $ 15 ) Gasoline 126,000 Btu / gallon 8 gallons ( 8 gal * $ 3.10 / gal ) ( $ 25 ) Electric Heating
( not really storable ) 3412 Btu / kWh 300 kWh ( 300 kWh * 12 cents /kWh ) ( $ 36 )
The efficiency of converting chemical energy into heat are generally far higher than in converting it into mechanical energy .
House furnaces were long considered to have around 80 % efficiency if gas - fueled and 70 % if oil - fueled .
There are high - efficiency ( condensing ) furnaces which now have around 95 % to 97 % overall efficiencies .
Nearly half of the electricity cost is often delivery fees and taxes .
Car batteries A good car battery is rated at around 400 amperes for a few minutes to start a car .
Older batteries , especially old six - volt batteries , had pretty high capacity , but modern batteries are even better and generally have an energy capacity ( storage ) of around 65 to 85 ampere - hours .
This is at 12 volts , so it is about ( 85 a-h * 12 v ) 1000 watt - hours or 1.0 kWh .
Around three hundred car batteries would be needed to store 300 kWh .
A conversion term is that one kilowatt - hour is equal to 3,412 Btus ( since 3.412 Btu = 1 Watt - hour [ power ] or 3.412 Btu/hr = 1 Watt [ energy ] ) , so this is roughly our million Btus .
At $ 50 each , that would be an investment of around $ 15,000 in batteries , and they have limited lifetimes of a few years as any driver knows !
Fine for storing enough electricity to start a car , but awfully expensive ( and taking up a lot of space ! ) if serious energy storage is considered .
They also suffer from disadvantages in the inefficiencies of getting energy into and back out of the batteries .
The process of charging batteries is not particularly efficient , the battery gradually loses charge over time , and then the process of discharge is not particularly efficient .
This all results in only around half the electricity actually provided to a battery ever being available as useful output .

Main Menu E-mail Enormous research is being done in trying to improve these efficiencies of transfer and in increasing the energy density of batteries .
This constantly results in news items about many exotic experimental batteries .
However , battery technology starts out at such a low state that even with impressive advances , batteries still cannot store significant amounts of energy , and the processes of charging and discharging them are still not particularly efficient .
The news stories ALWAYS talk about BREAKTHROUGHS , but actual batteries which will be able to efficiently power ( small ) vehicles are probably still at least 50 years away .
Worse , all those exotic experimental batteries are extremely expensive !
NASA ( with unlimited budget ) developed many advanced battery technologies in the 1960s and 1970s for spacecraft , but those batteries often cost millions of dollars !
The ( alleged ) Chevy Volt small vehicle has a battery pack which is supposed to have a maximum capacity rating of around 16 kWh .
This is equal to around 50,000 Btus ( not much when a single gallon of gasoline contains around 126,000 Btus of chemical energy in it ! ) .
It is also equal to about 16 standard lead - acid car batteries but without the thousand pounds of weight of them !
GM seems to hope to get the cost of that battery - pack down to around $ 10,000 so they can sell the vehicle , but currently ( 2008 ) their batteries cost them much more than that !
( In 2012 , GM is selling Volts and they claim that a replacement battery - pack would be around $ 8,000 , where GM will apparently be losing a lot of money on each of them !
All electric vehicle manufacturers admit that batteries only can last a few years , and the battery - packs are worse about that , as individual batteries are not replacable in them .
So when even one of the thousands of individual batteries within a battery - pack fails , the entire battery - pack must be replaced ! )
Another highly publicized electric vehicle , the Tesla sports car uses around 2,300 small exotic batteries instead of the normal ( heavy ) lead - acid batteries .
They admit that the batteries only last a few years and then the whole set has to be replaced , at an extreme cost .
There is another experimental car that was shown to the Press where the battery - pack costs around $ 300,000 !
Do n't hold your breath regarding really high - capacity and high - efficiency battery - pack systems !
Again , keep in mind that the FUTURE Chevy Volt only hopes to have a battery pack which contains around 50,000 Btus of chemical energy , where a single gallon of gasoline contains around 126,000 Btus in it .
If really excellent battery - packs ever come to exist , they will certainly be immensely expensive and still need replacement every few years .
But they are nice to dream about !
The public also seems to totally ignore that batteries do NOT contain any of their own energy !
They simply STORE ( electrical ) energy that was created somewhere else !
And due to the inefficiencies of getting that electricity into and out of the batteries , as well as the inefficiencies of generating plants and the power - grid needed to get the electricity to a destination , there really are immense obstacles .
But for vehicles like golf carts and demo vehicles , where they only need to perform for a minimal distance at relatively low speeds , and for starting engines , batteries are great !
A good car battery is rated at around 400 amperes for a few minutes to start a car .

Hot water A normal 40 - gallon hot water tank holds around 300 pounds of water .
Each degree the water is heated up involves 1 Btu / pound of water .
So if a hot water tank is at 170 °F ( a rather high temperature ) such that 100 °F of heating was done to 70 °F water , we would have ( ( 170 - 70 ) * 1 * 300 ) 30,000 Btu of heat stored .
We would therefore need around 33 standard hot water heaters all operating at a rather high temperature , to store our one million Btus .
Again , around $ 6,000 in initial investment , and again , such hot water heaters have limited lifetimes .
There is also the problem that all of the tanks generally only have around R - 5 thermal insulation surrounding them , so they would each continuously be losing a lot of heat through their insulation because they were at such high temperature .
Efficiency really drops if the energy needs to be stored for more than a few hours .
They have an additional problem in that initially heating up the water is often a very inefficient process .
Whether using natural gas in a burner , or electricity , or even solar , there are always heat losses .
But the thermal losses through surrounding insulation is really the most spectacular source of loss .

Raised water
If water is pumped ( or otherwise raised ) up to a raised tank , it can store some potential energy .
Some electric utilities in mountainous areas do this , pumping water up into a mountaintop reservoir at night ( when excess electricity is generated , since they necessarily have to constantly be making a lot of electricity , just in case there is suddenly a demand for it , as AC electricity cannot be stored ) .
They then allow that water to run back down through their turbines during emergency daytime needs .
If we again consider a standard 40 - gallon water tank that holds 300 pounds of water , and it is at a place 20 feet raised up , then we would have a potential energy of ( 300 lbs * 20 ft ) 6,000 ft-lbs .
Another conversion factor is that 778 ft - lbs equals 1 Btu , so this amount would be around 8 Btu .
More than 100,000 such tanks would be needed !
Or a tank that was a LOT bigger , like a swimming pool raised up that 20 feet !
Pumping water up to a raised tank , to let it run down again to get power ?
It is a terrible idea , unless you have a rooftop swimming pool !
A 500 gallon tank ( 4000 POUNDS ) up one floor ( 8 feet ) could represent 32,000 ft-lb of potential energy .
33,000 ft -lb / minute equals one horsepower .
By the conversion factor just mentioned , this would be around 40 Btus of energy .
You would need around 25,000 such tanks to store our million Btus !
Using the conversion factor given above , we can see that this is also around 13 watt - hours or 0.013 kWh .
Therefore , if you had totally perfect equipment for conversion , that would be equal to ONE horsepower for ONE minute .
Yes , it could probably light a single 60 watt light bulb for about 8 minutes or so , but that is not much considering all the trouble to reinforce the building !
The fact that some power companies ( which happen to own mountains ! ) use this storage method is NOT due to it having very good storage capabilities or efficiency .
They are simply faced with the fact that if they do NOT do such things , that nighttime - created electricity mostly disappears into heat and is totally wasted .
So by using a system that has low efficiency is better than zero efficiency !
There are so many sources and types of losses in this arrangement that it is really a terribly foolish idea , except for the fact that they cannot ever entirely stop making electricity , even when no one buys it !
So this " pumped hydro storage " concept simply represents the least terrible of even worse alternatives ! ]

Compressed air
It is possible to store energy as compressed air in a tank .
Consider air compressed to 100 PSI in a 40 - gallon tank .
It is least confusing to do this calculation in the metric system .
Our tank has a volume of 0.15 cubic meter .
The 100 PSI pressure is equal to 690,000 Pascals or Newtons / square meter .
The energy in a compressed gas is simply the product of the pressure and volume , so we have ( 0.15 * 690,000 ) 103,000 Newton - meters .
If we spread out the use of this energy over an hour ( 3600 seconds ) , we therefore would have around ( 103,000/3600 ) 29 watt - hours of energy .
[ you currently pay less than half a penny for this much electric power ! ]
This is the same as around 98 Btu .
That is around the same as one horsepower for two minutes .
Again , 10,000 tanks would be needed to save our million Btus .

Making and storing hydrogen
This first sounds like an appealing method of storing energy , but there are at least three main problems .
First , creating hydrogen is very energy intensive .
Electrolysis of water certainly can easily create both hydrogen and oxygen , but it takes a very large amount of electricity to make even one cubic foot of hydrogen .
Second , hydrogen has such a low density that one cubic foot contains very little hydrogen !
One pound of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure takes up nearly the space of a small bathroom !
This results in one cubic foot of Hydrogen only containing around 320 Btu of energy .
Our million Btus would therefore take up around 3100 cubic feet , or 8 feet by 20 feet by 20 feet , the space of nearly half a small house full of hydrogen !
Which brings up the third major problem with hydrogen , the absolute need to compress it A LOT to get a decent amount of hydrogen down into a manageable space .
Extremely high pressure tanks , at 3000 PSI , can hold around one pound of hydrogen ( in a massive tank about the size and weight of a small person ) or 60,000 Btu .
So 17 such tanks would be required for our one million Btus of storage .
Tanks have to be VERY sturdy and reliable ( and heavy ) to withstand 3,000 PSI of pressure , but another main problem is that a really strong and expensive compressor is needed to compress the hydrogen to 3,000 PSI , ( 200 times normal atmospheric pressure ) which again requires a lot of outside energy used up .
If any such 3000 PSI tank of hydrogen were in a vehicle , and that vehicle got into an accident , it would be VERY , VERY , VERY bad if the tank was damaged !
There are thousands of industrial horror stories where a tank of 1500 PSI oxygen fell over and had its valve snap off and then the tank demonstrated Newton 's action - reaction law in shooting off at aircraft velocities !
Many have gone through concrete walls as though they were not even there , and some have been said to have flown nearly half a mile through the air .
If the valve on an even higher pressure hydrogen tank were ever to snap off , a car accident could suddenly be far more dangerous .
IF you had the expensive equipment to Dissociate water into Hydrogen gas and then compress it to 3,000 PSI , the electricity just to Dissociate enough water for our 1 million Btus of Hydrogen would cost around $ 120 at current prices .
More for the electricity to run the high - tech compressor , plus the cost of the tanks and high - pressure piping and a LOT of safety equipment !
The current price of BUYING a tank of the lowest quality of industrial Hydrogen gas , one pound of it , is around $ 42 .
As we noted above , that tank contains around 60,000 Btus of energy , so our million Btus of BOUGHT Hydrogen would now be around ( 17 tanksful * $ 42/tank ) $ 714 .
Not REMOTELY competitive with even the eight gallons of gasoline for around $ 25 now !
This first sounds like an appealing method of storing energy , but there are at least three main problems .
First , creating hydrogen is very energy intensive .
Electrolysis of water certainly can easily create both hydrogen and oxygen , but Second , hydrogen has such a low density that one cubic foot contains very little hydrogen !

Tanks have to be VERY sturdy and reliable ( and heavy ) to withstand 3,000 PSI of pressure , but another main problem is that a really strong and expensive compressor is needed to compress the hydrogen to 3,000 PSI , ( 200 times normal atmospheric pressure ) which again requires a lot of outside energy used up .
Flywheel A fairly large ( 1000 kg , or one metric ton ) flywheel which is mounted on really good bearings can store as much as 7,000 watt - hours ( 7 kWh ) of energy .
It would have to spin rather fast ( VERY fast ! ) to store this much energy .
This is equal to around 24,000 Btu , so around 40 such flywheels would be needed to store our million Btus of energy .
There is physical danger of such giant flywheels spinning really fast , as bearings occasionally go bad !
Also , bearing friction and air friction are constant losses for this sort of storage , so it is not very good except for just a few minutes .
Such flywheels also have the effect of gyroscopic precession and the related effects .
When a small aircraft makes a sudden lateral ( side ) turn , the gyroscopic effect of the spinning propeller often surprises a rookie pilot by forcing the nose of the aircraft upward or downward ( depending on which way the propeller is spinning and which direction the turn was ) .
The giant flywheel we are considering here is far more massive than an aircraft propeller and it would spin far faster , so those gyroscopic effects would be far more extreme .
Depending on how the flywheel was oriented in a vehicle , a sudden left turn could cause the vehicle to instantly roll over on its roof !
Not very practical !
A fairly large ( 1000 kg , or one metric ton ) flywheel which is mounted on really good bearings can store as much as 7,000 watt - hours ( 7 kWh ) of energy .
It would have to spin rather fast ( VERY fast ! ) to store this much energy .
This is equal to around 24,000 Btu , so around 40 such flywheels would be needed to store our million Btus of energy .
There is physical danger of such giant flywheels spinning really fast , as bearings occasionally go bad !
Also , bearing friction and air friction are constant losses for this sort of storage , so it is not very good except for just a few minutes .
Wood Wood and other plants naturally take solar energy and convert it into chemical energy in the chemical bonds in the wood .
The actual process of collecting the solar energy ( photosynthesis ) is rather low efficiency ( generally less than 2 % and usually around 1 % ) but since it is natural , we are rarely concerned about that .
A piece of absolutely dry wood contains around 8,600 Btu of chemical energy , what is called the HHV ( high heat value ) .
A piece of cut firewood , suitably dried for nine months or so , has a remaining moisture content of maybe 20 % , which has to be evaporated by the energy of the fire , and it contains around 6,000 Btu of AVAILABLE heat ( called LHV or low heat value ) per pound .
At least this source only requires about 160 pounds of wood , or half a dozen logs 8 " thick and 24 " long , for the one million Btus that we are using as a comparison amount .
Compared to any of the other alternatives above , it is a vast improvement , and nearly being competitive with oil or natural gas in compactness of energy content , which are very long - term versions of biologically created energy anyway .
A main distinction between wood and the fossil fuels is that wood contains the oxygen atoms of the original cellulose cells of the plants ( called carbohydrates ) , while the coal , petroleum and natural gas had that oxygen slowly removed over millions of years to become nearly completely carbon and hydrogen ( hydrocarbons ) and they therefore contain a little higher energy content per pound .
Even better , wood is often available in many areas for free or nearly free !
There are variations on wood , which essentially have the same situation .
It is possible to burn kernels of corn in a stove , or corn cobs , or even dried supplies of nearly any organic material .
This Biomass is essentially also nearly all cellulose in composition , and therefore has roughly the same energy content as wood has .
You might note the links below where we have recently discovered that it is not actually necessary to " burn " organic materials to produce heat .
An advanced version of the long - known composting process can allow bacteria to decompose those same materials , producing the same heat that burning / combustion does , and resulting in the very same water vapor and carbon dioxide as end products .
When the plants first grew , they absorbed a lot of solar energy in the photosynthesis process .
There is Conservation of Energy , and that energy got converted into chemical energy of the molecules of the organic materials of the plant .
When the plant eventually dies and decomposes , bacteria and other effects cause those complex carbohydrate molecules to break down , eventually into just water vapor and carbon dioxide , the same materials that the plant first used in photosynthesis .
This decomposition completes what is called the Carbon Cycle .
The point here being that very large amounts of heat is necessarily released during that decomposition .
So when you cut your grass , and a few weeks later those cut grass clippings have disappeared , they have actually released very large amounts of heat in the process !
It 's just that no one has ever noticed that because the heat loss is spread out over the large area of your lawn and over the hundreds of hours of a few weeks !
But when cut grass is bagged , those bags get HOT within a few hours !
The same thing is true for autumn leaves and every other sort of organic material that NATURALLY decomposes .
Instead of letting that natural decomposition to occur spread out over a lawn , we Engineered a system that can capture the heat which is given off , which we call the HeatGreen 3a ( or HG 3a ) .
An acre of plant growth generally uses around 170 million Btus of solar energy per year .
When those plants from that acre later decompose , they must necessarily RELEASE that same 170 million Btus , AS HEAT ENERGY !
Since a medium - sized house in Chicago 's climate generally requires only around 40 million Btus to heat for an entire winter , see the benefit ?
Just one acre of ANY sort of plant growth produces plenty of decaying material each year to be able to entirely heat most any house !
This approach essentially uses cut lawn grass and bags of leaves and bags of weeds and a wide variety of other organic materials as an Energy Storage system !
This method seems to have some advantages over combustion processes , such as extremely high efficiency , but still uses " fuel " source materials that have a good deal of chemical energy in compact space .
In fact , even other organic materials , such as used motor oil and used automotive tires and food scraps work just as well as the source of energy .
This is discussed below , near the end of this presentation .
Since these organic materials are going to naturally decompose anyway , this is an extremely GREEN approach to heating one 's home , WITHOUT needing to burn any fossil - fuels at all !

Coal Coal is also a fairly compact source of stored energy , commonly around 12,000 Btu per pound , so only around 80 pounds of coal can provide the million Btus we have been considering .
( Some varieties of coal have as much as 14,000 Btu per pound of energy content . )

Ethanol Politicians and spokespeople for a few giant corporations keep bragging about Ethanol as being the total solution to the energy crisis regarding gasoline for vehicles .
This is an example of what has become amazingly effective as " spin " where outright deception is done to mislead the public .
It is unbelievable that we allow such behaviors by leaders without arresting them !
First , yes , Ethanol actually has most of the benefits that are attributed to it .
The most significant disadvantage regarding actual vehicles is that Ethanol has long been known to melt / destroy rubber seals like O - rings in automotive fuel systems .
So nearly all older vehicles cannot use Ethanol or even the standard modern gasoline which contains maybe 10 % Ethanol , without having damage .
But overall , this still sounds wonderful .
In fact , if kept as a " hobby - level " fuel , it would be great .
But that is not how it is promoted !
The primary reason why Ethanol has been promoted so heavily is because it is a product that is made from corn , and from the USA .
Last year ( 2006 ) , roughly 20 % of all crops grown in the USA were grown as corn and then used up for producing Ethanol .
Before Ethanol , that corn was used as food for people and for livestock , toward our National food supply .
There are already great concerns that even that 20 % reduction of available corn for food uses is endangering our food supply .
As long as weather is good , we may be fine , but if there are any weather anomalies where crops are damaged or destroyed , there may be immediate food supply crises .
With no obvious solution except to start importing food and corn !
That 20 % of the entire National corn crop used to create Ethanol generates around 5 billion gallons of Ethanol ( in a year ) .
This might sound like a lot , but it is not when compared to our usage of gasoline .
A simple way that we can see this is to note that there are presently 140 million drivers in the US , and the average driver drives 12,000 miles per year .
For that mileage , the average driver buys a little over 600 gallons of gasoline per year ( at an average of 20 miles per gallon of gasoline ) .
So , between all those drivers , ( multiplying ) we see that about 84 billion gallons of gasoline are used up by private drivers each year .
If we add in the many large trucks and the millions of smaller trucks , and railroads and airliners and taxis and all the rest , government figures show that roughly 200 billion gallons of gasoline or diesel are used each year in the USA .
The 5 billion gallons of Ethanol currently made from 1/5 of all the corn crop is therefore only about 1/40 of the actual consumption !
Could we rely on Ethanol much more than we already are ?
It is hard to see how !
Unless we stop raising livestock ( no steaks and no milk ??? ) and eating corn products , we cannot give up many more percent of the corn crop to being used to make Ethanol .
We are already about at the maximum that is possible .
But our government has already announced that around 33 % of the entire grown crops on American land in 2007 will go toward creating Ethanol .
The GOOD side of that coin is that the current 2.5 % contribution toward our automotive consumption will likely rise to around 4 % , still very little .
The BAD side of that coin is that there will be even far less American crop that is actually for providing food !
People in April 2007 are already noticing that food prices are already greatly increasing in the grocery stores , and they are already seeing that it is directly because of the strange compulsion our government currently has regarding making Ethanol no matter what the consequences !
( Update : The Bush government increased this usage of US corn to a mandatory 40 % of every year 's crop , further endangering the food supply if and when some drought or other problem occurs .
In 2012 , the severe drought reduced the corn crop , but Congress did not reduce the mandatory 40 % of that reduced crop that must go toward producing Ethanol .
Unbelievable !)
So when President Bush and NASCAR and politicians keep insisting that America can become " self - sufficient " by building and selling vehicles that can run on E - 85 ( 85 % Ethanol as compared to the common current 10 % ) , they seem to be ignorant of where that Ethanol would come from !
Sure , there is plenty of Ethanol for NASCAR races , but such things are actually misleading the American public into thinking that there is no problem , or that that technology has SOLVED the future energy supply problems !
It is absolutely untrue , and what I would define as a lie , because the people promoting such statements KNOW that they are not true !
There is yet another tremendous disadvantage to using Ethanol !
Virtually no one seems willing to admit that the PROCESSING of corn into Ethanol is VERY energy intensive !
By any known method , it always takes MORE external fuel ( which is invariably petroleum or natural gas based ! ) to make Ethanol than the end fuel contains !
Making Ethanol is a losing proposition !
( Have you ever heard anyone admit that fact ? )
So , the actual fact is that the production of Ethanol is not only using up 20 % of the entire corn crop of all US farmers , but also requiring more additional imported oil and natural gas than it could ever replace !
Do such things ever make you wonder how competent our leaders are ?
It also makes one wonder exactly when anyone is going to realize that this Ethanol adventure has been a really stupid idea !
Our government has provided the ( taxpayer ) money to nearly entirely finance everything related to Ethanol , so businesses have had very little to lose .
( Our politicians see that Brazil has accomplished getting most of their vehicles to run on Brazil - grown - sugar - cane Ethanol , but Brazil has far fewer vehicles than we do and they have very large croplands that are not needed for feeding cattle , so it works pretty well in that country .
As to why politicians assume that it will work in the USA is pretty hard to fathom ! )
This discussion has been meant to show that the several alternative ways of storing energy that companies seem to be aggressively promoting ( like batteries ) are fine if the needs are VERY small .
As soon as you start considering significant amounts of energy , most get ridiculously expensive , and often impractical !
The point here is NOT that that particular idea has any useful merit in large scale energy storage , but just that MANY such concepts actually do exist , which someone should carefully examine .
No one does , because they have always simply assumed that oil and gas and nuclear and coal would last forever !
Peak Power Rating vs. Average Power Rating
You may drive a car which was advertised as having a 495 horsepower engine , and that may have even affected whether you bought that specific car .
That engine rating can be called a PEAK POWER RATING , being the greatest amount of power that it is capable of producing .
When creating that enormous amount of power , it is realistic to expect to get around one or two MPG gas mileage .
But for AVERAGE driving on an Interstate Highway , your engine only produces around 40 horsepower , during which you may get 25 miles per gallon gas mileage .
This AVERAGE situation is a far more accurate description of what YOU CAN ACTUALLY EXPECT , such as regarding gas mileage .
Both situations are true , but they are extremely different .
One is a situation which sounds very impressive , but which you will likely NEVER actually experience , except possibly rarely for a second or two at a stoplight !
The other is a situation which you may experience every day of driving !
IF you were only given ONE of the numbers , which would you consider more important to know ?
Whenever electricity ratings are given for alternative energy devices , they seem to always be PEAK POWER RATINGS , meaning the greatest amount of electricity or power which can be created .
That is entirely different than ratings for AVERAGE USAGE CONDITIONS , which would be realistic numbers of amounts of electricity or power which might NORMALLY be expected to be provided .
The discussion and calculations included here will indicate that OFTEN the realistically expectable amounts of electricity or power is only around ONE - TENTH that of the PEAK POWER RATINGS .
But no one bothers to mention this important fact !
So advertising makes claims of spectacular performance numbers for photovoltaic solar - electric panels , and for solar roof panels , and for electric vehicles , and for Hybrid vehicles , and for windmill - electricity - generation , and even for FUTURE giant windmills and hydrogen as a fuel .
They invariably state PEAK POWER RATINGS , like that 495 horsepower engine in the car , numbers that may be technically true but are extremely misleading .
Not Storage , but Photovoltaic Cells
( This 7 % figure is for the most economical technology of solar cells , which is based on Cadmium Sulfide ( CdS ) .
There ARE higher efficient technologies which exist , such as those based on Gallium Arsinide ( GaAs ) , but they are far more expensive and not within the price range of most people .
There are even more expensive technologies that are based on silicon semiconductor technologies , which require a [ metal ] silicon ingot to be sliced so thin that sunlight can pass THROUGH it , which is extremely expensive to do !
So higher efficiencies exist in solar cells , which are reported in media stories , but they are currently far too expensive for broad use .
This all results in MOST commonly available solar cells being cadmium sulfide , and therefore around 7 % efficient . )
So , if someone actually expected to get a usable 200 watts of electricity , they would certainly need at least 100 square feet of solar photovoltaic cells , which is a lot of money !
And 200 watts for a few sunny hours is not very much electricity .
No toasters or microwaves or televisions or computers !
A few small lights and not much more .
The salespeople never present it this way !
They say the 300 Btu / square foot / hour , sure , which they correctly say is around 100 watts of solar energy .
They leave out those " details " which tend to ruin making a sale , and let the customer incorrectly believe that TWO square feet ( duh , 2 * 100 = 200 watts , right ? ) is all they would need for the 200 watts of electricity .
When the reality is around 100 square feet !
How come it is not criminal to intentionally mislead customers so wildly ?
It might be different if PV technology improved the current 7 % conversion efficiency of solar to electricity .
Or if such panels got a LOT less expensive and a lot more reliable and durable .
But for a few hours of collecting 200 watts in any 24 hour day , it seems truly wasteful to invest thousands of dollars !
Unless you simply want to be able to brag that you bought GREEN !
But the specific point of this Storage discussion is that the few hundred watt - hours of that PV electricity need to be stored for several hours until needed in the evening .
Or worse , if the day is without any sun , maybe an entire day later .
The electrical equipment and batteries usually sold cannot store enough energy to really use !
Virtually all such people are faced with either conceding that they will NOT be able to be off - the - power - grid or they will have to go back ( to the same dealer ) to buy lots more expensive stuff !
YOU know lots of people who have mentioned wanting to go " off - the - grid " , and they have been convinced by some PV salesperson or promotional literature that a few small solar panels is all they will need .
No , it is n't , BY FAR !
Unless they install something like $ 100,000 of solar equipment , like that well - publicized house in the Northeast , where they actually often have enough electricity ( but STILL have to sometimes buy conventional electricity ) , you are never going to hear such friends actually confirm that they accomplished that goal .
Their lives may turn out to be more like Lincoln growing up in that log cabin with one wall missing , a very , very primitive existence !
We hate to see people get taken advantage of like that by salespeople , just because they do not understand subjects like those discussed here .
We are providing this info so fewer people might get taken advantage of in a lop - sided conversation with such a salesperson .
Unfortunately , that salesperson invariably gets a commission on whatever he / she sells , and so remarkably impressive claims are always made .
And if a person only considered a noon situation on a perfectly sunny day and everything else was laboratory perfect , yes , such equipment CAN produce outputs that keep them from being sued !
But not enough for " real life " situations where people actually NEED the electricity !
There are a few other methods of storing energy , such as phase - change salts and other exotic things , but they tend to be even worse than the ones described above , and also more expensive .
An entirely new concept has occurred to me in early 2007 !
This is a good one !
If you own a house in a temperate climate like Chicago , then you pay at least $ 1,500 every winter to heat it .
Worse , you are spending that money to buy fossil - fuels , which are making the Global Warming problem worse .
You buy around 80 million Btus worth of heat each winter .
In your good - sized yard , grass and weeds grow and trees have leaves , and you mow and rake and bag everything up to have it all taken away .
Wherever that material goes , it will decompose , and in that process it will release heat energy .
A LOT of heat energy !
Farm studies have shown that each acre of land can produce around 95 to 125 pounds of organic matter ( glucose ) each summer day , and other studies have shown that an acre of grasslands and trees can produce around 17,000 pounds in an entire year .
We know that each pound of [ dry ] organic matter contains and releases around 9,000 Btus of energy when it decomposes .
You can see that , if you leave that grass and those leaves on the one - acre yard , and they do not blow away , they necessarily give off more than 150 million Btus of heat energy during the months of decomposition .
You have never noticed it because it is so slow and so spread out .
I have discovered a way to collect and use that heat to entirely heat your home .
NO heating bills !
NO fossil fuels used !
Absolutely " carbon - neutral " .
It is a high - tech version of doing the Composting that farmers have done for centuries !
You can both contribute to saving the world and also save yourself a lot of money !
You only need a few hundred dollars of common construction materials to build the things you need to accomplish this !
I have provided free complete directions on how you can make such systems .
I actually have provided two different sets of instructions , one for a small version which is designed to eliminate the cost of heating domestic how water .
Alternative GREEN Water Heater - Non-Fossil - Fueled HeatGreen - A Simple and Non-Fossil - Fueled Water Heater , HG3a ( biodecomposition ) ( March 2007 ) .
The other is a larger version , which is designed to entirely heat your entire house , with NO cost for any bought fuel , no Global Warming consequences , and a new independence from utility companies !
Alternative GREEN Furnace with no Fire - Non-Fossil - Fueled HeatGreen - A Simple , Non-Fossil - Fueled Home Heating Furnace .

Synfig is a Free , powerful , industrial - strength vector - based 2D animation software package , designed from the scratch for producing feature - film quality animation with fewer people and resources .
While there are many other programs currently on the market to aid with the efficient production of 2D animation , we are currently unaware of any other software that can do what our software can .
2D Animation has traditionally been very expensive because every frame must be drawn by hand .
Even with today ’s digital inking and painting software , the process still relies on individuals hand - drawing each frame .
This laborious task is called “ tweening ” .
Its animation technology eliminates the task of manual tweening , producing smooth , fluid motion without the animator having to draw out each frame individually .
This allows you to produce 2D animation with fewer people while producing a product of a higher quality .

( Fortune Magazine ) -- Scott Griffith enters the parking lot outside his office in Cambridge , Mass. , pulls out his iPhone , and taps a button on the screen .
Suddenly a yellow Mini Cooper starts honking like a crazed goose .
Griffith approaches the vehicle and taps the screen again .
The doors magically unlock , and under the steering wheel the key dangles from a cord .
He starts up the car -- nicknamed " Meneus " -- and drives away at a rate of $ 11.25 an hour .
Griffith is the 50 - year - old CEO of the car - sharing service Zipcar , but he's also just one of the 325,000 members who rely on the company 's handy , gassed - up cars to get around .
Just a few years ago the notion that you could persuade upwardly mobile professionals to share cars would have seemed as far - fetched as being able to unlock a car with a telephone .
But what started as a counterculture movement in places like Cambridge and Portland , Ore. , has gone mainstream .
You can now find Zipcars in most major U.S. cities , including Seattle , San Francisco , Atlanta , Chicago , and New York , and in college towns like Ann Arbor and Chapel Hill , as well as in Britain .
Zipcar 's annual revenues are $ 130 million , and the company is growing about 30 % a year .
Griffith says that Zipcar will turn a profit for the first time in the third quarter of this year , and he hopes to take the company public next year .
Netflix for cars
For drivers who already share movies via Netflix and stream music rather than buying CDs , the idea of sharing a car is the natural extension of a hip , financially smart , and environmentally conscious urban lifestyle .
After all , drivers who give up their cars and switch to Zipcar say they save an average of $ 600 per month .
Car sharers report reducing their vehicle miles traveled by 44 % , according to Susan Shaheen of the University of California at Berkeley , and surveys in Europe show CO 2 emissions are being cut by up to 50 % per user .
" When I meet another Zipcar member at a party or something , I feel like we have something in common , " says Francis Smith , a photographer who lives in Brooklyn .
" It 's like we 're both making intelligent choices about our lives . "
Businesses are catching on too .
About 8,500 companies have signed up for the service , including Lockheed Martin ( LMT , Fortune 500 ) , Gap ( GPS , Fortune 500 ) , and Nike ( NKE , Fortune 500 ) .
So have 120 colleges and universities , such as Carnegie Mellon and the University of Miami .
Zipcar is also marketing its technology -- the hardware and software that keep track of the cars -- to city governments .
Washington , D.C. , retrofitted its fleet this year using Zipcar 's wireless systems and estimates that the move will save it $ 1 million a year .
" It 's just such a no - brainer , " says Ralph Burns , who manages the D.C. government fleet .
" Agencies putting their budgets together for next year are calling me up and saying , ' Ralph , I 've got 25 cars I want to get rid of ! ' "
Though car sharing is an audacious challenge to the whole principle of car ownership -- each shared vehicle takes up to 20 cars off the road as members sell their rides or decide not to buy new ones , says Shaheen -- the auto industry is increasingly realizing it has little choice but to play ball .
Toyota ( TM ) and Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) have already begun exploring ways to work with Zipcar , from using its members to test electric cars to designing vehicles specifically for the sharing market .
" The future of transportation will be a blend of things like Zipcar , public transportation , and private car ownership , " says Bill Ford , Ford 's executive chairman .
" Not only do I not fear that , but I think it 's a great opportunity for us to participate in the changing nature of car ownership . "
Perhaps the clearest indication of how big the car - sharing market could become is the entrance of rental giants such as Hertz ( HTZ , Fortune 500 ) , Enterprise , and U - Haul .
Hertz launched a service in December in New York , London , and Paris that freely copies Zipcar , right down to the forest - green tones of its website and emphasis on a caring " community " of users .
Zipcar , meanwhile , may have sold its customers on the benefits of sharing , but the company is n't about to share the market it popularized without a fight .
Broadening appeal
As Griffith pilots the Mini Cooper across the Charles River into Boston , he says that as car sharing enters the mass market , the original Zipster demographic -- young , college - educated , higher - income , environmentally conscious , techno - savvy Facebook and Twitter users -- is gradually becoming older and more reflective of the national average .
" I 've been surprised to see good growth among empty - nesters , " he says .
" People who moved back into the city after raising kids and are now dumping their cars . "
The broadening appeal of car sharing comes as no surprise to Robin Chase and Antje Danielson , the two women who founded Zipcar in Cambridge in 2000 .
( CarSharing Portland , the first such service in the U.S. , was started in 1998 . )
At 42 , Chase was an MBA from MIT with a previous career in public health , and Danielson was a geochemist running a program at Harvard that explored ways to reduce carbon emissions ( she left the company within two years ) .
Taking advantage of advances in Internet and wireless technology , Zipcar was able to keep track of a growing fleet of fuel - efficient cars and attracted thousands of members in its first three years .
Zipsters were so passionate about the service that they gave their cars cute names and waved to each other as they passed on the street .
Chase expanded to New York and Washington , D.C. , but when an expected $ 7 million round of financing fell through in 2002 , the board eased her out in favor of Griffith , an engineer with more big - league experience , who took over the following year .
An MBA from the University of Chicago , Griffith had been an executive at Boeing and Hughes Aircraft and ran two startups , a database firm that was sold for a reported $ 25 million in 1999 and a software company that shut down in 2001 .
As much as Zipcar hates being compared to traditional car rental ( its real competition is car ownership , Griffith argues ) , Avis ( CAR , Fortune 500 ) and Hertz are really the type of business Zipcar most resembles .
But there are crucial differences .
Rental agencies ask consumers to travel long distances to a centralized hub , stand in line , fill out paperwork , pay only by the day or week , and shell out for insurance , gas , and often mileage charges .
They give you the keys to whatever generic car happens to be available that day .
Zipcar , meanwhile , charges $ 50 a year for a basic membership but makes it easy to make an online reservation for a specific car parked in your neighborhood ( Mini Coopers , Mazdas , and Toyota Priuses are popular ) .
You pay an hourly or a daily rate ; the price varies depending on the city , car , and day of the week ( the daily rate starts at around $ 60 ) .
Insurance and gas are included -- up to 180 miles daily -- and the car feels as if it belongs to a friend .
There are lots of rules :
Do n't smoke or leave trash in the car , keep your pet in a cage , leave the gas tank at least one - quarter full , call to extend your reservation if you 're running late , etc .
" Our business model depends on the kindness of others , " says Griffith .
After taking over as CEO , Griffith curbed Chase 's rapid expansion plans and focused on getting the business model to work in a single neighborhood , such as Chelsea in New York City , before moving on to other areas .
Rather than parking cars wherever it could find a spot , the company created " pods , " or groups of cars in parking lots or garages , so if one car was taken , others would be available in the same location .
They created memorable marketing campaigns like the one in Harvard Square , where they packed a Mini Cooper with frozen meatballs and asked people to guess how many were inside .
Later , in San Francisco , they let people take a sledgehammer to an old SUV , that enduring symbol of wasteful car ownership .
Zipcar also teamed up with local retailers to target its marketing to the specific character of each neighborhood .
To keep the company afloat , Griffith raised $ 35 million from blue - chip players Benchmark Capital and Greylock Partners .
He stocked the fleet with BMWs , those totems of conspicuous consumption , which alienated some Zipcar staffers and members .
Though the company 's mission statement still pledges to " change the world through urban and environmental transformation , " Griffith uses the very same language to describe what was wrong with the company when he came onboard .
" It was a very mission - oriented culture -- save - the - world , change - the - world culture , " he says .
" We had to put a performance - based culture in place . "
( Counters Chase : " We were performance - based since the beginning of time . " )
Zipcar 's competitors in the nonprofit world relish tweaking Griffith for sending what Scott Bernstein of the Center for Neighborhood Technology in Chicago calls a " mixed message " --
Save the world while driving a Beemer !
Since car sharing came to the U.S. in the late '90s , a handful of nonprofits , many partially funded by taxpayer grants , have entered the business and grown from some 6,000 members nationwide to an estimated 44,000 today .
They argue that they are better able to focus on the public benefits of car sharing -- reducing traffic congestion and greenhouse - gas emissions , coordinating with public transportation , and serving poorer communities -- because they do n't have to worry about turning a profit or pleasing shareholders .
In 2002 , for example , Bernstein 's group started a service in Chicago called I - GO that serves both affluent areas and low - income neighborhoods such as South Shore and Bronzeville that Zipcar acknowledges it has ignored because they are not profitable enough ( in January , I - GO teamed up with the Chicago Transit Authority to create a joint smart card that works with both public transportation and I - GO cars ) .
Griffith 's hard - charging manner has alienated some of his nonprofit competitors .
As Zipcar was preparing to launch in Chicago in 2006 , he asked Sharon Feigon , I - GO 's CEO , for a lunch meeting .
She says that when Griffith asked her what her exit strategy was , she replied she did n't have one ; I - GO would keep growing and serving Chicago .
Then she remembers being taken aback by his next comment .
" He looked me in the eye and said , ' You ca n't expect to survive .
We 're going to crush you . ' "
( Griffith remembers the lunch but denies saying anything remotely like that .
" That 's an outright lie , " he says . )
The ecological payoff
One thing everyone can agree on ?
The radical environmental benefits of sharing cars .
The high cost of car ownership -- AAA pegs the average at $ 8,000 a year -- motivates people to drive even when they do n't really need to .
( Hey , if you 're paying for the car , might as well use it . )
Paying by the hour , meanwhile , creates a strong incentive to cut back .
The Canadian car - sharing service Communauto calculates a 13,000 - ton reduction in CO 2 emission by its 11,000 members in Quebec and says that number could skyrocket to 168,000 tons per year with widespread adoption in the province .
Zipcar 's expansion was well - timed to ride the wave of environmental awareness sweeping the country , and by 2007 the company had launched in San Francisco , Chicago , Vancouver , Toronto , and London , and its membership had soared to some 120,000 .
That year Griffith took a gamble by acquiring Zipcar 's chief rival , No. 2 Flexcar , which was 85 % owned by AOL founder Steve Case 's holding company , Revolution .
In the stock deal , Revolution became Zipcar 's largest shareholder , holding a minority stake .
( Zipcar wo n't say what percentage Revolution owns . )
It was a defining moment for the young company .
With operations in 15 cities in the U.S. , Canada , and England , Zipcar had suddenly become the fledgling industry 's giant .
A brutal , complex business
The nonprofits may view Griffith as a cold - hearted capitalist , but Hertz may end up making him look like a pussycat .
Only a few months after its launch , Connect by Hertz already has 460 cars in 175 locations in Manhattan and 8,000 members , and vows to grab at least half of a global market that it says will balloon to $ 800 million over the next five years .
Hertz has many built - in advantages :
It can get volume discounts on cars , mobilize its huge fleet and customer - support call centers , invest heavily in each city , and absorb losses if it wants to start a price war .
Zipcar , on the other hand , has 10 years of experience , positive brand identification , a highly automated service that works extremely well , and a proven record establishing cozy relationships with neighborhoods that a corporate behemoth like Hertz may not be able to match .
Not to mention urban hipster cred .
When Griff Long , Hertz 's senior director of global car sharing , appropriates activist slogans by saying things like , " As I tell everyone in the operations team , we think globally but act locally , " it almost makes you wince .
While Hertz is jumping in with both feet , U - Haul and Enterprise are still testing the waters .
U - Haul 's U Car Share launched in 2007 but exists in only a handful of cities , and Enterprise 's WeCar , begun last fall , has confined itself mostly to university , government , and corporate locations such as Google 's Silicon Valley campus .
" It 's a brutal and complex business , " says Zipcar founder Chase , who went on to start a ride - sharing service called GoLoco .
" You have to get the technology , marketing , branding , and operations right .
If you fall down in any one of those four areas , you will fail . "
The fact that Zipcar has managed to get all those areas mostly right is forcing some in the auto business to take notice .
" We need to be innovative in thinking about the way cars interface with society , " says Bill Reinert of Toyota 's Advanced Technology Group .
For example , Toyota could make special car - sharing vehicles that do n't allow smoke , body odor , or perfumes to cling to the interior surface materials .
Bill Ford believes that just about everything should be on the table : letting customers bring their car back to their dealer , for example , to exchange it for a convertible for a trip to the beach or an SUV for a family vacation .
Or letting Zipsters test - drive innovative new models like electric and plug - in hybrid cars before they are offered to the general public .
" Zipcar is the perfect application for electric vehicles and plug - in hybrids because you leave them at a certain location to be charged and then take them out again , " says Ford .
In a survey , 80 % of Zipsters said they want to drive an electric vehicle , though it 's not clear it would be a slam dunk from a business point of view , as Zipcar could lose rental revenue while the cars are charging .
Nonetheless , Zipcar is currently allowing members in San Francisco to test a converted plug - in Toyota Prius and hopes to get its hands on the new all - electric Ford Focus before its debut in 2011 .
" Ford is the only American - branded company in the auto industry that seems to understand what we 're doing and has some affinity for what we 're up to , " says Griffith , who is also talking to Toyota , Nissan , Honda , and BMW about how to work more closely together .
" I think for a long time the auto industry was trying to decide whether Zipcar was friend or foe , but now they 're realizing that there are bigger forces working against the auto industry , especially in cities , that are only going to result in Zipcar getting bigger . "
Returning from his trip to Boston , Griffith pulls the yellow Mini Cooper back into the parking lot across from his office .
If he can persuade even a tiny fraction of the world 's drivers to perform this new ritual -- just imagine the appeal of car - sharing in expensive , traffic - snarled , polluted megacities from Hong Kong to S�o Paulo -- Zipcar could well become the enormous business he envisions .
" We 're going to be the market leader of an industry with a $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion growth curve , " he declares with bravado .
He locks the car by tapping his iPhone , and heads out of the garage , back to his mission of turning car owners into Zipsters .
THE back streets of Epping have become a carpark after the $ 2.3 billion Epping to Chatswood Rail Link was built without any commuter parking .
Locals said new drivers fill the streets from the early hours as they join 10,000 commuters on the line .
The new line has attracted residents from Sydney 's west and northwest after the State Government scrapped the Epping - Parramatta section of the new link , and the $ 12 billion northwest line to Rouse Hill .
Locals blamed the Government 's failure to address the " critical shortage " of commuter parking and to deliver integrated public transport .
Once -quiet residential streets have filled with commuters searching for a parking spot , shadow Attorney - General Greg Smith , a local , said .
" In the last year it has become so much worse , even where I live there used to be no cars at all , and now it is clogged each morning , " he said .
" We are seeing cars jammed across driveways and even people stealing things from front yards . "
Mr Smith said the problem would worsen in coming months , when a new timetable integrated the link with the rest of the CityRail network
Campbelltown resident Jamie Baker searches daily for a park since his workplace moved to Epping last year .
" I feel sorry for the residents , it 's really hard to find a parking spot anywhere , " Mr Baker said yesterday .
" It 's usually just a matter of driving around until you grab a spot . "
Parramatta and Hornsby councils formed the Epping Traffic and Parking Joint Lobbying Committee to fight for parking at the station or somewhere local .
" Extended peak - hour traffic , gridlocked local streets and neighbourhoods crammed with parked cars are now a daily reminder of the Government 's failure to develop an integrated approach to traffic and transport for the Epping community , " Parramatta mayor Tony Issa said .

In February , opponents of REAL ID were given a bit of hope when Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said that she wanted to repeal the REAL ID Act , the federal government 's failed plan to impose a national identification card through state driver 's licenses .
But what has taken place since is no return to sanity , as political machi nations have produced a cosmetic makeover called " PASS ID " that has revived the push for a national identification card .
The PASS ID Act ( S. 1261 ) seeks to make many of the same ineffectual , dangerous changes the REAL ID Act attempted to impose .
Fundamentally , PASS ID operates on the same flawed premise of REAL ID — that requiring various " identity documents " ( and storing that information in databases for later access ) will magically make state drivers ' licenses more legitimate , which will in turn improve national security .
WELLINGTON ( Reuters ) -
An extremely drunk , naked man lost his way at a New Zealand hotel and ended up sleeping in the wrong room , forcing its female occupant to hide in the bathroom , local media reported .
The 29 year - old Australian man had gone back the hotel in the resort town of Queenstown with a woman , but got up in the night and wandered into a bedroom where a couple were sleeping .
“ He was a bit surprised that there were two people in his room and he was butt naked , ” Sergeant Steve Watt of Queenstown police told the Southland Times .
As the intruder slept , the startled woman took refuge in the bathroom as her husband summoned hotel staff .
The man , who could not remember whom he had been with nor what room he had been in , and had no clothes or wallet .
Police gave him a ride home clad in a hotel bathrobe , but let him off after the guests and hotel decided not to press charges .
“ It was far too funny , ” said Watt .

He could have been a contender in 2012 .
Now it 's looking like South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford might not even make it to the end of his term .
On Wednesday morning , Lieutenant Governor Andre Bauer called on Sanford to step down , urging Sanford to consider the well - being of the Palmetto State .
Bauer , according to the Associated Press , reiterated his offer to back out of the 2010 gubernatorial race if Sanford leaves office now .
Bauer said rumors and discussion of Sanford 's impeachment could " dominate next year 's legislative session instead of issues like the economy and job creation . "
Bauer is the latest in a long line of Republican lawmakers urging Sanford 's exit .
In late June , for instance , 10 state senators said they wanted the governor gone .
And on July 6 , the South Carolina Republican Party voted to censure Sanford .
( The party never explicitly suggested he resign . )
Still , Sanford clung to his post , claiming that he despite his moral failings , he was still fit for political office .
" If the good Lord 's going to make changes in your life , you 've gotta stick around for the process , " Sanford said .
Sanford 's term as governor expires in January of 2011 .
" People need to take their personal , political considerations off the table and think about what 's best for the state , " a Bauer spokesman said in a statement yesterday .
It 's been a turbulent few months for Sanford , to put it lightly .
In June , Sanford vanished without a trace from the public radar ; aides assured the press he was only hiking the Appalachian Trail .
Wrong .
Instead , Sanford , a well - liked governor with a good shot at the GOP presidential nomination in ' 12 , was dallying in South America with a longtime Argentinian lover .
Worse yet : on at least a few occasions , Sanford had funded his affair with taxpayer dough .
This from a guy who earned major plaudits from conservatives for his initial rejection of federal stimulus funds .
( Forget the fact that he later accepted the bulk of that money anyway . )
After a strained press conference admitting the affairs , Sanford proceeded to dig himself a nice little hole .
He repeatedly referred to María Belén Chapur , whom he met in Uruguay years earlier , as a " soul mate . "
Then he admitted he'd " crossed the lines " with a handful of women since he'd been married .
Then he consider resigning .
Then he decided against it .
" Immediately after all this unfolded last week I had thought I would resign -- as I believe in the military model of leadership and when trust of any form is broken one lays down the sword , " Sanford said at the time .
" A long list of close friends have suggested otherwise -- that for God to really work in my life I should n't be getting off so lightly . "
Regardless of what any higher powers think , Sanford now has Bauer to deal with , along with a cadre of angry South Carolina politicians who just want to get back to work .
Maybe it 's time for the governor of the Palmetto State to follow fellow disgraced Republican George Allen -- lay low , hang your head , and wait for the right opportunity to dive back into the fray .

WPost : All the Ex - President 's Excuses Editor ’s Note : Many Americans still view the Washington Post through the prism of the Watergate scandal and “ All the President ’s Men , ” gutsy reporters doing the hard work to hold corrupt government officials accountable , backed up by brave editors .
Sadly , that reputation – earned from events some 35 years ago – has long since given way to an insider culture that promotes the neoconservative ideology and continues to make excuses for the Bush administration ’s crimes , as ex-CIA analyst Melvin A. Goodman notes in this guest essay :
Under the stewardship of Fred Hiatt , the editorial and op - ed pages of the Washington Post have gradually moved to the right .
Email
Printer friendly
Post editorials and op - eds have defended the decision to go to war in Iraq ; opposed any improvement in bilateral relations with Russia ; refused to acknowledge Israel ’s misuse of military power in the Middle East ; and lobbied against the need for investigation of the detention and interrogation programs of the Bush administration .
As part of the campaign to prevent a rigorous examination of “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” ( read : “ torture and abuse ” ) , the Washington Post 's editorial pages have been particularly protective of the Central Intelligence Agency and its senior leaders – the ideological drivers for torture and extraordinary renditions policies .
These CIA leaders , particularly deputy director Steven Kappes and acting general counsel John Rizzo , are not trying to protect the reputation and mission of the CIA ; they are trying to protect themselves .
Surely senior journalists from the mainstream media must understand that reliance on anonymous CIA clandestine sources is neither good reporting nor professional journalism .
Many of these “ anonymous sources ” almost certainly are former and current CIA officials seeking to protect themselves .
George Tenet , John McLaughlin and John Brennan are individuals who fit that description .
In the past several days , the Post has carried editorials and op - eds by its own editorial writer David Ignatius ; its longtime national security writer Walter Pincus ; former CIA director Porter Goss ; former CIA operative Michael Scheuer ; and Marc Thiessen , a former chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush .
These articles have been similar in content and similar to the statements of other CIA directors past and present ( Leon Panetta , Michael Hayden , Goss , Tenet , and John Deutch ) who opposed the release of the memoranda of the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel that justified the use of torture and abuse .
The Scheuer article is particularly scurrilous , accusing President Obama of self - righteousness and intellectual arrogance ” in deciding to release the torture memos .
Scheuer believes that an end to torture will lead to future terrorist attacks that could involve the “ loss of major cities and tens of thousands of countrymen , ” and that the president will bear some responsibility .
Scheuer , an aggressive proponent of torture and abuse , was the leader of the CIA ’s Osama bin Laden unit in the 1990s .
His behavior at CIA was so bizarre that he was eventually quarantined by the Agency , spending the last few years of his employment in the Agency ’s library without access to classified documents .
Covering Up
These Post articles also reflect the opinion of key members of the CIA ’s National Clandestine Service and Office of the General Counsel , who want to cover up CIA war crimes and prevent any authoritative investigation of the CIA ’s creation , operation and maintenance of its detention and interrogation programs .
The CIA took a similar stance in trying to block investigations of such intelligence failures as the inability to track the decline of the Soviet Union in the 1980s ; the 9/11 intelligence failure in 2001 ; and the provision of specious intelligence to the White House and the Congress of the United States in the run-up to the war with Iraq in 2003 .
The leader of the Washington Post editorial squad has been Ignatius , who has developed close relations with CIA clandestine operatives over a period that spans three decades .
Ignatius ’s key source in the 1970s was the late Robert Ames , one of the most successful clandestine officers in the history of the CIA .
Ames was the source for most of Ignatius ’s writings on the Middle East as well as for his novel about CIA clandestine tradecraft , “ Agents of Innocence . ”
Over the years , retired and active members of the directorate of operations have taken their stories to Ignatius ; they have been rewarded by Ignatius ’s one - sided accounts of CIA derring - do and willingness to ignore operational and analytical failures .
Ignatius is welcome to his opinion on these matters , of course , but he should not be permitted to create facts that do n’t square with the history of the recent past .
A comparison of the recent op - eds by Ignatius and Goss , a former CIA clandestine operative and a former chairman of the House intelligence Committee as well as the CIA director during the period of torture and abuse , is particularly revealing .
Both Ignatius and Goss argue that foreign intelligence services will not share sensitive intelligence with the United States and the CIA because of the declassification and release of the torture memoranda .
That is nonsense !
The truth is that European liaison services as well as other intelligence services have tempered their cooperation with the CIA because of the use of torture and abuse as well as the extraordinary rendition of innocent individuals from their countries to intelligence services in the Middle East .
The CIA ’s extra-legal activities have complicated and undermined the task of maintaining credible relations with our allies in the battle against terrorism .
CIA Morale
Both Ignatius and Goss argue that , because of the release of the memos , CIA clandestine operatives will keep their heads down and avoid assignments that carry political risk , and that the decline in CIA “ morale and effectiveness ” will harm American national security .
More nonsense !
CIA operatives and analysts are professionals who pride themselves on service to the country and their oath to the Constitution .
Very few of them took part in the corruption of intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and very few participated in the policies of torture and abuse .
They know that the law should not be broken and they want to get these issues behind them so that they can continue to serve the national interests of the United States .
They know that painful truths must be acknowledged and that some price must be paid by all for the chicanery of a few .
If Agency personnel were permitted to share their opinions about torture and abuse with the press , a large majority would oppose the practices .
Unfortunately , only those officers seeking to cover - up their own activities have the temerity to talk to reporters .
The notion that the declassification of these memoranda have given the “ enemy invaluable information about the rules by which we operate ” is particularly ludicrous .
The enemy has had this information for more than five years , ever since every major newspaper in the world published the unconscionable images from Abu Ghraib .
General officers who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan have testified that these images are the most important recruitment tool in the hands of terrorists and fundamentalists and have contributed to the deaths of many American men and women .
Two of the most senior Post writers , David Broder and Walter Pincus , who have been reporting on national political and national security issues for decades , joined the apologists for CIA actions .
Pincus argues that previous investigations of CIA transgressions damaged the Agency .
He ignores the fact that the Church Commission in the 1970s led to the creation of the Senate and House intelligence oversight committees as well as the introductions of “ findings ” that made sure a president had to vet plans for covert action with the oversight committees .
And Pincus fails to note that the CIA ’s illegal role in the Iran - Contra scandal led to the creation of an independent , statutory Inspector General to make sure that CIA transgressions could be inspected internally and reported to the Justice Department whenever necessary .
Well - Debated Policy ?
Broder wrongly tells us that the Justice Department memos on torture demonstrate that the Bush administration conducted a “ deliberate , and internally well - debated policy decision , made in the proper places …by the proper officials . ”
If he had read the memos more carefully , he would have concluded that there were no policy debates regarding torture and abuse , extraordinary renditions , and secret prisons .
Professional interrogators , for example , were excluded from the discussions .
Thiessen , the chief speechwriter for President Bush and perhaps the author of Bush ’s claim that “ we do n’t torture , ” resorts to misinformation to make his case .
He states that the waterboarding of Khalid Sheik Mohammed ( waterboarded 183 times ) led to the discovery of a plot to destroy a building in Los Angeles , but that operation had been compromised more than a year before KSM was captured .
Thiessen claims no critical information would have been gained from Abu Zubaydah ( waterboarded 83 times ) without the use of waterboarding .
FBI and CIA officials have testified , however , that all relevant information from Zubaydah was obtained with traditional interrogation measures and that Zubaydah did n’t have a great deal of intelligence to offer .
Thiessen ’s assertion that the 2004 report of the CIA ’s Inspector General concluded that waterboarding “ yielded critical information ” is almost certainly made up out of whole cloth ; it is unlikely that Thiessen has seen that report , which has not been released .
Actually , we know from the authoritative 2004 report from the CIA ’s Inspector General that there was no proof that torture enabled the Bush administration to thwart “ specific imminent attacks ” and that the CIA ’s Office of Medical Services ( OMS ) concluded that the risks to the health of prisoners outweighed any potential intelligence benefit .
It is noteworthy that once the OMS got involved in the use of waterboarding , the tactic was halted .
FBI Director Robert Mueller also has stated that no intelligence from “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” disrupted any attacks on the United States .
The CIA IG added that the CIA had no way of distinguishing detainees with relevant information from those who did not , which meant that many prisoners were tortured unnecessarily .
Even the editorial gurus of the Washington Post must know that White House speechwriters are unlikely to have access to such documents and are unlikely to have sufficient information to discuss such issues authoritatively .
But that does n’t stop them from publishing propaganda from Thiessen or regular commentary from Michael Gerson , another chief speechwriter and apologist for President Bush .
Thiessen ’s charge that President Obama ’s decision to release the torture memoranda is “ one of the most dangerous and irresponsible acts every by an American president during a time of war — and Americans may die as a result ” is obscene and irresponsible .
Ironically , Goss acknowledges at the end of his op - ed that the “ bottom line is that we cannot succeed unless we have good intelligence . ”
Professional interrogators from military and civilian agencies have testified that torture and abuse do not lead to good intelligence .
And Broder concludes that we needed an investigation after 9/11 to understand “ the flawed performances and gaps in the system and make the necessary repairs to reduce the chances of a deadly repetition . ”
Like 9/11 , only a serious investigation will allow us to understand the flawed processes and the gaps in the system .
Unlike 9/11 , the Bush administration ’s approval of torture and abuse served to undermine the reputation of the United States , the legitimacy of our aims , and the moral fiber of the people who engage in such depravity .

Back to Home Page
Over the past week , most people have noticed significant changes in the SERPs at Google .
Web sites that previously held number one positions have dropped to number 89 , and some web sites have disappeared off the Google results pages altogether .
As is the case with all major Google updates , SEOs have been panicking in forums and there has been much discussion about one topic in particular : reciprocal linking .
The first thing you have to do to understand the direction in which Google is taking with this update , is to get into the minds of the people who run it .
Something that is so often overlooked is the fact that Google ( and any other search engine ) is first and foremost , a business .
The reason they offer the service they do , is to make money , to make stocks soar and to keep shareholders happy .
GoogleÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s income comes from many sources , but the main one is advertising .
In order to be able to sell their advertising real estate for a profitable price , the ad space needs to be seen .
In order for the ad space to be seen , many , many , many people must visit the Google web site and use the Google search engine .
In order for Google traffic to be at such a level , Google must offer a great , if not the best , search engine service .
So , how does Google offer , or attempt to offer , the absolute best service possible ?
By having the most relevant , and most useful search results .
Useful and relevant web sites are sites that are extremely visitor - friendly , sites that offer a lot of quality information in many different forms , from RSS feeds , to articles , to forums .
Sites that are organized and have developed , naturally , a respect on the internet .
A great example of such a site is About.com – search for any topic on About.com and you get a page with a lot of information on that topic and many , many links to other web sites that carry further information .
It is , undoubtedly , one of the best places on the Internet to go for information .
Now , hereÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s where it gets tricky .
In the past , Google has evaluated web sites by looking at areas of the site that are easily manipulated by webmasters and SEOs , such as meta tags , alt tags , keyword density , page titles , etc .
We all know this has changed .
Google has begun to reward sites with a more natural approach to these areas , and to penalize sites that have been over - optimized .
The key now , is visitor - friendly , natural web sites .
Google will attract more repeat users , and thus , more advertising capital , if their search results always yield web sites that have the information searchers are looking for and are easy to use and understand .
Natural web sites are web sites whoÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s page titles reflect the page content in an easily understandable way .
They are web sites whoÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s keywords meta tags contain only the words that apply to the page content .
They have description tags that reflect the content in a concise , easily understood way .
They have image alt tags that describe the image properly .
Most importantly , natural web sites are web sites that develop a natural link popularity .
That is to say , they donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t have someone working on finding web sites to swap links with .
This is an unnatural linking strategy .
A natural linking strategy is to offer a good , resourceful web site and have people link to it of their own accord because itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s such a great resource .
Such a strategy also includes linking out to quality web sites that offer further information on your web siteÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s topic , whether or not they link back to you .
This is a huge indicator that the goal of your web site is simply to offer the best information possible to web site visitors .
Cross-promotion will happen naturally as well , and links that are a result of cross-promotion are still considered a natural linking strategy , and as a result , Google or any other search engine cannot not outlaw reciprocal linking all together .
But you have to be extremely picky about the sites you decide to engage in cross-promotion with .
They must be very relevant and should have a decent presence on Google .
Stay away from automated linking programs , link farms and most importantly , exchanging links with excessive amounts of web sites .
Your links page should look like an excellent place for your visitors to go should they require further information on the topic your site deals with .
In short , the most important factor contributing to your Google ranking , is visitor - friendliness .
Amassing enormous amounts of link exchanges simply does not work anymore .
You absolutely must have your web site visitorÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s needs foremost in your mind .
If you meet those needs , you will be rewarded both in your rankings and in repeat traffic .

The problem has boggled the minds of Web designers for years : fixed , fluid , elastic or a hybrid layout design ?
Each option has its benefits and disadvantages .
But the final decision depends so much on usability that it is not one to be made lightly .
So , with all the confusion , is there a right decision ?
By considering a few factors and properly setting up the final design , you can end up with a successful layout design that reaps all the benefits .
This article discusses the pros and cons of each type of layout .
Either one can be used to make a successful website layout , as long as you keep usability in mind .
Why all the debate ?
Web page design comes down to usability , and this can be difficult to balance because website users can account for many different variables among them .
When designing a website layout for a large audience , the designer must consider the following potential differences among visitors :
Screen resolution ,
Browser choice ,
Whether or not the browser is maximized ,
Extra toolbars open in the browser ( History , Bookmarks , etc. ) ,
Even the operating system and hardware .
Without the benefit of a standardized website size to work with , Web designers encounter numerous problems when it ’s time to get to work .
1. Difference Between Fixed And Fluid Layouts
Although most designers and developers would consider defining fixed and fluid website layouts to be elementary , we ’ll go over it just to be clear .
Fixed Website Layouts
A fixed website layout has a wrapper that is a fixed width , and the components inside it have either percentage widths or fixed widths .
The important thing is that the container ( wrapper ) element is set to not move .
No matter what screen resolution the visitor has , he or she will see the same width as other visitors .
The image above shows the general outline of a fixed - width website layout .
The components inside are fixed to 520 , 200 and 200 pixels , respectively .
A 960 - pixel width has become the standard in modern Web design because most website users are assumed to browse in 1024x768 resolution or higher .
Fluid Website Layouts
In a fluid website layout , also referred to as a liquid layout , the majority of the components inside have percentage widths , and thus adjust to the user ’s screen resolution .
The image above shows a fluid ( liquid ) website layout .
While some designers may give set widths to certain elements in fluid layouts , such as margins , the layout in general uses percentage widths so that the view is adjusted for each user .
2. Fixed Web Page Design
Many designers prefer fixed layouts to fluid ones because they ’re easier to make and provide more assurance that what the designer sees , the user sees .
However , the pros and cons come out even with fluid - layout design .
Pros
Fixed - width layouts are much easier to use and easier to customize in terms of design .
Widths are the same for every browser , so there is less hassle with images , forms , video and other content that are fixed - width .
There is no need for min-width or max - width , which is n’t supported by every browser anyway .
Even if a website is designed to be compatible with the smallest screen resolution , 800x600 , the content will still be wide enough at a larger resolution to be easily legible .
Cons
A fixed - width layout may create excessive white space for users with larger screen resolutions , thus upsetting “ divine proportion , ” the “ Rule of Thirds , ” overall balance and other design principles .
Smaller screen resolutions may require a horizontal scroll bar , depending the fixed layout ’s width .
Seamless textures , patterns and image continuation are needed to accommodate those with larger resolutions .
Fixed - width layouts generally have a lower overall score when it comes to usability .
Examples of Fixed - Page Design
Here are five examples from designers who get the most out of fixed - width layouts .
These websites incorporate many design elements , a perfect scenario in which to use a fixed layout .
The designers have more control over the placement of extra design elements around the content areas and can work with the content and navigation widths more precisely .
Notice how in all of these examples , the designers use continuous imagery to work with larger screen resolutions .
3. Getting Around The Cons Of Fixed Web Page Design
If you ’ve decided on a fixed page design , you should know these few tricks to get around the cons of this layout and create a successful design .
Looking at the Statistics
Today , most designers assume that the majority of Internet users have a screen resolution of 1024x768 or higher .
According to a poll published by W3Schools , this is not the case ( please notice that one should take the W3Schools statistics with a grain of salt , more details about it follow below ) :
As you can see , 640x480 does n’t even register on the chart .
W3Schools ’ analysis found a whopping 0 % of users have this screen resolution .
While , in fact , some users actually do have this screen resolution , the statistics show that they make up a small enough percentage that designers should be able to ignore the size and still offer wide usability .
Even for people who do use this resolution size , they probably use it mainly on smaller portable computers and would n’t use it as their primary screen resolution normally .
However , these statistics are probably not as accurate as one might hope .
Because W3Schools ’ visitors primarily belong to a certain demographic ( designers and developers ) , the information is a little biased .
Other research sources show different findings , but only slightly different .
According to resolution statistics from individual companies in 2009 , the 800x600 screen resolution showed up at somewhere under 10 % of users .
This next interesting table comes from SohTanaka.com , whose blogger has done a bit of research comparing how some of the largest websites accommodated screen resolutions in February 2006 versus February 2008 .
For all four major websites in the study , there was a complete turnaround .
Even the biggest companies on the Web are now assuming that their audiences have larger screen resolutions .
For other research on screen resolution , have a look through the sources below :
960 px or 760 px ?
All this being said , most designers choose a fixed width of either 960 or 760 pixels .
A layout 960 pixels wide looks good for users with a 1024x768 resolution or above , with a bit of room for margins .
For designers who want to accommodate the approximately 10 % of users with a 800x600 screen resolution , the 760 - pixel - wide layout works well , and is still suitable for larger screens .
Always Center the Layout
When working with a fixed width design , be sure to at least center the wrapper div to maintain a sense of balance ( margin : 0 auto ; usually does the trick ) .
Otherwise , for users with large screen resolutions , the entire layout will be tucked away in the corner .
4. Fluid Web Page Design
Designers may not use fluid page designs for various reasons , but the layout ’s benefits are often overlooked .
Below are pros and cons to think about when considering fluid web page design .
Pros
Fluid web page design can be more user - friendly , because it adjusts to the user ’s set up .
The amount of extra white space is similar between all browsers and screen resolutions , which can be more visually appealing .
If designed well , a fluid layout can eliminate horizontal scroll bars in smaller screen resolutions .
Cons
The designer has less control over what the user sees and may overlook problems because the layout looks fine on their specific screen resolution .
Images , video and other types of content with set widths may need to be set at multiple widths to accommodate different screen resolutions .
With incredibly large screen resolutions , a lack of content may create excess white space that can diminish aesthetic appeal .
Examples of Fluid Page Design
Below are two designs that use percentage widths to accommodate different screen resolutions .
The first example in each set alters the width of the content according to screen width , while the second screenshot uses varying widths for the white space .
5. Getting Fluid Web Page Design To Work
Even though fluid layouts can present a few problems , some of those problems can be overcome with a few tricks .
Use Simple Design
The less a fluid Web design depends on graphics and difficult techniques , the easier it will be to create and maintain .
It will also be more compatible with alternate screen resolutions .
With cleaner code and design , compatibility problems are more easily prevented , found and dealt with .
Smashing Magazine , for example , uses a fluid Web page layout , and to make it simple only the top black - and - orange navigation bar expands , depending on the user ’s situation .
Otherwise , the content area expands and contracts as needed , and smart use of CSS covers situations in which the sidebar and internal content could clash .
Min-width and Max - width
Two CSS properties , min-width and max - width , can be used to create a fixed width if the user ’s screen is too small or too big for the layout to be usable .
In this case , the layout gets a scroll bar and functions essentially as a fixed - width layout .
Look over W3Schools ’ pages on the min-width and max - width CSS properties below for more details :
Unfortunately , most versions of Internet Explorer do n’t support min-width and max - width .
Getting around this is simple , though , with an IE - specific expression .
Read more about that in the article Maximum and Minimum Height and Width in Internet Explorer .
6. Elastic Design
There is a third option when working with Web page layouts .
An elastic design is sometimes preferred by designers because it mixes the two other main layout types .
It works by sizing all elements with em ’s .
The quote below explains exactly what an em is and why it can be beneficial .
“ A pixel is an unscalable dot on a computer screen , whereas an em is a square of its font size .
Because font sizes vary , the em is a relative unit that responds to users ’ text - size preferences . ”
- Patrick Griffiths , A List Apart
While elastic design is supposed to offer more benefits , it still has its pros and cons like the other two layout styles .
Pros
If implemented correctly , this layout style can be very user - friendly .
The goal is to have everything grow larger or smaller in proportion with the user ’s preference .
Elastic layouts are perfect for designers who love both fluid and fixed designs , because the pros of each are found in elastic layouts .
Cons
Even given the first pro above , this type of layout can create a huge problem with usability .
It takes a lot of savvy and testing to get the layout right for all users .
This type of layout is much more difficult to create than the other two , and the extra bit of usability it brings may not always seem worth it .
Depending on the specifics of the layout , some elastic designs may require supplementary style sheets and cheats for IE6 .
Examples of Elastic Page Design
Elastic and fluid layouts are incredibly similar in appearance , so much so that they are usually confused with each other .
However , elastic designs use em ’s instead of percentages and depend primarily on font size .
These designs adjust to the text size that users set for their browser .
7. Which Is Right For Your Website ?
Choosing between a fixed and fluid website will depend a lot on the type of website itself .
Weigh the pros and cons above to determine the right solution for your website .
A portfolio website , for example , would probably be best shown in a fixed - width layout , so that you have more control over the design .
Not only will you be able to better control the layout of individual elements in the design , but the images in your portfolio showcase will be better handled with a fixed width .
Many designers , not just those with portfolios , may prefer fixed - width layouts for the ease of use and assurance it gives them .
Any designer who seeks 100 % compatibility should take the time to set up a fluid layout .
In such a case , the main challenge is n’t the excess of white space in large screen resolutions , but rather the small percentage of users with a small screen resolution .
For websites with large audiences , accommodating even the smallest percentage of users may be important .
But even beyond that , websites with large audiences should have a simple and clean design anyway , which can be done effectively with a fluid layout .
Still ca n’t decide ?
An elastic or partially elastic design is still an option .
When used correctly , elastic layouts can bring the biggest benefits of both other types < .
Designers will often employ the elastic - layout principle in using em ’s for fonts and containers , and then use a smart mix of percentages and pixel widths to set the rest of the layout elements .
What Other Designers Say
Comment by Heidi Cool on Fixed vs. Liquid vs. Elastic Layout
This designer makes some great points about working with other people who will be using the layout and may not know as much about Web design :
“ I go back and forth on this issue .
We use a fixed width at case .
edu because : Liquid is more complicated , and we distribute templated designs to users of varying skills who might easily break a liquid layout .
( They ’re actually regular HTML files rather than Dreamweaver templates . )
We want to ensure our maintainers do n’t build pages with line lengths that are too long and thus harder to read .
We try to limit the space available because people have a tendency of filling up whatever space is available .
If they have large monitors they could really overcrowd a page not realize how messy it gets on smaller displays .
As you can see the bulk of these issues relate to the fact that our sites are distributed and built and maintained by people of varying skill levels .
If I were working on one site alone and I was doing the coding , then I ’d base the decision on goals , content , etc . ”
Comment by madr on Where Have All the Flexible Designs Gone ?
Two more good points are made here about using fixed - width layouts :
“ Banners and ads are usually made with images and Flash movies , making it harder to do an elastic or flexible design .
I have worked in the newspaper world for a year and a half , and the ads really are a holy cow in these areas .
So are article images , for which an elastic layout would make the viewing area too big for the top image .
Every browser but Safari 3 and below ( Safari 4 is coming ) , Firefox 2 and below and IE6 and below ( which are to be viewed as obsolete / deprecated soon ) have support for page zoom instead of text resizing , making the time to accomplish a flexible and elastic design hard to justify since the majority of the visitors wo n’t even notice it . ”
Comment by jphilapy on Where Have All the Flexible Designs Gone ?
Two good points in support of fluid - width layouts :
“ Flexible sites can be made to work at many resolutions .
There is no need for heated debates or research about user screen sizes .
Besides , screen resolution statistics are a myth ; few people run their browser full - screen and many have toolbars , sidebars , or other widgets that use valuable screen estate .
Mobile phones , such as the iPhone , and games consoles are becoming viable alternatives for web browsing .
In general , these devices have smaller resolutions and can benefit from flexible web designs . ”
Comment by Calrion on About Fluid - and Fixed - Width Layouts Clear case for using elastic designs :
“ I think the ‘ elastic ’ layout is the best option .
Fluid to a point , then fixed to ensure lines of text , etc. , do n’t become ridiculously long .
I ’m a Windows user , and I maximize .
Mostly , I maximize because I can get the best look at whatever app I ’m using , and because I generally have large amounts of detritus on my desktop .
Additionally , maximizing my browser ( Firefox ) allows the maximum space for interface elements , specifically the links toolbar and tabbed area .
In terms of usability , fluid is probably best for savvy users , as their browser width is in control .
For less experienced users , elastic is probably best , as it will automatically stop itself from becoming too wide . ”
Comment by Georg on About Fluid - and Fixed - Width Layouts
An explanation of how one designer uses a mix of all three to get the best results :
“ Fluid main part , fixed sidebars and ( maybe ) some elastic parts is my preferred layout method .
I always keep text areas within 600 px max - width though , and hack IE / win .
Using min/max for the whole page , so it ’ll stay within 600 - 1200 px and centers above .
The same hacks for IE / win .
Testing everything on 600 to 2400 wide screens , and leave the rest to each visitor .
Text lines will not get too wide ( 600 px max ) , and the page does n’t break too early under stress .
Most comments
I get are that visitors do n’t notice anything that really disturbs them , and that it makes easy read .
Guess that means that it ’s a working compromise .
Your site works fine for me , so I ’ll call it a good compromise .
My old eyes say the text is a bit too small , so I zoom it to 200 % in Opera on a 1280 screen .
No problems whatsoever . ”

WASHINGTON  The White House tried Monday to douse speculation that it might raise taxes on the middle class in violation of President Obama ’s campaign promise , just a day after two of his top economic advisers left the door open to such a move to rein in spiraling deficits .
Mr. Obama told his economic team in a meeting at the White House that he intended to stand by his promise not to increase taxes on families making less than $ 250,000 , aides said .
He then sent his spokesman out to repeat that message in front of the television cameras .
“ The president made a commitment in the campaign .
He ’s clear about that commitment , and he ’s going to keep it , ” said Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary .
The renewal of the promise came a day after Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers , director of the National Economic Council , both refused to rule out tax increases on the middle class while discussing ways to pare the deficit .
The two were speaking on separate Sunday morning talk shows , venues where administration officials are usually well prepared on the official line before appearing .

GAFFNEY , South Carolina ( CNN ) --
Investigators believe the serial killer blamed for five deaths in South Carolina died in a shootout with police in neighboring North Carolina on Monday , a South Carolina state police official said .
Patrick Tracy Burris , 41 , was believed to be the suspect in five slayings in South Carolina , authorities say .
Tests on the gun found on 41 - year - old Patrick Tracy Burris match the weapon used in the killings that have haunted Gaffney , South Carolina , since June 27 , said Reggie Lloyd , director of South Carolina 's State Law Enforcement Division .
The dead suspect and his vehicle appear to match descriptions circulated by investigators in Gaffney , he said .
" We believe a killer is off the streets , " Lloyd said .
Burris was killed early Monday morning in Dallas , North Carolina , after police received a call about a possible burglary in progress , officers there said .
At a news conference Monday evening , investigators described him as a " habitual felon " with a record in several states who was on probation at the time he was killed .
When police arrived at the home , they found inside two people who lived there and a third who was an acquaintance , said Bill Blanton , the sheriff of Cherokee County , South Carolina .
Police checked Burris ' background and found there was an outstanding warrant on him from a probation violation from Lincoln County , North Carolina .
Watch Lloyd say why police think they 've got their man »
When police attempted to serve the warrant , Burris shot at the officers , who returned fire , Blanton said .
One officer was shot in the leg and was treated and released from a hospital , police said .
At a news conference Monday night , Lloyd held up what he said was Burris ' 25 - page rap sheet , including a lengthy history of armed robberies , forgeries , break - ins and several other charges from several states .
" At some point the criminal justice system is going to have to explain why this individual was out on the streets -- we owe that to the victims , " he said .
About 100 investigators from North and South Carolina were working the case , Blanton said .
Leaves for all members of the Gaffney Police Department and the Sheriff 's Department were canceled , their respective chiefs have said .
The first shooting occurred June 27 , when peach farmer Kline W. Cash , 63 , was killed .
His wife found him dead in their home , the sheriff 's office said , and Blanton said the home may have been robbed .
Four days later , the bound and shot bodies of Hazel Linder , 83 , and her 50 - year - old daughter , Gena Linder Parker , were found in Linder 's home , where she lived alone .
Blanton said authorities are still trying to determine if anything was taken from that home .
The killer 's last victim was 15 - year - old Abby Tyler , who was shot last week and died Saturday .
Her father Stephen Tyler , 48 , had been pronounced dead at the scene of the shooting , in their family - run furniture and appliance store .
See a map of where the bodies were found »
Lloyd said investigators had evidence that put Burris at the scene of the killings , but did not know a motive .
" There 's no hard evidence as to what connections he had with this community or why he targeted these victims , " Lloyd said .
He added that the investigation is ongoing , and that officials are trying to determine what the suspect was up to between the killings and after the last the shooting .
" We do n't believe at this point anyone else was involved in the murders , but anything could turn up , " he said .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A member of Congress Friday called on the State Department to stop doing business with Xe , the North Carolina - based security company formerly known as Blackwater Worldwide .
Rep. Jan Schakowsky , D - Illinois , on Friday urged the State Department " not to enter into further contracts " with Xe .
Rep. Jan Schakowsky , D - Illinois , asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton whether the State Department had just signed a new $ 20 million dollar contract with Xe for Iraq , saying she is " very concerned " that the State Department may be signing new security contracts with Xe , both in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" I urge you not to enter into further contracts with Xe and to immediately review any existing contracts , " the letter said , according to a copy provided to CNN .
" The behavior and actions of both the company 's leadership and a number of individuals employed by the company have harmed our mission in Iraq and Afghanistan and endangered the lives and welfare of our troops and diplomatic personnel serving overseas . "
The State Department decided in January not to renew a personnel protection contract with Blackwater , as the company was then known , when it expired in May .
That decision came amidst an investigation by both U.S. and Iraqi authorities of a 2007 shooting involving Blackwater guards in Baghdad in which 17 Iraqis were killed .
The company has repeatedly denied any wrong - doing .
The State Department did not immediately respond to a request Friday for reaction to Schakowsky 's questions and criticism .
The State Department had said that it would continue a Blackwater air - support contract after the much - larger personnel protection contract ended .
Xe spokeswoman Stacy DeLuke told CNN that , " Right now we have no contracts with the State Department in Iraq . "
DeLuke said the company would review calls for bids to provide security for U.S. officials in Afghanistan .
" The thing is we are totally open to bidding on some of the contracts that may come up in Afghanistan just like anyone else , " DeLuke said in a telephone interview .
The Nation magazine released an article Friday that said the State Department had signed a new contract for Iraq with Xe for $ 20 million to extend an earlier aviation contract .
" The State Department contract is scheduled to run through September 3 .
In May , the State Department announced it was not renewing Blackwater 's Iraq contract , and the Iraqi government has refused to issue the company an operating license , " the article said .
The controversy over the role of Blackwater in Iraq was revived earlier this week by a lawsuit filed in Virginia by two former employees accusing Blackwater guards of smuggling weapons and using excessive force in Iraq .
And the lawsuit claims Blackwater founder Erik Prince " views himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe . "
Xe said in a statement that it would respond " to the anonymous unsubstantiated and offensive assertions put forward by the plaintiffs , " in a brief to be filed August 17 .
Blackwater changed its name to Xe in February .

August 29th : As the fires rage in Southern California , the “ Station Fire ” continues to burn unnervingly close to the famous Mount Wilson Observatory , about 50 miles east from my location .
The above image was captured at 8:29 pm ( PST ) tonight from the observatory ’s 150 - foot Solar Tower webcam ( called the “ Towercam ” ) , and it ’s pretty obvious how close the fire is .
Mount Wilson is n’t just important for the observatory , it is also home to telecommunication masts that are a lifeline for emergency services .
“ If Mount Wilson goes out , this news conference is done , because we wo n’t have any telecommunications , ” Deputy Los Angeles County Fire Chief Jim Powers said in a press conference this morning .
Update ( August 30th , 19:40 PST ) :
Things are looking a little grim for Mt. Wilson .
A couple of hours ago , the LA Times reported that the Station Fire was expected to reach the summit of Mt. Wilson in 2 - 4 hours .
The worst news is , that due to a lack of escape routes at the observatory , fire crews will have to abandon the site should the fire get too close .
“ It ’s a serious situation , ” said Bob Shindelar , operations branch director of California Incident Management Team 5 .
“ Is the observatory going to make it ?
We ’re doing everything in our power .
But I would n’t be surprised if it is impacted by fire today or tomorrow . ”
At 17:42 PST , the fire was within 2 miles of the summit and closing .
Fire crews have been working on removing brush from the observatory buildings , structures that cover many acres .
I was driving through Woodland Hills today , and the view from here was ominous .
The smoke is thick , and a huge cumulus cloud was rising high in the atmosphere .
At one point , the scene looked like a volcano from a distance .
Reports from the observatory itself however remain a little more upbeat than the LA Times with this update on their website :
The LA Times has released this article in the last hour .
Our reports on site are not presently so dire , but the “ fog of war ” certainly exists in a situation like this .
Every preparation is being made for this scenario , and it may indeed yet happen .
I remain optimistic for now .
Lets hope the spreading fire slows before it reaches the observatory and telecommunication masts …
Updates pending …

However small it may be , it most likely is directly attributed to all of the teams he single handedly torched this year during the regular season and playoffs .
Fans of opposing teams ca n’t enjoy seeing one man destroy their club .
Then again , it could also have to do with his unsportsmanlike attitude after being sent fishing by the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals .

Environment correspondent , BBC News
Some regions of the UK are likely to see more floods , especially in winter
The UK needs to plan now for a future that will be hotter and bring greater extremes of flood and drought , says Environment Secretary Hilary Benn .
Launching the UK Climate Projections 2009 report ( UKCP09 ) , Mr Benn told MPs that the UK climate will change even with a global deal on emissions .
By 2080 , London will be between 2C and 6C hotter than it is now , he said .
Every part of the UK is likely to be wetter in winter and drier in summer , according to the projections .
Summer rainfall could decrease by about 20 % in the south of England and in Yorkshire and Humberside by the middle of the century .
These projections show us the future we need to avoid , and the future we need to plan for
Hilary Benn
See projections for your region
Scotland and the north - west of England could see winter rainfall increase by a similar amount .
The government hopes UKCP09 will allow citizens , local authorities and businesses to plan for future decades .
It uses computer models of the world 's climate to make projections of parameters such as temperature , rainfall and wind .
" Climate change is going to transform the way we live , " said Mr Benn .
" These projections show us the future we need to avoid , and the future we need to plan for . "
UK CLIMATE PROJECTIONS
By the 2080s , average summer temperatures could be up to six degrees warmer in parts of southern England Average summer rainfall could decrease by 22 % in the already water - stressed southern England An increase of 16 % in winter rainfall in the North West , increasing the amount of rain on the wettest days leading to higher flood risk BACK {current} of {total} NEXT
An effective global deal at December 's UN climate talks in Copenhagen could keep the summer temperature rise in southern England to about 2C , the projections suggest .
But if greenhouse gas emissions rise quickly , that figure could be as high as 12C , Mr Benn said .
Probable futures
The UK Met Office , which led the scientific analysis , says UKCP09 is the " most comprehensive set of probabilistic climate projections at the regional scale compiled anywhere in the world " .
FROM THE WORLD AT ONE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from The World At One Scientists collated data from 400 variations of the climate computer model developed by the Hadley Centre , part of the Met Office .
Each variant has been checked to see how well it predicted the climate of past decades ; and the numbers have been compared with projections of other computer models .
This allowed scientists to assign probabilities to various forecasts .
Using a range of online tools including a " weather generator " , people will be able to enter their postcodes and see projections of how conditions are likely to change within 25 sq km grid squares at different points in the future .
But some climate scientists have reservations about trying to project the future on such a detailed scale .
" If your decisions depend on what 's happening at these very fine scales of 25 km or even 5 km resolution then you probably should n't be making irreversible investment decisions now , " commented Myles Allen of Oxford University , one of the UK 's leading climate modellers .
Climate warnings ' error margins
But the idea of the impact assessment has been well received by environment groups .
" It 's great that the government has decided to put together such a scientifically robust analysis of the potential impacts of climate change in the UK , " said Keith Allott , head of climate change at WWF - UK .
" But the picture it paints is an alarming one , " " This research confirms that not only is climate change already having a serious impact in Britain , but that we are also locked into further impacts , and that these impacts will get much worse unless we act now to tackle the problem . "
Mild UK
Campaigners say that the UK impacts are likely to be minor compared to other parts of the world .
Last month a report from the Global Humanitarian Forum , the think tank chaired by former UN secretary - general Kofi Annan , said the UK was among the 12 countries likely to be least affected by climate change .
" Life in parts of the UK will get harder , but it will get a great deal harder in countries already suffering the impact of climate change , " said Alison Doig , senior climate policy expert with Christian Aid .
Will British crops go thirsty ?
" Their plight will worsen dramatically unless the international community wakes up to the fact that a full - blown emergency is looming . "
On Friday , the Environment Agency will release an assessment of how the changing climate will affect the risk of impacts such as flooding in England and Wales .
Commenting on the UKCP09 projections , Environment Agency chairman Chris Smith said : " These new projections remind us starkly of the choices we face in ensuring a sustainable future for our fragile planet .
" A failure to cut greenhouse gas emissions will lead to a battle for survival for mankind and many other species across the globe by the end of this century ; and we will feel the effects here in the UK too . "
The agency is likely to recommend measures that would protect areas of the UK , and sectors of the economy , against climate impacts such as flooding .

It is better to use '' because if you do n't like your new desktop you can simply uninstall the packages with all its dependencies and you are back to the system state where you were before .

Tobacco Legislation
Is a Sneaky Big Government Play
Before you sigh , “ Not another anti-anti - smoking article , ” this issue represents the state vs. the people in microcosm .
It appears to be the perfect way for Big Brother to seize authority to change the behavior of others .
The underdogs are outnumbered 3 to 1 .
Perhaps 99.9 % think the behavior is deleterious .
( “ Science ” says so . )
Many believe passionately that our action injures them physically .
At least as many believe our smoking costs “ you ” money “ because we ’re paying for your health care . ”
( You are n’t in most cases and you should not be in any case . )
Who could be “ for ” smoking ?
Smoking is n’t the issue .
Setting precedents is .
Once a people accept that a government has the right , far less the duty , to regulate our choices , deny us our right to make our own choices , and be responsible for our own actions , no one is safe .
State science decrees that red meat , butter , other fats , eggs , salt , insecticides , red wine , and numerous other items are “ bad ” for us .
Even when jihad is declared on something you think indispensable , your personal preferences still wo n’t be the issue .
That will remain freedom .
Freedom to make our own choices , pay for our own mistakes , freedom to take responsibility for our decisions .
The trouble with putting zealots in charge of anything –or even listening to them–is that they want to apply their pet ideas to every facet of life .
One begins to suppose there is a near - universal craving for a universal panacea .
Even I appear to be among that number because my idea of the solution to all of our woes is to get the government out of our lives , out of office buildings , and off the bloated payrolls .
The latest bright idea is that vast amounts of money will be saved if the government bans smoking / tobacco use in the military .
Well , there is a really bright idea .
The claims are that not allowing the troops to use tobacco will improve their health and lower costs .
My reaction to the latter point was a stunned , “ Since when have the Democrats wanted to lower costs anywhere , at any time , for any reason ? ”
This is certainly a first .
It would be if those were the real reasons , instead of control .
Let ’s start with a really quaint notion regarding a useless piece of paper known as the Constitution .
Such a ban makes tobacco a contraband substance .
Presumably the intent is not just to say , “ You may not smoke in mess halls .
You may not smoke in barracks .
You may not smoke in public .
You may not smoke in the middle of battle . ”
It appears that Ted Kennedy was not jesting when he said that all that was necessary to end smoking was just to outlaw it , even if the first part of the strategy was to hit menthol - smokers first .
( The “ flavoring ” always mentioned , by careful design , is “ cherry , ” but the one under attack is menthol , for the purpose of driving smaller companies out of business , as I have discussed before , and because most of us who smoke menthol cigarettes wo n’t smoke regular ones . )
This is reminiscent of recent city bans against smoking anywhere within twenty - five feet of a doorway , far less inside buildings !
It criminalizes smoking .
Never mind “ the pursuit of happiness , ” do we really want to encourage Big Brother to intrude further into anyone ’s lifestyle ?
In particular , do we want the Nanny State messing with the morale of our soldiers ?
USA Today ( which is not the world ’s premium newspaper ) cites , “ Combat veterans are 50 % more likely to use tobacco than troops who have n’t seen combat . ”
They do n’t tell us what the percentage of those who smoke is compared to the US average , which , until the price quintupled in the last ten years due primarily to taxes , was 28 % for a couple of decades .
All of those who were going to be deterred by scare tactics left long ago .
Mr. Obama ’s ten dollar hike did several percentage points in ; they ca n’t pay for it again around all of the other prices going up .
I grew up in the military and was a military wife .
While I am certainly a smoker , no one is going to send me into combat , so I have no personal interest here , nor am I promoting smoking .
It has come to restrict my life annoyingly , as in not being able to get on airplanes .
The “ choice ” foisted on me is whether to smoke or whether to fly .
No problem .
Smokes win .
Smoking is a personal choice–oh , wait , is this like abortion , in that it should be “ legal , but rare ? ” Apparently not .
My concern is entirely for the welfare of the troops , who have far more serious threats to their health than the putative damages of smoking .
Viet Nam was “ our ” war , and only a fiend would have denied kids living in the horror of jungles full of enemies from zero to four legs the comfort of a smoke .
Back then the things cost $ 1.25 a carton .
In WWII cigarettes were included in the field rations .
I imagine the effects of cigarettes are just as beneficial in Iraq and Afghanistan , soothing the nerves when there is a lull in the fighting or you ’ve finally scraped out a relative measure of cover in the sand .
Why does anyone suppose that the kids who get shot at are 50 % more likely to smoke ?
Go get yourself attacked and ambushed , eat indifferent food , be hated by those in a place you never wanted to go , and watch your buddies be destroyed by sniper fire , land mines , hand grenades , and artillery shells , and you might find yourself reaching for a cigarette , too .
Gum is n’t going to cut it in those situations .
Enlisted men , in particular , and cigarettes are pretty much a combination .
I think we can predict that a lot of the more seasoned NCO ’s will refuse to re-up .
I stopped to consult Asia , a combat veteran , who did n’t think much of the idea , either .
MDC said calmly , “ I would probably have left the military . ”
He did thirty years .
Health .
Ah .
We wo n’t discuss the effects of Agent Orange , Post Traumatic Stress , or being struck by shrapnel .
I ’m going to go with the theory that smoking is to this era as sex was to Victorians , the ultimate evil which must be destroyed .
It has long been fashionable to ascribe virtually all diseases to smoking .
We ’ve been hearing that line since C. Everett Koop , and although the percentage of smokers has been cut in half , the diseases attributed to smoking not only become more numerous with every passing year , but the incidence of them continues to rise .
“ Oh ! ” exclaimed the AMA .
“ Second - hand smoke ! ”
Very few people are exposed to second - hand smoke , friends .
We smokers are far more likely to die of heat prostration , pneumonia , mugging , or drive - by shootings by being sent outside like naughty children .
Costs ?
We ’re back to the Democrats ’ ploy of “ think of a really big number . ”
They fling “ statistics ” around with no regard for truth , science , or even any sort of scientific proof .
Remember science ?
That ’s how we used to determine cause and effect , back before the witch - hunting mentality returned .
The claim is that “ Tobacco use costs the Pentagon $ 846 million a year in medical care and lost productivity . ”
Oh ?
Determined how ?
By what standards ?
The guys are standing around smoking and joking instead of working ?
I thought the claim was that evil tobacco killed swiftly , so what was the “ medical care ” portion spent on , burned fingers from lighters ?
That ’s not good math , it is n’t good statistics , and I do n’t believe it .
I do n’t believe that “ The Department of Veterans Affairs spends up to $ 6 billion in treatments for tobacco - related illnesses , says the study , which was released late last month . ”
Why ?
Because nobody defines “ tobacco - related illnesses , ” or provides a little pie chart .
Are we talking about emphysema and cancer ?
Have we got any studies ?
Have we got any real proofs of causal relationships ?
Our dentist told me that smoking causes periodontal disease !
By constricting blood vessels in the mouth .
Chuckle .
When I was in my thirties and really rather attractive , an Army dentist told me that my dental health would be improved by having an affair with him !
I decided to stick with more usual protocols .
( Pity no one told me then that tooth sensitivity is caused by the fluoride which laces our public water supplies and most toothpaste brands .
Try switching to a good non-fluoride toothpaste such as Tom ’s for a tube and see if yours does n’t decrease .
Only the detested “ anecdotal ” evidence , but I was told that , tried it , and it works for me . )
It is accepted as holy writ that smoking causes everything from ingrown toenails to hair falling out .
The doctors say so .
The AMA says so .
Where ’s the proof ?
“ Linda !
You ca n’t challenge that !
Everybody knows that … ”
I ’m not “ everybody . ” I ’m me .
I will have been a smoker for forty years this fall , and am up to three packs a day .
People restricting me always leads to an increase .
My darling Charles has been a heavy smoker longer than that .
My foreman is 50 and has smoked since he was very young , and our other hand is 54 and has , as well .
Among the four of us we number exactly two prescription medications : I have a low thyroid , which escaped being stigmatized as a “ tobacco - related disease ” somehow , and to my dismay his doctor has MDC on Lipitor for a cholesterol level I would like to see higher .
( What the much misquoted Framingham study showed was that those most at risk were men with cholesterol under 170 !
Cholesterol is actually good stuff , a subject for another day . )
Other than that he got an absolutely splendid report on his physical Wednesday .
Glittering blood work !
Charles ’ levels were down , again , and the doctor asked him what he had been doing .
Charles used that patented Robert Mitchum sleepy “ bad boy ” smile of his and replied truthfully that he had been eating a lot of butter , eggs , and red meat , and consuming un - homogenized , unpasteurized milk !
( Also a subject for another day . )
Precisely how much healthier does anyone think MDC will be if he quits smoking , which would make both of us miserable ?
We all drink , we all eat a great deal of butter , eggs , and red meat .
We fry potatoes and eggs in bacon grease ( delicious ) , and we produce a lot of that around here .
Freddie thinks that bacon and pork chops are one of the three basic food groups .
Half our group is black , three - quarters is male … and I admit we have n’t reached the James Linda minimum for proving that lime juice prevents scurvy .
Oh , wait , yes we have .
He gave seven sailors various diets , two of them including limes , and those were the men who did n’t come down with scurvy .
Here ’s an interesting , undeniable statistic : in every case , those who are Linda or live with Linda lead happy , healthy lives .
I ’m probably the cure for heart disease , stroke , aneurysm , depression , dyspepsia , boredom , Alzheimer ’s , frustration , and the heartbreak of psoriasis .
Perfect record .
Cigarettes actually have three verifiable effects : they annoy the whey out of most of you because of the smell ; they have become ruinously expensive ; they destroy 20 mg. of vitamin C each .
Those of us who take our ascorbic acid a minimum of four times a day do n’t have any problem with the only health threat , although the other two factors are serious .
Having tilted at a windmill far stronger than I , I want to thank a marvelous reader for sending us a quote from Heraclitus , circa 500 B.C .
“ Of every One - Hundred men , Ten should n’t even be there ,
Eighty are nothing but targets , Nine are real fighters …
We are lucky to have them …
They make the battle ,
Ah , but the One , One of them is a Warrior …
and He will bring the others back . ”
I had planned on putting this in whatever I chose to write about , but it is sheer , amusing circumstance that the topic turned out to be abuse of tobacco users .
What if “ the one ” ( which is n’t referring to the likes of Mr. Obama ) is a smoker ?
Unrepentant regards ,

A group of University of Oklahoma researchers led by Dr. James P. Shaffer , Homer L. Dodge Department of Physics and Astronomy , have discovered giant Rydberg molecules with a bond as large as a red blood cell .
Determining how Rydberg molecules interact is important because Rydberg atoms are a key ingredient in atom based quantum computation schemes .
Giant Rydberg molecules are formed when two Rydberg atoms interact .
A Rydberg atom is an atom that has at least one electron orbiting the nucleus at a very large distance .
A giant molecule can form from two Rydberg atoms when they are in close proximity to one another because fluctuations of the electron orbiting the nucleus can create an electric field at the position of the other Rydberg atom and vice versa to attract the atoms to each other .
An additional electric field can change the orbit of the electrons and lead to a change in the forces acting between the Rydberg atoms .
The ability to change the orbit of the electron with an electric field is what makes it possible to control the properties of the molecule , such as binding energy and vibrational frequencies .
Applying an electric field to tailor the properties of these types of molecules is a unique property .
The characteristics of the macroscopic molecules make them ideal candidates for probing quantum gases , properties of the electromagnetic field , and determining how Rydberg molecules interact .
Shaffer says an understanding of these problems will bring us closer to a new generation of quantum mechanical devices that meld the best properties of isolated atomic systems with advances in microelectronic fabrication and materials science .
The research performed by Shaffer , K.R. Overstreet , A. Schwettmann , J. Tallant , and D. Booth is reported in the advanced online version ( June ) of Nature Physics and in the July issue of the scientific journal .
LAS VEGAS —
Talk about kicking a neighbor while he ’s down : Nevada is spending $ 250,000 for an ad campaign that compares California legislators to talking chimps and tells business owners they can “ kiss their assets goodbye ” if they stay put .
It ’s the latest salvo in a generally friendly rivalry that ’s taken on a harder edge with both states among the recession ’s hardest - hit areas and desperately fighting to stay afloat — California recently had to issue more than $ 1 billion in IOUs to survive a prolonged budget crisis while trying to slash a $ 26.3 billion debt .
Nevada leaders paint their clever but biting campaign — aimed at California business owners considering a move — as simply a matter of helping the Silver State fight high unemployment and diversify an economy heavily dependent on struggling casinos and tourism .
Nevada business advocates are pitting their state ’s low taxes against rising workers ’ compensation rates and fears of bankruptcy in California .
But there is clearly a certain amount of grim glee at getting under the skin of their Golden State counterparts .
Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman said he can’t wait for the new ads and a chance to needle California leaders about picking off companies and jobs .
“ It ’s going to drive them bonkers , ” Goodman said .
“ We ’re going to crush them . ”
He and others say they want to erect one billboard outside California ’s state Capitol building in Sacramento .
The Nevada Development Authority , a nonprofit that recruits businesses , is funding the radio , TV and print ads .
Somer Hollingsworth , president of the development authority , said Nevada is hoping to stand out among the 49 states trying to get Californians to flee .
“ Everyone ’s trying to pull companies out because “ … they really smell blood , ” he said .
The ads have the attention of business promoters at the California Chamber of Commerce , who say Nevada needs the campaign because it is hurting , too .
“ I would match California ’s higher education system and quality of life against theirs any day , ” said Allan Zaremberg , the chamber ’s president and CEO .
Nevada had 12 percent unemployment in June , compared with 9.5 percent unemployment nationwide .
Meanwhile , California ’s unemployment was 11.6 percent in June , with more than 766,000 jobs lost in the past year .
Nevada ’s campaign is the latest pull in an ongoing tug of war between the two states .
In 2004 , California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger drove a moving van down the Las Vegas Strip to bring a small business back to California .
Nevada retaliated with a “ Will Your Business be Terminated ? ” campaign , which referenced Schwarzenegger ’s famous role in the “ Terminator ” action flicks .
Last year , Nevada launched a print cartoon series featuring California ’s grizzly bear symbol as a “ tax bear ” preying on business owners .
This time , the not - so - friendly pitches include comparing California legislators to talking chimps , saying the Golden State will be more business - friendly when pigs fly , and telling business owners that they can “ kiss their assets goodbye ” if they do n’t move .
Schwarzenegger spokeswoman Camille Anderson responded to the ads by pointing to the state ’s entertainment and high - tech prowess .
“ There is no rival to California , ” she shot back .
At least one television station , KABC - TV in Los Angeles , has declined to air Nevada ’s latest commercials , which were scheduled to begin running Friday for 90 days in Southern California markets .
“ We live , work and play in L.A. and we ’re not going to run commercials that will be detrimental to our state , ” said KABC - TV President and General Manager Arnold Kleiner .

I really like the watercolor feel in this , if it was digital it is very convincing ... if you did it the hard way then DAMN , you 're a trooper .
What software did you use for this ?
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The National Rifle Association is asking the Supreme Court to strike down strict gun control laws in the Chicago area , setting the stage for another high court battle over Second Amendment protections for gun owners .
The NRA wants the court to rule that last year 's gun rights decision invalidating a handgun ban in the District of Columbia applies as well to local and state laws .
The appeal to the Supreme Court comes almost immediately after a federal appeals court in Chicago said Tuesday that it is bound by earlier Supreme Court decisions which held the Second Amendment applies only to federal laws .
Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor was part of an appeals court panel in New York that reached a similar conclusion in January .
Judges on both courts — Republican nominees in Chicago and Democratic nominees in New York — said only the Supreme Court could decide whether to extend last year 's ruling throughout the country .
Many , but not all , of the constitutional protections in the Bill of Rights have been applied to cities and states .
The framers of the Constitution intended " to protect the right to keep and bear arms and other rights from state infringement , " the NRA said in a filing made available at the court Thursday .
One federal appeals panel , from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco , has ruled that the Second Amendment does apply broadly .
That court , however , is considering whether to take another look at a dispute between Alameda County and gun show promoters .
In the case now pending at the Supreme Court , the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld ordinances barring the ownership of handguns in most cases in Chicago and suburban Oak Park , Ill .
Judge Frank Easterbrook said that " the Constitution establishes a federal republic where local differences are to be cherished as elements of liberty rather than extirpated in order to produce a single , nationally applicable rule . "
" Federalism is an older and more deeply rooted tradition than is a right to carry any particular kind of weapon , " Easterbrook wrote .
Evaluating arguments over the extension of the Second Amendment is a job " for the justices rather than a court of appeals , " he said .
Chicago officials said they were pleased with the appeals court ruling and would defend the local laws in front of the Supreme Court , if the justices agree to hear the NRA 's case .
Any decision about that probably wo n't come earlier than late September .

In 1997 , several Californian members of the Libertarian Party founded a think tank ( a usually political center of research , propaganda and spreading of ideas .
Translator ’s note ) to promote its own ideas : sexual liberty , pacifism and the elimination of the welfare state .
The origin of its name ( Cato Institute ) is related to the famous pamphlets of the XVIII Century against colonialism and the expansion of the government known as Cato ’s Letters. 28 years later , this right - wing anarchists ’ association has turned into a successful foundation based in Washington , subsidized at length by several multinational companies and proud of being responsible for the pensions ’ reform President Bush will implement in his second term .
Edward Crane Founder and Director of the Cato Institute .
The Cato Institute was founded by Edward H. Crane when he stopped being the president of the Libertarian Party .
Since the beginning , he was economically assisted by the Koch brothers - Charles G. and David H - heirs of petrochemical giant Koch Industries .
David H. Koch was the Libertarian Party ’s candidate to the vice presidency of the U.S. in 1980 .
Beyond its nice discourse on sexual liberty , gays ’ rights , marihuana liberalization and other revelations of the new age , the Cato Institute has quickly turned into a promoter of social egoism , and above all , it has reintroduced and spread Charles Murray ’s theories on racial differences [ 1 ] .
In 1985 , the association hired one of Ronald Reagan ’s former economic advisers and founder of the National Tax Limitation Committee as its director .
It focused then on the elimination of the State and its welfare structures inherited from President Franklin D. Roosevelt ’s New Deal by promoting the elimination of the personal income tax , the privatization of Social Security , Medicare and education .
This is the reason why it recruited Chilean economist José Piñera - former Minister of Labor of General Augusto Pinochet ’s fascist government - who , influenced by the « Chicago Boys » and their leader , economist Milton Friedman , privatized social security and freed the Chilean State from its most expensive responsibility .
By doing this , Piñera reduced taxes considerably though more than half of the population retired without pensions .
Jose Piñera
According to The New York Times , which quoted a report by Lyndon LaRouche , José Piñera ’s Project on Social Security Choice was the basis of the privatization plan presented by George W. Bush in his year 2005 State of the Union address [ 2 ] .
By worshiping Friedrich von Hayek [ 3 ] .
The Libertarians ’ prophet , and his follower Milton Friedman , the Cato Institute held conferences on their economic works where they were usually present .
President Edward H. Crane and some members of the Institute ( Paul Craigs Roberts , James M. Buchanan , etc. ) are also members of Mont Pelerin Society , the libertarians ’ temple .
However , the respectability of this think tank has been affected by its biological racism , its social egoism and its level of corruption .
Once it began to accept millions from the multinational companies which financed it , the Cato Institute stopped defending ideas and began to defend interests .
For instance , it published works on tobacco harmlessness after receiving important contributions from cigarette maker Philip Morris and criticized ecologists ’ alarmism on greenhouse effects once it received contributions from its sponsor Exxon - Mobil .
But the Institute ’s contribution to the Bush Administration has not been limited to pension ’s reform .
It has also included a paradoxical ecologist discourse that approves multinational companies ’ immunity to contaminate .
George w .
Bush has even named Gale Norton , former editor of Clarke - Koch ’s electoral speeches , head of the Department of Environment [ 4 ] .
She opposed the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol which sets limits to the greenhouse effects and defended oil installations in Alaska , no matter what the risks for the environment were .
Gale Norton
In 1998 , the Cato Institute managed to be well known by the media though it was not due to a remarkable political change but to the fact that multimillionaire Rupert Murdoch , owner of Fox News and many newspapers , joined the Institute by becoming a member of its Board of Directors that included also his partner John Malone , the distinguished owner of Liberty Media ( which controls Discovery and Noos ) .
On foreign policy issues , the Cato Institute has favored the American withdrawal of all military alliances and intergovernmental organizations and has opposed NATO - and therefore the war against Kosovo , Afghanistan and Iraq - and financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
The Institute has also developed a phobia against a possible rapprochement between Russia , China and India which , according to it , may have an adverse effect on American interests .
Consequently , it denounced Primakov ’s diplomacy and the foundation of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization .
Apart from all these , the Institute has held colloquiums in Russia and China to spread free market ideals .
The Cato Institute has turned into a powerful institution based in the American federal capital .
What used to be a group against the State ’s excesses has turned into an organization in defense of private interests and against all social responsibility .
This is the reason why its president and founder , Edward H. Crane , fired the Californian hippies of 1968 and bought an expensive office in Washington .
There , to conclude , all were happy , united in the present as they had been in the past ; but never could they forget that island upon which they had arrived poor and friendless , that island which during four years had supplied all their wants , an of which there remained but a fragment of granite washed by the waves of the Pacific , the tomb of him who had borne the name of Captain Nemo .
Well , this little viral number did n't take long to become the stuff of screaming Drudge sirens .
So , over at CNET , Declan McCullagh wrote about an update to a cybersecurity bill that first circulated this spring .
In his interpretation of the bill ( which I have n't read in entirety , full disclosure ) , Declan says the bill gives the White House new power to unplug private - sector computers from the Internet in the case of national emergency .
Snip :
[ Critics of the earlier bill are ] not much happier about a revised version that aides to Sen.
Jay Rockefeller , a West Virginia Democrat , have spent months drafting behind closed doors .
CNET News has obtained a copy of the 55 - page draft of S.773 ( excerpt ) , which still appears to permit the president to seize temporary control of private - sector networks during a so - called cybersecurity emergency .
The new version would allow the president to " declare a cybersecurity emergency " relating to " non-governmental " computer networks and do what 's necessary to respond to the threat .
Other sections of the proposal include a federal certification program for " cybersecurity professionals , " and a requirement that certain computer systems and networks in the private sector be managed by people who have been awarded that license .
Bill would give president emergency control of Internet ( CNET ) .
Commenting on this article , ZDNET 's Sam Diaz argues that the White House is not equipped to hold the keys ( where are these magical keys , btw ? ) .
" The argument that the government is ill - equipped and should n't be trusted with the such far - reaching power is no joke . "
At the Atlantic , Mark Armbinder counters that Skepticism [ is ] Warranted — But Nuance Needed .
A few things to keep in mind .
One : the president already has the authority to shut down parts of the Internet in emergencies .
The bill restates the power and expands it to make sure that any system that is too big to fail cannot be allowed to fail at the expense at the rest of the system .
The analogy the bill 's authors use is that of the president 's power to order all aircraft to land in the event of a systemwide emergency .
That power is — powerful ! — but we 're generally OK with it .
The Internet , of course , is different , in kind and expanse .
There 's a broad sense that it should be free , unfettered , and allowed to evolve on its own .
There 's a broad sense that the Internet is to citizens today what guns were to civillian militias of the founding era — the trenchline against tyranny .
( Editorial note : I agree . )
Maybe the White House should have this power in extreme emergencies , but it had better be clear about what those emergencies entail , and it had better accept accountability if it oversteps its authority .
There is , aside from the obvious definitional issues , an inherent trade - off in codifying this power , and it 's going to be tough to find a balance that satisfies everyone .
So far most of what I 'm seeing in the way of online discussion around this * draft * bill ( it 's not yet law , guys ) involves meta debates around authoritarianism and " is Obama Hitler , " plus a lot of rehashing of boilerplate Libertarian and Republican talking points .
I 'm less interested in those thread - wars , and more interested in better understanding the murky technical details under discussion .
I 'll be reading what I can find over the weekend , but welcome your thoughts in the comments .
No sirens plz .
After professional photographer Alex Dejong lost his sight three years ago , he thought his days of taking and editing photos was over .
But the iPhone 3GS 's VoiceOver feature , plus a few key apps , has given some of his abilities back .
Advertisement
Dejong 's field of vision is n't totally black ; he can distinguish light from dark , and had continued to take photos with the help of an editing assistant .
But VoiceOver , which reads back anything displayed on the iPhone , has allowed him to use the ( low - end , Dejong admits ) camera and certain photo editing apps like Camerabag and TiltShift even without sight .
" With the iPhone and a lot of the photography apps that a lot of people are using , I have my entire workflow , and I can do it in five minutes , " Dejong said .
" In this way , the iPhone is a remarkable gift .
I 've had it for three weeks now , and it has really opened up my world , apart from the photography . "

It 's a pretty interesting story , and Wired 's account goes into more depth with other blind photography techniques .
I 'd never really thought about blind photography before , but for someone like Dejong , for whom photography had been a vital part , I can see how VoiceOver and other new tools would be a godsend .

Last night I saw Pixar ’s latest , Up .
In a word : uplifting ( okay , sorry , that was too easy ) .
At this point , pretty much anything the acclaimed animation studio produces is expected to be wonderful , but I had my suspicions about the superlatives that critics and audiences alike had been lavishing on the film .
They were all right .
I wo n’t go into too much plot detail , but suffice it to say , this film did not disappoint .
Some story elements were slightly predictable , but overall the movie was full of surprises , both emotional and eye - popping .
( My favorite part was The talking dog , Dug , who is constantly distracted by squirrels .
The “ joke ” he tells about the furry creatures had me laughing long after the credits rolled . )
The film ’s central focus is the relationship between Carl , a curmudgeon with a heart of gold , and Russell , a naive Wilderness Explorer .
Carl is still dealing with the death of his beloved wife , Ellie .
Russell is reeling from his parents ’ divorce .
In one of the sweetest moments of the film ( and trust me , there are plenty ) , Russell talks about how his dad was supposed to teach him how to pitch a tent , and how the two of them used to go get ice cream , sit on the curb , and count cars together .
“ It might sound boring , ” Russell tells Carl , “ but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most . ”
Excuse me while I sob into my popcorn .
Carl eventually becomes somewhat of a surrogate father to Russell , and plays a pivotal role in an important event for Russell later in the movie .
Their interactions are sweet and touching , but never cloying .
The film does an excellent job of portraying the pain and confusion that children of divorce face without rubbing our noses in it ; the word “ divorce ” is never said , only implied .
If you ’re looking for a film that will make you laugh , cry , and then double over laughing again , Up is your movie .
Just be careful swallowing your popcorn with that lump in your throat .

Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel , health adviser to President Barack Obama , is under scrutiny .
As a bioethicist , he has written extensively about who should get medical care , who should decide , and whose life is worth saving .
Dr. Emanuel is part of a school of thought that redefines a physician ’s duty , insisting that it includes working for the greater good of society instead of focusing only on a patient ’s needs .
Many physicians find that view dangerous , and most Americans are likely to agree .

Ariel Attack , a Denver - based anarchist , was arrested at 2:27 am Tues , 24 here in Denver for allegedly smashing 11 windows of the Democratic Party headquaters at 777 Santa Fe Drive .
Right now we are trying to raise the bail money for her to get out of jail ; her bail hearing will be tomorrow at 10 am Denver time .
Several lawyers have told us to expect anywhere from between $ 3,000 to $ 10,000 in bail , and due to the high publicity of the case here in Denver , we are expecting higher ( lead story for most all local news outlets , and being picked up by national news networks ) .
At this moment , we do not know Ariel 's status within the jail , especially regarding her gender classification .
We have been unable to talk with Ariel since she went in .
She is listed in the jail records and media under her birth name .
We also do not know what plans , if any , she had made for this situation .
As such , Denver BB ! and all of her friends and community are calling out hoping to raise the money to at least make bond .
Jail is a dangerous place for everyone , but especially trans people , and we make every effort to get our friends and comrades out .
We are also asking people to NOT call the jail and potentially out Ariel , which would create a very dangerous situation .
Interaction with the jail is being done by people here in Denver in very specific ways to create the maximum amount of safety possible for Ariel .
People will be meeting up outside of the courthouse ( 14th and Bannock , across from civic center park ) at 9:30 before going into court .
All people are welcome .
Below is a link to the paypal account which will deposit money into the FREE ARIEL ATTACK FUND !!!
Please do what you can to help get an amazing friend and comrade out of jail and back into her community .
Also below are links to some of the corporate media stories about her arrest .
If you have any questions , you can email benjaminyager@gmail.com .
THANK YOU !!!
You can't make this stuff up , folks .

Update :
The progressive - anarchist web just got more twisted .
The blog Queers Against Obama lists Ariel Attack as one of their contributors .

Update 12:15 am Colorado Indymedia has picked up the story and gives us the news that she / he has been charged with Felony Criminal Mischief ( F4 ) .
Denver Anarchist Black Cross is also all over the story .
Social War Chicago is beating the tom - tom for Ariel , as well .
When not wielding hammers , Ariel keeps busy not only writing for Queers Against Obama , but also contributing to the blog Gender Mutiny and Bash Back .

As turmoil over the disputed election in Iran continues , many techs are trying to find ways to help Iranian citizens safely communicate and receive information despite the barriers being established by Iranian authorities .
One tactic that even moderately tech - savvy Internet users can employ is to set up a Tor relay or a Tor bridge .
More sophisticated users can skip this paragraph , but for the rest , here 's the basic outline .
Tor ( an acronym of " The Onion Router " ) is free and open source software that helps users remain anonymous on the Internet .
Normally , when accessing websites , your computer asks for and receives a webpage out in the open , a process that exposes your IP address , the URL of the website , and the contents of the site , among other information to third parties .
When accessing websites while using Tor , your computer essentially whispers its requests for a website , to another computer , which passes the request on to another computer , which passes it on to another computer , which passes it onto the computer where the website is hosted ; the reply returns in the same , chain - message manner .
The whispers are encrypted , so that neither outside authorities , nor the computers in the middle of the chain , can tell what is being said , and to whom .
And the website itself does not have your IP address either .
Internet users in Iran are using Tor to both ( a ) circumvent censorship systems and ( b ) remain anonymous while reading and writing on the Internet .
Both are critically important to the safety of protesters , many of whom fear retaliation from the government .
Preliminary reports indicate that use of the Tor client in Iran has increased in the days after the contested election .
However , Tor 's design relies on a robust network of " volunteer computers " ( a.k.a. relays ) to pass messages back and forth .
This means that the speed and quality of a Tor users ' browsing experience relies extensively on the number of volunteer computers there are to pass messages along .
This is where volunteers can make a difference -- setting up additional relays improves access for dissident Iranians and other users of the Tor network .
The more people who help out , the better and more quickly the network runs .
If you 're interested in helping out , find and follow instructions for configuring a Tor relay on the Tor website .
Those looking to help fight censorship should also consider providing a Tor bridge .
Bridges come into play when an ISP decides to try blocking users ' access to the Tor network .
( For now , there seems to only be anecdotal evidence of Iran attempting to block the use of Tor.
However , Iran has recntly been practicing reactive and centralized blocking , which makes any effective block of Tor far more likely . )
The Tor bridge configuration differs from a relay in that your computer does not appear in the public Tor network .
Instead , users looking for access to the Internet through Tor can receive your Tor routing information through more private channels , then configure their Tor client to transmit requests through your computer .
By not appearing in the public
Tor network , your Tor routing information is less likely to end up on an ISP filter and can provide help for a longer period of time -- but recognize that the network needs both relays and bridges .
Tor provides strong protections for its users , but if you plan to use it to access the Net , take time to fully understand its limitations .
Check the Tor " Warning " section for more information .
You should also consider any limitations that may exist in your arrangement with your ISP .
If you have other questions about setting up a Tor bridge or relay , please check the Running a Tor relay FAQ page .
For other concerns , The Onion Router Wiki may help .
For understanding the technical conditions of the Iranian Internet , we have found the Open Network Initiative 's ongoing research , Arbor Network 's network analyses , and the Tor Project 's own blog status reports to be informative .
Hackers are now using Twitter to send coded update messages to computers they 've previously infected with rogue code , according to a report from net - monitoring firm Arbor Networks .
This looks to be the first reported case of hackers using the popular micro-messaging company to control botnets , which are assemblages of infected PCs that can be directed to spy on their users , send spam , or attack web sites with fake traffic .
Arbor Network 's Jose Nazario , an expert on botnets , discovered the so - called command - and - control structure .
Infected computers were following the Twitter feed " Upd4t3 " ( now suspended ) through its RSS feed .
" Basically , what it does is use the status messages to send out new links to contact , then these contain new commands or executables to download and run , " Nazario wrote .
" It ’s an info - stealer operation . "
The tweets turned out to be obfuscated links to sites where further malicious code and instructions could be downloaded .
Hackers have long used IRC chat rooms to control botnets , and have continually used clever technologies , such as peer - to - peer strategies , to counter efforts to track , disrupt and sometimes decapitate the bots .
Perhaps what 's surprising then is that it 's taken so long for hackers to take Twitter to the dark side .
There 's something ironic about this finding , given that Russian hackers allegedly used a botnet to take Twitter down for two days last week .
But we wo n't go down that rabbit hole .

SPRINGFIELD - Thieves , trashing a Habit for Humanity home under construction in the East Forest Park neighborhood , did n't get the kitchen sink but they made away with just about everything else .
Items stolen from 75 Pomona St. include a toilet that was ripped out of an upstairs bathroom and spirited out a side window .
" The place is a mess , " Jennifer E. Schimmel , executive director of the Greater Springfield Chapter of Habitat for Humanity .
Schimmel said the break was discovered Wednesday morning .
Entry was gained through a basement window and the bulkhead door was opened , presumably to let in one or more accomplices , she said .
Other missing items include a bathroom vanity sink , bathroom mirror , light fixtures and a ventilation hood from the stove .
Habitat personnel are still tallying the stolen items , Schimmel said .
Stolen items and damage repair are expected to amount to several thousand dollars , she said .
" We are still finding bits and pieces of things , " Schimmel said .
Volunteer laborers were about six weeks from completing the home .
It 's not clear , Schimmel said , how much the theft and damage will set back the project timeline .
This particular project , one of four ongoing projects for the chapter , is sponsored by a group of 10 different churches that have raised money for it .
Schimmel , executive director since 2007 , said such theft and vandalism has not been a problem for the chapter .
" In comparison to some of the other neighborhood we work in , it really is n't a bad neighborhood so it 's a bit of a shock to the system , " Schimmel said .
Kevin M. Sears , broker owner at Sears Real Estate , said he has not heard of spike in the theft of items from homes under construction .
" It occurs every now and then , " Sears said , adding that his business has given financial assistance to this particular project .
" It 's just a slap in the face for them to have this type of setback , " Sears said .
Schimmel said the chapter is seeking the public 's help in getting the project back on track .
Donations may be sent to Greater Springfield Habitat for Humanity , 104 Memorial Ave. , West Springfield , MA 01089 .

Miss Sanchez 's aunt , Gloria Sanchez , told the Associated Press that her niece had been " in and out " of a psychiatric ward , and that the hospital called several months ago looking to check up on her .
She did not elaborate on the nature of her niece 's health problems .
I never think about tenses when I hear Latin Americans speak English .
If it 's their second language , you can't blame them for being technically imperfect .
Then again ...
I definitely was a little bit careless back in those days when I was buying supplements , vitamins over the counter .
Legal supplements , legal vitamins over the counter .
But I never buy steroids or use steroids .
Past tense for the first sentence , present tense for the second .
Was that an intentional slip by David Ortiz in Saturday 's news conference ?
Did he pull a Sammy Sosa and dumb himself down ?
Technically , he did n't lie if he is n't buying or using steroids right now .
Of course , nobody was asking about right now .
We wanted to know what caused Big Papi 's positive PED test in 2003 .
And the answer was , " I never buy or use steroids . "
Present tense intended to be past tense .
Or maybe not .
Jared Wickerham / Getty Images Was Big Papi's loose use of past and present tense a mistake or a safety net ?
These are the things baseball makes you consider in 2009 .
You study favorite players the same way you 'd study a potentially cheating spouse or girlfriend .
You analyze tenses , soak in body language , search for double meanings .
You try to catch them in lies .
You compare their facial expressions with ones from the past , almost as if you 're sitting at a poker table with them .
You evaluate a pattern of performance and hope everything adds up .
You worry about good memories becoming tainted by other ones .
You worry .
The word " taint " can go a number of ways .
Some interpret it as " ruin . "
I think of it more like " affect . "
The shadow of that effect depends on the person -- how optimistic you are , how forgiving you are , how spiteful you are -- but the shadow never totally disappears .
On Saturday , when ESPN Classic showed Game 6 of the 2004 American League Championship Series ( the Bloody Sock game ) , I watched it a little differently .
Yes , it made me happy and brought back some fond memories .
But I could n't help seeing Ortiz and Manny and thinking , " Do they look bigger then ?
Were they using ?
Did they inject each other with the needles ?
Was it a big needle orgy before every game ?
Am I overthinking this ? "
Again , just a shadow .
But I could see it .
Will it fade away over time ?
Will it get bigger ?
That 's the part I cannot figure out .
What bothered baseball fans this decade was n't the cheating as much as the lack of accountability .
Some players lied to our faces .
Some twisted the truth .
Some hid in shame .
Some said nothing but probably wake up every morning thinking , " I wonder if today will be the day I get caught . "
I can't think of one player who admitted wrongdoing and just came clean .
You know , something like , " I did it because everyone else was doing it .
I did it because there were no rules in place that I could n't do it .
I did it because I 'm a competitive guy , because my professional and financial success , as depressing as this sounds , was at stake to some degree .
If you were me , what would you have done ? "
I wish David Ortiz had said this .
When news broke that Papi had landed on the Dreaded 104 , he promised to respond as soon as he gathered enough information .
( Um , how 'bout this response : " This ca n't be true !
I have never taken a steroid in my life !
I am suing everybody ! " )
Nine days passed .
He fell into a massive slump and looked more rattled than Melissa Rivers during the Joan Rivers Roast .
His teammates tightened around him , blowing two crucial games in Tampa , then another biggie in New York on Thursday night .
They squandered a 15 - inning game on Friday that was probably the make - or - break game of the season , the one that -- barring a semimiraculous turn -- we will point back to this winter and say , " That 's the game when I knew we did n't have it this year . "
Then and only then did David Ortiz speak .
When your favorite athletes find themselves in these situations , you want them to react like Dr. Richard Kimble .
You want them to profess their innocence loudly and passionately .
You want them screaming about the truth and claiming they have been framed .
" I AM INNOCENT !
I AM INNOCENT !
I AM BEING SET UP !
I DID NOT KILL MY WIFE !!! "
Ortiz did none of these things .
He admitted to being careless with vitamins and supplements .
He made the " never buy steroids or use steroids " comment .
He did n't say much else .
A slick players ' association lawyer named Michael Weiner sat beside him and questioned the veracity of the list itself -- not just the number of names but the number of false positives .
We 'll never know the truth because this list is n't supposed to exist .
It 's like arguing about the Bermuda Triangle .
Well , how are Red Sox fans supposed to feel ?
If Ortiz was n't lying , then why would an innocent supplement or vitamin cause a positive PED test ?
Did he abuse steroids or not ?
The answer seems to be " yes and no . "
In Monday 's New York Times , reporter Michael Schmidt ( the Woodward / Bernstein of the 104 List ) wrote the following : " [ Both Ortiz and Weiner ] implied that Ortiz might have been using a legal , over - the - counter supplement that happened to include a substance that would produce a positive test .
What they did not mention was that , if this was indeed the case , Ortiz was probably using the supplement 19 - norandrostenedione , which converts to the powerful steroid nandrolone in the liver but was not banned by baseball at the time . "
Hmmmmmmm .
Let 's say this was true .
It certainly explains Big Papi 's unwillingness to profess his total innocence , as well as his slightly confusing remarks at the news conference .
It also explains why the MLB Players Association and commissioner 's office -- normally invisible when baseball stars get nailed by PED allegations -- made a public display of support this particular time ( as opposed to nearly any other time ) .
It makes me feel a little better .
Just a little .
In 2003 , David Ortiz unwittingly used a soon - to - be - banned supplement while wittingly being careless about everything he was putting into his body .
I think that makes sense .
Sure it does .
Do I believe him ?
I do n't know .
Am I tired of wondering if I should believe my favorite athletes ?
Yes .
It 's getting old .
If the lack of fallout from Manny 's suspension and Big Papi 's recent saga taught us anything , it 's this : Baseball fans have lost the capacity to be outraged .
You 'd need to do something really crazy to shock us at this point .
Fix a game .
Swing a bat at someone 's head during a bench - clearing brawl .
Charge into the stands to punch out a fan .
Take a dump on home plate to protest a call .
For anything else ?
Whatever .
We expect the worst .
We are prepared to be disappointed by any baseball player .
It 's a sad place to be .
The question remains : Should it matter that any baseball star bent rules that were n't in place or being enforced ?
How was it different from scuffing baseballs , corking a bat , stealing signs , stalling between pitches or anything else ?
The easy answer is that it should n't matter .
So many players were using " illegal " enhancers , and so many others were looking the other way ... I mean , can you even call it cheating ?
It 's like blaming your dog for swiping the last two pork chops off the kitchen counter because you were dumb enough to leave them there in the first place .
Too much money and glory were at stake to expect competitive athletes to say , " I ca n't bend the rules , I do n't feel right about it " when again , EVERYONE was looking the other way .
Hell , baseball even encouraged it .
What about the home run frenzy from 1997 to 2003 ?
What about " Mike McGwire and Sammy Sooser " ?
Why did n't the union agree on testing sooner ?
Why wait so long to do something ?
From a historical standpoint , this era should n't be judged differently from any other goofy era .
Stuff happens .
It 's baseball .
Babe Ruth 's numbers happened in an all - white league .
Ted Williams flukishly missed five full years because of two different wars .
Mickey Mantle and Sandy Koufax would have excelled for twice as long with today 's surgeons .
Now we 're splitting hairs with eras ?
Come on .
In 2006 , I wrote that Barry Bonds ' records should stay .
In 2007 , I wrote that Mark McGwire should be allowed in the Hall of Fame .
Five months ago , I wrote that I 'd remember watching the best guys of the steroids era whether they cheated or not .
I meant this as a compliment .
I am also a realist .
If your favorite player broke a record or achieved something memorable from 1993 to 2008 , there 's a very good chance he had help .
If your favorite team won a title or came close , there 's a very good chance it was n't the Good Ship Lollipop .
No one team or player stumbled across an edge that everyone else did n't already know about .
You do n't have to like it -- in fact , I hope you do n't -- but that 's how it played out .
And it 's done .
So why bother kvetching about it ?
Again , that 's the easy answer .
And if everything were that easy , we would n't care .
The more complicated answer -- the one that involves real emotion instead of an icy dissection of previous events -- hinges on the eerie parallels between sports and real life .
It 's about having a treasured memory ruined , tainted or slightly altered through no fault of your own .
( Note : I tackled this subject in 2008 and last May . )
It 's about standing by your team through thick and thin , even when it 's making you feel more embattled and foolish than Rod Blagojevich 's wife .
It 's about your willingness to forgive and forget .
It 's about putting yourself in the position of others and asking the simple question , " What would I have done ? "
It 's about remaining loyal to people who brought you joy once upon a time .
It 's about looking back and answering the simple question , " Was it worth it ? "
Everyone handles these variables differently .
I remember the day after the Boone Home Run in 2003 , when I left work early because I could n't function .
I remember wondering if I was going to live an entire life , followed by death , without ever seeing the Sox win the World Series .
At that specific point in my life , in a sport where so many were already ( and obviously ) cheating , I would have taken a title any way I could have gotten it .
That 's how I felt , and that 's how it played out .
Did we have some " help " ?
Yeah , probably .
The 2003 Red Sox shattered franchise records for slugging , OPS and home runs .
The 2004 team came damned close to toppling those same records .
Any Boston fan who claims not to have had at least one " Which guys on our team do you think are juicing ? " conversation during that stretch is lying .
But here 's what I find fascinating ...
Any Cubs fan will tell you they are still recovering from the Bartman Game .
Any Giants fan will tell you they are still recovering from their team 's unraveling in Game 6 of the 2002 World Series .
The 2003 Cubs were led by Sammy Sosa .
The 2002 Giants were led by Barry Bonds .
Now , you 'd think both fan bases would say , " Looking back now , it does n't hurt as nearly much as it should given what happened with Sosa / Bonds after the fact .
In a weird way , we are off the hook !
We were saved from an asterisk title ! "
Nope .
They remain devastated .
So crushing losses can't be de-tainted , but tremendous victories can still be tainted .
Confusing , right ?
That 's why I do n't believe in asterisks .
The Cubs and Giants fans would have switched places with the ' 04 or '07 Red Sox in a heartbeat .
That is n't to completely forgive what happened .
I will never watch a Manny / Papi highlight from 2004 or 2007 again without 0.0001 percent of my brain thinking ... you know .
( The shadow again . )
Would I do it all over again ?
Of course .
Anything for a title .
That makes me no better than anyone who cheated .
And that 's one of two things that frightens me .
The other : When Jonathan from Memphis e-mailed after the Papi revelations just to ask me , " Are you dreading the day , some 15 or so years in the future , when you and your son have a disagreement and he says ' I could never respect a man whose heroes were cheaters ( paraphrasing Ray Kinsella ) ?
Or will you shield him from ' Field of Dreams ' just to avoid this potential gut punch ? "
Yikes .
Even one of my favorite sports movies has a shadow now .
I will never be able to watch that scene without thinking of that e-mail .
Great .
On the bright side , Boston fans have plenty of company .
Name a contender from the past two decades and that team 's fans are staring at that same tiny shadow ; either they can already see it , or they worry it 's coming .
My guard was up well before the Ortiz / Manny stuff broke ... although I have to admit , I was a little amazed that someone as dense as Manny could successfully pull off one steroid cycle .
When I learned about Ortiz , it happened right after my flight to Cleveland landed two weeks ago .
My BlackBerry caught a signal and e-mails started popping up from the previous four hours .
ORTIZ
BIG PAPI !
HA HA , I TOLD YOU !
SORRY , MAN
PAPI
2004 * 2007 *
NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I knew right away .
Did n't have to read any of them .
Just knew .
Crushing ... but not really .
I mourned for about 10 minutes , made one phone call and one tweet , then voyaged over to the National Collectors Convention and did n't think about Ortiz again that day .
That 's life as a baseball fan in 2009 .
Be prepared for anything ; do n't be surprised by anything .

The only thing Pujols can do is take a page from Roy Hobbs ' book and " hit away . "
And you wonder why Cardinals fans are cringing .
Barring injury , Albert Pujols has a chance to become the greatest hitter of all time .
He has never suffered an off year .
He has never enjoyed a season you would describe as anything less than " really , really , REALLY good . "
I happened to be on the phone last week when he came up with the bases loaded against the Mets .
I was walking my dog ; my buddy Gus was providing play - by - play .
We were joking about the inevitability of the ensuing grand slam that had n't happened yet , which would have been Pujols ' fifth of the year , by the way .
When I heard Gus yelp , " There it goes ! ! ! "
I was n't remotely fazed .
Pujols has reached that vaunted Tiger / Federer level .
At least during the regular season .
Of course -- and I am not the first person to make this point -- Pujols is doing " this " during the worst possible era to do " this . "
He remains a suspect without ever doing anything wrong .
He passed all kinds of tests over the years .
He carried himself with dignity even as fans whispered about him and reporters peppered him with PED questions ( most recently , during All - Star Week in St. Louis ) .
His swing and his batting eye have remained infallible .
But his performance has been a little TOO good ... and during this crummy era , that fact alone shines a giant spotlight on Albert Pujols .
No modern athlete has dealt with more scrutiny without doing anything that warranted scrutiny .
All he has ever done is thrive at a historically good rate .
That mere fact should n't make him clean or dirty -- in fact , I would bet " clean " for him -- but baseball has changed for the worse these past 15 years .
Thanks to years and years of recklessness and incompetent leadership , transcendent stars like Pujols will never be totally trusted -- not by you , not by me , not by anyone .
They will always be presumed guilty until proved innocent .
It 's like we flipped the Constitution upside down .
America 's pastime has become decidedly un-American .
If I were Pujols , I would hold a news conference every night , pee into a cup in front of reporters , then hand the sample to a drug - testing lab technician with a big smile on my face .
I am clean .
Stop doubting me .
Seriously .
You can trust me .
He would never do this for the same reason nobody else would do it :
It 's an absolutely ridiculous idea .
Poor Pujols will forever have to settle for hitting the crap out of the ball as everyone wonders about him .
There is no other way .
Meanwhile , his loyal fans have to be prepared for the worst possible news at all times .
They remain on guard 24 hours a day , every day ... and yes , I know the feeling .
It 's a shame .
It 's baseball in the 21st century .
Present tense .

Review article The Status of the P Versus NP Problem
Illustration by C.E.B. Reas
When editor - in - chief Moshe Vardi asked me to write this piece for Communications , my first reaction was the article could be written in two words :
Still open .
When I started graduate school in the mid-1980s , many believed that the quickly developing area of circuit complexity would soon settle the P versus NP problem , whether every algorithmic problem with efficiently verifiable solutions have efficiently computable solutions .
But circuit complexity and other approaches to the problem have stalled and we have little reason to believe we will see a proof separating P from NP in the near future .
Nevertheless , the computer science landscape has dramatically changed in the nearly four decades since Steve Cook presented his seminal NP - completeness paper " The Complexity of Theorem - Proving Procedures " 10 in Shaker Heights , OH in early May , 1971 .
Computational power has dramatically increased , the cost of computing has dramatically decreased , not to mention the power of the Internet .
Computation has become a standard tool in just about every academic field .
Whole subfields of biology , chemistry , physics , economics and others are devoted to large - scale computational modeling , simulations , and problem solving .
As we solve larger and more complex problems with greater computational power and cleverer algorithms , the problems we cannot tackle begin to stand out .
The theory of NP - completeness helps us understand these limitations and the P versus NP problem begins to loom large not just as an interesting theoretical question in computer science , but as a basic principle that permeates all the sciences .
So while we do n't expect the P versus NP problem to be resolved in the near future , the question has driven research in a number of topics to help us understand , handle , and even take advantage of the hardness of various computational problems .
In this article I look at how people have tried to solve the P versus NP problem as well as how this question has shaped so much of the research in computer science and beyond .
I will look at how to handle NP - complete problems and the theory that has developed from those approaches .
I show how a new type of " interactive proof systems " led to limitations of approximation algorithms and consider whether quantum computing can solve NP - complete problems ( short answer : not likely ) .
And I close by describing a new long - term project that will try to separate P from NP using algebraic - geometric techniques .
This article does not try to be totally accurate or complete either technically or historically , but rather informally describes the P versus NP problem and the major directions in computer science inspired by this question over the past several decades .

What is the P versus NP Problem ?
Suppose we have a large group of students that we need to pair up to work on projects .
We know which students are compatible with each other and we want to put them in compatible groups of two .
We could search all possible pairings but even for 40 students we would have more than 300 billion trillion possible pairings .
In 1965 , Jack Edmonds12 gave an efficient algorithm to solve this matching problem and suggested a formal definition of " efficient computation " ( runs in time a fixed polynomial of the input size ) .
The class of problems with efficient solutions would later become known as P for " Polynomial Time . "
But many related problems do not seem to have such an efficient algorithm .
What if we wanted to make groups of three students with each pair of students in each group compatible ( Partition into Triangles ) ?
What if we wanted to find a large group of students all of whom are compatible with each other ( Clique ) ?
What if we wanted to sit students around a large round table with no incompatible students sitting next to each other ( Hamiltonian Cycle ) ?
What if we put the students into three groups so that each student is in the same group with only his or her compatibles ( 3 - Coloring ) ?
All these problems have a similar favor : Given a potential solution , for example , a seating chart for the round table , we can validate that solution efficiently .
The collection of problems that have efficiently verifiable solutions is known as NP ( for " Nondeterministic Polynomial - Time , " if you have to ask ) .
So P = NP means that for every problem that has an efficiently verifiable solution , we can find that solution efficiently as well .
We call the very hardest NP problems ( which include Partition into Triangles , Clique , Hamiltonian Cycle and 3 - Coloring ) " NP - complete , " that is , given an efficient algorithm for one of them , we can find an efficient algorithm for all of them and in fact any problem in NP .
Steve Cook , Leonid Levin , and Richard Karp10 , 24 , 27 developed the initial theory of NP - completeness that generated multiple ACM Turing Awards .
In the 1970s , theoretical computer scientists showed hundreds more problems NP - complete ( see Garey and Johnson16 ) .
An efficient solution to any NP - complete problem would imply P = NP and an efficient solution to every NP - complete problem .
Most computer scientists quickly came to believe P NP and trying to prove it quickly became the single most important question in all of theoretical computer science and one of the most important in all of mathematics .
Soon the P versus NP problem became an important computational issue in nearly every scientific discipline .
As computers grew cheaper and more powerful , computation started playing a major role in nearly every academic field , especially the sciences .
The more scientists can do with computers , the more they realize some problems seem computationally difficult .
Many of these fundamental problems turn out to be NP - complete .
A small sample :
Finding a DNA sequence that best fits a collection of fragments of the sequence ( see Gusfield 20 ) .
) .
Finding a ground state in the Ising model of phase transitions ( see Cipra 8 ) .
) .
Finding Nash Equilbriums with specific properties in a number of environments ( see Conitzer 9 ) .
) .
Finding optimal protein threading procedures .

In 2000 , the Clay Math Institute named the P versus NP problem as one of the seven most important open questions in mathematics and has offered a million - dollar prize for a proof that determines whether or not P = NP .

What If P = NP ?
To understand the importance of the P versus NP problem let us imagine a world where P = NP .
Technically we could have P = NP , but not have practical algorithms for most NP - complete problems .
But suppose in fact we do have very quick algorithms for all these problems .
Many focus on the negative , that if P = NP then public - key cryptography becomes impossible .
True , but what we will gain from P = NP will make the whole Internet look like a footnote in history .
What we would gain from P = NP will make the whole Internet look like a footnote in history .
Since all the NP - complete optimization problems become easy , everything will be much more efficient .
Transportation of all forms will be scheduled optimally to move people and goods around quicker and cheaper .
Manufacturers can improve their production to increase speed and create less waste .
And I 'm just scratching the surface .
Learning becomes easy by using the principle of Occam 's razorwe simply find the smallest program consistent with the data .
Near perfect vision recognition , language comprehension and translation and all other learning tasks become trivial .
We will also have much better predictions of weather and earthquakes and other natural phenomenon .
P = NP would also have big implications in mathematics .
One could find short , fully logical proofs for theorems but these proofs are usually extremely long .
But we can use the Occam razor principle to recognize and verify mathematical proofs as typically written in journals .
We can then find proofs of theorems that have reasonable length proofs say in under 100 pages .
A person who proves P = NP would walk home from the Clay Institute not with $ 1 million check but with seven ( actually six since the Poincaré Conjecture appears solved ) .
Do n't get your hopes up .
Complexity theorists generally believe P NP and such a beautiful world cannot exist .

Approaches to Showing P NP
Here , I present a number of ways we have tried and failed to prove P NP .
The survey of Fortnow and Homer14 gives a fuller historical overview of these techniques .
Diagonalization .
Can we just construct an NP language L specifically designed so that every single polynomial - time algorithm fails to compute L properly on some input ?
This approach , known as diagonalization , goes back to the 19th century .
In 1874 , Georg Cantor7 showed the real numbers are uncountable using a technique known as diagonalization .
Given a countable list of reals , Cantor showed how to create a new real number not on that list .
Alan Turing , in his seminal paper on computation ,38 used a similar technique to show that the Halting problem is not computable .
In the 1960s complexity theorists used diagonalization to show that given more time or memory one can solve more problems .
Why not use diagonalization to separate NP from P ?
Diagonalization requires simulation and we do n't know how a fixed NP machine can simulate an arbitrary P machine .
Also a diagonalization proof would likely relativize , that is , work even if all machines involved have access to the same additional information .
Baker , Gill and Solovay6 showed no relativizable proof can settle the P versus NP problem in either direction .
Complexity theorists have used diagonalization techniques to show some NP - complete problems like Boolean formula satisfiability cannot have algorithms that use both a small amount of time and memory , 39 but this is a long way from P NP .
Circuit Complexity .
To show P NP it is sufficient to show some NP - complete problem cannot be solved by relatively small circuits of AND , OR , and NOT gates ( the number of gates bounded by a fixed polynomial in the input size ) .
In 1984 , Furst , Saxe , and Sipser15 showed that small circuits cannot solve the parity function if the circuits have a fixed number of layers of gates .
In 1985 , Razborov31 showed the NP - complete problem of finding a large clique does not have small circuits if one only allows AND and OR gates ( no NOT gates ) .
If one extends Razborov 's result to general circuits one will have proved P NP .
Razborov later showed his techniques would fail miserably if one allows NOT gates .
32 Razborov and Rudich33 develop a notion of " natural " proofs and give evidence that our limited techniques in circuit complexity cannot be pushed much further .
And , in fact , we have n't seen any significantly new circuit lower bounds in the past 20 years .
Proof Complexity .
Consider the set of Tautologies , the Boolean formulas of variables over ANDs , ORs , and NOTs such that every setting of the variables to True and False makes true , for example the formula
A literal is a variable or its negation , such as x or NOT x .
A formula , like the one here , is in Disjunctive Normal Form ( DNF ) if it is the OR of ANDs of one or more literals .
If a formula is not a tautology , we can give an easy proof of that fact by exhibiting an assignment of the variables that makes false .
But if were indeed a tautology , we do n't expect short proofs .
If one could prove there are no short proofs of tautology that would imply P NP .
Resolution is a standard approach to proving tautologies of DNFs by finding two clauses of the form ( 1 AND x ) and ( 2 AND NOT x ) and adding the clause ( 1 AND 2 ) .
A formula is a tautology exactly when one can produce an empty clause in this manner .
In 1985 , Armin Haken21 showed that tautologies that encode the pigeonhole principle ( n + 1 pigeons in n holes means some hole has more than one pigeon ) do not have short resolution proofs .
Since then complexity theorists have shown similar weaknesses in a number of other proof systems including cutting planes , algebraic proof systems based on polynomials , and restricted versions of proofs using the Frege axioms , the basic axioms one learns in an introductory logic course .
But to prove P NP we would need to show that tautologies cannot have short proofs in an arbitrary proof system .
Even a breakthrough result showing tautologies do n't have short general Frege proofs would not suffice in separating NP from P .

Dealing with Hardness
So you have an NP - complete problem you just have to solve .
If , as we believe , P NP you wo n't find a general algorithm that will correctly and accurately solve your problem all the time .
But sometimes you need to solve the problem anyway .
All hope is not lost .
Here , I describe some of the tools one can use on NP - complete problems and how computational complexity theory studies these approaches .
Typically one needs to combine several of these approaches when tackling NP - complete problems in the real world .
Brute Force .
Computers have gotten faster , much faster since NP - completeness was first developed .
Brute force search through all possibilities is now possible for some small problem instances .
With some clever algorithms we can even solve some moderate size problems with ease .
The NP - complete traveling salesperson problem asks for the smallest distance tour through a set of specified cities .
Using extensions of the cutting - plane method we can now solve , in practice , traveling salespeople problems with more than 10,000 cities ( see Applegate3 ) .
Consider the 3SAT problem , solving Boolean formula satisfiability where formulas are in the form of the AND of several clauses where each clause is the OR of three literal variables or negations of variables ) .
3SAT remains NP - complete but the best algorithms can in practice solve SAT problems on about 100 variables .
We have similar results for other variations of satisfiability and many other NP - complete problems .
But for satisfiability on general formulae and on many other NP - complete problems we do not know algorithms better than essentially searching all the possibilities .
In addition , all these algorithms have exponential growth in their running times , so even a small increase in the problem size can kill what was an efficient algorithm .
Brute force alone will not solve NP - complete problems no matter how clever we are .
Parameterized Complexity .
Consider the Vertex Cover problem , find a set of k " central people " such that for every compatible pair of people , at least one of them is central .
For small k we can determine whether a central set of people exists efficiently no matter the total number n of people we are considering .
For the Clique problem even for small k the problem can still be difficult .
Downey and Fellows11 developed a theory of parameterized complexity that gives a fine - grained analysis of the complexity of NP - complete problems based on their parameter size .
Approximation .
We cannot hope to solve NP - complete optimization problems exactly but often we can get a good approximate answer .
Consider the traveling salesperson problem again with distances between cities given as the crow flies ( Euclidean distance ) .
This problem remains NP - complete but Arora4 gives an efficient algorithm that gets very close to the best possible route .
Consider the MAX - CUT problem of dividing people into two groups to maximize the number of incompatibles between the groups .
Goemans and Williamson17 use semi- definite programming to give a division of people only a .878567 factor of the best possible .
Heuristics and Average - Case Complexity .
The study of NP - completeness focuses on how algorithms perform on the worst possible inputs .
However the specific problems that arise in practice may be much easier to solve .
Many computer scientists employ various heuristics to solve NP - complete problems that arise from the specific problems in their fields .
While we create heuristics for many of the NP - complete problems , Boolean formula Satisfiability ( SAT ) receives more attention than any other .
Boolean formulas , especially those in conjunctive normal form ( CNF ) , the AND of ORs of variables and their negations , have a very simple description and yet are general enough to apply to a large number of practical scenarios particularly in software verification and artificial intelligence .
Most natural NP - complete problems have simple efficient reductions to the satisfiability of Boolean formulas .
In competition these SAT solvers can often settle satisfiability of formulas of one million variables .
a
Computational complexity theorists study heuristics by considering average - case complexityhow well can algorithms perform on average from instances generated by some specific distribution .
Leonid Levin28 developed a theory of efficient algorithms over a specific distribution and formulated a distributional version of the P versus NP problem .
Some problems , like versions of the shortest vector problem in a lattice or computing the permanent of a matrix , are hard on average exactly when they are hard on worst - case inputs , but neither of these problems is believed to be NP - complete .
Whether similar worst - to - average reductions hold for NP - complete sets is an important open problem .
Average - case complexity plays an important role in many areas of computer science , particularly cryptography , as discussed later .

Interactive Proofs and Limits of Approximation
Previously , we saw how sometimes one can get good approximate solutions to NP - complete optimization problems .
Many times though we seem to hit a limit on our ability to even get good approximations .
We now know that we cannot achieve better approximations on many of these problems unless P = NP and we could solve these problems exactly .
The techniques to show these negative results came out of a new model of proof system originally developed for cryptography and to classify group theoretic algorithmic problems .
As mentioned earlier , we do n't expect to have short traditional proofs of tautologies .
But consider an " interactive proof " model where a prover Peggy tries to convince a verifier Victor that a formula is a tautology .
Victor can ask Peggy randomly generated questions and need only be convinced with high confidence .
Quite surprisingly , these proof systems have been shown to exist not only for tautologies but for any problem computable in a reasonable amount of memory .
A variation known as a " probabilistically checkable proof system " ( PCPs ) , where Peggy writes down an encoded proof and Victor can make randomized queries to the bits of the proof , has applications for approximations .
The " PCP Theorem " optimizes parameters , which in its strong form shows that every language in NP has a PCP where Victor uses a tiny number of random coins and queries only three bits of the proof .
One can use this PCP theorem to show the limitations of approximation for a large number of optimization questions .
For example , one cannot approximate the largest clique in a group of n people by more than a multiplicative ratio of nearly unless P = NP .
See Madhu Sudan 's recent article in Communications for more details and references on PCPs.36
One can do even better assuming a " Unique Games Conjecture " that there exists PCPs for NP problems with some stronger properties .
Consider the MAX - CUT problem of dividing people discussed earlier .
If the unique games conjecture holds one cannot do better than the .878567 factor given by the Goemans - Williamson approximation algorithm .
26
Recent work shows how to get a provably best approximation for essentially any constrained problem assuming this conjecture .
30
We expect P NP to hold in very strong ways .
We can use strong hardness assumptions as a positive tool , particularly to create cryptographic protocols and to reduce or even eliminate the need of random bits in probabilistic algorithms .
Back to Top
Using Hardness
In " What If P = NP ? " we saw the nice world that arises when we assume P = NP .
But we expect P NP to hold in very strong ways .
We can use strong hardness assumptions as a positive tool , particularly to create cryptographic protocols and to reduce or even eliminate the need of random bits in probabilistic algorithms .
Cryptography .
We take it for granted these days , the little key or lock on our Web page that tells us that someone listening to the network wo n't get the credit card number I just sent to an online store or the password to the bank that controls my money .
But public - key cryptography , the ability to send secure messages between two parties that have never privately exchanged keys , is a relatively new development based on hardness assumptions of computational problems .
If P = NP then public - key cryptography is impossible .
Assuming P NP is not enough to get public - key protocols , instead we need strong average - case assumptions about the difficulty of factoring or related problems .
We can do much more than just public - key cryptography using hard problems .
Suppose Alice 's husband Bob is working on a Sudoku puzzle and Alice claims she has a solution to the puzzle ( solving a n × n Sudoku puzzle is NP - complete ) .
Can Alice convince
Bob that she knows a solution without revealing any piece of it ?
Alice can use a " zero - knowledge proof , " an interactive proof with the additional feature that the verifier learns nothing other than some property holds , like a Sudoku puzzle having a solution .
Every NP search problem has a zero - knowledge proof under the appropriate hardness assumptions .
Online poker is generally played through some " trusted " Web site , usually somewhere in the Caribbean .
Can we play poker over the Internet without a trusted server ?
Using the right cryptographic assumptions , not only poker but any protocol that uses a trusted party can be replaced by one that uses no trusted party and the players can't cheat or learn anything new beyond what they could do with the trusted party . b
Eliminating Randomness .
In the 1970s we saw a new type of algorithm , one that used random bits to aid in finding a solution to a problem .
Most notably we had probabilistic algorithms35 for determining whether a number is prime , an important routine needed for modern cryptography .
In 2004 , we discovered we do n't need randomness at all to efficiently determine if a number is prime .
2
Does randomness help us at all in finding solutions to NP problems ?
Truly independent and uniform random bits are either very difficult or impossible to produce ( depending on your beliefs about quantum mechanics ) .
Computer algorithms instead use pseudorandom generators to generate a sequence of bits from some given seed .
The generators typically found on our computers usually work well but occasionally give incorrect results both in theory and in practice .
We can create theoretically better pseudorandom generators in two different ways , one based on the strong hardness assumptions of cryptography and the other based on worst - case complexity assumptions .
I will focus on this second approach .
We need to assume a bit more than P NP , roughly that NP - complete problems cannot be solved by smaller than expected AND - OR - NOT circuits .
A long series of papers showed that , under this assumption , any problem with an efficient probabilistic algorithm also has an efficient algorithm that uses a pseudorandom generator with a very short seed , a surprising connection between hard languages and pseudo - randomness ( see Impagliazzo23 ) .
The seed is so short we can try all possible seeds efficiently and avoid the need for randomness altogether .
Thus complexity theorists generally believe having randomness does not help in solving NP search problems and that NP - complete problems do not have efficient solutions , either with or without using truly random bits .
While randomness does n't seem necessary for solving search problems , the unpredictability of random bits plays a critical role in cryptography and interactive proof systems and likely cannot be avoided in these scenarios .

Could Quantum Computers Solve NP - Complete Problems ?
While we have randomized and nonrandomized efficient algorithms for determining whether a number is prime , these algorithms usually do n't give us the factors of a composite number .
Much of modern cryptography relies on the fact that factoring or similar problems do not have efficient algorithms .
In the mid-1990s , Peter Shor34 showed how to factor numbers using a hypothetical quantum computer .
He also developed a similar quantum algorithm to solve the discrete logarithm problem .
The hardness of discrete logarithm on classical computers is also used as a basis for many cryptographic protocols .
Nevertheless , we do n't expect that factoring or finding discrete logarithms are NP - complete .
While we do n't think we have efficient algorithms to solve factoring or discrete logarithm , we also do n't believe we can reduce NP - complete problems like Clique to the factoring or discrete logarithm problems .
So could quantum computers one day solve NP - complete problems ?
Unlikely .
I 'm not a physicist so I wo n't address the problem as to whether these machines can actually be built at a large enough scale to solve factoring problems larger than we can with current technology ( about 200 digits ) .
After billions of dollars of funding of quantum computing research we still have a long way to go .
Even if we could build these machines , Shor 's algorithm relies heavily on the algebraic structures of numbers that we do n't see in the known NP - complete problems .
We know that his algorithm cannot be applied to generic " black - box " search problems so any algorithm would have to use some special structure of NP - complete problems that we do n't know about .
We have used some algebraic structure of NP - complete problems for interactive and zero - knowledge proofs but quantum algorithms would seem to require much more .
Lov Grover19 did find a quantum algorithm that works on general NP problems but that algorithm only achieves a quadratic speed - up and we have evidence that those techniques will not go further .
Meanwhile quantum cryptography , using quantum mechanics to achieve some cryptographic protocols without hardness assumptions , has had some success both in theory and in practice .

A New Hope ?
Ketan Mulmuley and Milind Sohoni have presented an approach to the P versus NP problem through algebraic geometry , dubbed Geometric Complexity Theory , or GCT.29
This approach seems to avoid the difficulties mentioned earlier , but requires deep mathematics that could require many years or decades to carry through .
In essence , they define a family of high - dimension polygons P n based on group representations on certain algebraic varieties .
Roughly speaking , for each n , if P n contains an integral point , then any circuit family for the Hamiltonian path problem must have size at least nlog n on inputs of size n , which implies P NP .
Thus , to show that P NP it suffices to show that P n contains an integral point for all n .
Although all that is necessary is to show that P n contains an integral point for all n , Mulmuley and Sohoni argue that this direct approach would be difficult and instead suggest first showing that the integer programming problem for the family P n is , in fact , in P .
Under this approach , there are three significant steps remaining :
Prove that the LP relaxation solves the integer programming problem for P n in polynomial time ;
Find an efficient , simple combinatorial algorithm for the integer programming problem for P n , and ;
Prove that this simple algorithm always answers " yes . "
Since the polygons P n are algebro - geometric in nature , solving ( 1 ) is thought to require algebraic geometry , representation theory , and the theory of quantum groups .
Mulmuley and Sohoni have given reasonable algebro- geometric conditions that imply ( 1 ) .
These conditions have classical analogues that are known to hold , based on the Riemann Hypothesis over finite fields ( a theorem proved by André Weil in the 1960s ) .
Mulmuley and Sohoni suggest that an analogous Riemann Hypothesis - like statement is required here ( though not the classical Riemann Hypothesis ) .
Although step ( 1 ) is difficult , Mulmuley and Sohoni have provided definite conjectures based on reasonable mathematical analogies that would solve ( 1 ) .
In contrast , the path to completing steps ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) is less clear .
Despite these remaining hurdles , even solving the conjectures involved in ( 1 ) could provide some insight to the P versus NP problem .
Mulmuley and Sohoni have reduced a question about the nonexistence of polynomial - time algorithms for all NP - complete problems to a question about the existence of a polynomial - time algorithm ( with certain properties ) for a specific problem .
This should give us some hope , even in the face of problems ( 1 ) ( 3 ) .
Nevertheless , Mulmuley believes it will take about 100 years to carry out this program , if it works at all .

Conclusion
This survey focused on the P versus NP problem , its importance , our attempts to prove P NP and the approaches we use to deal with the NP - complete problems that nature and society throws at us .
Much of the work mentioned required a long series of mathematically difficult research papers that I could not hope to adequately cover in this short article .
Also the field of computational complexity goes well beyond just the P versus NP problem that I have n't discussed here .
In " Further Reading , " a number of references are presented for those interested in a deeper understanding of the P versus NP problem and computational complexity .
The P versus NP problem has gone from an interesting problem related to logic to perhaps the most fundamental and important mathematical question of our time , whose importance only grows as computers become more powerful and widespread .
The question has even hit popular culture appearing in television shows such as The Simpsons and Numb3rs .
Yet many only know of the basic principles of P versus NP and I hope this survey has given you a small feeling of the depth of research inspired by this mathematical problem .
Proving P NP would not be the end of the story , it would just show that NP - complete problem , do n't have efficient algorithms for all inputs but many questions might remain .
Cryptography , for example , would require that a problem like factoring ( not believed to be NP - complete ) is hard for randomly drawn composite numbers .
Proving P NP might not be the start of the story either .
Weaker separations remain perplexingly difficult , for example showing that Boolean - formula Satisfiability cannot be solved in near - linear time or showing that some problem using a certain amount of memory cannot be solved using roughly the same amount of time .
None of us truly understands the P versus NP problem , we have only begun to peel the layers around this increasingly complex question .
Perhaps we will see a resolution of the P versus NP problem in the near future but I almost hope not .
The P versus NP problem continues to inspire and boggle the mind and continued exploration of this problem will lead us to yet even new complexities in that truly mysterious process we call computation .

For the definition of " vanish " and the proof , see my Japanese site http://www.int2.info/news1.htm

Not reading Japanese , it is hard for me even to understand what the claim is .
I 'd suggest to Jinsei Yamaguchi to submit his result to a scholarly publication for review .

I 'd like to congratulate Dr Fortnow and the CACM editors for one of the best pieces I 've read in CACM in years .
This article is engaging and clear , on a topic of broad theoretical and practical interest .

A problem is just only a matter of debate .
The only thing we can not control is the time .
Assuming that a problem when you dissolve it , its importance is relative , because what can already solve a minor .
The problem is the importance of the correct definition of the most important and hence the explanatory memorandum in relation to the proper time .
If a calculation is needed done today , but only months later , I get accurate results .
It is no longer important to the results tomorrow .
Unless my life depends on it , because it certainly calculated ! :)
There are no insoluble problems !
You do not always worth the time to devote as much .

" P=NP " does n't imply " public - key cryptography becomes impossible " .
Nor does it imply " short , fully logical proofs " .
This is because the order for polynomial time algorithms can still be astronomical .
Search , for example , for " inefficient " at http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=803896
( " Linear time algorithm for isomorphism of planar graphs " , by Hopcroft / Wong )
I do n't think that is a good point to make .

Thank you for an excellent article !
( And , if I am correctly using a cultural term from a generation younger than mine " respect " for the " New Hope " reference . )
My own intuition is , that P <> NP , but I would love to be proved wrong .
One line , however , struck me .
> Nevertheless , Mulmuley believes it will take about 100 years to
> carry out this program , if it works at all .
This is the piece in which I have a strong disagreement .
I believe that the calculation of " about 100 years " fails to adequately take into account the advances in machine - based theorem proving .
At the risk of sounding " singularitian " , I would be willing to wager that the problem will :
EITHER be solved by 2050
OR prove unsolveable , and not be solved by 2500

To the two posters who provided solutions to the P vs NP problem , you solved a different P vs NP problem than the one that everyone else is discussing . :)
Good work , though !

The real issue of P vs NP is it 's framed incorrectly .
If one thinks of the costs in terms of physics I imagine many problems would disappear .
This is the problem when being caught up in the mathematics without a sound understanding of the physics of the world itself .
You 've framed the problem incorrectly to begin with so you end up pursuing stupid questions .

Seamus Heaney , photographed in Dublin , 2009 .
Photograph : Antonio Olmos
Seamus Heaney is taking a taxi from his home in Sandymount , which overlooks the bright grey waters of Dublin Bay , to the centre of town .
Our driver is silent , but bursting with respect .
When the poet compliments him on the ingenuity of his route through the lunchtime traffic , the cabbie exclaims , with a sudden loss of discretion , " Only the best now for Ireland 's favourite son . "
Everyone wants a piece of Ireland 's first Nobel - winning poet since Yeats .
When we arrive at our destination , an oyster bar overlooking St Stephen 's Green , the ebb and flow of Irish pride in Seamus , as he is universally known , surges up in a succession of spontaneous greetings .
Everyone recognises Heaney 's professorial spectacles and silvery mop .
A frisson passes through the restaurant .
This woman wants to tell him about her daughter , recovering from leukaemia , and to ask for an autograph .
Two punters , checking the starting prices on a laptop , volunteer a tip about the 2.30 at Leopardstown .
Another old chap wants to be remembered .
And the maître d' is beside himself with getting the best table ready .
I wonder how Heaney can stand it .
No need to worry .
The object of this attention seems to move in a serene bubble of modesty and unconcern : he likes the attention , and it does not really trouble him .
He 's had it , in different ways , all his life , and he knows that , for an Irish poet , it comes with the territory .
There are many ways to be a famous writer in Dublin .
You can be mad and grand , like Yeats ; or mysterious , like Beckett ; or drunk , like Flann O'Brien ; or absent , like Joyce ; or what ?
A long time ago , Clive James nailed Heaney with " Seamus Famous " , but that 's a gag , at best half true , spun off Heaney 's brilliant self - presentation .
There is rather more to the poet than his fame , dazzling though that can be .
For someone who has been so remorselessly scrutinised , Heaney is still something of an enigma .
He works hard to make " famous " seem normal .
Unfailingly courteous and attentive , he can also be grave , remote and occasionally stern , always watching himself , like the king of a vulnerable monarchy .
In keeping with that vigilance , and a well - defended uncertainty , Heaney is always asking himself the essential questions articulated in Preoccupations , his collected essays .
" How should a poet properly live and write ?
What is his relationship to be to his own voice , his own place , his literary heritage and his contemporary world ? "
I 've known Seamus Heaney for about half of his writing life .
The key to our friendship was always a third party : the mischievous , antic figure of the folk - singer , broadcaster and lord of misrule , David Hammond , from Belfast .
Last summer , after a long illness , Hammond died .
I was in America at the time , and unable to go to the funeral .
As part of my farewell to " Davey " , I knew I had to see Seamus , pay my respects to the dead , and share the recollection of old times .
Quite apart from my deep affection for Hammond , I 'm conscious that Heaney is keen on the proper obsequies ( he loves funerals ) and will be only too glad to raise a glass to our old friend .
It 's a good moment .
Heaney has just turned 70 .
On the table in the window of his attic study - the place that he calls his " hutch " - there are three piles of poetry books : he wants to pass on good first editions of his life 's work to his children .
As well as copies of the best - known volumes ( Death of a Naturalist , North , Field Work , Door into the Dark and Station Island ) there are the translations ( Sweeney Astray , Beowulf ) , the plays ( The Cure at Troy , The Burial at Thebes ) , and some very rare editions from small presses , an accumulated bibliography of between 30 and 40 titles .
With three score years and ten behind him , Heaney is in a quasi-mystical mood , ready to take stock of his life and to address the question of growing old as a poet .
" The problem as you get older , " he says , " is that you become more self - aware .
At the same time you have to surprise yourself .
There 's no way of arranging the surprise , so it is tricky .
You 're either obsessed or you 're surprised .
There 's no halfway house . "
Lately , his age has given him both an extra reason to take stock and also a premonitory surprise , a sudden tap on the shoulder .
In August 2006 , Heaney had a stroke , something he 's not spoken about publicly before .
Heaney and his wife , Marie , were up in Donegal for the 75th birthday of Ann Friel , wife of Brian , the playwright .
" We flew up there , " says Heaney , taking up the story .
" There were many old friends .
We all stayed in a boarding house , and went to bed at around 12.30 . "
In the past , Donegal has been the scene of certain bardic revels , but on this occasion , he says , " it was n't a wild night .
David Hammond was there , Brian Friel himself .
John Hume .
Tom Kilroy [ the writer ] , Desmond Kavanagh .
I went to bed around one o'clock , and woke at eight the next morning .
We were in a twin - bedded room , and I spoke across the gap between us to Marie , reporting a remark made to me the night before by Brian Friel about another distinguished Irish writer .
You know , in the middle of the floor , he 'd said to me , ' X is a real shit , you know . ' "
Heaney goes on , " So we had a good laugh about this , and then I made a move to get out of bed , and I felt strange .
I did n't know what was wrong with me .
I made to move , but I could n't move , and I felt very odd .
My speech was n't affected .
When Marie came over to help me , she saw my leg was twisted , and she began to cry out .
And I said , ' For God 's sake , calm down . '
Yes , I spoke roughly to my little girl , and then I realised there was something seriously wrong , so I apologised to her and said .
' Yes , you 'd better go to the Kavanaghs . ' "
This was a piece of luck .
Mary and Desmond Kavanagh and their children are medics .
" So immediately the family went into action , " Heaney continues .
" The medical grapevine across the country was alerted and the ambulance was on its way .
[ The poet ] Peter Fallon and Kavanagh carried me down the stairs . "
Heaney reports his instinctive Ulster sang froid , saying : " My sense of humour was intact as they were carrying me down . "
Almost everyone involved in getting the bulky , 6ft figure of Heaney down the stairs had been involved with the Field Day theatre company , and many of the group had recently suffered minor illnesses .
So now , with his natural detachment , Heaney made a joke .
" It 's the curse of Field Day , I said .
But within an hour I was in the ambulance . "
" The trip in the ambulance I always remember , " he says , " because Marie was in the back with me .
I just wrote about it three weeks ago .
To me , that was one of the actual beauties of the stroke , that renewal of love in the ambulance .
One of the strongest , sweetest memories I have .
We went through Glendorn on a very beautiful , long , bumpy ride to Letterkenny hospital . "
There , they did a scan , he continues .
" And the woman who was doing the scan - this is Ireland for you - the nurse said , ' I believe you were at Friel 's last night . '
Her uncle had been at the party .
So this is Ireland , " he repeats , with satisfaction .
It 's certainly Heaney 's Ireland .
Heaney 's stroke - the festive occasion ; the circle of old friends ; the jokes ; the Irish grapevine ; the observation of the self from afar ; the country drive - is all of a piece with the poet 's character , good fortune and his unflappable temperament .
Within a comparatively short time , a matter of weeks , he was on the road to recovery .
Looking back , he can even refer to his hospitalisation as " a rest cure " .
But I 've had my own experience of stroke .
It is much bleaker than that .
So I pressed him about the darker side of his experience .
" Yes , I cried , " he says .
" I cried , and I wanted my Daddy , funnily enough .
I did .
I felt babyish . "
But the public Heaney cannot enjoy the luxury of self - indulgence .
Even by his standards , the next stage of his convalescence was surreal , a visit from a friend , the former president of the United States .
" Clinton was here for the Ryder Cup , " he says .
" He 'd been up with the Taoiseach [ Bertie Ahern ] and had heard about my ' episode ' .
The next thing , he put a call to the hospital , and said he was on his way .
He strode into the ward like a kind of god .
My fellow sufferers , four or five men much more stricken than I was , were amazed .
But he shook their hands and introduced himself .
It was marvellous , really .
He went round all the wards and gave the whole hospital a terrific boost .
We had about 25 minutes with him , and talked about Ulysses Grant 's memoirs , which he was reading . "
Then Clinton was off , back to the airport .
Around this time , perhaps responding to the larger stage on which he always finds himself , he began to write a poem , Miracle , inspired by the gospel story of the paralysed man lowered through the roof into Christ 's presence .
Heaney insists that it's not a spiritual poem , but one that marked " being changed a bit by something happening .
Every now and again you write a poem that changes gear . "
He had never written a poem in response to scripture before , and says he is not a believer .
But clearly the stroke had come as a powerful moment of punctuation in his intensely busy life , and gave him the idea that he should devote more time to himself .
" I looked at the calendar after these days in the hospital , " he says .
" I thought , ' My God , you 've never stopped , Seamus . '
So , for a year afterwards , I just cancelled everything .
I decided that in hospital . "
So now there was another pressure , a new conflict to wrestle with .
" I spend a lot of time saying ' No ' to people , " he says , " and then being anxious about saying No . "
He says his illness has heightened an inner sense of private doubt , confiding , " I 'm less confident about public speaking .
I spend a lot of time worrying about it , and getting it ready .
I 'm not good spontaneously at all .
I suppose it 's balancing a sense of obligation against self - preservation . "
Meanwhile , in hospital , making a steady recovery , he read more than he had in ages , finding a special comfort in thrillers by Henning Mankell , Donna Leon and Robert Harris .
With time on his hands , inevitably he also reviewed his situation .
His mother had died of a stroke at 74 , never regaining consciousness ; his father from colon cancer at 76 .
Did he , from his hospital bed , have any regrets about succumbing to the pressures of celebrity ?
" I ca n't regret myself , " he replies .
" I mean , it 's part of me , for better or worse .
I 'm aware now that I 've repeated myself , but it 's my temperament .
I 'm stuck with it . "
Seamus Heaney was born in 1939 , just before the Second World War , on the farm of Mossbawn , near the village of Castledawson , County Derry , into an Ulster farming family .
In one of his poems , he recalls a strangely tranquil haven from the storms raging across the west - the thump of a sledgehammer , and the " heavyweight silence " of cattle in the rain .
Mossbawn is equidistant from Derry and Belfast , in deep country , a one - storey thatched and whitewashed house set back from a main road , though the traffic was always intermittent .
Heaney says that the dominant notes in Mossbawn were the clucks and cackles of the hens , and sometimes the roar of a calf or cow from a nearby field .
He also remembers the screams of the pigs from the slaughterhouse across the way .
His mother , who was a McCann , gave him the convivial side of his character .
" The Heaneys were more kind of native American , " he jokes .
" They were always in the wigwam , facing each other , and very grave .
There was a kind of stoicism about the Heaneys and an Anglo - Saxon melancholy , and everything was very measured .
Marie once said of them that they did n't carry a spare ounce of emotional weight .
That was completely true . "
To be crude about it , his McCann side nurtures his public face , while the Heaney part fuels the graver and more introspective reflections of the poetry .
His wife Marie also tells me that Mossbawn holds the key to her husband .
" It 's his paradise , " she says .
" His Eden .
All he 's ever wanted to do is go back . "
Both the McCanns and the Heaneys were Roman Catholic families in Protestant Ulster .
This has placed him at the murderous crossroads of sectarian conflict and Irish nationalism throughout his life .
It 's an unenviable and dangerous location at the best of times , and there 's a part of him that 's highly attuned to the history and heritage of oppression .
He has always moved , as he puts it , " like a double agent among the big concepts " .
On both sides of the border , some still question his loyalties .
" My mother 's side , " he goes on , speaking carefully , " were much more alert to the exacerbations of the situation , and with a stronger sense of injustice , and a more articulate mockery .
The irony is so important .
In the north , northern irony has allowed people to stand at the edge of the rift and shout across to each other .
This is very important , actually .
David Hammond used to say , ' Banter , banter is the curse of us all . ' "
Life in Mossbawn , in the Ulster countryside , is what gives Heaney his language and imagery - words like " braird " , " seggans " and " sned " , titles like A Hagging Match , The Haw Lantern , and Broagh , a placename almost impossible for an outsider to pronounce correctly .
I remember asking him about the nuances of Ulster English for a television programme some years back .
Heaney 's reply expressed not only a deep reverence for the sanctity of his country paradise , but also articulated the source of his creative energy .
He remains , pre-eminently , the poet of the peat bog and the home fire .
He said : " Your language has a lot to do with your confidence , your sense of place and authority . "
He added that speaking his own language , Irish English , was to acquire a trust in the pronunciation and in the quirks of vocabulary , and " to go through a kind of political re-awakening " .
Heaney 's poetry has a distinctive poetic language that comes from a direct and intimate connection with the Irish landscape and its culture rather than any academic literary ambition .
He has often said that he showed no special aptitude or poetic promise as a child .
A poem like Alphabets recalls a small boy wondering over the alphabet , but showing no precocious mastery - " First it is ' copying out ' , and then ' English ' " - until , as he puts it , " the poet 's dream stole over him like sunlight . "
If there was poetry in Mossbawn , it came through holiday , festival and party recitations .
Then , in 1953 , this paradise was shattered when his brother Christopher was killed in a road accident , aged three .
In the elegiac poem Mid-Term Break , Heaney wrote about this dreadful episode in his young , adolescent life ( he was 13 ) .
He describes being " embarrassed by old men standing up to shake my hand " , and then , with the poet 's detachment , seeing his baby brother 's corpse laid out in an upstairs room with " a poppy bruise on his left temple " .
Even by the stoical traditions of the North , Heaney learned early to ingest his pain .
Young Seamus was the scholarship boy in a family of seven boys and two girls .
As the clever , eldest one , he was bound for the city - the great Protestant industrial and shipbuilding inferno of Belfast .
As a country boy , banished from Eden , he was lost .
His first poems were written under the pseudonym " Incertus " .
He has described the personality of this pseudonymous poet as expert in obeisance , " a shy soul fretting .
Oh yes , I crept before I walked . "
" I was describing my own unsureness , " Heaney explains , when I ask him about the Incertus pseudonym .
" Describing exactly the inner state of the creature .
When I was an undergraduate [ at Queen's , Belfast ] , I was in the poetry - aspiring business , and I did n't feel confident .
I did n't feel I had crossed any line .
I was still scrabbling on the outside , not entering . "
Heaney , who often harks back to the Anglo - Saxons , has many of their qualities .
Behind his homespun bareness there 's a highly wrought editorial process at work , and a good deal of artifice in which things are not quite as they seem .
It 's this that can sustain an accusation of deviousness and even cunning .
In his own career , " Incertus " was soon replaced by " Seamus J. Heaney " .
This was the young man from Castledawson who , at the turn of the Sixties , began to experiment with poetry .
In the autumn of 1962 , Heaney met young Marie Devlin , his future wife .
" We met at a dinner .
That evening I walked her home , and I lent her a book , saying I needed it back by Thursday .
The disgraceful truth was that I had a girlfriend , and she was returning on Friday . "
It 's a long time ago , but he is still rather sheepish about the memory .
" So we met on Thursday , and then there was a kind of stealth .
It took a long time to clear the decks .
But there was a kind of immediate recognition , yes . "
As well as falling in love , he began to write poems with " a new sense of possibility , and a new confidence " .
He protests that " they were n't any good , " but remembers " I was excited . "
He had joined Philip Hobsbaum 's influential Belfast poetry circle , a group , he once said , " who used to talk poetry day after day with an intensity and prejudice that cannot but have left a mark on all of us " .
It was within this circle that he first wrote poems such as Digging , Tollund Man , Mid-Term Break and Death of a Naturalist .
With an exhilarating sense of discovery and excitement , these early poems were published by Karl Miller in the New Statesman .
Then Faber showed interest ; everything was happening very fast .
" I knew I was n't quite ready , " Heaney says , " but I wrote like hell and sent the manuscript in . "
That was January 1965 .
When he describes it now , it seems to him as if it was yesterday .
" To be truthful , it was n't until North was written , and had come out , that I felt I had followed a calling or done something in the name of it . "
Death of a Naturalist was noted for poetry that sprang from the farming life of Heaney 's youth , and its subtle communication of a physical and pastoral intensity in a language of profound and unforced simplicity .
Heaney , whose work appeared at the same time as Thomas Kinsella , Derek Mahon , Michael Longley , Paul Muldoon and Ciaran Carson found himself hailed as a standard - bearer for a " Northern Renaissance " , a movement centred on Belfast that some have dismissed as a journalistic construction but which , nonetheless , signalled an end to the poetically barren 1940s and 50s .
Edna O'Brien , who has followed Heaney 's career from the beginning , " devouring everything he wrote " , believes that , once he had emerged from the cocoon of literary Belfast , " his place in Irish literature was guaranteed , secure , and goldplated . "
" There 's a poem in his collection District and Circle [ called ]
The Lift , that is truly great , " she says .
" His essays , too , are so marvellously luminous , so erudite and accessible . "
Invited to compare him to Yeats , she demurs blithely .
" I 'm not going to go down that road , " she laughs .
" Great writers are unique , and beyond comparisons . "
From the beginning , then , Heaney always seemed destined for greater things .
Despite his precocious flying start , Heaney says he was still " uncertain at that stage what I was doing " .
He took a postgraduate year of teacher training , not realising it was a blind alley : " I thought I was going to be a teacher , " he says .
" The first guy out of the family , and into the trade with a degree . "
At this early stage , and throughout his career , Heaney has been susceptible to the influence of stronger artistic talents .
Now he met a poet , later a great and enduring friend , who " actually sent a charge of energy through me , a kind of electric Hopkinsian transmission " .
He had met Ted Hughes .
" I always felt safer for Ted 's friendship somehow , " he says now , recalling the poet laureate .
" He was foundational to me .
As you know , he transmitted a desire to be more yourself to yourself . "
Of their first meeting , he says , almost bride - like , " I recall trembling with excitement and shyness . "
The next time they were together , for a reading , Hughes came over with his partner Assia Wevill .
" We sat up in my house in Belfast that night after the reading , drinking poteen and singing .
Marie sang songs .
I think Assia sang some Israeli songs , and Ted sang ' The Brown and Yellow Ale ' , which he said was [ James ]
Joyce 's favourite song .
Everybody was young .
Assia was quite magnificently beautiful .
She said a wonderfully grand and affected thing to me .
She could see I was excited and in awe of Ted , and she said ' Poets ought to be like bishops .
Each should have his own diocese and meet not all that often , and quite formally . '
I remember Marie had a strong sense that Assia was somehow halted by Sylvia [ Plath ] , and in competition with her . "
Now that we 're talking about Ted Hughes , a poet who was always so attuned to an unpoliced unconscious , and even the astrological side of creativity , it seems like the right moment to ask about the question of inspiration .
Where does poetry come from ?
In his response to this question , Heaney is probably more pragmatic and Anglo - Saxon than Hughes would have been .
" I think it comes from all the other poetry that 's there , " he replies .
" I think that a relationship with something else is called for - all the other poetry that 's around , or the culture , or the times , or your clique - and it calls the poetry out of you . "
Is there someone who does this ?
" To get started , what starts you ? " he wonders .
" You can call it the muse , but it 's excitement , the beloved .
Certainly , there 's a kind of quickening . "
He begins to describe this excitement .
" There is a physical need .
I need to feel a purchase on something .
I used to say that it was like a bite on the line , or a tug .
With me , the purchase is a ' thingyness ' or a ' memoryness ' " .
Now he 's becoming slightly Delphic , and I sense we 're drifting into some ancient Celtic cave .
" It really comes out of - from the side ...
Like a ball kicked in , " he goes on , speaking of this private moment with a tangible , strange reticence .
" It 's rather risky .
I do n't keep a notebook .
I 'm superstitious .
I always felt that if I started to be assiduous about it , and looked for it , then it might go away .
Or I would turn into a different kind of writer . "
So is Marie his muse ?
" Well , she was a muse , certainly , " he replies .
I 'm not exactly sure what to make of this answer , but before we can go down that avenue , he 's switched back to Hughes .
" Ted 's phrase , which I love quoting , is that the only thing that distinguishes what we call poetry from the other literary arts was that it arrived from ' the place of ultimate suffering and decision ' in us . "
He repeats the phrase with relish and satisfaction , as if it defines something important about his own work .
For Heaney , the Irish Catholic from the North , the central and inescapable fact about his creative life , from Death of a Naturalist ( 1966 ) to the present day , is that it had been shadowed , haunted , and occasionally blighted , by the Troubles .
If ever there was a place of " ultimate suffering " in Heaney , it must be located somewhere in the historical and psychic trauma of Northern Ireland .
But when you read Heaney 's poems , you rarely find any committed parallel narrative .
It 's as though , from very early on , out of temperament as much as self - preservation , double - agent Heaney chose to step back from , or to the side of , the crisis .
To be detached , and uninvolved .
To elevate his uncertainty into art , and transmute it into the lyricism of everyday life and the " thingyness " of things .
How he executed this manoeuvre is not exactly clear , but there 's a story he tells against himself that says a lot about his innate diplomatic skills in navigating the bloody waters of the sectarian North .
When he lived in Belfast during the beginning of the Troubles , Heaney used to buy fish and chips at a shop on the edge of fiercely loyalist territory .
One night in the chippy a new assistant , not knowing Heaney as a regular , recognised him from a television arts show the night before .
" Oh , " she cried , lashing on the salt and vinegar .
" I saw you on the box last night , did n't I ?
Are n't you the Irish poet ? "
Before Heaney could answer this , the most loaded of all local questions , the owner of the shop turned from her frying to correct the girl .
" Not at all , dear , " she said .
" He 's like the rest of us , a British subject living in Ulster .
God , " she went on , now speaking directly to Heaney , " would n't it sicken you ?
Having to listen to that ?
Irish poet ! "
When he repeats this story , Heaney confesses he was afraid to contradict her .
Are n't you the Irish poet ?
The irony is that , having used all his resources to evade the question , Heaney is now , more than ever , defined in this way .
At this point , Marie Heaney , climbing up the stairs to the poet 's " hutch " , arrives with cups of coffee .
She is recovering from a successful cancer treatment , and wears a wig .
Today , she has lost her voice .
There 's a whispered conversation in which Heaney wonders if it's not too early for " a nip " ( of Bushmills ) , and then we continue .
At first , he says he had been carried along on " a generational conveyor belt " .
He 'd been the " scholarship boy , chosen boy , first class degree .
I 'd gone into teaching , and had blessedly encountered poetry , the magic of print .
I 'd been published , and it all just came along .
It happened very fast , and I knew that I was being overpraised in my first three books .
I was n't as sure as other people were . "
Then , in 1970 , he was invited to Berkeley , California , and his eyes were opened .
" This gave me a sense that I could make a choice .
I was n't just on the conveyor belt .
I could step off it .
When we came back from Berkeley in 1971 , I was ready to make the move and become a writer , as it were .
America influenced me in taking the step to leave Queen 's and go freelance . "
He does n't see this as leaving Belfast because of the Troubles , as some have alleged .
" I said , I have to verify myself to myself .
I would give up the job [ at Queen 's University ] .
Among other things , I felt I was drinking too much .
The relationship between the move to County Wicklow and the happenings in the North was n't cause and effect at all , no . "
Heaney insists that the cause of his move was what he calls " the writerly desire .
It was the right thing at the right tine .
But , of course , once I moved there was the sense of historical change , and an editorial in the Irish Times , ' Heaney moves South ' .
So this was already mythologised , and I could n't escape the sense that it was a public act as well as a private . "
Just before I met Heaney , I had come across a quotation from Thomas Mann 's The Magic Mountain , which seemed appropriate .
Now I read it out to him for his reaction : " A man lives not only his personal life as an individual but also consciously or unconsciously the life of his epoch and his contemporaries . "
Heaney listens thoughtfully , and after a pause , he agrees .
" That 's true , " he says .
" You did n't need to be a writer to be living the same life [ of the Troubles ] .
That 's what gave everybody who came to the fore in my generation a charge . "
Temperamentally , he cannot be unambiguous about his answer , and launches into a complicated and not wholly convincing theory about how the poetry of Belfast in the 60s was not related to the violence .
But then , having given the diplomatic answer , he concedes that the Troubles had given him " something of consequence " to write about , and that " Something was at stake .
I was n't aware of it at the time , but I 'm aware of it since the peace process . "
" These were very dangerous times , " says Heaney , yielding a point with hindsight .
" When the Provisional IRA began their campaign , people like myself , with a strong sense that things needed to be redressed , were excited . "
Bloody Sunday and its poisoned aftermath polarised everything .
Even Heaney lost his cool sufficiently to write a polemical poem , speaking of " My heart besieged by anger , my mind a gap of danger " and of justice waiting to sprout " in Derry where the 13 men lay dead " .
Looking back to those dark days , he insists that this was a protest poem , commissioned for a rally but never actually performed .
The worst year was 1974 .
" There was a sense of an utterly wasteful , cancerous stalemate , and that the violence was unproductive .
It was villainous , but you were living with it .
Only after it stopped did you realise what you had lived with .
Day by day , week by week , we lived through this , and did n't fully take in what was going on . "
But he always felt it was impossible to take sides , and I ask him if he has ever regretted not being more vocal .
" Speaking out , " he insists , " one was cornered .
My sympathy was not with the IRA , but it was n't with the Thatcher government , either . "
He says now that he " did n't want to enter into bigotry , " but his deep Irishness was never far below the surface .
Again , there 's a little episode in his creative life that 's more revealing than any commentary .
When , in 1981 , Andrew Motion and Blake Morrison placed Heaney in an anthology of contemporary British poetry , he was indignant at being " cornered " and protested in rhyme .
" My passport 's green " , he wrote , " No glass of ours was ever raised / To toast the Queen " .
He now says of this furore that " it was complicated because at the same time I did n't want to pull my books out of Britain .
I did n't want to be bigoted .
I just wanted clarification , but it was complicated ...
It was a hell of an uneasy time here , savage .
It was an awkward time for anybody who wanted to stand apart from both sides .
I did n't want to be too rabid , or enlisted as an IRA spokesperson either . '
He goes on , " As I was living in the Republic , I wanted to call myself Irish .
I just felt totally conflicted .
I felt I was n't owning up to something in myself if I ran with that [ " contemporary British poetry " ] .
It 's a very ambiguous , uneasy thing , having the British cake and eating it , as it were . "
Lately , Heaney has become more political , for instance , urging Irish voters to say Yes to the Lisbon Treaty , but the Troubles remain a closed book .
Heaney turned 50 during the murderous final decade of the war in the North .
To mark this milestone , he gave himself a year off in County Wicklow , and went to Rome for the first time .
Does he go to church ?
" No . I mean , I go into it .
I go to funerals and weddings . "
He does n't pray , but " I find myself mantra - ing a bit .
I 'm not addressing a godhead , but repeating a mantra .
But it 's like nursery rhymes and belongs in the realms of things known by heart . "
During this season of solitary communion with his Irishness , to occupy himself as a fulltime writer , Heaney began some translations from Irish Gaelic literature .
He had learned Irish at school .
The language was real to him .
" If you lived in the Irish countryside as I did in my childhood , " he says , " you lived in a primal Gaeltacht . "
So he translated the Madness of King Sweeney , a classic Irish text .
Other commissions followed , notably for Beowulf , a translation which , to his amazement , was awarded the Whitbread prize in 1999 .
This was part of a prize - winning sequence he shared with his friend and collaborator , Ted Hughes .
Several times in our conversation Heaney referred to " Ted " with a deep sense of personal loss .
Hughes died in 1998 , three years after Heaney 's Nobel Prize .
The poet 's death was like a great tree falling in the forest ; the prize a sudden gale of public exposure : these two events , so unconnected , have combined to leave Heaney isolated , reflective , and facing up to the inevitability of the endgame .
A poet who has conducted his life so successfully wants to manage his last years with grace and distinction , and to continue defying expectations .
" Between the stroke and the 70th birthday , " he says , " I suddenly realised I had boxed myself into a kind of closing cadence . "
So now he 's doing his best to break out of that box , and says " I 'm trying to finish a book of poems to counteract that . "
He wants to call it Human Chain , another reference to his downstairs exit to the ambulance after the stroke .
There 'll be no Yeatsian madness for Seamus Famous .
In fact , he takes secret inspiration from one of literature 's classic enigmas , confiding that when recently asked by an arts programme which character from fiction he'd like to be , " I said I 'd like to be Jeeves . "
He is still elucidating the mystery of his life as a poet .
" If the truth be told , " he says , " it 's only now , 14 years later , that I 'm realising that I really did win the Nobel Prize .
All that time ,
I was holding it at bay and diving underneath it , and hurrying through it . "
Heaney has reached a moment in his life where he wants to be at peace with himself , and with his society .
He quotes , as a kind of epitaph , the messenger 's line from his translation of " Oedipus at Colonus " : " Wherever that man went , he went gratefully . "
Here , he catches his own quotation , and laughs .
" I 'd better watch out that I do n't talk myself into a conclusion . "
Nothing 's easy , but he can find renewal and take comfort in the solitude of his house in Wicklow .
He says he still finds it hard to say " No " .
" I 'm haunted by ' ought ' , " he confesses , conceding that he 's probably done too many interviews ( including a whole volume of them , Stepping Stones , with Dennis O'Driscoll ) , and accepted too many honorary degrees .
" Again , after the stroke I thought , ' This has got to stop now . ' "
Now , more than a decade after the peace process was signed , the lethal , divisive times through which he worked in his prime are part of the Irish past that is always so vivid and present in the everyday lives of the people .
" British " and " Irish " have become written into the constitutional settlement inaugurated by the Good Friday Agreement .
The sectarian scars are healing , despite the occasional flaring of violence .
Now , says
Heaney , " You can have an Irish identity in the North , and also have your Irish passport .
As far as I 'm concerned , the language has changed , the times have changed , and we have signed up to an open relationship with Sinn Fein . "
He seems relieved that the ancient Irish blood feud is in abeyance for the moment .
Heaney says he was not involved in the Good Friday Agreement " in any way " .
But he 's known John Hume , its chief architect , for years , and when President Clinton threw himself into the peace process , he recruited Heaney 's work to his cause , quoting one of Heaney 's most memorable lines " Between hope and history " at every opportunity .
The loaded tranquillity of the peace process mirrors the pregnant understatements of Heaney 's own poetry .
He will never be drawn into an explicit exploration of his place in this history , or his contribution of " hope " , but in answer to his own inner and urgent questions , Heaney knows that poetry must be a private matter .
So how does he reconcile the pressures of the Nobel laureateship , and prevent the wind of celebrity from extinguishing the flame of inspiration ?
" Well , " he admits , slightly baffled , " I do n't know the answer to that . "
The taxi is waiting downstairs .
It 's time to go into town .

The Economist echoed the lies of the Santa Cruz `autonomy ' thugs ( captured on video above ) .
By Francisco Dominguez
August 3 , 2009 --
The July 18 , 2009 , edition of The Economist contained an article on Bolivia ( " Bolivia 's divisive president .
The Permanent Campaign " ) which asserted that , “ Venezuelan troops helped quell a rebellion centred on the airport at Santa Cruz in the east in 2007 ” .
The article did not bother to substantiate such a serious charge against Venezuela and was one of several unjustified and unsubstantiated allegations against the president and government of Bolivia .
The piece " Bolivia 's divisive president .
The Permanent Campaign " does not even pretend to be ``even handed '' or ``balanced '' .
Some of the statements in it are simply unalloyed anti-Morales propaganda .
Putting the blame squarely on Bolivia 's President Evo Morales , for example , for the diplomatic difficulties Bolivia has been having with the US ( without informing the readers that US President George Bush unilaterally had ended Bolivia 's preferential treatment on some exports or that Bolivia expelled US ambassador Mr Phillip Goldberg because he had been actively supporting secessionist efforts in Santa Cruz ) and with Peru ( without telling readers that Peru gave asylum to a Bolivian cabinet minister indicted for civilian deaths resulting from military repression of protests six years ago during the government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada ) , but explaining them as a deliberate drive by Morales to isolate Bolivia because , according to The Economist , " Many in the government dream of an economic autarky , powered by gas . "
The article goes even further by quoting government opponents in Santa Cruz , who describe Morales as an “ indigenous fascist ” with The Economist accepting such a highly inflammatory label with no qualification whatsoever .
And , if there was any doubt as to where The Economist stands on the Morales government , the piece ends by sympathetically paraphrasing one pundit who says , " Bolivia is suffering a classic bout of Latin American populism : personalised politics , mild paranoia , bad economic policy and a weak opposition . "
No journalistic objectivity or even the pretension of it .
Venezuela 's ambassador to the United Kingdom , Samuel Moncada , responded to the allegation regarding the participation of Venezuelan troops in the suppression of a rebellion in Santa Cruz in 2007 , with letter to Michael Reid , The Economist 's Latin American editor , in which he stated : “ Unfortunately , dangerous and negative consequences in the region may arise due to this blunder published in your magazine .
I would therefore demand a correction of such fallacy ” .
( The ambassador 's letter can be found in full at http://www.vicuk.org/index.php?ption=com_content&task=view&id=503&Itemid=30).
Subsequently ambassador Moncada wrote again to Michael Reid , who had responded to the first letter by saying that The Economist stood by its story .
In his second letter Moncada wrote : " As we believe that the videos in your possession are absolutely false , this matter can only be settled with evidence .
Therefore , either you publish your data in order to prove your point , or our request in the first letter stands .
Then , you will have no choice but to correct the statement in your article issued on the 18th of July . "
A campaign of letter writing to Michael Reid was initiated demanding that he publish the video material in his possession and prove his story , or correct the false statement made about Venezuelan troops having participated in quelling a rebellion in Bolivia .
On its July 25 , 2009 , edition , The Economist was forced to publish a ``correction ' ' on its story : " Clarification : Bolivia and Venezuela " ( http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14142418).
See also the video footage on which the allegation was based at
http://video.economist.com/index.jsp?fr_story=f2f7691c61dd984f635cbc089e53ecb36666289f.
The full text of the ``correction '' is :
Clarification : Bolivia and Venezuela
Jul 30th 2009
From The Economist print edition
In our recent story on Bolivia ( “ The permanent campaign ” , July 18th ) , we stated that “ Venezuelan troops helped quell a rebellion centred on the airport at Santa Cruz in the east in 2007 ” .
Both the Venezuelan and Bolivian governments deny this ( see Letters ) , and Venezuela ’s government has publicly asked us to retract this assertion .
We based our statement on television footage aired at the time which shows a Venezuelan air force plane and uniformed Venezuelan personnel at Santa Cruz airport shortly after it had been seized by the Bolivian government from the local authorities .
No official explanation has been given for their presence .
However , we are happy to clarify that this footage does not prove Venezuelan troops played an active role in quelling the rebellion .
We have placed the television footage on our website .
The explanation , " we are happy to clarify that this footage does not prove Venezuelan troops played an active role in quelling the rebellion " , not only TOTALLY contradicts the assertion made in the July 18 story -- defended by Latin American editor Michael Reid in correspondence with Venezuela 's ambassador -- but also shows the type of bias
The Economist tends engage in when it comes to covering developments in Venezuela in particular but also in Latin America in general .
The fact is that the assertion that “ Venezuelan troops helped quell a rebellion centred on the airport at Santa Cruz in the east in 2007 ” was based on the flimsiest of ``evidence '' which no serious editor should use to make such a grave assertion .
Furthermore , the facts themselves , as presented by The Economist 's ``correction '' speak for themselves .
The footage which Latin American editor Michael Reid was forced to made public NOWHERE shows anything of any kind whatsoever that could be construed as “ Venezuelan troops [ having ] helped quell a rebellion " in Bolivia in 2007 as affirmed in the July 18 article .
The footage comes from a TV channel which is clearly opposed to President Evo Morales , at a time when the Bolivian government faced a serious destabilisation threat from a radical opposition to the Bolivian government whose epicentre was / is the Department [ province ] of Santa Cruz and the capital city of the same name .
The Half Moon ``autonomist '' movement in Bolivia has strenuously tried to demonstrate in its propaganda that Morales is a puppet of Hugo Chavez and falsely claim that it is Venezuelan ``domination '' they have been fighting against .
The Economist 's ``explanation '' as to why it had asserted that there had been Venezuelan military participation in the quelling of an anti-government rebellion at the Santa Cruz airport is that the TV " footage aired at the time [...] shows a Venezuelan air force plane and uniformed Venezuelan personnel at Santa Cruz airport shortly after it had been seized by the Bolivian government from the local authorities " , adding , " No official explanation has been given for their presence " .
None was asked for .
Reid , as the Latin American editor , ought ot have corroborated the story by requesting confirmation or otherwise from the Bolivian and Venezuelan authorities as to the alleged participation of Venezuelan troops in repressive activities against Bolivian citizens on Bolivian soil .
It is just incredible that such a grave assertion could have been made on the basis of the video footage published in The Economist and without this elementary safeguard of sound journalism .

Most of the online world is based on a simple , if unarticulated , agreement : consumers browse
Web sites free , and in return , they give up data  like their gender or income level  which the sites use to aim their advertisements .
The new head of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the Federal Trade Commission , David C. Vladeck , says it is time for that to change .
In an interview , Mr. Vladeck outlined plans that could upset the online advertising ecosystem .
Privacy policies have become useless , the commission ’s standards for the cases it reviews are too narrow , and some online tracking is “ Orwellian , ” Mr. Vladeck said .
After eight years of what privacy advocates and the industry saw as a relatively pro-business commission , Mr. Vladeck , has made a splash .
In June , the commission settled a case with Sears that was a warning shot to companies that thought their privacy policies protected them .
In just over six weeks on the job , he has asked Congress for a bigger budget and for a streamlined way to create regulations .
And he said he would hire technologists to help analyze online marketers ’ tracking .
“ These are pretty aggressive moves for an agency of a new administration , ” said Charles Kennedy , who handles privacy cases at Morrison & Foerster .
Ah , now we 're playing hardball !
Maybe when Americans start to see how much money these guys are making , it 'll get a rise out of them .
Way to go , Jay :
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A U.S. Senate Democrat asked the top 15 health insurers to explain what portion of premiums go to profits versus patient care , putting further pressure on the companies to explain their business practices as Congress considers sweeping health reform legislation .
In letters to the companies on Friday , Sen . John Rockefeller also asked for information about how insurers disclose financial practices to customers .
Earlier this week , senior Democrats on the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee asked dozens of health insurers for details about executive compensation and other practices .
" Too often consumers are not getting a fair deal for what they pay , they are not getting the protections they deserve , and the insurance companies are awash in profit , " Rockefeller , chairman of the Senate Commerce , Science and Transportation Committee , said in a statement .
The letters were sent to companies including UnitedHealth Group , Wellpoint and Aetna , the committee said .
Health insurers have come under attack amid a contentious debate about how to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system to cover the currently uninsured and cut costs .
A key issue is whether the government should offer its own health insurance option to provide competition for the private companies .
America 's Health Insurance Plans ( AHIP ) , an industry group , said insurers provide detailed financial information to federal and state regulators .
Health plans rank 35th among Fortune magazine 's profitability rankings with an average profit margin of 2.2 percent , AHIP spokesman Robert Zirkelbach said .
This week , one of Parliament 's most active bodies , the Joint Committee on Human Rights ( JCHR ) , made up of both peers and MPs , reports on the allegations of government involvement in and knowledge of the torture of terrorist suspects by foreign powers .
If you 're like me , you find it hard to read anything about torture , but this report is very important because it makes plain these barbaric practices have been commissioned in our name .
Those who have read it say it is " truly shocking " and that the government cannot avoid a formal response to the allegations .
I suspect we know much of the detail because of Ian Cobain 's exemplary investigation in the Guardian ; what Andrew Dismore 's JCHR has done is to list all the examples where there appears to be a prima facie case to be answered .
And in the absence of a definition of complicity that is accepted across government , the committee defines exactly what the word means .
Does complicity entail actively supplying questions for an interrogation that involves , for instance , water boarding or slicing a man 's penis ?
Being in the vicinity of these actions and encouraging them ?
Or should we operate on the basis that the knowledge that information being used has been gained from torture is enough to satisfy any decent test of involvement ?
I believe it to be the latter for the reason that torture in counterterrorist operations rarely happens independently of a demand for information .
The letter sent to Dismore by David Miliband and Alan Johnson , both of whom refused to appear before the JCHR , leads me to believe that the Foreign Office and Home Office have covered all the bases with various human rights training programmes .
" We are confident , " they write , " that whenever the issues of torture arises in any of our training courses or internal communications , staff are left in no doubt as to the government 's absolute abhorrence of torture . "
Absolute abhorrence indeed , but that does not prevent complicity , as Cobain has amply demonstrated .
It seems certain that the British government steeled itself against any feelings of revulsion and used as much torture " intelligence " as it could lay its hands on , with agencies crossing the line into brutal collusion .
" The government has repeatedly denied that it condones torture , " wrote lords Ashdown , Howe , Hannay , Lester , Baroness D'Souza and eight other peers to the Times in March .
" The conflict between evidence and the official denial is stark and is undermining the trust in our stated commitment to human rights . "
The British state is institutionally hypocritical on torture .
Tony Blair says he condemns it and has never authorised it and even though he did know that information being used came from the torture , somehow his spokesman has contrived to finesse his position into a state of innocence .
Before Blair , the former home secretary Jack Straw denied authorising torture , but then suggested that the product of the torture chamber might have its uses .
As he told the Intelligence and Security Committee in November 2004 : " It does not follow that if it [ information ] is extracted under torture , it is automatically untrue .
But there is a much higher probability of it being embellished . "
Feline as ever , he touches on the critical double standard , which is this : while British courts will have nothing to do with evidence gained from torture , the executive is allowed free rein .
In 2005 , the law lords ruled against the use of evidence procured by torture in a judgment where Lord Carswell wrote : " Once torture has become acclimatised in a legal system , it spreads like a disease , hardening and brutalising those who have become accustomed to its use . "
The then senior law lord , Lord Bingham , was utterly clear that torture evidence " was offensive to ordinary standards of humanity and decency " .
But later on in the 90 - page judgment , Lord Brown supported the executive using such evidence .
He wrote : " It has a prime responsibility to safeguard the security of the state and would be failing in its duty if it ignores whatever it may learn . "
The possible benefits of torture are thus admitted and the ground laid for complicity .
That British agencies are willing to accept such information , and have supplied lines of interrogation in the past must mean that the use of torture is stimulated , which is a form of complicity .
It is not good enough to protest that we are simply the recipients of information that has been extracted by people over whom we have no control .
That excuse does n't work in other areas of the law .
Download pictures of child pornography and you will find yourself facing a prison sentence because even though you did not take part in the abuse and had no control of the abuser , your action effectively added to the demand for the pictures and is held by the law to be part of the stimulus to an appalling crime .
Once the passive involvement is permitted , the state and its agencies pretty soon become active collaborators in torture , although they obviously take care to do this secretly .
All the cases listed by the JCHR make our role in torture utterly clear and underline that Britain , a signatory to the United Nations Convention Against Torture , is almost certainly in breach of international law .
Quite apart from the erosion of our own standards and the way this must affect the moral well - being of a society , how on earth can we expect our views about human rights to carry any weight with , for instance , the Chinese over their treatment of the Tibetans , with the Russians or the Burmese junta ?
It is preposterous that Britain still presents itself to the world as a paragon of virtue when our people have been sitting with their fingers in their ears as some poor bastard has his fingernails ripped out , waiting for a lull in the screaming so they can ask the next question .
It is not just in a legal system that torture spreads like " a disease hardening and brutalising " people .
It is time that we learnt exactly what has been going on and what current practices are .
The questions in the JCHR report must be answered , but evidently we cannot rely on this government for the truth .
As the peers ' March letter to the Times stated : " Only a full independent inquiry will meet the need in a democracy to hold accountable those who knowingly breach national and international law . "
In 2007 , Frank used his influence as committee chairman to insure that the housing trust - fund bill finally passed the House .
In 2008 , a similar measure made it through the Senate as part of a larger bill , which President Bush signed .
By that time , however , Fannie and Freddie were mired in debt , and the value of their shares was collapsing .
And , because Frank ’s committee was supposed to oversee the two mortgage giants , he faced questions about what he might have done to avoid the catastrophe .
The Committee on Financial Services , which has seventy members , is one of the biggest panels in Congress .
( It was known as the Banking , Finance , and Urban Affairs Committee until the Democrats lost control of the House in 1994 , and Frank attributes the change to “ Republican political correctness . ” )
Congressional hearings customarily begin with statements from members , a practice that can take hours .
Frank and Michael Oxley , the Ohio Republican who was his predecessor as chairman , shared a distaste for the tradition , and together they were known as the “ impatient caucus . ”
Still , Frank allows his colleagues to speak briefly before a hearing , and , on October 21st , Scott Garrett , a conservative Republican from New Jersey , used his time to attack Frank — in particular , his claim that he had anticipated the crisis .
“ Before we are able to go forward with new and important changes to the over - all regulatory structure for our financial - services industry , I do believe that it is essential that we better understand just how we got into this problem , ” Garrett said .
“ Now , one of the main parts of the problem was poor regulation in the past , specifically in the area of Fannie and Freddie . ”
According to Garrett , “ our distinguished chairman ” had no right “ to claim the mantle of being a champion of reform with Fannie and Freddie . ”
On the contrary , Garrett argued , he and other Republicans had wanted to “ raise the capital levels , to reduce the retained portfolios , to lower the conforming loan limits . ”
Garrett ’s accusations were genteel compared with those made by Bill O’Reilly , a few weeks earlier , when Frank appeared on his show on Fox News .
“ You blame everybody else !
You ’re a coward ! ” O’Reilly bellowed .
“ In any private concern , you ’re out on your butt !
But not here in the federal government ! ”
Frank , in turn , berated O’Reilly for his “ ranting ” and “ stupidity . ”
( The confrontation has been viewed more than a million times on YouTube . )
At the hearing , Frank responded testily to Garrett .
“ The purpose of this hearing was to be forward - looking , ” he began .
“ And I had hoped we could focus on that .
But , after the gentleman from New Jersey ’s comments in having decried partisanship , he then practiced it .
It does seem to me to be important to set the record clearly before us . ”
Frank pointed out that when Garrett had attempted to tighten regulations on Fannie and Freddie , Republicans had controlled the House .
“ Had a Republican majority been in favor of passing that bill , they would have done it , ” Frank said .
“ Now he has claimed that it was we Democrats — myself — who blocked things .
The number of occasions on which either Newt Gingrich or Tom DeLay consulted me about the specifics of legislation are far fewer than the gentleman from New Jersey seems to think .
“ I will acknowledge that during the twelve years of Republican rule I was unable to stop them from impeaching Bill Clinton , ” Frank went on .
“ I was unable to stop them from interfering in Terri Schiavo ’s husband ’s affairs .
I was unable to stop their irresponsible tax cuts , the war in Iraq , and a Patriot Act that did not include civil liberties . ”
In other words , Frank insisted , if the Republicans had wanted to try to prevent the mortgage crisis , they would have had plenty of opportunities to do so .
Frank and I discussed his role in the housing crisis at his district headquarters , in a small office building in Newton .
His boyfriend , Jim Ready , who runs an awning company in Maine , had just returned from Whole Foods with Frank ’s lunch , a salad , which he was eating with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm .
Frank explained that he first became interested in housing during his service , in the late sixties , as the top aide to Kevin White , who was then the mayor of Boston .
The city had a long history of building public housing , mostly high - rises , and White pledged to encourage the construction of small apartment complexes , in keeping with the scale of most Boston neighborhoods .
“ At first , when you talk about affordable housing and subsidized housing , people immediately ask , ‘ What sort of public housing ? ’ ” Frank said .
“ ‘ Is it run by the city , like Cabrini - Green ? ’ ” — a notorious , now demolished project in Chicago .
“ And we long ago learned how not to do that , but that still was in people ’s heads .
And if you can do a word - association test , where a picture floated out in people ’s heads , there would be these sterile high - rises .
And it struck me , before I conceptualized this , that the answer to that was public - private partnership , that that ’s the way to do affordable housing .
And then it struck me :
You know what ?
This is the model for other things .
Public - private - sector coöperation . ”
When White was mayor , one of the most infamous public - housing projects in the city was Columbia Point , in Dorchester .
The project was said to be so dangerous that ambulances refused to enter it without a police escort .
In a process begun under White , and shepherded in its early days by Frank , Columbia Point was turned over to a private developer , who converted it to a mixed - income community , which included housing for the poor and market - rent apartments for the more affluent .
“ Barney is a real capitalist , ” Joe Corcoran , the developer who took over Columbia Point , told me .
“ He understands that we have to make a profit .
Barney is the smartest politician I ’ve ever seen .
I have no problem with him being gay , or being Jewish .
I like Jews .
I like doing business with Jews .
They know how to make a deal . ”
Frank ’s experience in city hall in Boston led to an impatience with abstractions .
He recalled a comment by Lawrence Summers , the former president of Harvard , who will be the director of the National Economic Council in the Obama Administration : “ Larry said , ‘ Oh , well , in the history of the world , nobody ever washed a rented car . ’
Well , people wash leased cars all the time .
And , secondly , poor people do n’t rent cars .
It ’s just one of those irrelevant things . ”
Frank went on , “ In 2004 , it was Bush who started to push Fannie and Freddie into subprime mortgages , because they were boasting about how they were expanding homeownership for low - income people .
And I said at the time , ‘ Hey — ( a ) this is going to jeopardize their profitability , but ( b ) it ’s going to put people in homes they can’t afford , and they ’re gonna lose them . ’ ” ( In a recent op - ed piece in the Wall Street Journal , Lawrence B. Lindsey , a former economic adviser to President Bush , wrote that Frank “ is the only politician I know who has argued that we needed tighter rules that intentionally produce fewer homeowners and more renters . ” )
Frank recalled with disdain a Bush Administration proposal to allow time limits on rental vouchers for poor people .
“ They said , ‘ Well , do n’t you agree that we should limit the amount of time people have a voucher ? ’
I said , ‘ Yes , if you limit the amount of time they can be poor — “ I ’m sorry , you can only be poor for four years . ” ’ ”
In 2005 , while the Democrats were still in the minority , Frank contributed to a bipartisan effort to put his objectives — tighter regulation of Fannie and Freddie and new funds for rental housing — into law .
At the time , Fannie and Freddie were regulated by a small agency within the Department of Housing and Urban Development ; the bill proposed to create an independent agency to monitor their operations .
Frank and Michael Oxley , who was then chairman of the Financial Services Committee , achieved broad bipartisan support for the bill in the committee , and it passed the House .
But the Senate never voted on the measure , in part because President Bush was likely to veto it .
“ If it had passed , that would have been one of the ways we could have reined in the bowling ball going downhill called housing , ” Oxley told me .
“ Barney , to some extent , is misunderstood — with this image of him as a fierce partisan .
He is an institutionalist .
He believes in the House and in the process .
He eschews the grandstanding style that so many members use and prefers to work behind the scenes and get something done . ”
Frank ’s prescience on the housing crisis should not be overstated , because Fannie and Freddie represented only one aspect of the problem .
“ Fannie and Freddie were contributors to the bubble , but they came late in the really bad loans , after the private issuers like Merrill and Citigroup , ” Dean Baker , the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research , in Washington , said .
“ The law probably would have curtailed their lending , but it ’s hard to say it would have made any difference .
The real problem was outside of Fannie and Freddie , with the banks , and nobody in Congress was talking about it . ”
Frank hopes that the housing trust fund wo n’t have to rely entirely on Fannie and Freddie for money .
He intends to secure additional funding from , among other sources , the Federal Housing Administration , a division of the Department of Housing and Urban Development which insures mortgages .
Specifically , he wants to fund the trust with profits from an F.H.A. program that allows older homeowners to borrow money against the equity in their homes .
“ We ’re going to expand that program , which makes money for the federal government , and start with part of the profits from it , ” Frank told me .
“ If you know how the government works , you can find ways to do what you want . ”
The number of housing units that will be built or renovated with funds from the trust is likely to be modest at first .
( Frank declined to provide an estimate . )
But the money will be available to both nonprofit and commercial developers , fulfilling Frank ’s longtime goal of promoting public - private partnerships .
“ Barney has been our champion in the House , and he has been unbelievably effective , ” Sheila Crowley , the president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition , which lobbied for the establishment of the trust , said .
“ If the bill had n’t come out of Barney ’s committee to the House with universal Democratic support and strong support from moderate Republicans , the Senate would n’t have paid any attention .
But Barney got it done . ”
The bill takes effect this year , but it ’s unclear whether the housing trust will work as Frank expects .
“ I am skeptical that a national housing trust will address the real problems in our housing markets , ” Edward Glaeser , a Harvard economics professor who studies the housing market , said .
“ In many places , there is a lot of housing available at low prices .
In Buffalo and throughout the industrial Midwest , there ’s loads of low - cost rental housing available .
The private sector in Houston does a great job of providing low - cost rental housing without help from the government .
The question is whether this program will make a difference in places like New York and San Francisco , where there is a shortage .
It ’s not obvious that you want to think about new or renovated housing for poor Americans .
Poor people buy used cars .
There ’s no reason to think that used housing is n’t often the right answer as well . ”
Moreover , it ’s not clear that Frank ’s determination to avoid the annual congressional appropriations process makes good public policy .
“ Once you have funding on automatic pilot , the money is spent regardless of what other priorities are there for the federal government and whether it ’s properly targeted and properly administered , ” David John , who studies housing as a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation , said .
“ This is why we have an appropriations process . ” Scott Garrett , Frank ’s colleague and ideological adversary on the Financial Services Committee , told me , “ Barney has a great deal of faith in government ’s ability to solve people ’s problems .
The question is whether that faith is justified . ”
When the Republicans won control of Congress in 1994 , the Democratic leadership in the House made Frank a kind of one - man immediate - response team to Newt Gingrich , the new House Speaker .
Frank and Gingrich sparred almost daily , and Frank still professes surprise that Gingrich took their disagreements personally .
“ Barney Frank hates me , ” Gingrich said at the time .
( He would not discuss the matter for this article . )
According to Frank , Gingrich is a “ bleeder ” — a derogatory term for a boxer who is prone to cuts .
For Frank , the word has particular resonance : one of his high - school classmates was Chuck Wepner , a heavyweight boxer who was known as the Bayonne Bleeder .
“ My first day of high school , I was sent to the vice - principal for discipline , because I got in trouble for talking too much , ” Frank told me .
“ When I got to her office , Chuck was already there .
He ’d gotten into a fight with the toughest kid in the school . ”
( In 1975 , Wepner went fifteen rounds in a heavyweight championship bout against Muhammad Ali and , in so doing , it has been said , inspired Sylvester Stallone to create the character Rocky . )
Frank ’s parents , Sam and Elsie , raised their four children in a distinctly less rarefied setting than the ones in which they all eventually arrived .
Sam Frank operated Tooley ’s Truck Terminal , near the mouth of the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City .
“ My father ran a truck stop , ” Frank told me .
“ He sort of lived on the fringes .
We ’re talking about Hudson County — Frank Hague was the boss — a totally corrupt place .
In 1946 , my father ’s brother Harry got the contract to sell cars to the city , and of course he had to give a kickback to the guys who ran the city .
My father was a middleman or something . ”
Sam was subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury about the matter .
He refused and was found in criminal contempt .
“ For a while , he was hiding out from the cops in New York , ” Frank recalled .
“ I was six years old , and once I went to see him in the city , and we saw ‘ Robin Hood , ’ with Errol Flynn .
The next day , the cops came to my first - grade class to interview me , to see if I had been with my dad .
My father ’s sister , Aunt Minnie , taught at the school .
She heard about the cops coming and went straight to my classroom to break it up , so I did n’t have to talk . ”
All environmental protesters attending the Climate Camp demonstrations today will be photographed by police , although organisers have told activists that they do not need to co-operate by showing their faces .
Senior officers said the tactic of recording images of those taking part in high - profile demonstrations would continue , with members of so - called Forward Information Teams being present at the six initial meeting points and the final secret camp destination , once it is identified .
Campers have been warned to watch out for police photographers , and are expected to respond by blocking their views with placards and banners and taking pictures of the photographers themselves .
The demonstrations will be the first test of public order policing since the G20 protests , when the Met was criticised for its heavy - handed tactics .
Police have signalled a change in approach since the April demonstrations , which resulted in the death of Ian Tomlinson , but are to continue filming and photographing those attending .
A third of the public believe filming protesters is an invasion of privacy , according to a YouGov poll of 2,000 people published yesterday .
Chief Superintendent Helen Ball , of the Metropolitan police , said taking photographs of protesters remained an important tactic .
She said police would also stop and search anyone they were suspicious of , but it is likely any such actions will be kept low key .
Ball said : " At the moment we will be photographing people on arrival at the camp because it is important for us to know if there are people coming who want to cause violence and disorder .
" We will not be routinely stopping and searching everybody going into the camp and we have briefed officers carefully on searching people and what the spirit of the operation is . "
Police have made a last - minute plea for organisers to tell them where the camp will take place .
" We are putting in a neighbourhood policing team for the periphery of the camp and for the local community .
" But we have not been able to go further than that because we do not know where it is going to be . "
Up to 30 officers based at the Met's Lambeth control room will oversee developments at the Climate Camp via a network of CCTV cameras .
Operators have access to more than 12,000 cameras across the capital , plus live feeds from the force 's three helicopters .
Senior officers have split control - room operators into teams , watching different parts of London , until the final campsite is identified .
The control room will be packed with up to 150 people at the weekend , as the force oversees the Notting Hill carnival , its biggest annual policing event .
About 200 extra officers have been drafted in from five forces - Gwent , Cheshire , North Wales , West Mercia and City of London - to bolster numbers at the camp .
The police operation , dubbed Operation Bentham , is in the spotlight after angry clashes marred demonstrations during the April G20 meeting of world leaders in London .
The force will use a mobile police station , helicopter - mounted loudhailer and Twitter account to improve links with protesters .
The Brazilian TV station Globo has claimed that Nelson Piquet was ordered to crash by the Renault team during the Singapore GP last year .
The accident resulted in a Safety Car which played into the hands of Fernando Alonso , who had pitted just before the accident occurred .
The result was that Renault was able to win the race .
There were suspicions at the time that this had happened but there was no proof .
Since Piquet was fired by Renault , claims have been flying around and Globo says that it has received information that there is evidence to back up the story .
We hear that the FIA may call in an independent body to investigate the claims being made .
The July meeting of the Twin Cities Lisp Users Group was this past Tuesday .
There were four presentations on the agenda :
The presentation slides and videos of the talks are available through the links above , and directly at the tclispers.org site .
Enjoy !
As he told the EPW committee last week that pythons are taking over the Everglades .
There are over 100,000 snakes living there , apparently .
That is bad .
Now he 's appealing to the Secretary of the Interior , Ken Salazar , for a massive python hunt .
" Lord forbid , a visitor in the Everglades ever encounters one , ” Nelson wrote in a letter today .
Full letter after the jump .
How long til PETA responds ?
We say an hour .
UPDATE : And PETA has responded : " Senator Bill Nelson 's plan to organize a python hunt in the Everglades is senseless and cruel .
It is extremely difficult to kill snakes without causing them immense suffering .
If lethal measures are insisted upon , the animals should be rounded up by trained wildlife professionals and euthanized .
" These pythons did n't ask to be taken from their native homes in Southeast Asia , kept as " pets , " and then turned loose when their guardians discovered that caring for them was more work than they had expected .
Instead of initiating a clumsy massacre , Sen .
Nelson should focus on preventing exotic animals from ending up abandoned in the first place by passing legislation to ban the importation , trade , breeding , and keeping of these and other exotic animals as " pets . "
Programs should also be put in place to allow citizens to drop off snakes and other exotic animals at shelters if they can no longer care for them , no questions asked .
" We owe it to these animals who have ended up in Florida through no fault of their own to deal with them in the most humane way possible . "
Ken Salazar
Secretary of the Interior
Department of the Interior
1849 C Street , Northwest
Washington , D.C. 20240
Dear Secretary Salazar :
As we have discussed , we need to get a grip on pythons invading America 's Everglades .
Thus , I would offer two things .
First , I appreciate your input on my bill that would ban the import of Burmese pythons .
Many of these dangerous snakes are making their way into the ‘ Glades because they are being released by their owners .
My legislation would classify pythons as an injurious animal and would prohibit their import and interstate trade .
Passage of this bill would put an end to people importing these things .
And , I hope we never again would have to see what we saw in Florida three weeks ago : a toddler strangled to death by a pet python .
Second , when we visited the Everglades recently we heard a variety of ideas for capturing or killing many of the estimated 100,000 - or - more pythons now roaming the ‘ Glades .
They are threatening endangered wildlife there - and , Lord forbid , a visitor in the Everglades ever encounters one .
One idea seems particularly promising .
Some , including Florida Gov. Charlie Crist and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission , appear open to an organized hunt .
This is not intended in any way to open our national parks to hunting per se .
Steps must be taken to protect the Florida Panther and other wildlife .
Instead , the U.S. Park Service , under your direction , would allow for a supervised hunt of pythons by park staff , authorized deputies or agents and volunteers .
Given the serious threat from these snakes , I ask that you approve of taking this step .
Sincerely ,
Bill Nelson

CONDITION OF THIS GIUTAR

It do n’t have hardly any scratches on it and everyhting is in real good shape .
The mirror could prolly use some Windex on it It ’s like brand new condition , but it ’s relly old !
And , it ’s a real Fender .
Did I say VINTAGE ??
Did I say MINT ?
Just want to be sure .
Lets talk about age !
OK , this is the year 2002 and this gitrar was made in the year 1951 , so that makes it what ?
63 years old , or something like that !
Its aintchint — but when your speeking about giutars the older the better .
U can just remember this simpel rule : OLD = vInTaGe !!!
HOW I GOT IT OK , here ’s the story behind this wonderful and historical and VALUABLE giutar .
I ’ll be the first to admit I do n’t know squat about guitars .
I took trombone for awhile but I did n’t like it much .
But my granddady did no about guirtas .
He was a musician before he went to the hospital ( and never came home ! ) .
He even played in some bands and I think he was on TV or maybe the radio — one of them .
Andyway , A few weeks ago gramma asked me to clean out her attick .
I says , Sure , OK I ’ll do it ’ cause I did n’t have anything else to do .
Why not ?
So I was cleaning out old boxes and clothes and stuff and found this FENDER STRAT !!!
I ask gramma if I could have it and she says , yeah sure I do n’t want it it ’s prolly no good anyways .
She said grandaddy bought it a long time ago but she did n’t remember exactly when ( her memory is not too good ! LOL ) .
So I took it and here it is !
And she was wrong .
I t is good ‘ cuz it ’s a real Fender stratocastor !
And it ’s really old ( old giutars are worth more then brand new ones ! )
DID I SAY VINTAGE !!
STILL NOT CONVINCED ?
OK .
Some people might not belive me when I say that this is really a authenitcated and VALUABLE historical 1951 Fender Strat ( VINTAGE ) !!!
Well , I took it to a guy I know ( named Bob Jones , sometimes called " Sparky " ) who is an expert on guitars .
Hhe actually plays drums in a band and has about a million CDs !!
Once he met a guy who knew someone who was a cousin of the girlfriend of one of the guys in Green Day !.
So he DOES no what he ’s talking about !
He looked it over real careful , strummed on it , turned those six keys , looked in the mirror , looked at some books , and then apprised this guitar at a value of $ 35,000 !!!
He even signed an affidavid , which is in the picture below .
I ca n’t be sure of this ( cuz it ’s so old ) but somebody else toll me this giutar may have been made by the guy who started up the Fender company — Freddy Fender himself !!!
I wo n’t sware to it , but I ’m pretty sure it ’s true .
You can check the cereal number for yourselv ( each guitar has its own cereal number .
No two are the same ! ) .
There are books that have those number in it I think .
I even took a picture for you !
Proof !
MORE STUFF
OK , I really do n’t want to sell this beautiful peace of historical VINTAGE history , because I no it will just get more and more valuable as time goes on .
But I have to sell it and I ’ll never learn how to play it anyways ( I couldnt even learn a trombone ! ) .
Things have n’t been too good around here since I left school .
Let ’s just say I did some things I should n’t a did and now a prole officer is involved !!
No I ’m not in jail .
LOL !!
The original gig bag ( also VINTAGE and also historical ) is also for sale for only $ 400 extra
This VINTAGE guitar was made way before they even invented actual guitar cases !!.
All they had back then was gig bags .
Sorry – I forgot to take a picture of the gig bag , but it ’s a real good gig bag !
For those who do n’t know , a gig is when you go out and play in a band .
You carry your guitar to a gig using a gig bag !
If you do n’t play a band you may not even need a gig bag !!!
But you should by it anyways just to be safe .
I no you all have lots of questions about this authentic PEASE OF USA HISTORY .
Sorry but I really can’t answer any of your questions about this guitar .
Like I said I do n’t know jack squat about giutars .
Plus my AOL does n’t work too good anymore since my mom ’s boyfriend put some new software on it !!!.
Also , you can just ignore those five negative feedback ratings I got from other auctions !
It ’s a long story !

My Music !!!
Music is my life !
I mean it .
I could relly just sit around all day and just listen to music .
I do n’t care if its on CDs , radios , tapes , TV , or even life music .
Whatever !!
As long as its good music I dig it and also enjoy it .
So what makes good music you might ask ?
Well , for one thing it has to have loud guitars in it and those guitars must be played fast with lots of high notes and a good deal of distrotion .
And it must also have drums too .
And some base , of course ( all good music has base ! ) .
And the singer should also be good and sing about meaningful things like isuues such as life , death , and drugs and even relation chips .
Eventually I hope to have a sucesful career in the music biz .
Right now I do n’t have a job , but I want to work in a music store and sell guitars and other sorted instruments like bases and amps and even drums .
I have already applied for some jobs but they always tell me they do n’t need anybody right now .
But that ’s OK they can keep their dam job !!
I ’ll prolly just start my own store and call it T HE GUITAR GOD MUSIC STORE !
Right now I ’m getting some valubale experience by selling musical stuff on EBAY !!
I have n’t had to much luck so far , but I ’m only just starting !
So give me a brake !!!
And I also watn to learn how to play the guitar as well , I think that will help me be a better salesman cuz I can demonstrate the varius guitras to my customors and sell the guitar that best meets their particular needs !
I used to take trombone , but I decided that ’s not for me .
I mean when was the last time you heard a good song that had a tombone on it ???
Think about it !!
If I would a stuck with the trombones then you wood have to call me Trombone God ! LOL .
Trombones = No. Guitars =
Yes !
So , to sumarize , my name is the GUITAR GOD and music is my life !
I plan to make a career out of music .
All About My Family
I happen to be a family man .
I do n’t mean that I have kids and a wife and stuff .
But I do live with my family .
I have my own room and my mom and her boyfreind pretty much just leave me be .
Well , it ’s not atcually a room in the trailer .
It ’s a little small room out in the back what used to be some kind of a tool shed or something like that .
If you look at hte pictor below you ca n’t actually see my place ( its behind the tree ) but you can see the actual trailor where my mom and her boyfriend stay .
That ’s my mom ’s truck .
Its a nice one !
My place may not be a mashion , but it suites me just fine !!
I have lot of pivatcy and I dont even have to pay rent and I get free food because I eat in the trailor with the others .
My sister also lives here ( but she has a actual room in the trailer ) and she will soon have another baby ( that will make 2 !!!
Boy that room will be crowded and noisy and even stinkier than it is already , what with the diapers and all ) .
Now she ( my sister , that is ) just needs to find herself a boy freind that will stick around LOL !!
I do n’t have a picture of my sister but I do have one of my Mom .
See right below .
That ’s her .
Mom was n’t two happy in this phogotraph , she do n’t really like to get her pitcher taken , I do n’t know why , she just do n’t .
This picture was taken one night before she went out on a date with somebody she met at the Piggly Wigly market ( that ’s a good place to pickup chicks !! ) .
Sometimes she will actually smile , and she looks pretty good considering that she ’s a mom !
Now mom has herself a steady boyfriend and he lives at the trailer .
For some raison he does not like me two much and I do n’t really know the reason why not .
He works over at the gas station and he usually comes home drunk .
And sometimes he ’ll give me a few beers , but only if he ’s already drunk .
Otherwise he just goes , " Hey , get the hell outta here boy . "
Dad is in the picture to the right ..
That ’s the only picuter I could find .
I beleive it was the last picutre ever takin of him before he went away for about the ninth time ( mom threw out all the others pictuers ) .
I do n’t really know exactly where he is right now , but i think he prolly has plenty of free time on his hands to think about things such as life , death and music .
Lets hope he does n’t drop the sope when he takes a shower !
LOL !!
Maybe
Ill see him again sometimes but I relly doubt it !
LOL .
Check Out My Girlfreind !!!!!
Meet Myrtle , my girl ( but do n’t call her Turtle ! ! ) .
OK , she may not be the best looking girl in the world , but she has a big heart ( along with other " big " things LOL ) .
Well look at me .
I mean I ’m not exacly Brad Pits !
She actuly looks better than the picture shows because her hair is now alot shorter and she got some eyeglasses .
The zits have alos cleared up for the most part .
But I think she might a put on a little weight ( that girl eats more than me ! ) .
We ’ve been going toegether for almost a year off and on .
We met at school , but we never had any classes together .
I went outside to have a smoke and there she was smoking too !
I think it was some kind of carma that caused us to meat that day .
I asked her if she might like to go on a drive with me after school and she says Sure why not ?
I do n’t have antyhing better to do .
And I go Alright !
And the rest is hystory !
Anyways , we usually get along good except when we fight and argue .
Mainly its about stuff that I can’t even talk about here ‘ cuz this web site is rated G for general audeinces .
But usually things are good and we spend time together and watch the TV and drive around and listen to music and " stuff " ( if you know what I mean ! ! ) .
We ’ll prolly get married at some time in the future , as soon as I open my music store and she gets herself a job .
Right now Myrtle is unemployed but she gets a check each and every month on account of her baby .
That ’s actualy better than working because she does n’t have to do antything !!

Hes the guy who lets me use his ‘ puter and showed me how to make my very on HOME PAGE wich you are reading right now !
Here is Alexander .
What a nerd !!
But at lest he has a computor !
These friens of mine are all relly cool guys and are also good guys to hang with .
But for some reason they all seem to be very busy these days so we do n’t realy hang out much anymore .
I do n’t know why .
They always seem to have to go somewheres or do something . .
And they would n’t give me any pictuers ( except for Alexander ) for my web site .
I do n’t know why really .
About School :~(
I was smart and left school as soon as I could .
The law says I can quit when I turn 16 so I followed the law and that ’s exatcly what I did !
I just did n’t like it at school and the teachers were pretty stupid if you ask me .
I mean really .
Why should I have to read " Great Expectorations " by Charles Dickson ?
This is the US of A we live in , not the united kingdom of England !!
And it was a very thick book too and I could n’t really understand what was going on with this guy Pip !!
And then their ’s math !
Give me a brake !
I can add stuff up and that ’s pretty much all the math I need .
I mean when was the last time you had to do some algebra ?
Be honest !
I was never much good in goegraphy or history either .
I mean , I do n’t plan to do much traveling and what ’s past is past , right ?
And I wont ’ even talk about Spanish class !!
They gotta be kidding with that stuff !
Plus look at all of the great rock stars .
I bet none of them spent to much time in shcool , right ?.
I have graduated from the " School of Hard Knocks " .
My dad went their and so did my grand dad ( ha - ha ) .
They both did alright , well at least my grand dad did alright .
He played the guitar in a band butt was not known as the GUITAR GOD .
That ’s me !!
Heres My Dog !!
Everybody needs a dog , right ?
And I have one goes by the name of Snot Rag ( I named him ! ) .
I do n’t realy know what kind a dog it is .
I do n’t even know where it came from .
It just kinda showed up one day .
I started feeding it some food and the next thing you know he like made hisself at home and now it stays with me .
He do n’t know any tricks and he wo n’t even come when I call him ( unless I have some food in my hand , then he comes right away even if I call him by a name other than Snot Rag ) .
It lost a lot of its fir somewhere along the line .
I do n’t know why maybe from scratching flees .
He ’s kinda bald .
He also barks a lot for no real reason .
And sometimes he ’ll bite poeple if they get to close and do n’t have any food on them .
I guess he ’s kinda mean , really and most poeple do n’t like him at all .
And , I must admit that he realy does n’t smell all that good specially when its wet out after its rained .
That ’s why I make him sleep on the floor ( tho he wants to sleep with me !! )
And heres My Car !!
OK , I ’m not one of those guys who are really into there cars .
As I mentionned , my main thing in life is music and guitars !!
I am , afterall , THE GUITAR GOD !!!
But , everybody needs a car just to get around , and I have one !
It ’s a white car , kinda old , but I ’m not sure of the model or the year .
It really needs to be washed LOL and the junk needs to be cleared off the floors and seats , but she runs pretty good and gets descent milage !!
Theres no spare tho , so let ’s hope I do n’t get a flat !!!!
Oh and the blinkers do n’t work and one tail lite is out .
I did have one accident with the car , and I think it had a few more before I even got it !!
Let ’s just say I backed up and did n’t look to close in the miror so I didnt see that guy standing there !
But you know what ’s the funny thing ?
He was even drunker than I was !!
LOL
But the police were n’t really laughing much that day !!

It ’s a joke …
In case you have n’t noticed , the page you were viewing is not for real .
It started out as a parody of an eBay guitar ad , but quickly took on a life of its own .
Most of the links do not work , but a few of them do :
Some people , of course , just do n’t get it .
Here ’s an email I received from someone who , apparently , has no sense of humor :
Are you stupid or something ?
Only a dumbass would fall for that .
Fender strats do n’t have yamaha any where on them .
1950 strats
do n’t have rosewood necks , they have maple .
That is not a $ 15,500
guitar , that is a $ 130 guitar .
If you ai n’t sure that is a yamaha pacifica
112 . Just thought you might like to knnow how big a f*** ing ediot you are .
Or , maybe he was just playing along with the joke .
Yeah , that ’s gotta be it .
Nobody is that stupid .
Note :
This is not intended to poke fun at eBay ( which is a fine company that performs a great service ) .

I ’m really glad we saw G.I. Joe : The Rise of Cobra at the drive in theater .
Otherwise I dont think we would have been as free to yell at the screen , huff exhaust fumes or reorient our chairs to watch other movies .
We were on the very last row of cars , sandwiched between a hotboxing minivan ( Josh did n’t mind at all ) and a pickup full of red necks so the screen was quite far away and difficult to make out at times .
We tried to emulate real theater sound ( to hear the movie you tune a radio to a certain station ) using Eli ’s boombox for high ’s , Josh ’s subwoofer for lows and our own bemused groans for mids .
It was my first drive in experience and all told a very pleasant one despite the movie ’s best efforts .
Oh , the movie ?
Right .
It was unfathomably terrible .
I expected it to be bad , but I also expected to have at least some idea of what was going on at any given time during the film .
I ’m almost positive there was some dialog between explosions , in the same way one assumes people are all basically good .
There ’s a lot of evidence to the contrary , but you still want to hold onto that belief .
I have a feeling the shooting script for G.I Joe went something like this :
Camel / Jet/EXPLOSION/Tank/EXPLOSION/EXPLOSION/Camel Duke & Black Duke meet hologram Hawk / Adlib dialog / EXPLOSION EXPLOSION /EXPLOSION/EXPLOSION / Adlib dialog / Robot Suits !/4 EXPLOSIONS ROBOT SUIT FIGHT / NINJA FIGHT / NINJA FLASHBACK /EXPLODING NINJAS Eiffel Tower EXPLODE !/ Adlib/MORE ROBOT SUIT STUFF / MORE NINJA STUFF / HUMMER / BOOOOOM !
[ Director ’s Note : ok , the rest of the movie needs to take place underwater or on the north pole .
Fuck it , let ’s do both . ]
BOOM / BOOM / EXPLODE / SUBMARINE /Secret jet that speaks SCOTTISH / BOOM / BOOM / BOOM !
Haggis MacCloud turns into Destro / Cobra Commander turns into Cobra Commander / EXPLODE EXPLODE AGAIN / Set Up Sequel / Credits .
[ Director ’s Note :
Make sure we use “ Yo Joe ! ” “ Knowing is half the battle ” “ Kung Fu Grip ” “ Gotta catch ’em all ! ” and “ ThunderCats Ho ! ” ]
Bottom line :
Do n’t go see it anywhere that shouts of outrage and uproarious laughter would n’t be appreciated .
Wait for DVD .
Hell , do a triple feature of ultimate confusion and explosions with G.I. Joe and both Transformers films .
Make a real night out of it .
UPDATE ON THE BOOK PRESALE !
As of this posting there are only 5 Ultimate Fancy Editions left !
I was live Tweeting during the movie from the drive in theater in Ennis , TX .
The fruits of that effort are listed below :
SPOILERS !!!
[ I guess ]
I ’ve created a website that has a timeline of everything that happened ( with evidence ) as well as every resource on what ’s been going on .
It also has websites / blogs that cover the Rockstar boycott and Facebook ’s censorship .
If you want to catch up on everything that happened this is the best place to go as it has all the information as I find it / people send to me : [ VISIT HERE ]
[ This was written when the facebook group was “ hijacked ” ]
As I sit here utterly tired from lack of sleep , anger , confusion , and other things , I ’m trying to think of the best , clearest and most efficient way to tell you about what ’s been going on the past several weeks and why I ’ve decided to make this blog .
I think the Facebook apology page might help explain more , but for now here ’s a quick version / timeline of what ’s happened :
1
Created the facebook group “ Do n’t Drink Hate . BOYCOTT ROCKSTAR ” late April .
2
Group starts growing , quickly grows to 12,000 + people
3
I wake up on May 27th , to find my Facebook account disabled .
I also find out that the group was suddenly deleted .
4
May 28th , I receive a threat of lawsuit from the lawyers representing ROCKSTAR .
5
I create a new group “ Do n’t Drink Hate .
BOYCOTT ROCKSTAR * my apology ” on June 2nd .
6
My friend uses her connections to get my original Facebook account reinstated
7
I come home from dinner on June 8th to find my new Facebook account disabled and because I created the group from it , I am no longer an admin of the “ Do n’t Drink Hate .
BOYCOTT ROCKSTAR * my apology ” group .
8
Still June 8th , at 1:52 am the group is changed by a sudden new admin “ Jan Mikael Evertsson ” to a new group name and description “ LEGALIZE CHILD LABOR ! ”
Then around 4:00 am the group is changed again to “ ROCKSTAR ENERGY DRINK FANCLUB ! ”
Some of my status updates on Facebook :
1:38 am | Charles Tsai is confused , who is Jan Mikael Evertsson and why is he now the admin for the group I created … ?
1:49 am | Charles Tsai is fucking pissed off .
AND , legalizing child labor is FUCKED UP .
3:11 am | Charles Tsai is now energized , more than ever , to fight the fuck out of this thing .
9
Now , here I am .
Reading ( and being sickened by ) wall posts by the new admin such as “ Yes , this is a cave - in .
It was decided it was not worth any legal repercussions to we now FULLY endorse Rockstar Energy Drink in every way !
GO ROCKSTAR ! YAY ! ” and “ Please let ’s all focus on the AWESOMENESS that is ROCKSTAR ENERGY DRINK ( as ordered by lawyers ) .
Any past negative comments concerning ROCKSTAR ENERGY DRINK originatin from this group were WRONG , LIES and SLANDER ! GO ROCKSTAR ! ” and “ Once again , we APOLOGIZE publically for any slander towards ROCKSTAR ENERGY DRINK and salute them as the world ’s most powerful energy drink !
Go Rockstar ! ”
And , apparently , when members e-mailed the new admin inquiring , some received this message : “ Ownership was handed over to me by the previous owner after a deal was made to avoid going any further with a potential lawsuit . ”
Excuse me ?
That is utter bullshit .
10
Just woke up from a nap ( did n’t sleep all night ) and it seems that group is completely gone now ?
Unfortunately for whoever it was , I have screenshots ( something that ’s grown into a habit since the original group and its 12,000 + members disappeared ) .
I ’ll start uploading them on a new images page soon ( I need to get ready to work now though ) !
I ’ve copied and pasted the original group ’s content on the “ apology ” page .
Please read it .
And be sure to join the newly posted “ Do n’t Drink Hate .
BOYCOTT ROCKSTAR * ( reposted ) ” Facebook group !
Just wanted to let everyone know about what ’s going on and again , thank you so much for all the support .
Let ’s all keep it up !
We will not be silenced .
I know I fucking wo n’t ,
Charles Chung - Chi Tsai
PS I ’ve also copied and pasted the original apology below
Hi all ,
As the creator of the original “ Do n’t Drink Hate . BOYCOTT ROCKSTAR ” group , I ’ve created this group to publish a public apology and retraction as forced by the law firm representing ROCKSTAR *.
But before I do , let me explain what led to this .
One month ago , my friend showed me a little article filled with quotations from Michael Savage Weiner and his son Russell Weiner .
I was utterly disgusted .
Then I read that Russell Weiner was the CEO of Rockstar * and his mom Janet Weiner was CFO .
After more readings , I made a PERSONAL CHOICE to BOYCOTT all ROCKSTAR * products .
I made a group to let others know and be able to make a similar choice if they wanted ; the group was formed and it quickly grew to over 12,000 members .
In it , we put together a list of quotations from Michael Savage Weiner as well as his son that we strongly did not agree with .
We also put commonly known information such as the fact that they co-founded the extremely conservative Paul Revere society , which openly calls for actions such as “ Eliminate bilingual education in all states ” and “ Traditional Marriage . ”
More easily proven information was included as well .
Then , on May 27th , I woke up unable to log into my personal Facebook account .
It was disabled .
I lost all my photos , friends and priceless memories .
I sent multiple e-mails to Facebook without any response .
And then upon inquiring , I found out that the “ Do n’t Drink Hate .
BOYCOTT ROCKSTAR ” facebook group was coincidentally also suddenly taken down without my or any of the administrators ’ knowledge ( As an update , as of early June , after my friend ’s hard work with connections at Facebook they suddenly reinstated my old account .
However , as happy as I am , I find this very troubling on many levels especially because I still have not yet received a satisfactory explanation — the original group is still nonexistent . )
A few days later , I received a lawsuit threat from the law offices of Glaser , Weil , Fink , Jacobs , Howard & Shapiro , LLP — Robert Shapiro was one of the attorneys who successfully defended OJ Simpson .
I researched , and apparently other individuals — primarily bloggers and reporters ( e.g. SF Examiner ’s Kelvin , wiqaable.com , gaywired.com ) had received threats of legal action as well .
Now here I am .
And I ’ve been forced to make this apology .
I ’ve been forced to make “ an immediate public retraction … ” and “ apologize for the business libel you committed against ROCKSTAR . ”
I ’ve been “ advised that ROCKSTAR will pursue all necessary legal action to redress the violations of its rights , including , without limitation , an action for general , special and exemplary damages and equitable relief . ”
— — — — — — — — ———————-
To THE ATTN OF : ROCKSTAR * / Glaser , Weil , Fink , Jacobs , Howard & Shapiro , LLP
Let this group and this statement stand as evidence of an apology .
As Facebook disabled the original group without my knowledge , I suggest you contact them if you want me to be able to message all the members of the original group :
I , Charles C. C. Tsai , hereby apologize for the alleged business libel that I committed against ROCKSTAR * and publicly retract , through Facebook ’s own unexplained deletion , the statements from the original Facebook group .
— — — — — — — — ———————-
Now , I personally also apologize for the following :
I apologize for having an opinion .
I apologize that I created a group as a means to explore my FREEDOM OF SPEECH .
I apologize that the over 12,000 + individuals in that group were SILENCED WITHOUT EXPLANATION .
I apologize for STANDING UP for my communities and the communities that I consider myself an ally to .
I apologize for being DISGUSTED by the statements , beliefs , thoughts and actions of two INDIVIDUALS : ROCKSTAR * CEO Russell Weiner and his father , Michael Savage Weiner .
Let me repeat , two INDIVIDUALS .
I apologize that you feel the need to THREATEN and SILENCE individuals & organizations that you know are POWERLESS in comparison to your various forms of capital .
I apologize that you seem to be confused by the semantics of the word “ co- founder ” in the sense that Michael Savage Weiner and his wife Janet Weiner IRREFUTABLY CO -CREATED / CO-INVENTED / CO -FOUNDED the ROCKSTAR drink alongside current CEO RUSSELL WEINER .
From ROCKSTAR *’s OWN archived WEBSITE :
“ I was very fortunate to have been raised by two of the leading herbalists in the world , Dr. and Mrs. MICHAEL WEINER , Ph.D. …
From my earliest walking days , I remember exploring the jungles of the South Pacific on expeditions WITH MY PARENTS .
… MY FAMILY HAS taken that spirit and experience – their lifetime journey – and DEVELOPED the most complete , most unique , most powerful , and most honest energy beverage ever created : ROCKSTAR . ” – CEO RUSSELL GOLDENCLOUD WEINER
http://web.archive.org/web/20021211144041/www.rockstar69.com/new/rockstar.html
After reading the above , I apologize that you , Michael Weiner Savage , feel the need to LIE , as you told the SF Chronicle in May 2009 that “ I had NOTHING to do with the founding or CREATION of Rockstar . ”
I apologize that legal threats WILL NOT FORCE me into SUBMISSION .
I apologize that I will not be silenced .
I apologize that the incredibly smart , strong willed and amazing individuals and communities that dislike your CEO Russell Weiner , his dad Michael Savage Weiner and his mom CFO Janet Weiner will NOT go quietly into the night and will too NOT BE SILENCED .
I apologize that I will , WITHOUT ANY DOUBT , continue to BOYCOTT ROCKSTAR * as it is MY OWN PERSONAL CHOICE TO DO SO .
And , lastly , I apologize for any additional semantically puzzling words this note may have presented .
Please realize that I have sensitively taken this into consideration through capitalization and repetition .
Yours truly ,
Charles C. C. Tsai

WASHINGTON  George J. Mitchell likes to remind people that he labored for 700 days before reaching the Good Friday accord that brought peace to Northern Ireland .
So the fact that Mr. Mitchell has shuttled back and forth to the Middle East for the last 190 days without any breakthroughs , he said , does not mean that President Obama ’s push for peace there is stalled .
But while the negotiating has continued  mostly in closed - door sessions with few comments for the press , in keeping with Mr. Mitchell ’s close - to - the - vest style  reports in Israel , in particular , have focused on the claim that the Obama administration ’s pressure is alienating Israelis even while it is failing to sway Arabs .
“ One of the public misimpressions is that it ’s all been about settlements , ” Mr. Mitchell , the administration ’s special envoy to the Middle East , said in a rare interview Friday after six months on the job .
“ It is completely inaccurate to portray this as , ‘ We ’re only asking the Israelis to do things . ’
We are asking everybody to do things . ”
Another misperception , he said , was that Arab countries had rebuffed Mr. Obama ’s request to make moves toward a more normal relationship with Israel  a perception fueled by a Saudi official ’s blunt public rejection of such incremental steps in Washington on Friday .
Top 16 Pieces of Your Information Identity Thieves Crave
Tweet
Unfortunately , identity theft has recently become the fastest growing crime in our increasingly digital world .
Potential thieves are becoming extremely adept at leveraging stolen data to empty existing accounts , max credit limits , apply for jobs , and even obtain mortgages .
Despite the specifics of the fraud , becoming a victim of identity theft can end up costing you a ton of time , stress , and money .
This is a countdown of the most valuable information identity thieves would just love to get their grubby little hands on .
While it ’s not a comprehensive guide on how to prevent identity theft , the first step in prevention is knowing what is being targeted .
Enjoy !
# 16 – Your Hobbies , Club Memberships , or Employer
This might seem like an unusual place to start this countdown , however many aspiring thieves begin their hunt here .
This information is insanely easy to obtain , as we rarely protect these details .
Once they ’ve obtained this information , thieves will either leverage it to pretext ( impersonate you ) or in various phishing scams ( impersonating the club , organization , or even employer ) .
The basic idea is people are much more likely to respond to e-mail and telephone scams when they appear to be from groups they belong to .
# 15 – Where You Hold Financial Accounts
Again , the value here lies in the ability for thieves to leverage this information when pretexting or phishing .
Thieves will study how major banking and financial institutions contact their customers , in order to make their scams appear more genuine .
In general , be wary of ANY e-mail that asks you to provide additional information , even if it looks authentic .
Always play it on the safe side by visiting a branch or calling .
Some of the most popular phishing scams target Username / Passwords for online financial accounts by asking clients to “ log - in ” using an application within the e-mail .
# 14 – Your Telephone Number
In general , most of us are weary about giving out our phone number based on fear from getting telemarketing or fundraising calls of some sort .
While it happens far less frequently , identity thieves are n’t afraid to tap into this medium , as well .
Many use automated callers ( hoping to get punch in or record information ) , but some are brave enough to impersonate institutions and call themselves .
With only a few pieces of other information , you ’d be shocked at how elaborate and effective these types of phishing scams can be .
# 13 – Your E-mail Address
Like your telephone number , your e-mail address is most valuable as a medium for phishing scams .
E-mails are easier to automate , can be made to look ultra-authentic , and have a higher rate of success than phone or snail - mail .
E-mails addresses also carry a little extra weight , as various online accounts allow you to use them as a username ( PayPal , anyone ? ) .
# 12 – Your Physical Address ( including previous ones )
While used more rarely these days as a medium for phishing , the threat of receiving “ bait ” in the mail is still very real .
These attempts can range from phony bills , sweepstakes scams , or change - in - service notifications with bogus customer service telephone numbers .
In addition to phishing , thieves can use your address to initiate a “ change - of - address , ” effectively rerouting all your mail ( and the additional information within ) for at least a couple days .
Lastly , identity thieves can literally visit your home to steal mail , trash , or even information out of your glove box .
# 11 – The Expiration Date or Confirmation Code of Your Plastic
While obviously not as valuable as the actual account numbers themselves , these two items are the most common form of security when using your plastic .
These can either be picked up by more advance skimmers ( a special device attached to common places where you swipe your card ) or as the target of a phishing scam .
It should go without saying that if someone can piece together your account numbers with one or both of these items , you ’re in for some major damage control .
# 10 – Where You Were Born
This information is much more valuable than it may first appear .
It ’s yet another piece of information that can be used when impersonating you and / or verifying “ your ” identity with various institutions .
In addition , thieves can use this to find public records , request birth certificates , and locate relatives .
Knowing just someones full name along with the city , county , state , or even nation of birth can open up a portal to the more valuable information later .
# 9 – Your Mother ’s Maiden Name
Ah , the default piece of information used to verify so many accounts .
Luckily , this has been so popular for so long that many organizations are shying away from even offering it as a verification option .
Despite this trend , a vast majority of them still DO accept it .
My suggestion ?
With so many other options available for verification , why use this one ?
If you have a choice , utilize a more random and difficult - to - guess verification question / method .
# 8 – Your Banking PINs
Your Personal Identification Numbers or PINs act as mini-passwords ( most 4 - 6 numbers in length ) to your financial accounts .
Unfortunately , many people use anniversaries , birthdays , or other easily guess personal information .
Even worse , they store their PINs in their wallet !
It ’s an all - you - can - eat buffet in the event it gets lost or stolen .
With your PIN thieves can withdraw cash directly , swipe debit without producing additional i.d. , or gain full access to your online accounts .
# 7 – Your Passport Number
A passport number in conjunction with an illegal database can result in a wealth of information for thieves .
Passport numbers can yield full names , date of birth , place of birth , and of course nationality .
If your physical passport is snatched , the consequences go downhill quickly .
With an altered picture , a thief could use your passport to open accounts internationally , resulting in some rather complex problems you ’ll have to clean up .
# 6 – Your Driver ’s License Number
Your driver ’s license number is much like your passport number , but because it is more common and contains more information it is actually much more valuable .
Amongst the information that can be illegally obtained through you DLN is your full name , date of birth , address , and basic personal appearance data ( height , weight , eye & hair color ) .
If physically stolen they are easier to alter successfully than passports and will usually result in less scrutiny .
# 5 – Your Online Passwords ( including usernames )
With everything moving online these days , your online usernames and passwords are becoming more and more valuable .
It should be blatantly obvious that if a thief got his / her hands on your financial institutions log - in information , you ’d be toast .
You can do a lot with online banking these days .
Let ’s even assume that they only get your e-mail password or even just a social media account .
Unfortunately , I ’d be scared to admit what other information would be attainable if my e-mail was compromised .
Bottom line … be careful what information you send through e-mail and be sure to create kick - ass passwords .
# 4 – Your Actual Account Numbers
In terms of stealing from your current accounts ( opposed to using your info to open new accounts ) , your actual account numbers are the primary target of thieves .
The most common accounts are checking , savings , credit cards , and debit cards , but do n’t rule out protecting your investment and retirement accounts .
A thief can do a lot with just the full account numbers , but if they ’re able to match it with numbers 8 , 11 , or 15 … watch out .
# 3 – Your Full Name ( including aliases )
While this may seem too basic to include on the list ( especially this low ) , it ’s value is so immense that it ca n’t be neglected .
“ Name as it appears on card ” is one of the most common security checks for online credit purchases .
In addition , it ’s clearly essential when generating / opening new fraudulent accounts .
While a name like Adam Baker is n’t going to cause any problems , names like Robert , Richard , and Elizabeth can result in many different aliases .
Finding your full birth name and common aliases is the base for everything else !
# 2 – Your Date of Birth
Again , another bread - and - butter piece of personal information .
But , like your full name , it ’s value lies in the fact that it ’s used in the creation of nearly every account .
It ’s also one of the most common and easily - used pieces of information to verify existing accounts .
Along with the one before it and after it , this comprised what I like to call the “ Big 3 ″ of your identity ( at least to the government / corporate worlds ) .
# 1 – Your Social Security Number
Ah , the golden ticket .
So obvious , you probably guessed it from the get - go .
Unfortunately , this magical number is used by nearly every government and financial institution as the primary form of identity .
It out ranks even your name , which can vary from institution to institution depending on minor details .
While it may be a sad situation that your entire life can be summed up with a number … it can .
It ’s our system and this is your only key .
Protect it !
Further Information :
Identity thieves utilize a wide variety of techniques to obtain your personal data .
While I ’ve touched upon a couple above , much more in - depth information is available on the official site of the Federal Trade Commission .

HUNTSVILLE , AL --
The Airborne Laser missile defense system successfully tracked and hit the mark earlier this month during its first in - flight test against an instrumented target missile , according to Boeing and the Missile Defense Agency .
The news came today , just a few days before the 12th annual Space and Missile Defense Conference opens next week in Huntsville .
During the Aug. 10 test , the modified Boeing 747-400 F prototype aircraft took off from Edwards Air Force Base and used its infrared sensors to find a target missile launched from San Nicolas Island , Calif .
The Boeing - developed battle management system aboard ABL then issued engagement and target location instructions to the beam control / fire control system , which acquired the target and fired two solid - state illuminator lasers to track it and measure atmospheric conditions .
ABL then fired a surrogate high - energy laser at the target , simulating a missile intercept .
Instrumentation on the target verified the laser hit the missile .
" This test demonstrates that the Airborne Laser can fully engage an in - flight missile with its battle management and beam control / fire control systems , " said Michael Rinn , Boeing vice president and ABL program director .
MDA said this test marks the third successful ABL missile engagement in just over two months and the first time laser performance
data was collected at the target missile .
Plans call for ABL to engage progressively more difficult targets in coming months , culminating with a lethal
demonstration against a boosting threat - representative ballistic missile target later this year .
Boeing is the prime contractor and overall systems integrator for ABL , and provides the modified aircraft and battle management system .
Northrop Grumman supplies the high - energy laser , and Lockheed Martin provides the beam control / fire control system .

The crash happened in Patricroft , Salford
A police officer is to face a charge of causing the death of a woman who was killed in a crash involving a police van in Greater Manchester .
Angela Purcell , 38 , was in a Seat Ibiza which collided with the vehicle as it answered an emergency call in Patricroft , Salford , on 20 June , 2008 .
Pc John Hannan , the driver of the van , was charged following an investigation managed by the police watchdog .
The 31 - year - old will appear before Bury magistrates on 22 September .
Officers injured
The collision happened at the junction of Green Lane and Cromwell Road in Patricroft .
Ms Purcell 's five - year - old niece and a man who was driving were also injured in the crash .
Both officers in the police vehicle suffered minor injuries and were taken to hospital as a precaution .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) managed the Greater Manchester Police ( GMP ) investigation into the incident .
It revealed on Thursday that Pc Hannan had been summonsed to face a charge of causing death by dangerous driving .
BOSTON -- A Democratic push to appoint a successor to the late Sen. Edward Kennedy is sparking a political tempest in Massachusetts , infuriating Republicans and dividing Democrats who only five years ago passed a law requiring that voters decide on Senate vacancies .
On a day when members of both parties paid their respects to Mr. Kennedy , a Democratic icon who died this week of brain cancer , Republicans accused Democrats of hypocrisy .
In 2004 , the state 's Democrat - controlled legislature changed the law to prevent the governor from appointing an interim successor after a U.S. Senate seat becomes vacant .
Instead , the new law requires that a special election be held between 145 and 165 days after the position becomes vacant .
At the time , Democratic Sen. John Kerry was running for president and Massachusetts had a Republican governor , Mitt Romney .
Proponents of changing the law argued that a gubernatorial appointment was undemocratic and that only voters should decide on a replacement .
Democrats also feared Mr. Romney would appoint a Republican .
Now , with Mr. Kennedy dying three years before his term was up , some Massachusetts Democrats are reversing course , calling for Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick to appoint an interim replacement to hold office until the special election can be held .
They now argue the state should n't be without full Senate representation for months , especially with pressing issues such as health care before Congress .
The Massachusetts situation is the latest to erupt over filling vacant U.S. Senate seats , following particularly messy appointments in New York and Illinois .
Press TV said its contributions to the show reflected the balance of opinion George Galloway 's shows on an Iranian - funded TV channel broke broadcasting rules on impartiality , Ofcom has said .
Two shows hosted by the Respect MP during the Gaza conflict in January did not give enough weight to pro-Israeli views , the regulator ruled .
The " overwhelming majority " of content was pro-Palestinian and no phone calls reflected pro-Israeli opinion , it said .
Press TV argued it had met the broadcasting code by giving viewers of differing opinions a chance to respond .
Two editions of the shows - a weekly phone - in programme called Comment and a current affairs show The Real Deal - prompted some complaints to Ofcom .
Alternative views Ofcom said Mr Galloway , who earlier this year was given a Palestinian passport from a Hamas leader in Gaza for his support for the Palestinian people , was entitled to express his opinions .
But it ruled that alternative viewpoints had to be aired on controversial issues .
It said no telephone calls and only limited texts and e-mails were taken from people with pro-Israeli views .
Where a matter of major political controversy is being discussed , as here , the broadcaster must ensure that an appropriately wide range of significant views must be included
Ofcom ruling " Taking the programmes as a whole , Ofcom noted that there were some but extremely limited contributions that could be labelled as being broadly supportive of the actions of the Israeli state in Gaza during January 2009 .
" It should be noted that where a matter of major political controversy is being discussed , as here , the broadcaster must ensure that an appropriately wide range of significant views must be included and given due weight in each programme or in clearly linked and timely programmes .
" This is especially important where a presenter is known to have strongly held views on the subject being discussed in the programme and clearly makes his position clear throughout the programme . "
Balance of opinion Press TV , an English language satellite station funded by the Iranian government , said it had complied with the broadcasting code by giving viewers the chance to respond .
It said its contributions to the show reflected the balance of opinion .
Ofcom rejected an argument that the presence of journalist Jeff Steinberg on The Real Deal gave an Israeli viewpoint - as he was appearing as a commentator rather than giving the Israeli position .

A cadre of Menlo - Atherton High School students used some high - tech savvy , a Mideast connection and a gift card to pull off a senior prank that kept most of their classmates away from school until third period Friday .
Right around 6:40 a.m. , the home phones of about 1,700 Menlo - Atherton students received automatic “ robo - calls ” from a number that showed up on caller ID as 650- 322-5311 , the school ’s office number .
“ This is an important message regarding a serious electrical failure at Menlo - Atherton High School , ” the robo - call said .
“ Due to the potential hazards this morning ’s events may induce , school has been temporarily postponed until third period . ”
The message then repeats in Spanish .
The caller rang back five minutes later for those who did n’t pick up the phone the first time and left voicemails for those who still did n’t answer .
Students familiar with the prank , who divulged details to the Bay Area News Group on the condition of anonymity , said it worked perfectly and the school was “ empty ” during the first two periods .
Here ’s how they did it :
The students obtained the school directory and converted it to an Excel spreadsheet .
They plugged the numbers into a Web site that makes robo-calls , using a friend in Israel to sign up for the service .
That way , the computer IP address for the person responsible for the calls was traced back to the Middle East .
The site allows users to enter any caller ID number for the calls , and the pranksters recorded the message using a fake robotic computer voice .
The students used a Visa gift card to pay the $ 150 to $ 200 fee for the calls , because the gift card is not traceable to a specific person as a regular debit or credit card is .
Menlo-Atherton officials sent out counter - calls telling students to come to school but the caller ID again showed the school ’s office number .
Students said their classmates finally arrived in time for third period , about 9:35 a.m. , and the pranksters had not been caught by the time school let out Friday .
Sequoia Union High School District spokeswoman Bettylu Smith said the incident is under investigation , but there was no breach of the school ’s telecommunications or student information system .
“ Preparation for finals is in full swing and , although a number of students arrived after the school day began ( Friday ) morning , school business continued as normal , ” Smith said .

Advertisement A missing merchant ship with 15 Russian crew members on board has been spotted off the coast of West Africa , unconfirmed reports say .
The Arctic Sea had last been sighted in the Bay of Biscay on 30 July .
Reports citing coastguards suggested it had been seen some 400 nautical miles north of the Cape Verde islands .
However amid continuing uncertainty , the Russian envoy in Cape Verde said he had contacted the military there and the sighting had not been confirmed .
Russian navy ships have been searching for the 4,000 - tonne Maltese - flagged vessel , which had been carrying timber .
Observers have suggested the ship was hijacked , possibly because of a Russian commercial dispute .
Click here for a map charting sightings of the Arctic Sea Following the reported sighting , a spokesman for the French defence ministry told the BBC that the Arctic Sea was thought to be in international waters .
The spokesman said his information came from the Cape Verde coastguard , who said the ship was outside its jurisdiction .
It would seem that these acts , such as they have been reported , have nothing in common with ' traditional ' acts of piracy or armed robbery at sea .
Martin Selmayr
EU Commission
Speculation rife over missing ship However , the spokesman said there was a " high possibility " that the ship had been located .
French intelligence officials also believe they have found the ship in the same area , he said .
The Russian ambassador to Cape Verde , Alexander Karpushin , told Associated Press news agency that a Russian frigate was heading to the area but had no information on the Arctic Sea 's location .
Russia 's RIA news agency later quoted Mr Karpushin as saying that confirmation that the Arctic Sea had been spotted " 400 nautical miles north of the island of Santo Antao ... did not prove to be true " .
Five Russian warships and other vessels have been searching the Atlantic for the vessel .
Attack reports Carrying timber reportedly worth $ 1.8 m ( £ 1.1 m ) , the Arctic Sea sailed from Finland and had been scheduled to dock in the Algerian port of Bejaia on 4 August .
The Arctic Sea went missing in mysterious circumstances last month
The crew reported being boarded by up to 10 armed men as the ship sailed through the Baltic Sea on 24 July , but the intruders were reported to have left the vessel on an inflatable boat after 12 hours .
There are also reports of the ship being attacked a second time off the Portuguese coast .
However the ship 's operators said they had no knowledge of the incident and Portugal said the ship was never in its territorial waters .
The last known contact with the crew was when the Arctic Sea reported to British maritime authorities as it passed through the Dover Strait .
On Friday , the European Union Commission spokesman Martin Selmayr said : " From information currently available it would seem that these acts , such as they have been reported , have nothing in common with ' traditional ' acts of piracy or armed robbery at sea . "
Nato was monitoring the situation due to the unusual nature and location of the attacks , but was not directly involved in the search .

This is my very first blog post and so I thought it should be about a tool that is indispensable for me – Git .
I started using git about 10 months ago and looking back I can’t imagine how I managed to get work done without it .
The purpose of this post , however , is not to sing git ’s praises , there are lots of good articles on the web that do so much better than I ever could .
Instead , I wish to share the work - flow I use on my projects .
I developed this work - flow by trial and error over the months and is currently the most efficient and productive approach I can think of .
If any experienced git users happen to stumble upon this post , please do provide suggestions / alternatives to help me improve my process .
The project I am currently working on requires me to maintain two parallel deployment branches .
One is a “ production branch ” which is deployed on the live server and the other is a “ development branch ” which is deployed on a staging server .
All enhancements and feature additions are done in the “ development branch ” and the only changes made in the “ production branch ” are production bug fixes that need urgent attention .
Once the “ development branch ” is deemed stable it is merged into “ production branch ” and deployed .
I ’ve divided my work - flow into two parts .
The first part is a generic approach which I follow in all projects , the second part is specific to the case mentioned above and discusses how I manage the two branches using git .
Although I mention “ Rails ” in the title of this post , the work - flow I define below is not “ Rails ” specific and can be applied to any project where multiple deployment branches need to be maintained .
I assume the reader has a basic understanding of git and is comfortable with git branches .
There are lots of configuration settings in git which help you set up things like you git author name , email and colors for git commands , etc .
There are two I would like to mention here though :
git config -- global push .
default " tracking "
This command tells git to perform a push only to the tracked remote branch in which you are currently working .
git config -- global pack .
threads " 0 "
This command tells git to auto - detect the number of threads to use for packing repositories and is useful when working on a machine with more than one core .
1. Generic Workflow
a. Start with a clean master branch .
git checkout master git pull
You now have a clean master branch .
Never work directly in the master branch , instead make all changes to a local branch .
b. Create a local branch .
git branch my_local_branch git checkout my_local_branch
or do both in one command :
git checkout - b my_local_branch
This creates a new local branch named “ my_local_branch ” and switches to it .
You can now perform all changes in this branch .
One good practice to follow when using git is to commit often and in small chunks .
This gives you finer control on the work done and allows you to fix mistakes without losing other work .
Once you are satisfied , all those smaller commits can be consolidated in a single meaningful commit .
c. Merge with master branch .
git checkout master git pull
if new changes were pulled do the following :
git checkout my_local_branch git rebase master
A rebase will apply the newly pulled changes in the master branch to your local branch and then apply local branch changes on top of that .
This will ensure a clean merge with master .
Conflicts are very common during a rebase and will need to be resolved before you can have a successful rebase .
You can also pass the “ - i ” option to rebase to perform an interactive rebase which will alllow you to squash multiple commits into one if you so require .
Once you are finished with the rebase do the following :
git checkout master git merge my_local_branch git push
Once you are satisfied with the push you can delete the local branch :
git branch -d my_local_branch
2. Managing Multiple Deployment Branches
The master branch is set as the branch for production deployment and a new remote branch is created for development phase .
Since I use capistrano for project deployment I set it up to have three separate tasks : “ production ” , “ production_staging ” and “ development_staging ” .
The “ production ” and “ production_staging ” tasks use the master branch and the “ development_staging ” task uses the newly created remote branch .
For both the remote branches you must follow the above work - flow i.e : never work directly in the branches themselves , instead create local branches to work in .
a. Create a new remote branch .
First create a new remote branch from our master branch :
git push origin master : refs/heads/development_phase_1
b. Track the remote branch .
Track the newly created remote branch :
git checkout -- track - b development_phase_1 origin/development_phase_1
This will create a new local branch named “ development_phase_1 ” that is tracking the remote “ development_phase_1 ” branch .
Everyone who needs to work on development branch tracks this remote “ development_phase_1 ” branch and pushes to it .
The only pushes to master branch are production fixes .
c. Merge the development branch with the master branch .
Once work on development branch is finished we are ready to merge the two branches :
git checkout development_phase_1 git rebase master git checkout master git merge development_phase_1 git push git branch -d development_phase_1 git push origin : heads/development_phase_1
Normally a rebase is not a good idea in a remotely tracked branch but since our phase is finished and we will create a new remote branch for the next phase , I do so here .
Alternatively , I could do a force push for the remote development branch and everyone working on it would need to remove and retrack it again .
The second last line removes our locally tracked development branch and the last one removes it from the remote repository .
Final Thoughts
As I mentioned before , the above presented work - flow is not perfect by any means but it works for me .
I would appreciate feedback from anyone who reads this and has some suggestions / recommendations to help me manage my projects better .
D id Krishna exist ?
Most certainly , says Dr Manish Pandit , a nuclear medicine physician who teaches in the United Kingdom , proffering astronomical , archaeological , linguistic and oral evidences to make his case .
" I used to think of Krishna is a part of Hindu myth and mythology .
Imagine my surprise when I came across Dr Narhari Achar ( a professor of physics at the University of Memphis , Tennessee , in the US ) and his research in 2004 and 2005 .
He had done the dating of the Mahabharata war using astronomy .
I immediately tried to corroborate all his research using the regular Planetarium software and I came to the same conclusions [ as him ] , " Pandit says .
Which meant , he says , that what is taught in schools about Indian history is not correct ?
The Great War between the Pandavas and the Kauravas took place in 3067 BC , the Pune - born Pandit , who did his MBBS from BJ Medical College there , says in his first documentary , Krishna : History or Myth ?.
Pandit 's calculations say Krishna was born in 3112 BC , so must have been 54 - 55 years old at the time of the battle of Kurukshetra .
Pandit is also a distinguished astrologer , having written several books on the subject , and claims to have predicted that Sonia Gandhi would reject prime ministership , the exact time at which Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati would be released on bail and also the Kargil war .
Pandit , as the sutradhar of the documentary Krishna : History or Myth ? , uses four pillars -- archaeology , linguistics , what he calls the living tradition of India and astronomy to arrive at the circumstantial verdict that Krishna was indeed a living being , because Mahabharata and the battle of Kurukshetra indeed happened , and since Krishna was the pivot of the Armageddon , it is all true .
You are a specialist in nuclear medicine .
What persuaded you to do a film on the history / myth of Krishna ?
You think there are too many who doubt ?
Is this a politico - religious message or a purely religious one ?
We are always taught that Krishna is a part of Hindu myth and mythology .
And this is exactly what I thought as well .
But imagine my surprise when I came across Dr Narhari Achar ( of the Department of Physics at the University of Memphis , Tennessee , in the US ) and his research somewhere in 2004 and 2005 .
He had done the dating of the Mahabharata war using astronomy .
I immediately tried to corroborate all his research using the regular Planetarium software and I came to the same conclusions .
This meant that what we are taught in schools about Indian history is not correct .
I also started wondering about why this should be so .
I think that a mixture of the post - colonial need to conform to western ideas of Indian civilisation and an inability to stand up firmly to bizarre western ideas are to blame .
Also , any attempt at a more impartial look at Indian history is given a saffron hue .
I decided that I could take this nonsense no more , and decided to make films to show educated Indians what their true heritage was .
The pen is mightier than the sword is an old phrase but I thought of new one : Film is the new pen .
Any ideas I have will receive wide dissemination through this medium .
I wanted to present a true idea of Indian history unfettered by perception , which was truly scientific , not just somebody 's hypothesis coloured by their perceptions and prejudices .
Why not a documentary on Rama , who is more controversial in India today ?
Proof of his existence would certainly be more than welcome today ...
A documentary on Rama is forthcoming in the future .
But the immediate reason I deferred that project is the immense cost it would entail .
Whereas research on Krishna and Mahabharata was present and ready to go .
Further more , Rama according to Indian thought , existed in the long hoary ancient past of Treta Yuga , where science finds it difficult to go .
There is a controversial point in your documentary where someone Isckon monk alludes to Krishna as being the father of Jesus .
How can you say that since there is an age gap of roughly 3000 years between the two spiritual giants ?
Is Krishna the spiritual father of Jesus ?
That is what the person who was training to be a Roman Catholic priest , and who now worships Krishna , asks .
The answer comes within the field of comparative religion and theology .
The Biblical scriptures qualify Jesus as the son of God.
Most Indians have no problems accepting this as Hindus are a naturally secular people .
However , then the question that arises is , if Jesus is the son , then who is the Father or God Himself ?
Now , Biblical scriptures do not really give the answer except to say that the Father is all - powerful and omnipresent .
Now , of course , we know that Jesus does not say that he is omnipresent or omnipotent .
Now , no scripture can live as an island , all by itself , and the Srimad Bhagavatam and other scriptures such as the Bramha Samhita all call Krishna as an all powerful , omnipresent being .
So , if we use these words of Bhagavatam , there can be no other truth , which means that Krishna is the father of all living creation .
But it does not mean that Jesus is not divine .
Jesus is indeed divine .
What I liked about the monks in my documentary is that they do not denigrate Jesus although they worship Krishna as God .
They keep Jesus in their hearts , while worshipping Krishna .
What could be more secular or more Christian ?
3067 BC is when the Mahabharata war took place , says Dr Achar .
How did he arrive at this ?
There are more than 140 astronomy references in the Mahabharata .
Dr Achar used simulations of the night sky to arrive at November 22 , 3067 BC , as the day the Mahabharata war began .
He used the references common to Udyoga and Bhisma Parvan initially , and so Saturn at Rohini , Mars at Jyestha with initially only the two eclipses , Lunar at Kartika and Solar at Jyestha .
Let me tell you how rare this set of astronomical conjunctions is .
The Saros cycle of eclipses is periodic at 19 years and so is the Metonic cycle of lunar phases .
So if I say that Amavasya has occured at Jyestha , then this will occur again in 19 years , but if I say that a solar eclipse has occured at Jyestha , then this occurs again at Jyestha only after 340 years .
Add Saturn at Rohini and we take this to 1 in 7,000 years .
This set of conjunctions takes all of these into consideration , but also takes all the other data into consideration .
So now , we know about Balarama 's pilgrimage tithis and nakshatras , and believe it or not , all that fits the 3067 BC date perfectly .
And to top it all , so does the repetition of the three eclipses described at the destruction of Dwarka 36 years later .
This would explain why so many other researchers tried and failed to find the date of the Mahabharata war as it is based on such a unique set of astronomy that it occured only once in the last 10,000 years .
So essentially , your thesis is that since the Mahabharata war actually happened , as confirmed by astronomical deduction , Krishna was also a living entity since he's the fulcrum of the Great War ?
Not just that , but the fact that archaeology , oral and living traditions point to the same .
And yes , we cannot separate the Mahabharata war from Krishna .
If one is shown to have happened , then the other must be true as well .
What 's your next project ?
The next project is called Indian Jesus .
It is already 80 % complete .
It is very controversial but needed to be done .
Living in India convinced me that there are definitely many paths to God .
Anybody who lives in India and does not subscribe to that concept should be termed intolerant , but instead the opposite is happening .
There are some people today who call their God as God and mine as the devil , this is unacceptable , and I will see to it that those intolerant concepts are demolished .
I long to see a one borderless world where we live in mutual respect .
I cannot say much on the project but to say that I will prove that the underlying basis of religions is the same .
There is talk of a banyan tree which the documentary says was a witness to the Battle of Kurukshetra , where 4 million people are said to have died in 14 days .
Where exactly does this exist ?
Has the tree been carbon - dated to confirm its age ?
There is indeed a banyan tree at Jyotisaar in Kurukshetra which is worshipped as such .
This concept is similar to the tree in Jerusalem , which is thought to have witnessed Jesus 's arrival .
Carbon - dating of this banyan tree is unlikely to give any concrete answers .
I have included it in the documentary to show the living tradition of India --- like worship of the Ganges cannot be carbon - dated to give any answers .
There is a gentleman named Ram Prasad Birbal , who said he has found many bones which are said to belong to the Kurukshetra battle .
Has this been scientifically proved ?
Ram Prasad Birbal is a resident of Kurukshetra .
I am not aware of carbon dating of those bones .
But I am informed that thermo-luminescent dating of other relics as well as carbon - dating at other sites in Kurukshetra have given dates far older than the Indus valley civilisation .
Further , Euan Mackie , an eminent archaeologist , had found a clay tablet of Krishna 's Yamalaarjuna episode at Mohenjedaro , a site of the Indus Valley civilisation proving that even in 2200 BC , there was a culture of worshipping Krishna .
You said Hinduism spread across South East Asia in those times ... how big was this religious empire ?
The Hindu religious empire extended across the whole of the Asian sub -continent to South East Asia , from Afghanistan to Thailand ( where Ramayana and Krishna are still shown through dances ) , Burma , Cambodia ( Angkor Wat , Angkor Thom , Bayon , etc ) , Vietnam , Laos ( little Kurukshetra and temples ) , Malaysia ( which was Hindu until recent ) up to Java ( more temples ) , Bali ( where Hinduism is still the religion ) and Indonesia , where Bhima 's grandson is said to have performed a thousand fire rituals at Yogyakarta .
Afghanistan was of course home to both the Yadu race and Shakuni ( Kandahar or Gandhar ) .
Dr Achar said the Kurukshetra war must not have happened on a full moon day ...
The Mahabharata war did not start on an Amavasya .
That is straight forward .
Krishna tells Karna " Saptama chappi divasat Amavasya Bhivasyati " and says that Karna should tell Drona and Bhisma to do the ayudha ( weapons ) pooja on that date .
But not start fighting the war on that date .
The documentary is quiet crisp .
I am told this is the first time you held a camera , and learnt how to shoot .
How many days did this take and what was your budget ?
I learnt film editing first using a variety of software such as Final Cut 6 as I realised that a film director must be able to do decent basic editing to realise what to shoot , from what angles and for what duration .
I bought a professional grade HD movie camcorder initially and then learnt to shoot before we went filming in 8 major Indian cities , the US , UK and Cambodia .
However , nothing prepares you as thoroughly as filming on your own .
Most of this was done with a skeleton crew , mostly handling audio .
I later was funded to buy the latest Cinealta tru HD movie cameras , which are not available in India , and which I am now proficient in using .
I also taught a few crew members how to shoot .
Then came the task of assembling a team of professionals to do editing , graphics , voice over and all else , so that I had a team of people for my next set of documentaries .
It was a steep learning curve , as I never went to film school , but it has worked out well , with people within the industry who are veterans complimenting my work .
I personally think that it was all God 's grace .
The budget was 15,000 pounds or approximately Rs 12 lakh .
It took me 18 months to complete .
Your documentary says India did not have a tradition of putting down everything in writing till 325 BC , when Alexander the Great arrived .
How did you come to this conclusion ?
This is what the current scientific belief is .
Although people have talked about deciphering the Indus Valley " script " , there is no straightforward conclusion about the same , so we stuck to the " official line " there .
We will deal with these issues in a future documentary .
S R Rao , the marine archaeologist from the National Institute of Oceanography , found a 9th century building , and an entire city .
Where was this and when did he find it ?.
S R Rao found the sunken city of Dwarka a few years ago at Beyt Dwarka in the early 1990s .
Apparently , this city near Dwarka was set up 36 years after the Mahabharata war .
Is this the summation of Rao ?
It is believed that due to damage and destruction by the sea , Dwaraka has submerged six times and the modern - day Dwarka is the 7th such city to be built in the area .
Scientifically speaking , we see that 36 years after the war there were the same repetitions of an eclipse triad as we have shown in the documentary .
From Dwarka to Kurukshetra is more than 1,000 km .
How do you think Krishna travelled to help the Pandavas ?
As a scientist , I believe that they travelled on horses which would enable them to reach pretty quickly .
If you consider 1,000 km , that should take him 7 days if he had a string of horses .
Of course if you take faith into account , then it could happen in a twinkling of an eye .
What 's the link between the two comets that Sage Vyasa talked about , the retrograde motion of Mars ( Mangal or Kuja ) at Antares ( Jyestha ) to all this
The idea that comets are harbingers of doom is well - documented .
The thing is that there is a set of statements describing comets and their positions .
Only Dr Achar has arrived at the correct deduction , that those sentences in Bhisma Parvan relate to comets , not planets --- which is where previous researchers found it difficult .
We know that Halley 's comet was seen in that year as well .
Dr Achar interpreted verses from the Bhism Parvan and Udyog Parvan to arrive at various conclusions .
One of them is that when Saturn in at Aldebaran ( Rohini ) it brings great bad tidings .
The last time this happened was in September 2001 , when 9/11 happened .
When does this happen next ?
Actually Saturn at Rohini is long known to be a bad omen by astrologers .
Rohinim Pidyannesha Stitho Rajan Shanischarah .
This transit happened in 1971 where a million or so were killed , and again in 2001 September , when 9/11 happened .
The next time is in 2030 / 2031 AD approximately .
When is the next time Mars will be in Antares ?
Mars at Jyestha has to be taken in conjunction with the other things mentioned by Karna when he talks to Krishna , as it occurs every year .
In any case , those people were great astronomers and not just warriors , so we do n't know what the extent of their knowledge was regarding these events ,
In my personal humble opinion it was perhaps even better than that which we have today .

Ready for some freaky science ?
My most recent obsession is ferrofluid , a liquid containing ferromagnetic nanoparticles that respond strongly to magnets , while remaining in liquid suspension .
Okay , in layman 's terms , this stuff is basically the oil monster from Star Trek the Next Generation ( the one that ate Tasha Yar ) .
The best way to understand what this stuff looks like is to see it in action .
Check out Sachiko Kodama's " Morpho Tower , " a moving , changing sculpture :
( Check out more sculptures at Google Video -- seriously , check them out . )
More amazing ferrofluid videos and links after the jump !
Ferrofluids have lots of practical applications -- used in everything from anti-radar paint to hard drives .
But for my money , it looks like a way - cool toy .
Daniel Rutter wrote up a brief article about the material , with plenty of photos .
Here 's a " Fun with Ferrofluid " video showing what happens when you play with magnets and a dish of the stuff :
Ferrofluids can also be used for games .
SnOil is an implementation of the simple video game " Snake " done in ferrofluid .
In order to play , the user tilts the tray of fluid , steering the snake .
Stick around for when the user finally loses and " GAME OVER " scrolls across ... written in fluid : SnOil .
You can buy ferrofluid kits online , or check out some instructions for making your own ( looks messy ) .

Advertisement People living in urban areas are being encouraged to consider keeping bees in gardens , on roofs or on balconies to help reverse population decline .
Conservation watchdog Natural England wants more homeowners to install hives and grow insect - friendly plants .
Nearly all the UK's 250 species of bee are in decline .
Honeybee numbers have fallen by 10 - 15 % in the last two years .
Experts say sustaining bee populations is essential to ensuring the survival of Britain 's plants and crops .
Natural England wants to see more UK bee colonies , which would make the insects more resistant to their biggest killers - disease and pests , such as the varroa mite .
' Not wildlife deserts '
The organisation 's chief scientist , Tom Tew , said urban areas could play a crucial part in encouraging bees and a new easy - to - use beehive , called a beehaus , could help more people become apiarists .
" There 's no reason why our towns and cities should exist as wildlife deserts - wildlife can thrive when we design our urban areas with nature in mind and the ' beehaus ' is a great example of how easy it is for anyone to bring the natural world closer to their doorstep , " he said .
The new beehaus is intended for use in towns and cities Bees played a crucial role in pollinating plants and crops , he explained , and Britons needed " to recognise that , if we want plants to flourish , we need healthy populations of insects to sustain them " .
Some £ 100 m to £ 200 m worth of British commercial crops are estimated to benefit from bee pollination every year .
Honey itself is also thought to be worth between £ 10 m and £ 30 m to the UK economy .
The first of the newly - designed urban beehives is due to be installed on the roof of Natural England 's central London offices , but Dr Tew said the bees would not be coming into contact with pedestrians on pavements because they flew about five metres off the ground .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This is an excellent idea .
Bees are extremely important Andy T , Devon Omlet , the firm that fuelled interest in urban chicken - rearing with its modern plastic " Eglu " coop , designed the new beehaus and said bee - keeping did not require acres of land .
" Those in the know have been keeping bees in towns for a long time .
Keeping a hive does n't take much space , so you can even keep them on balconies , roof tops and obviously gardens , " said Johannes Paul , from the company .
Natural England urged aspiring apiarists to think carefully about the commitment required when keeping bees , and encouraged people to seek professional advice or visit their local beekeeping association before making a decision .

With Twitter being such a hot trend right now , research firms have been anxious to study how people are using the social platform , and analyze trends in aggregate view .
One such company , data analytics provider , Pear Analytics , set out to study the contents of our tweets to determine if , in fact , we 're all just sharing mindless babble , or if there was something more intellectual going on .
Their findings are n't all that favorable to those of us with lofty views of Twitter , because as it turns out , 40.55 % of tweets are pointless babble .
The Pear Analytics group took 2,000 tweets in English from the public timeline over a time span of two weeks , with 200 tweets captured each half - hour from 11 am - 5 pm CST daily .
They then categorized tweets into six different types : news , spam , self - promotion , pointless babble , conversation , and pass - along value .
The clear winner : pointless babble tweets , with over one - third of all studied tweets fitting into the " I 'm eating a sandwich now " category .
As somewhat of a redemption for our narcissistic oversharing ways , conversational tweets came in a very close second with 37.55 % .
Pass - along value — or RTs — captured third - place with only 8.7 % , but , thankfully , spam only accounted for 3.75 % of all tweets studied .
Other key findings :
- News tweets are heaviest at 2:00 pm CST on Tuesdays - Pass - along value tweets are most frequently seen at 11:30 am CST on Mondays - Spam tweets flow consistently all day , everyday - Conversational tweets are heaviest on Tuesdays
Of all the studies we 've seen on Twitter and online behavior in recent history , this one has to be one of the more scientific .
You can read about Pear Analytics ' research methodology in the full report ( PDF download ) , but it appears as if they tried to capture sample data that would be reflective of the larger Twitter population .
Should that be the case , you and I should probably learn to keep more of the pointless babble we share on Twitter to ourselves .

About R.I.S .
Research and Information Services , Inc. is a non-profit corporation which publishes books and other information primarily related to three interconnected and little - known nameless sects .
These usually meet in homes .
The largest of these calls itself " The Truth " and is presided over by a nominally homeless and itinerant ministry who are known as " Workers , " " Apostles , " " Servants , " etc . *
Their catch - phrase is " meetings in the home and the ministry without a home . "
Private Sunday morning " fellowship meetings " and mid-week " Bible study " meetings are held in the homes of elders in each area .
This larger group also holds public " Gospel Meetings " and private " Special Meetings " in rented halls , as well as large , annual " Conventions " of members ( usually in rural locales and often in facilities constructed for this purpose ) .
The sect has a distinct , though often denied , hierarchy consisting of Overseers , senior workers and elders which developed under George Walker , William Gill , William Jamieson , Jack Carroll , William Hughes and other early leaders .
In contrast , the two smaller groups have rejected a separate ministry and hierarchy , and they neither hire halls for public meetings nor build and maintain facilities for conventions .
Our goal is to document the the history and doctrines of these sects .
Although our main efforts have been in traditional publishing , this site contains historical materials from our archives , including items contributed by others and displayed here with their permissions .
We believe that searching the Scriptures is the basis for testing and defending doctrine .
We believe that raising questions and searching out answers regarding any belief undermines neither faith or truth itself .
Acts 17:11 says of the Bereans , " these were more noble than those in Thessalonica , in that they received the word with all readiness of mind , and searched the scriptures daily , whether those things were so . "
If they were praised for checking out what they heard from the lips of the Apostle Paul , there is nothing wrong with questioning today .
R.I.S. is not a church , nor is it a branch of any denomination .
Truth can be questioned and examined without fear .
Truth stands on its own merit , regardless of who states it — or who questions it .
" For we can do nothing against the truth , but for the truth . "
– 2 Corinthians 13:8
* Other names for the group have included " workers and friends " ( or " friends and workers " ) , " Cooneyites " ( sometimes misspelled " Coneyites " or " Connyites " ) , " Tramps " or " Tramp Preachers , " " the Way , " " les anonymes , " " non-denominational gospel meetings , " " Secredismo " , " die namenlossen , " " home meetings , " " gospel meetings , " " the no-name fellowship , " " the friends , " " the Truth as it is in Jesus , " " the Testimony , " " Christian Conventions , " " the secret sect , " " Assemblies of Christians " ( or " Christian Assemblies " ) , " Christian Missionaries , " " the Jesus Way , " " the New Testament church , " " the church in the home , " " Two by Twos " ( or " 2x2s " ) , " the nameless church , " " Truth meetings , " and other titles ( both formal names used for official purposes only and descriptive nicknames used by members and outsiders ) .

NEW YORK -- Despite a well - publicized oversupply of products and excess manufacturing capacity for solar photovoltaic equipment and components , some solar power industry watchers are still predicting further robust growth in production capacity .
But financial analysts fear numerous makers may fail over the next few years .
Record demand for solar equipment and a shortage of polysilicon , the key ingredient for PV panels , led companies worldwide to rapidly expand their facilities just before the global financial crisis cratered demand for new clean energy installations .
As a result , prices for polysilicon , PV and thin - film solar panels have plummeted , and many experts say the industry is now in the midst of an upheaval as weaker firms close or sell off major chunks of their operations to stay alive .
But while companies struggle with a glut of manufacturing capacity and unsold equipment , at least one research firm still sees capacity growing strongly and not slowing down or shrinking .
It remains confident that firms will continue to bet big on government stimulus programs , the push for action on climate change and a bounce in demand responding to fallen prices .
In the latest report to join this chorus of solar bulls , analysts with Austin , Texas - based DisplaySearch , a division of the global market research firm NPD Group , predict the worldwide manufacturing capacity for solar cells will expand by 56 percent this year over 2008 levels .
2009 is seen as one of the weakest market years this decade , with even DisplaySearch admitting that demand is down by some 17 percent this year , while others see a decline of up to 30 percent .
" So much cell manufacturing equipment was ordered and installed over the past year that capacity is still expected to grow 56 percent this year , " explains report author and manufacturing research vice president Charles Annis in a summary .
In his third fiscal quarter " Quarterly PV Cell Capacity Database & Trends Report , " Annis agrees that an " enormous over - supply " is forcing prices down and threatening the viability of numerous cell makers .
But despite the current weakened market , the company sees capacity expanding at a compound annual growth rate of about 49 percent a year up to 2013 .
Is some overcapacity a mirage ?
Other photovoltaic industry researchers are n't so sure .
" During the boom , there were significant capacity increases .
There were also , by the way , significant announcements of capacity that may or may not have happened , " said Paula Mints , principal PV analyst at Navigant Consulting .
" If someone is following announcements and assuming capacity based on that , then their numbers are way too high . "
But all agree that the rapidly descending prices , fueled further by aggressive cost cutting by some of the industry 's leading players , are causing a bit of upheaval in the solar technology field .
Analysts point to Advent Solar , DayStar Technologies and Blue Square Energy as among the solar companies in the United States that are feeling the pinch and could be shaky .
Though stronger solar manufacturers are viewed as unlikely to acquire weaker rivals immediately , as that would only add to their own inventory problems , large technology companies not traditionally involved in solar power seem to be moving in .
In one oft - cited example , a major German auto parts builder recently swallowed up two solar companies that had been active players in the German market before the current economic upheaval , Aleo Solar and ErSol Solar Energy .
First Solar Inc. has been given the title of largest cell manufacturer in the world in terms of production capacity , with an estimated 1 gigawatt 's worth .
First Solar recently posted $ 180 million in profit for the second quarter of 2009 .
China coming rapidly out of the shadows
But Navigant 's data show that last year , Q - Cells was the largest maker in terms of sales .
That company is now hurting , as much of its customer base has been hit hard by the global economic downturn , a factor compounded by the exit of Spain as a major destination for sales .
And though Japan has long been the leading home of solar manufacturing capacity , China is rapidly rising as the leader in the industry , many experts acknowledge .
China is estimated to have surpassed Japan two years ago as the world leader in solar production capabilities , although Japanese makers still have plans to rapidly grow output levels .
And there is growing speculation that Suntech is poised to emerge as the global leader .
Suntech does n't report its latest quarterly fiscal results until Aug. 20 .
But analysts at Credit Suisse , citing an earlier positive income report by the smaller Chinese maker Canadian Solar , predict that " China solar panel makers will report strong Q3 results aided by strong seasonality , and falling poly prices . "
Thin - film solar technologies are also expected to expand their market share .
Annis predicts that thin film 's share of the overall solar power industry will grow to 30 percent of cell capacity by 2013 .
Some experts predict that 2013 will see an explosion of solar power installations worldwide , while some see a strong rebound coming even sooner , even as early as 2010 .
But given the solar industry 's relative youth and its history of wild up - and - down swings and adjustments , Navigant analyst Mints warns against following too closely predictions on the future size and shape of the solar industry in the years to come .
The feared " shakeout " in the industry could simply be a temporary return to less certain times , she notes .
" It 's an industry that was essentially unprofitable up to 2004 and is used to struggling , " said Mints .
" So we 're pretty much back to that right now and learning how to struggle again . "

The Senate today voted to strip funding for F - 22 fighter jets from the Department of Defense Authorization bill .
The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes
Act rides as an amendment to the DoD legislation , which was under the threat of a veto if funding for the controversial aircraft remained .
The 58 - 40 vote reflected an all - out lobbying campaign by the administration , which had to overcome resistance from lawmakers confronted with the potential losses of defense - related jobs if the F - 22 program was terminated .
“ The president really needed to win this vote , ” Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin , D - Mich . , said .
Levin said it was important not only on the merits of the planes but “ in terms of changing the way we do business in Washington . ”
While the termination of the F - 22 program increases the likelihood Obama will sign the hate crimes bill when it reaches his desk , it is unclear if the “ unwelcome ” amendments added just yesterday , including a provision for the death penalty , will pose further problems .
The ACLU also has issues with the Senate version of the bill , preferring the House version .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- A 90 - year - old Holocaust survivor was found strangled Thursday in his Upper East Side apartment , a spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner said Friday .
Felix Brinkmann dances at a 2008 party marking his 90th birthday .
Felix Brinkmann , a native of Latvia , escaped death for a year while he was in the Nazis ' Mauthausen , Ebensee and Auschwitz concentration camps .
Five times he had been slated for the gas chambers , but each time he used his fluency in German to talk his way out .
After the war ended , he was stunned to discover that his wife , who had also been shipped to Auschwitz , was alive and well in Poland .
The Brinkmanns immigrated to America , where Felix spent years in the bar and nightclub business , co-founding in 1971 Adam 's Apple disco in Manhattan .
In recent years , he had served as the real estate manager of a mixed - use building in the Bronx , working " seven days a week , without fail , " said his son Rick Brinkman , who spells his last name differently than his father .
On Thursday , the building 's superintendent grew concerned when Brinkmann did not show up to work .
He notified Brinkmann 's son and received permission to enter the father 's apartment , where he had lived alone since his wife died last year .
Brinkmann 's body was found lying face down in his bedroom , his hands bound , his body showing blunt - force trauma wounds , police said .
Brinkmann 's blue 2009 Honda Civic may have been stolen and a safe in his apartment tampered with , police said .
A police spokesman said authorities were looking for " a man and a woman " in connection with the homicide .
Rick Brinkman speculated that the killing was random in nature .
" Anybody who knew him really liked him , " the son said .
" He was not the kind of guy who had enemies . "

I discovered this piece of writing and it struck a real chord with me so I felt compelled to share it .

Death does n’t end the suffering .
People who contemplate of committing suicide may think that suicide is the only way that can take away all the pain and end their suffering .
But in Buddhism , death is only the beginning of another cycle of pain and suffering for others and yourself .
According to the Buddhist teaching of the Four Noble Truths – life is full of dissatisfactions .
All the stages of life – birth , ageing , sickness , death – all the ways of being , wanting and striving are conditions of suffering .
However , the Buddha also taught that the end to a dissatisfactory life is possible with the Noble Eightfold Path .
The Buddha also taught us to realise the impermanence and insubstantiality of both life and death .
Everything changes constantly .
Nothing stays the same .
Rain might come after sunshine , but so does sunshine comes after rain .
In the realisation that people ( their personalities , interests and attitudes ) and life situations are unfixed and constantly changing , it becomes possible to approach each moment with an open mind .
One is then able to react and adapt to new situations without clinging to outdated and inconsequential conceptions .
We can live more in the present without hanging on to the past or worrying about the future since each phenomenon arises depending on causes and conditions that are coming into being .
In Buddhism , the mind is also seen as the root of all good and all evil , the cause of both suffering and True Happiness .
It regards the mind as the primary factor that determines the well - being of each person .
Through meditation and counselling , the perception of reality for those with persistent negative - thinking can be adjusted .

Dear Cecil : A friend of mine and I have had a little running joke for many years .
He says he saves every letter he gets from me so that when I become a rich and famous writer , he can publish them and make a ton of money .
This does n't seem quite fair to me , since , after all , I wrote them , and I deserve as much of the take as he does .
He points out that letters from famous people are hot collectors ' items , and that nobody asks Richard Nixon , say , if it 's all right with him if they sell his letters .
Obviously , only Cecil Adams can settle an important legal issue like this one .

Cecil replies :
Dear Karen :
A little running joke , eh ?
Boy , you two do have a lot of fun , do n’t you ?
Collecting and publishing are two very different things .
As a material possession –like a pair of socks or a souvenir paperweight–a letter is yours if someone sends it to you , and you can sell it if you like .
But as a literary composition , a letter belongs to its author , and only s/he has the right to publish it .
If you acquired the original manuscript of A Farewell to Arms , for instance , you ’d have no right to run off a few copies ( or , technically , even put it on display –that ’s considered “ publication , ” too ) without the author ’s permission .
The same rules apply to letters as to novels , plays , poems , or whatever .
But I ’ll think I ’ll hang on to this one anyway , just in case .

Family Breakdown and Suicide in Australia
The information quoted below is excerpted from the report " Family Breakdown in Australia 
An attempt to get at the truth about the magnitude of the problem " by Malcolm Mathias , president of the Lone Fathers Association of Australia Inc. Update 2004 09 23 : The PIR Independent Research Group published a report on a thorough review of the Australian Child Support Agency ( 2004 09 22 ) .
The PIR CSA - Review contains the latest compilation of estimates on men's suicides caused through Draconian , oppressive and exploitative enforcement of CSA rules .
That information from the PIR report has been appended .
The full report is accessible as a PDF document ( 131kB . )
If you do n't have the time to read all of the text below , check at least the graph .
" There is a growing feeling that the loss of family can now be measured directly in poor achievement at school , unemployment , bankruptcy , domestic violence , homelessness and suicide . "
" It is in the best long term interests of the children and both parents that payments are maintained for as long as possible .
Short term gain for the custodial parent becomes long term pain for the children and the non-custodial parent in the longer term .
After only five years the financial burden becomes too great , and many non-custodial parents are forced to look at other financial and " life " options .
Many non-custodial men are forced to live in cheap accommodation ( or move back in with often pensioner parents ) , are compelled to leave paid employment , forced into bankruptcy , lose contact with their children , lose any prospect of a comfortable retirement and a growing number ultimately commit suicide .
Many innocent men do not survive this draconian system . " "
The recent Men and Family Relationships conference conducted by the Federal Attorney General in Canberra ( June 9 - 11 , 1998 ) suggested the need for marital counselling before family breakdown , and recognised the " situational " nature of domestic violence , which was non -gender specific .
Non-custodial parents are plunged into emotional turmoil following family breakdown .
Government services must be put in place to support " non-custodial " parents .
It is hoped that this type of service would reduce the suicide rate among non-custodial men . "
SUICIDE IN AUSTRALIA
For some the only solution to family breakdown is suicide .
The number of divorced men choosing suicide as the means of ending their heartache , pain and suffering has increased since the introduction of the Child Support Scheme .
This is supported by the ABS Suicides Australia 1982 - 1992 , Pub No 3309.0 .

[ The callousness of society towards men is quite well reflected in the " Not Stated " column .
We do n't even care enough about men who committed suicide to determine their marital status as often as we do with women when they committed suicide .
It would make an interesting study to determine why that happened , although , to be objective about it , it did n't happen as often anymore from 1887 on .
Did someone suddenly develop a conscience ?
The following graph was constructed from the data in the preceding table .
 WHS ]
See also the poster Save the Males " In analysing suicide by marital status i.e. whether persons were married , divorced , widowed or never married , only the population over the age of 15 years was included .
Of the four marital status categories , divorced persons had the highest average crude suicide rate over the period 1982 - 1992 with 34 deaths per 100,000 of divorced mean population .
Divorced females had a higher suicide rate than females in any other marital status category with 18 deaths per 100,000 of the divorced female mean population during the reference period .
By comparison , divorced males had an average crude suicide rate of 54 deaths per 100,000 of the divorced male mean population .
The highest proportion of suicide deaths for both divorced males and females occurred in the 35 - 44 years age group with 32 per cent and 31 per cent of total suicides for divorced males and females respectively .
Persons who had never married had the next highest rate of suicide for the reference period with 21 suicides per 100,000 of the mean population .
The average crude suicide rate for males who had never married was 32 deaths per 100,000 of the male never married mean population , while the female rate in the same category was 8 deaths per 100,000 of the female never married mean population . "
" The highest proportion of suicide deaths for both males and females who had never married occurred in the 15 - 24 years age group .
Forty five per cent of both male and female suicides in the never married category occurred in this age group .
This age group also represents the highest proportion of never married persons .
The proportion of the never married population in the 15 - 24 years age group has increased over the reference period .
In 1992 the median age for males to marry was 26.9 years while for females the median age was 24.7 years .
By comparison the 1982 median ages at which males and females married were 24.6 and 22.4 years of age respectively .
There were 5 female suicide deaths per 100,000 of the female never married mid-year population in the 15 - 24 years age group for the period 1982 to 1992 , compared with 24 male suicide deaths per 100,000 of the mid-year population in this age group over the same period .
By contrast the age - specific death rate in the 25 years and over age group for the period was 13 female suicide deaths per 100,000 of the female never married mid-year population and 46 male suicide deaths per 100,000 of the male never married mid-year population .
The widowed population had an average crude suicide rate of 20 deaths per 100,000 of the widowed mean population .
The male suicide rate for this marital status category was the highest for males in any category with 56 deaths per 100,000 of the widowed male mean population .
Widowed females recorded a suicide rate of 11 deaths per 100,000 of that mean population .
The highest proportion of suicides in the widowed category are in the older population .
Males most at risk appear to be in the 75 and over age group which contributed 40 per cent of the total widowed male suicides .
Females in the 65 - 74 years age group had the highest proportion ( 35 per cent ) of widowed female suicides . "
" The pain of separation ( and divorce ) from your partner is clearly reflected in the suicide statistics for both widowed and divorced persons .
Divorced males are also forced to endure the pain of separation from their children ( 92 % of men do not get custody of their children ) , on top of the pain of separation from their partner .
It is therefore not surprising that divorced men suicide 3 times more frequently than divorced women .
Further study of the " never married " and " married " categories may reveal further evidence of the effects of " Family Law " and the " Child Support Scheme . "
There were 143,800 " never married " Lone Mothers with dependent children included in the ABS Family Characteristics study ( Pub No 4442.0 ) .
If some of these pregnancies were planned by the mother to take advantage of social welfare and child support payments , then some of the " male youth suicide problem " may also be a " Family Law " and " Child Support " problem .
Young males suicide at a rate of 24 male deaths per 100,000 of the mid-year population in this age group ( 15 - 24 years ) , while young females suicide at a rate of 5 female deaths per 100,000 of the female never married mid-year population in this age group .
Young males suicide 4.8 times more frequently than young females .
The suicide rates for married people clearly reflect the desirability of marriage for both males and females .
When do suicides in marriage occur ?
Is it the impending marriage breakdown which brings on suicide for both male and female , or are there other factors ?
More research is needed .
" Further data on suicide rates for the period 1993 to 1996 are available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for their minimum charge of $ 100 .
Unfortunately , voluntary organisations like the Lone Fathers Association of Australia Incorporated find it very difficult to allocate $ 100 of their scarce resources to obtain the more recent , but as yet uncompiled , data . "
[ The situation is much the same in Canada .
There is absolute no funding for non-custodial fathers and virtually none for parenting rights groups catering to non-custodial parents of either sex .
However , consider that the federal government made an extra $ 250,000 available to " women 's " rights groups to allow them to do a study on domestic violence that could be used to demonstrate the overwhelming need for the right of custodial mothers to have freedom of movement .
That study was prepared in time for the hearings of the Joint Senate House of Commons Committee on the Review of Child Custody and Access .
-- WHS ]
Many men are paying a heavy personal and family price for the " feminist " movement .
Men appear to be more loyal to their marriage vows , and are more distraught after marriage breakdown .
Many women go through a grieving process while they are secretly planning the marriage breakdown , and it often takes men by surprise .
Women now feel more empowered to pursue a more egocentric lifestyle without the encumbrance of the now unwanted husband .
Freedom for liberated women by their choice is one thing , rewarding them with a favourable property settlement , custody of the children , significant Government welfare support and child support payments is an entirely different matter . "
[ However , to be a single mother and a successful parent is no easy task .
In all of this acrimony between government - sponsored , anti-family interest groups and non-custodial parents , although they are often mentioned , the welfare of the children is often totally ignored .
We should always keep in mind a picture of a society in which today 's children will be tomorrow 's adult citizens .
Father - absence hampers them in achieving their full capabilities ( we have more than enough evidence to support that ) and thus on average makes them less than fully functioning in every imaginable way .
To deprive children of their fathers ( or their mothers for that matter ) is to impose a big handicap on them .
That handicap will make itself felt for as long as they live .
That then means that all of society will have to bear the consequences of that handicap , now and in the future .
The consequences are lower productivity and higher crime rates .
Nobody in the next generation will thank this one for producing so many fatherless children .
To be a good parent is a great responsibility and a difficult obligation .
It is hard for a set of two parents to be successful in that duty and far more difficult for just one parent who can't possibly be successful in filling two different pairs of boots .
Not one single parent can be completely successful in filling the role of both , mother and father .
Far too often it is that women who tried so hard to " have it all " and therefore expelled the fathers from their thoughts , families and the lives of their children find that they " have to do it all " and are not up to the task .
-- WHS ( See also The Impact of Fatherlessness on our Children ) ]
" The current financial incentives offered by the welfare system through sole parent pensions , combined with the " guaranteed " child support payments , are contributing directly to family breakdown , and consequent suicide rates . "

Child Support Agency
A Community Awareness Project
PIR INDEPENDENT RESEARCH GROUP
[ Australia ] September 2004
The full PIR report ( 24 pages , 192 kB PDF file ) is available at the PIR website and at the website of Fathers for Life .
The PIR asks that the report receive wide distribution .
[ Malcolm Mathias stated in 1990 , in a widely ignored report , that , ]
After only five years the financial burden [ of child support ] becomes too great , and many non-custodial parents are forced to look at other financial and " life " options .
Many non-custodial men are forced to live in cheap accommodation ( or move back in with often pensioner parents ) , are compelled to leave paid employment , forced into bankruptcy , lose contact with their children , lose any prospect of a comfortable retirement and a growing number ultimately commit suicide .
( p. 9 ) A FURTHER SIGNIFICANT ISSUE  SUICIDE / DEATH RATES AMONG CSA CLIENTELE :
In the course of our investigation , PIR has become aware that fathers and family law reform groups have consistently reported over many years that relationship breakdown and the resultant involvement of the Child Support Agency is a major contributory factor to the suicide or death from stress related illness of paying parents .
It has been claimed that at least three clients of the Child Support Agency suicide each day .
The three a day figure is arrived at by deducting those who are too young or too old to be likely clients of the Agency from the overall suicide figures and then taking 70 % of the remainder in the prime divorce age range as likely to be clients .
Professor Pierre Baume from the Centre for Suicide Prevention , Griffith University had previously found that 70 % of adult male suicides were preceded by a relationship breakdown .
Some groups claim that the mortality rate of child support payers is likely to be higher than the suicide figures alone suggest ; with for example the divorce age group being the only age group showing an increase in fatal car accidents and it also being an age group with significant health issues .
The CSA has repeatedly refused to attend the inquests of child support payers , claiming confidentiality .
Despite ongoing requests from a number of quarters , the Agency itself , and the politicians responsible for it , have consistently refused to release any data on these deaths until recently .
After the installation of a new computer system CSA claims it is now able to supply the relevant data .
p. 16 Researcher and economist John Coochey said  the CSA has reported that 6.1 % of terminating cases do so because of the death of either the payer or payee parent .
This is more than double the rate within that cohort of the general population .
Across the life of the scheme CSA calculated that 22,765 cases have terminated because of the death of a parent .
Assuming the 6.1 % figure is consistent since the beginning of the scheme this means that of the 68,244 cases terminated during 2002 / 03 , 4162 did so as a result of the death of one of the parents .
These figures are not as precise as I would like , but there can be little doubt that the very high death rate amongst CSA clients is due to the high suicide rate among paying parents . 
Suicide rates : Men and Women Aged 20 +

In four yearly increments , the rapid rise in male suicides since the introduction of the Family Law Act in 1975 and the CSA in the late 1980s is clearly evident :
Source : ABS / Australian Institute of Health and Welfare p. 17
The chart below , based on the same data , also helps to illustrate the rapid rise in suicide levels since the introduction of the Child Support Agency for those aged over 20 .
With youth suicides static or decreasing , all this increase has been driven by men in the divorce age bracket .
Dr Robert Kelso , a public sector ethics consultant summed up the situation as follows :
 It would appear the senior officers of the Agency have not fully informed successive ministers as to the keeping of records on the deaths .
Clearly there has been no public policy response to these deaths .
There has been no critical incident team to deal with the trauma to parents , children and extended family .
There also appears to be no policy mechanism in place to prevent the taxpayer from having to carry the burden of cost other than the aggressive and ham - fisted approach at making claims against the dead persons estate .
This is just another example of a refusal by the government to admit the full costs and liabilities of operating this scheme .
It has clearly never paid for itself in an economically rational way . p. 18 Alby Schultz , MP for Hume :  This anti-male culture is contributing to the destruction of careers , mental health problems and it would appear to national male suicide rates .
The system is not fair , not just and certainly not equitable between men and women .
It is demonstrably wrong to have a system in place under which in some instances a man must pay $ 2100 a month for his three children plus support himself and his new partner .
 As if the loss of all things materialistic and his children was not enough he is now being prevented from embarking on a new life because of these unrealistic expectations from the Child Support Agency ,  Mr Schultz said .
 The CSA must be dismantled and reconstructed .
The system as it is being administered is not fair , it is unjust and it is inequitable .
It is obvious there is discrimination and a mindset against men , to the point where it is really disturbing . " p. 22

How To Start An Online Store – Your 3 Main Shopping Cart Options
First off , I want to dispel the misconception that you need to spend thousands of dollars to put up a good looking ecommerce website .
For example , there are many fully featured open source shopping cart software packages out there that are completely free .
In fact , if you are comfortable with a computer , you can launch a fully featured shopping cart for less than 5 dollars per month .
Incidentally , this is the exact route my wife and I took to start our ecommerce store .
Click here to check out my 7 figure online store which is built on FREE software
Because I was on a major budget early on , I ran my online store on a free open source platform and spent only $ 5 / month for the first 2 years .
( I ’ll show you how to do this later on in this post ) .
Today , this store generates over 7 figures per year and I ’m still on the exact same free platform that I started with .
Anyway , my point is that none of the solutions that I will be recommending to you today will cost very much money .
And there are 7 , 8 and 9 figure businesses running on these platforms today .
Do I have your attention yet ?
Ok , here are your 3 main options .
Free Open Source Shopping Cart –
With this option , the source code for your shopping cart is provided to you at no cost but you must host it yourself on a computer server that you manage .
This is by far the cheapest solution available but requires some work on your part to maintain .
Regardless , you do not need to know how to code but it does help to have some technical knowledge .

You literally do n’t need to worry about anything in regards to keeping your website up and running .

Hybrid Fully Hosted Shopping Cart –
If you already run a website and want to add ecommerce functionality to it , then a hybrid solution like Ecwid or BigCommerce might be the right solution for you .
Option # 1 : Use An Open Source Shopping Cart
Open source software is software that is maintained by a small group or community and the beauty is that anyone can use it for free !
Linux is probably the most famous example and there are many open source shopping carts available that you can download at zero cost !
The main advantage with an open source shopping cart is that you are n’t tied down to a specific company or service provider .
You can take your store wherever you want and you pay absolutely nothing .
Going with an open source platform is a lot like owning an unlocked cell phone .
You are free to use any carrier that you want but you own the phone and it is free .
The other huge benefit is that you are in 100 % control of the source code ( ie , you own the phone and all the tech ) .
As a result , if you need to add special functionality that is very specific to your shop , you can either implement it yourself or hire a developer .
In other words , going open source means that you are the boss .
No one will be able to change the terms and conditions .
No one will be able to kick you off or raise prices on you .
Over the years , I ’ve played around with many open source shopping carts including WooCommerce , Open Cart , Prestashop and Magento but my favorite one by far is WooCommerce .
Not only is it easy to use , stable and built on top of the # 1 blogging platform in the world , but it has also has a great developer community as well .
Did I also mention that it ’s free : ) ?
WooCommerce
WooCommerce is the most widely used shopping cart in the world and boasts the largest 3rd party developer ecosystem of any ecommerce platform .
The best part about WooCommerce is that it runs on top of the world ’s most popular content management system , WordPress .
If you already have a WordPress blog and you want to add ecommerce functionality to it , then going with WooCommerce is a no brainer .
In this day and age , content marketing with a blog is par for the course .
As a result , it makes sense to integrate your blog and your ecommerce store together on the same platform .
The only downside to running a shopping cart on top of WordPress is that WordPress was not designed for ecommerce out of the box .
As a result , WooCommerce and other ecommerce plugins will tend to run a little slower unless they are optimized .
But on the flip side , there are thousands of free plugins out there that will speed up and add extra functionality to your online store .
Recently , my 9 and 11 year old kids started an ecommerce store selling entrepreneurship t- shirts online with WooCommerce .
And if a 9 and an 11 year old can launch an online business , then so can you : )
My kids used their own money to start this business and spent less than $ 3 from start to finish .
Click here to check it out !
Editor ’s Note :
If you want to read the the entire backstory about my kid ’s store and their marketing plan , check out my post on How To Start A T - Shirt Business For Under $ 3
Right now , WooCommerce is one of the easiest shopping carts to install and get running right away .
Why ?
It ’s because most if not all webhosts offer a one click installer .
You pretty much just have to click one button and voila , you are ready to go .
In fact , I put together a quick 5 minute video tutorial that shows exactly how to get started with WooCommerce from complete scratch for less than $ 3 .
If you can follow the directions in the video below , then you are tech savvy enough to use a free open source shopping cart !
WooCommerce Install Video
Note :
The instructions in this video will teach you how to setup a fully functional online store on Bluehost , a web host that I recommend for new shop owners .
I also negotiated a discount off of the regular price of Bluehost for MyWifeQuitHerJob.com readers ( Only $ 2.95 / month ) .
You can redeem the discount by clicking here or any Bluehost link on my blog .
OpenCart
OpenCart is my second favorite open source shopping cart that is fast , easy to use and has a very modern looking feel to it .
What I like about OpenCart is the backend administration interface which is simple and intuitive .
In addition , there are many companies and independent developers that are very active in developing website templates , themes and plugins .
The downside to OpenCart is that if you need additional functionality that OpenCart does n’t offer out of the box , you have to purchase and install your own plugins .
Also , because OpenCart is n’t nearly as popular as WooCommerce , there is far less developer support and free plugin availability .
But overall , the out of the box features should be more than adequate for most users and the cart is lightning fast .
Here ’s a quick video that will walk you through the installation process .
The Downside Of Using An Open Source Platform
The main downside of using an open source platform is that you are the boss and being in control of your own platform is a double edged sword .
For example , you have to manage your own server .
You have to make sure your site does n’t go down .
You must keep your shopping cart up to date .
And if anything goes wrong , you are responsible for finding the solution .
In other words , you have to be resourceful .
You have to be a good problem solver .
Because eventually , something will go wrong .
Over the years , I ’ve come to realize that using an open source ecommerce solution and self - hosting may not be the right solution for everyone .
Some people just do n’t feel comfortable installing or tweaking their own website let alone modifying an open source shopping cart .
One time , I tried to help a coworker of mine launch her online store using OpenCart .
Unfortunately , she did n’t possess the basic knowledge to even make simple edits to her store and had to ask for help for every little change .
Ultimately , I had her go with a fully hosted solution because of the added support .
While open source shopping carts are free , flexible and powerful , you have to decide whether your time is better utilized on marketing and sales as opposed to website management .
Option # 2 : Use A Fully Hosted Shopping Cart
If you have the budget and you do n’t want to deal with the hassle of managing your website , then it often makes sense to pay a company to run your shopping cart for you .
And a fully hosted shopping cart platform like Shopify or BigCommerce basically does everything .
They manage your shopping cart
They provide technical support
They make it extremely easy to get started
In other words , you are paying for convenience .
While I usually advise that everyone who is interested in opening an online store give open source a try and host their own website , some people require a little extra hand holding in order to get started with their online business .
As a result , it makes sense for certain entrepreneurs to go with a fully hosted shopping cart for peace of mind .
Some of you do n’t want to go through the trouble of setting everything up and want everything to just work out of the box .
Some of you would rather focus on marketing and sales rather than tinker with your website .
In my experience , 85 % of you should probably pay the extra money and go with a fully hosted platform unless you are comfortable with technology .
In fact , there are many advantages of going with a fully hosted ecommerce platform that may not be too obvious right off the bat .
Below are some advantages that immediately come to mind
You never have to worry about getting hacked .
During the early stages of my online store , I got hacked a few times and it took me awhile to put safeguards into place .
If you never want to deal with site security , then go with a fully hosted cart

You never have to worry about server downtime .
When you host your own site , sometimes you can make an edit and screw things up .
Sometimes your server goes down and you have to find out what happened .
Early on with my store , my site used to crash from time to time and it was very stressful

Early on with my store , my site used to crash from time to time and it was very stressful Backups are usually automated .
I remember losing all of my data once and it was n’t pretty .
If you do n’t want to worry about backing up your data , then go with a fully hosted platform

If you do n’t want to worry about backing up your data , then go with a fully hosted platform
You have someone there to help .
Going the open source route can be a lonely endeavor .
Basically , you must be a self - learner and know how to use the forums effectively .
But with a fully hosted cart , you can usually get someone on the phone within a few minutes .
Recommended Fully Hosted Platforms
I ’ve spent a lot of time these past few years test driving fully hosted shopping carts and I ’ve found that both Shopify and BigCommerce offer an awesome hosted shopping cart solution for a low monthly fee .
The number one concern most of you probably have is whether you ’ll be able to design a good looking website without hiring a designer .
And I ’m happy to say that both BigCommerce and Shopify make it super easy to create a professional looking site .
BigCommerce for example offers an intuitive drag and drop interface where you can shuffle things around with your store at the click of a button .
Both Shopify and BigCommerce also offer a pretty good library of standard templates for you to start out with .
All in all , you can throw up a decent looking store within a matter of minutes without knowing a lick of HTML .
Their back end features and tracking are also top notch and there ’s built in support for many popular 3rd party apps and integrations to your favorite marketing tools and social media sites like Facebook and Pinterest .
That being said , both Shopify and BigCommerce each have their own pros and cons .
If you are trying to decide between the two , I wrote a very detailed comparison that you can check out below .
Shopify Vs BigCommerce Review – An Honest Comparison Of Two Great Shopping Carts
The Downside Of Using A Fully Hosted Platform
All of the benefits of a fully hosted platform come at an increased cost and you sacrifice some amount of control over your site .
For example , both Shopify and BigCommerce have raised their prices over the years and are constantly changing their policies .
If you want to sell anything remotely controversial like hemp related products , some fully hosted platforms will shut you down .
Recently , a friend of mine got kicked off of Shopify for selling CBD products .
The costs of a fully hosted platform can quickly add up as well and you ca n’t judge the overall cost based on the base price alone .
For example , many of Shopify ’s plugins carry a monthly fee that must be factored into the equation .
To give you a rough idea , my wife and I pay just $ 100 a month to host our 7 figure ecommerce store along with 6 other websites on the same webhost .
If we went with Shopify or BigCommerce , we would easily be paying $ 500 or more for the exact same features .
Once again , if you are willing to put in the work and learn the ropes , then hosting your website yourself is almost always the most flexible and economical choice .
But if you want to skip the early headaches and just start selling , then fully hosted could be for you .
Option # 3 : Use A Hybrid Shopping Cart
If you want to add shopping cart functionality to your existing website WITHOUT breaking or changing anything , then a hybrid solution like Ecwid or BigCommerce might be your best bet .
A hybrid shopping cart is exactly how it sounds .
A company like Ecwid or BigCommerce hosts the ecommerce portion of your website on their servers and you simply add buy buttons or a small piece of code to your existing site .
This solution offers 3 main advantages
You can keep your website as is without having to change or migrate platforms
without having to change or migrate platforms
The ecommerce portion of your website will not bog down or slow down your site
of your website will not bog down or slow down your site
You get a fully featured shopping cart that can take transactions online
If you are currently running a WordPress blog and you do n’t want to deal with an ecommerce plugin that could slow down your site , then BigCommerce has an amazing offering that seamlessly integrates a fully hosted shopping cart to your existing blog .
You get the best of both worlds .
You can continue to use WordPress as your main blogging platform .
And BigCommerce will run your shopping cart on the exact same domain which is ideal for SEO !
You ’ve Given Me Too Many Choices .
What Should I Choose ?
Unfortunately , only you can answer that question .
I ’ve already narrowed down the field from hundreds to just a handful of shopping carts for you .
Most if not all of these shopping carts can provide you with a free test drive of the front and back end of the storefront as well .
Do your own due diligence and run through the features of each cart to determine what you need .
I would naturally start with one of the open source shopping cart options that I ’ve recommended because they are free .
In addition , you have full control over the source code of your shopping cart and can add new features at any time .
WooCommerce , the open source shopping cart I recommend , has a strong developer community that is constantly adding new plugins and additional functionality for free .
If coding or installation is way over your head , then I would then look at some of the paid options that I mentioned above like Shopify and BigCommerce .
Again , keep in mind that once you choose a shopping cart , it is extremely hard to migrate to another platform .
Plus , the fees with respect to fully hosted solutions may seem small at first but substantially increase once your store kicks into high gear .
Editor ’s Note : I ’m often asked about Wix , Squarespace , Weebly and other super cheap fully hosted shopping cart solutions .
While these platforms are ok for a very basic shop , they lack extensibility and integration to important and crucial 3rd party services .
As a result , you will outgrow these cheap services quickly as your store grows .
To sum things up , if you do n’t want to deal with any website management and want to focus on selling your products , then go with either Big Commerce or Shopify .
Here ’s a quick comparison table .
Shopify
Larger design template selection
More 3rd party developer support
Larger 3rd party app ecosystem
Larger installed base
Better for dropshipping
More flexible product organization scheme Try It For Free
Big Commerce
Superior feature set out of the box
Less expensive
Better product options support
Better discounting features
Better international support
Better analytics Receive 1 Month Free and 10 % off Your First Year
If you are willing to learn how to manage your own site and be in full control , then consider using WooCommerce which is free .
What Do I Use ?
Currently I ’m on OSCommerce which is an open source shopping cart that I chose in 2007 when there were very few options .
Heck , back then my only fully hosted option was Yahoo Merchant Solutions : )
Even though I would not advise anyone use OsCommerce today , my trusty open source shopping cart powers a 7 figure ecommerce business and is equally as powerful as a fully hosted platform like Shopify or BigCommerce .
If I were to do it all over again , I would probably go with WooCommerce .
If I was n’t around to manage my cart , and my wife was the only person running our store , I ’d probably go with Shopify or BigCommerce .
Overall , you have to decide where you want to spend your time and whether the cost savings and control are worth it .
Good luck !

TEGUCIGALPA , Honduras ( CNN ) --
Thousands of protesters demanding the return to power of ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya pushed through riot police at Tegucigalpa 's airport and surrounded the terminal Saturday , but there were no reports of violence .
Ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya appears Tuesday at the U.N. General Assembly .
more photos »
The airport continued to operate , CNN Correspondent Karl Penhaul reported .
In Washington , the Organization of American States held an emergency meeting Saturday evening to discuss expelling Honduras from the 35 - nation hemispheric organization .
The OAS had given Honduras ' new leaders until Saturday to reinstate Zelaya or be ousted from the organization .
Zelaya , who was removed from power in a June 28 military - led coup , arrived at the emergency OAS session at 7 p.m .
OAS Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza traveled to Honduras on Friday to talk with the nation 's new leaders about the ultimatum .
He said at Saturday night 's meeting that he was told Zelaya would not be returned to power .
Insulza recommended that Honduras be suspended , and the session went into recess so delegates could discuss the matter privately .
A vote was expected later Saturday night .
Zelaya has said he will return Sunday with presidents of other OAS member countries , despite Micheletti's vow to have him arrested if he does so .
The Canadian delegate to the OAS meeting recommended Saturday night that Zelaya not return immediately because of the danger in which he could find himself .
Honduran officials have said the Central American nation is prepared to withdraw from the organization rather than reinstate Zelaya .
" If the Organization of American States does n't deem Honduras worthy of membership of the Organization of American States , then Honduras would renounce with immediate effect the inter-American charter , " said Deputy Foreign Minister Marta Lorena Alvarado .
Vice Chancellor Martha Lorena de Casco agreed , calling OAS a political organization rather than a tribunal of justice .
The OAS comprises 35 nations from North , Central and South America and the Caribbean and , according to its Web site , was formed to cooperate on shared interests and to promote democratic ideals .
Honduran lawmakers installed congressional leader Roberto Micheletti as interim president hours after Zelaya 's ouster .
That sparked international condemnation .
On Friday , thousands of Micheletti supporters assembled in front of the presidential residence in Tegucigalpa , where the provisional president praised the armed forces .
" We must tell the world that there was no coup d'etat here , " he said , his voice hoarse .
" It was n't a coup !
It was n't a coup ! "
He promised that the nation would revert to a democracy -- but did not say when .
" Here , in front of Honduras and the entire world , I guarantee we will have free elections , as soon as we decide when , " he said .
Prior to Zelaya 's overthrow , presidential elections were scheduled for November .
Micheletti has promised not to run for president .
Despite the upheaval , a compromise might be possible , said Jennifer McCoy , head of the Carter Center 's Americas Program .
" The options are that neither side backs down and that President Zelaya shows up tomorrow and the police are there waiting to arrest him . "
If Zelaya returns accompanied by international figures , the result would be " awkward , " she said .
Or the two sides could negotiate a further delay to give them more time to find a solution .
Finally , she added , there could be " some kind of compromise , including mutual guarantees . "
One such scenario would be Zelaya 's promise not to pursue legal action against the coup plotters in exchange for their agreement to step aside and not to pursue his Cabinet ministers who are in hiding .
The situation in Honduras remained tense , and Amnesty International accused the new government Friday of intimidating media workers .
" Recent reports suggest that journalists who have published news stories on the crisis or covering the issue of protests and scores of detentions have been intimidated , " it said .
" Prosecutors also have reported threats on account of their attempts to verify human rights abuses during protests . "
At the center of the dispute was a referendum that Zelaya had vowed to carry out June 28 even after the country 's Supreme Court and congress declared it would be illegal .
The nonbinding referendum could have allowed the creation of a constitutional assembly to modify the country 's charter .
Opponents accused Zelaya of having sought to rewrite the constitution to allow him to run for re-election .
Zelaya denied that was his intent .
But international support for the new government has been virtually nonexistent .
On Thursday , the European Union announced that all its ambassadors had left Honduras .
Also Thursday , the U.S. State Department said it was suspending some aid programs to the country .
Earlier , the U.S. military , which has trained Honduran forces for years , postponed some planned exercises with the Honduran military until the situation in the country settles down .
Zelaya narrowly won the presidency in 2005 with 49.8 percent of the vote to 46.1 percent for Porfirio " Pepe " Lobo .
After 18 years of nearly uninterrupted military rule , Honduras returned to civilian control in 1981 .
Since then , the military has not seemed interested in holding power in the nation of more than 7 million people , about 70 percent of whom live in poverty .

Military interventions were once common in Latin America , but civilian governments have held sway since the 1980s .
Before Sunday , the only other barracks revolt this decade was the unsuccessful 2002 coup attempt against Chavez , when the military displaced him but backed down days later and allowed his reinstatement .

Where are you from ?
IP Geolocation Finding the IP address Page 1 of 2 Knowing where a website visitor is located is vital if you hope to have a chance to provide information that is geographically relevant .
The simplest solution is to use IP geolocation .
In the case of I Programmer , for our book review section and articles such as this one where we indicate relevant book titles , we want to pinpoint a user 's location so that the best Amazon locale can be used to retrieve book pricing details in the correct currency .
One obvious solution would be to ask the user but , guess what , users really do n't like to be asked things .
Indeed if confronted by a pop-up window demanding that they divulge where they are , many visitors might simply go away without ever finding out if a site offers anything useful .
For some reason most users are paranoid about revealing any information , no matter how innocent and harmless even if it could be beneficial .
So , we need an automatic way to determine with reasonable accuracy where the user is .
We also need a facility to override the choice - users for some reason are always pleased to correct personal data that you have wrong even if they wo n't supply it in the first place !
Using MaxMind's GeoLite
In principle , all we need to do the job is a big table mapping IP address to location .
Sadly there is n't a standard 100 % certified IP to location table .
As a result a number of companies have put in a lot of effort and created exactly such tables and of course sell them and / or their services .
One such company is MaxMind which offers a range of location services including the free GeoLite Country .
This is a downloadable database complete with access software .
There is an upgrade to a paid service which increases the accuracy from 99.5 % to 99.8 % and throws in additional features .
The free version is certainly enough to prove the worth of the idea .
If you need to locate your users to an individual city then there is also GeoLite City and its corresponding paid - for full version .
The first thing to do is to download ( about 700 KB at the moment ) the GeoLite Country Binary Format , GeoIPdata.gz , from the MaxMind website http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecountry
This takes the form of a .gz compressed file and you need to decompress this , use 7 - Zip if you do n't already have a decompression utility .
The resulting file , GeoIP.dat , is currently around 1 M byte and this has to be stored somewhere accessible on your web server .
As I 'm working with a Joomla PHP based website I stored it in : / includes / GeoLite
To work with it from PHP you also need to download geoip.inc which contains the code needed to access the database .
This also needs to be stored on the server and the most sensible location is in the same directory as the database , i.e. in my case , / includes / GeoLite .
Making it work
Time to start work on the actual program , which could n't be easier .
Create a new PHP file called findRegion .
php - again you might as well store it in the same directory .
So now you should have a / includes / GeoLite directory containing : GeoIP.dat
geoip.inc
findRegion.php
The API has facilities to specify the country in different ways , but the country code ( e.g. " GB " , " US " , " FR " , etc. ) is one easy option .
If you would like to know what the country codes are then see : ISO 3166 - 1 alpha - 2 .
Instead of having to determine the country of the client every time they visit the site we are going to set a cookie so that any other script in PHP or Javascript can use the region information .
The user is also given a menu option to change the region and reset the cookie to a new value .
Likewise , if it already exists we do n't want to change it .
We start off by checking that the cookie called Region exists .
If it does , the job is nearly done and we simply set the $ Region variable so that we can refresh the cookie at the end of the program by recreating it .
<?
php
if ( isset ( $_COOKIE [' Region ' ] ) )
{
$ Region = $ _COOKIE [ ' Region ' ] ;
}
else
Only if the cookie is n't set do we do the actions in the else part of the if , so this makes the whole thing efficient .
To make use of the GeoLite code we have to load the include file : {
$ GeoPath=JPATH_BASE .DS.' includes '.
DS .' GeoLite ' .
DS ;
include ( $GeoPath.'geoip.inc ' ) ;
As I Programmer is a Joomla website , the standard variables JPATH_BASE and DS have been used to provide the start of the URL and the directory separator .
If you 're not using Joomla simply build the path in a way that works for you , e.g. as simple as : $ GeoPath= ' / includes / GeoLite / ' ; < ASIN:0596007035 > < ASIN:0321518667 > < ASIN:1449304729 > < ASIN:0321733452 > < ASIN:143022925X >
Norton was renowned back in the days when I started using personal computers for resource hungry security applications that could slow down computer systems significantly .
I decided to skip Norton products for my whole life like many other users at that time .
There are still many tech savvy users who avoid Norton antivirus and other software programs from Norton because of how they performed ten or more years ago .
Norton software programs have on the other hand received lots of praise from computer magazines and reviewers .
That 's the moment the idea for this review was born .
I wanted to know if Norton antivirus and Norton 360 were as good as the press thought they were or if they were still the heavyweight security suites that would bog down a system noticeably .
I contacted Norton with my proposal and they were all for it .
I quickly received a review copy of Norton 360 and started the test about a month ago .
Norton 360 is Norton 's top of the line product that combines all features of Norton Antivirus , Norton Internet Security and some additional ones exclusive to this version .
Users who install Norton 360 get among other features an antivirus solution that protects against all forms of malware ( including bots , rootkits , viruses , trojans and spyware ) , a software firewall , email protection , web browser protection , identity protection , a file backup solution , secure networking and PC tuneup modules .
This can look like overload to some users but the first surprise awaits during the installation of Norton 360 .
The installation is quick and painless .
A system restart is required after installation of Norton 360 which was not noticeably slower than before .
One point of criticism that has haunted Norton products for years seems to have been taken good care of by the Norton developers .
Both the system start and the system itself do not feel noticeably slower than before ( startup and shutdown time is probably in the region of 1 - 2 additional seconds at the most ) .
That 's great and somewhat unexpected considering the past .
Norton 360 itself runs pretty much automated .
It is a good idea to tweak the settings at least once .
This includes disabling modules that are not needed ( e.g. if you run a firewall you might not want to run another one , same for the backup solution or web browser protection ) .
The purpose of an all - in - one solution like Norton 360 on the other hand is to be the one program that is needed to secure the PC .
Users who only need specific modules might want to consider the two other Norton products Norton Antivirus or Norton Internet Security instead .
The interface of Norton 360 on the other hand could confuse some users as it opens several modules and options in new windows .
It 's not that seldom that two or even three Norton 360 windows are open at the same time .
Uses who are looking for advanced options need to go into the settings of the security software program .
A click on any of the modules in the Settings of Norton 360 will open display advanced configuration options .
No direct help or explanation is offered there which can be problematic if the name of the setting does not explain what they do ( anyone want to guess what Early Load or Sonar Advanced Protection in Automatic Protection under Antivirus do ? ) .
A click on the question mark will open a Windows help file that explains the settings in detail .
It would be more comfortable if at least some explanation was given directly in the menu ( for example by hovering over a name ) .
These settings on the other hand are very detailed .
It is possible to enable some modules that are not enabled by default ( for example Microsoft Office Automatic Scan , Advanced Events Monitoring or enabling Silent Mode ) .
Advanced users should take their time and take a detailed look at the settings provided .
Norton 360 is a security software program that is ideal for users who want an all - in - one protection that requires barely any configuration .
It might on the other hand also be an interesting alternative for uses who like to configure their security software programs as much as possible which is something that Norton 360 offers as well .
The best part ( if you ask me ) is the confirmation that Norton security programs are not slowing down computer systems noticeably anymore .

The Lakers have reached an agreement with Shannon Brown keeping the athletic combo guard in L.A. for two more years .
According to the Los Angeles Times , the deal is worth $ 4.2 million with a player option for the second year .
Brown worked his way into Phil Jackson ’s rotation after coming to L.A. mid-season as a throw - in for a trade invloving Vladimir Radmanovic and Adam Morrison .
Jackson , who prefers bigger guards with a defensive commitment , felt comfortable giving Brown minutes as he quickly took to learning the triangle offense .
Laker fans grew fond of the former Michigan State Spartan as she showed flashes of athletic brilliance and a knack for hitting big shots in the playoffs .
With the news of Brown coming just days after the announced agreement with Ron Artest and Phil Jackson ’s return , all eyes shift towards Lamar Odom .
As it stands now , the Lakers and Odom are not moving closer to a deal .
However , there is little leverage for L.O. as his other options continue to wilt with each new agreement struck by other free agents .
There ’s quite a big discussion about this on Flickr .
Ugh …
So , today I tried browsing to one of my sites , linuxlaboratory.org , and found a 403 “ Forbidden ” error .
Calling support , they said it was a “ billing issue ” .
Well , I pay my bills , and I have n’t received any new credit cards , so I ’m not sure what that ’s about .
Further , they have n’t contacted me in any way shape or form at all in a very long time , and I ’ve had the same email addresses for years now .
Last time they failed to contact me , it was because they were sending all of the mail to “ root@localhost ” on the web server .
What ’s more , the tech support guy , having determined that this was n’t a technical but an administrative problem , transferred me to a sales person who was not there .
I left a message .
That was 3 hours ago .
So I took matters into my own hands and changed the name server records to my webfaction account , and linuxlaboratory .org now points to an old test version of the site that uses Drupal .
It ’s Over Between Us …
Drupal holds the record for the CMS that has run LinuxLaboratory the longest .
Since its launch in 2001 , LinuxLaboratory has used all of the major , and some of the minor open source PHP CMSes .
Drupal gave me something very close to what I wanted , out of the box .
Nowadays , Drupal is even nicer since they redid some of the back end APIs and attracted theme and module developers to the project .
I ’ve even done some coding in Drupal myself , and have to say that it really is a breeze .
But the problem is this : I ’m a consultant , trainer , and author / editor .
I am an experienced system admin , database admin , and infrastructure architect who makes a living solving other peoples ’ problems .
I really ca n’t afford to have something that is super high overhead to maintain running my sites .
With Drupal releasing new versions with major security fixes once per month on average , and no automated update mechanism ( and no built - in automated backup either ) , it becomes pretty cumbersome just to keep it updated .
This is in addition to my experiences trying to do e-commerce with Drupal .
I tried to use one plugin , but soon found myself in dependency hell — a situation I ’m not used to being in unless I ’m on a command line somewhere .
So , out with Drupal .
I know it well and I ’m sure I ’ll find a use for it somewhere in my travels , but not now , and not for this .
Is Django the Future of LinuxLaboratory ?
So I ’m thinking of giving Django another shot .
In fact , I thought I might try something new and interesting .
Maybe I ’ll build my Django app right in front of everyone , so that anyone who is interested can follow along , and so people can give me feedback and tips along the way .
It also lets me share with people who have questions about a feature I ’m implementing or something like that .
For fanboys of < insert technology here > , know this : I ’m a technology whore .
I consume technology like some people consume oxygen .
I love technology , and I get on kicks , and every now and then , a “ kick ” turns into a more permanent part of my tool chest .
Python is one such example .
I ’ve done lots with Python , but have never really made friends with it for web development .
I got a webfaction account specifically because they support Python ( and Django ) .
I ’ve done nothing with it .
Now I think I might .
But not to worry !
I own lots of domains that are sitting idle right now , and I ’m considering doing a Ruby on Rails app for one of them , and I ’m dying to do more with Lua .
There ’s only so much time !
Webfaction Django Users : Advice Hereby Solicited
So if you ’re a webfaction customer using Django , please share your tips with me about the best way to deploy it .
I ’ve used nothing but PHP apps so far , and found that rather than use the one - click installs webfaction provides , it ’s a lot easier to just choose the generic “ CGI / PHP ” app type and install the code myself .
This allows me to , for example , install and update wordpress using SVN .
Is Django a similar story , or does webfaction actually have an auto - upgrade mechanism for this ?
How are you keeping Django up to date ?
Thanks !
Where do the downspouts off of your house ’s gutters flow ?
Â
Do they enter into the city ’s sewer system ?
Â
For many cities , this is a problem .
Â
The city of Portland , Oregon explains :
A large part of Portland has a combined sewer system that carries sewage and stormwater runoff in the same pipes .
When it rains , the combined sewers fill to capacity and some of the stormwater and sewage mixture overflows to the Willamette River .
Downspouts on many homes are connected directly the combined sewer system and roof runoff from those homes contributes to combined sewer overflows ( CSOs ) .
Disconnecting those downspouts reduces the amount of water entering the system and reduces CSOs .
Disconnecting your home ’s downspouts allows roof water to be used for lawn irrigation and filter pollutants , similar to planting a rain garden .
Â
Just one disconnected downspout can redirect thousands of water a year .
Â
Over 58,000 homes have disconnected their downspouts in Portland .
Portland has a Downspout Disconnection Program in which incentives are available for DIYers or the city will do the work for free !
Â
According to the city , the following steps should be followed to safely disconnect your downspouts :
1.Â Observe your property :
Where do your current downspouts flow to ?
Â
If they are not connected to the city sewer system , then they may not need to be disconnected .
What is the slope of your property ?
Downspouts should not be disconnected if the slope of your property is over 10 % .
How much area is available for drainage ?
Â
Disconnected downspouts should discharge water at least six feet from the home ’s basement or two feet from a slab foundation .
Â
You need at least 10 % of the roof area in your yard size to safely absorb the stormwater .
Where are your property lines ?
Â
Your disconnected downspout extension must be at least five feet from your neighbor ’s property and three feet from any public sidewalks .
What kind of access may be affected by the relocation of the water ?
Â
Obviously , you would n’t want your relocated roof water flowing over your driveway , patio , walkway , etc .
Do other hazards exist ?
Â
You need to consider the location of retaining walls , septic systems , etc. in relocating your roof water .
2. Design your disconnection :
You will need the following tools : Â a hacksaw , a drill , pliers or crimpers , a tape measure , and a screwdriver .
Based upon your design , you will need a variety of elbows and extensions to match your gutters .
Be sure to use durable , gutter - grade materials .
Mark the downspouts to be disconnected and lay out the path for the extensions , including obstacles you may need to circumvent .
3.Â Disconnect !
Cut the downspout with a hacksaw about nine inches above where it enters the sewer system .
Plug the standpipe where it enters the sewer system at the cut .
Attach an elbow OVER the downspout to prevent leaking .
You many need to crimp the downspout with needle nose pliers to make it fit inside the elbow .
Measure , cut , and attach extensions OVER the elbow .
Secure the elbows and extensions with sheet metal screws .
An optional splash block at the end of the extension can be used to prevent erosion .
4.Â Maintain your gutters and disconnected downspouts :
Clean gutters at least twice a year ; monitor downspouts and extensions for clogging .
Caulk holes .
Ensure gutters drain into downspouts .
Portland offers discounts on city utility bills if you disconnect your downspouts .
Â

This low maintenance project offers a great solution for reusing stormwater and preventing it from burdening city sewer systems .
Sacramento , Calif .
California has avoided fiscal reality for so long it ’s fitting that the state legislature reverted to subterfuge last week while voting for its third budget deal in nine months .
Part of the latest deal — which depends in equal part on real cuts and accounting gimmicks to close a $ 26 billion gap — was a proposal to raise revenue by allowing new oil drilling off of existing platforms near Santa Barbara .
It was a move that had been endorsed by that county ’s own board of supervisors last year .
But environmentalists and 43 % of voters remain fiercely opposed , according to a new poll by the Public Policy Institute of California .
The measure cleared the State Senate a week ago Friday and moved over to the Assembly .
There Democratic Assembly Speaker Karen Bass admitted she could n’t find enough votes for the oil - drilling lease .
Thanks to the environmental lobby , it mustered only three Democratic votes and was defeated 43 to 28 with nine abstentions .
Then things got weird .
A motion to expunge the vote from the public record was made by Democratic floor leader Alberto Torrico and was approved by voice vote .
It disappeared from the public record as if it had been erased , in an effort to hide their decision from voters .
MTA Board Votes to Approve EIR and Bike Plan
In a decision advocates hailed as a victory for bicyclists in San Francisco , the MTA Board of Directors voted uaninmously this afternoon to approve the EIR and adopt the Bike Plan , legislating 45 of the 56 priority projects , which will add about 34 miles of new bike lanes in the city .
A crowd of bicyclists at the meeting erupted into cheers after the final vote was taken .
It followed nearly four hours of testimony from a diverse group of 200 bicyclists — organized by the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition — who filled an overflow room on the 1st floor of City Hall , and lined up outside the main meeting room on the 4th floor .
A smaller group of people opposed to the 2nd Street bike lanes , as they ’re currently proposed , was successfull in getting 2nd Street taken off the first wave of projects .
The MTA announced that plan would come back in the next round .
The final vote was 5 - 0 , with Directors Tom Nolan and Malcolm Heinicke absent .
" It ’s a historic day for bicycling in San Francisco , " said MTA spokesperson Judson True .
" Adopting the CEQA
findings , approving the Bike Plan , and legislating 45 projects is an incredible accomplishment .
We ’re very proud of the work
that our staff , other city agencies , and the bicycling community has
done .
It has been a long process . "
Mayor Gavin Newsom , the SFBC and MTA staffers were scheduled to attend a press conference and celebration at 3 p.m. on the Polk Street side of City Hall .
We ’re staffing and will post more soon .
Once the standing ovation died down , anticipation among the 6,500 people packed into a Comic - Con convention hall in San Diego was almost electric as they waited for the first words from the silver - haired alchemist of animation , Hayao Miyazaki .
To the opening question from Pixar leading light John Lasseter about how he develops his stories , the white - jacketed , 68 - year - old director replied , “ My process is thinking , thinking and thinking -- thinking about my stories for a long time . ”
Then with an impish smile , he added , “ If you have a better way , please let me know . ”
His answer sparked laughter and affectionate applause , if little revelation , and foreshadowed much of what was to come in Miyazaki ’s ensuing West Coast tour before thousands of fans in the last week of July , a visit that provided rare U.S. exposure for the reclusive Japanese creator of “ My Neighbor Totoro , ” “ Princess Mononoke ” and the Oscar - winning “ Spirited Away . ”
Before a sold - out crowd of 2,000 at UC Berkeley , “ Japanamerica ” author Roland Kelts asked Miyazaki about the perception that “ true evil . . . if it exists , is very hard to pin down in your films . ”

The good - guys - versus - bad - guys formula often falls through the rabbit hole in Miyazaki stories , particularly the ones that suggest a moral philosophy in their portrayals of individuals caught in conflicts between destructive civilization and a mysterious powerful Nature .
Kelts pointed to the wizard father in Miyazaki ’s newest film , “ Ponyo , ” comparing him to Shakespeare ’s Prospero as “ more of a troubled man than an evil one . ”
Miyazaki responded : “ To have a film where there ’s an evil figure and a good person fights against the evil figure and everything becomes a happy ending , that ’s one way to make a film .
But then that means you have to draw , as an animator , the evil figure .
And it ’s not very pleasant to draw evil figures .
So I decided against evil figures in my films . ”
Again , laughter and applause .
Miyazaki , who refused to come to the U.S. to receive his Oscar in 2003 , came this time , a bit reluctantly , to help promote Disney ’s Aug. 14 release of “ Ponyo , ” about a goldfish princess who falls in love with a human boy and strives mightily to become human herself .
Tickets quickly sold out for the man Lasseter has called “ the greatest animation director living today , the greatest director living today . ”
Many American children have spent hours on repeated viewings of “ Totoro ” -- featuring a cat - bus and a forest creature shaped somewhat like a giant pear with fur .
Many settings

Miyazaki ’s settings vary -- a contemporary Japanese seaside town in “ Ponyo , ” a European - type village of the late 19th or early 20th century in “ Castle in the Sky , ” and a post - apocalyptic community clinging to a medieval existence in “ Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind . ”
But all his films share a painterly aesthetic , hand - drawn with nuanced colors and exacting frame composition , to enhance his fantasy worlds that often blend myth , environmental destruction , shape - shifting spirits and complex human characters .
The leading roles belong to independent - minded , resourceful young females , and several films reflect conflicted views of technology , partly embodied in fanciful flying machines seemingly dreamed up by an eccentric genius from the Industrial Revolution .
He has also spawned a growing body of academic analysis .
“ There are more people writing papers on Hayao Miyazaki in the United States than any other Japanese artist that I ’m familiar with , ” said Frederik Schodt , a manga expert and co-translator of the newly published English version of Miyazaki ’s book “ Starting Point . ”
Miyazaki’s “ films are both popular and subversive , especially in regard to conventional gender coding , ” writes Tufts University professor Susan Napier .
While Miyazaki “ bristles ” at being described as the Walt Disney of Japan , Napier finds similarity but also key differences in the animation pioneers .
Both sometimes draw on stories from other cultures , but unlike Disney ’s tendency to imbue the characters with American values , Napier says , Miyazaki creates “ characters that , while retaining certain characteristics linked to Japanese society , are distinctively more independent in thought and action than the group - oriented characteristics traditionally celebrated in Japanese culture . ”

Similarly , Miyazaki himself reflects and stands apart from his society .
His enormous popularity in Japan stems in part from his unsurpassed mastery of animation , a medium embraced by the culture at large and , at its best , regarded as more intellectually ambitious than its American counterpart .
At the same time , in an environment that stresses group harmony , the outspoken director can be sharply critical of others in his field and unafraid of challenging traditional views , whether related to women ’s roles or espoused by the ruling political conservatives .
And if you want to avoid his disfavor , do n’t call his films “ anime . ”
He calls them animation or manga films , saving the term “ anime ” for quickly made products of lesser quality , largely for TV .
One reason for fascination with Miyazaki may be his contradictions .
The director whose films typically end with an uplifting affirmation of humanity suitable for children is the same director who told his Berkeley audience , “ It would be wonderful if I could see the end of civilization during my lifetime . ”
The man who is able to entrance children , and adults , with his animation is the same one who complains about children spending too much time with virtual reality instead of being outdoors in nature .
UC Berkeley honored Miyazaki with the Japan Prize , first given last year to writer Haruki Murakami , for contributions to the understanding of Japan .
Miyazaki provided further fodder for academics in his brief acceptance remarks , which consisted of an extended metaphor about those in the entertainment field needing to insert a pipe down through the sheets of paper full of data and figures that fill our daily lives .
“ We have to start fishing from way down below where there is no paper , ” he said through an interpreter .
“ And the only way that we can really justify our presence and our work is to continue to make this effort to make this hole and go deeper and deeper . ”

He is highly revered in Japan , where the top - grossing films are typically American , except in years when Miyazaki ’s work is showing .
“ Ponyo ” led last year ’s list , grossing about $ 160 million , nearly triple the amount pulled in by the top U.S. film , “ Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull . ”
Limited U.S. audience
And though he ’s also popular in the world at large , his work has seen only limited release and ticket sales in America .
While “ Howl ’s Moving Castle ” grossed $ 230 million internationally , it pulled in only $ 4.7 million in the U.S .
But this time Disney is staging its largest ever Miyazaki debut with “ Ponyo , ” in more than 800 theaters , and has assembled a constellation of talent for the dubbed voices , including Cate Blanchett , Matt Damon , Tina Fey , Cloris Leachman , Liam Neesom , Lily Tomlin and Betty White .
The leading children roles , the goldfish / girl named Ponyo and the boy Sosuke , are voiced by Noah Cyrus ( Miley ’s younger sister ) and Frankie Jonas ( kid brother of the popular singing trio ) .
The dubbing is the only difference from the original , in line with the policy of Miyazaki ’s Studio Ghibli that no cuts or other changes be made for the international market .

But is “ Ponyo ” representative of his work as a whole ?
The G - rated film seems targeted to young kids , with 5 - year - olds as the two leading characters .
GhibliWorld.com , a fan site , notes “ an obvious change ” in “ Ponyo , ” where “ character designs are clean and simple and shadows seem to have disappeared . ”
Asked if he is concerned about American audiences seeing “ Ponyo ” as typical of his work , Miyazaki said in a brief interview , “ What I ’ve been doing in a sort of haphazard way without much thought before , I ’ve tried to clarify in ‘ Ponyo . ’ ” For example , he said , Studio Ghibli returned to sole reliance on pencil drawing in “ Ponyo , ” abandoning limited use of computer graphics in some films to supplement Ghibli ’s trademark cell animation .
He did n’t mention that he did a major part of the drawing himself .
What about those who see deep meaning and mythology in his work ?
“ I do n’t intentionally make deep movies , ” he said .
“ It ’s not that I set out to make films that deal with myths , but as I develop the story , aspects of older stories or myths enter into the story . ”
Nor does he seek inspiration in the contemporary work of others in his field .
“ I do n’t read manga anymore , I do n’t watch movies , I do n’t even watch the animation of my friends these days , ” he said .
When he did watch films , he says in his book , he was “ hardly a high - brow person , ” preferring the Charlie Chaplin film “ Modern Times ” to art - house movies .
He makes films , he says , for Japanese audiences , particularly children , and is happy when audiences abroad also enjoy them .

And if he seemed at times like Coyote Trickster during his visit , he can also be frank and refreshingly honest .
Why did n’t he come for the Oscars in 2003 but came this time , including appearing at a sold - out tribute to him in July at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ?
“ In 2003 , I did n’t want to come to a country that had just started bombing Iraq , ” he said .
“ This time it ’s an order from my producer that I come . ”
He chuckled and added , “ Combined with my friendship for John Lasseter . ”

WASHINGTON , July 14 ( Reuters ) - A sweeping overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system to be announced on Tuesday in the U.S. House of Representatives will include a surtax on millionaires of 5.4 percent , congressional sources said .
The tax rate is higher than the 3 percent surtax lawmakers had been discussing earlier and would be imposed on those making more than $ 1 million a year , the sources said .
The Sound of Music has been found not to be to youngsters ' taste Songs from the musical The Sound of Music have been used to encourage youngsters to go home when youth clubs wrap up for the night .
Activities at the Hilton Community Centre in Inverness are so popular , staff have faced challenges in getting the youths to leave at closing time .
My Favourite Things and The Hills Are Alive have been played in an effort to disperse the groups .
Councillor John Finnie said nursery rhymes were used as a last resort .
Starring Julie Andrews , the 1965 film was a huge hit and later became a sell - out stage production .
More recently , it was the inspiration for BBC One 's song contest How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria ?
' Much appreciated '
However , the music has not been to the taste of youngsters attending clubs at Hilton Youth Club .
Highland councillor Mr Finnie said : " There has been a lot of work which has gone into the facilities at Hilton Community Centre .
" They are very attractive to young people and that is down to the work of volunteers , the council but primarily the excellent work of Hilton Community Centre management committee . "
He said sports , music and computer games sessions were on offer .
But he added : " They are so very much appreciated by the young folk that they are very keen to hang around and do n't want to go home at 10 pm .
" So this is a creative use of music - classical music , musicals and if things get really awkward I understand nursery rhymes will be deployed . "

Nano -ink could replace standard method of manufacturing solar cells
This is one powerful idea that would do away with massive solar panels .
Solar cells could soon be spray painted onto the sides of buildings or rooftops with nanoparticles .
The new nano - ink process could replace the standard method of manufacturing solar cells , which requires high temperatures and is relatively expensive , said Brian Korgel , a chemical engineer with the University of Texas at Austin .
“ The Sun provides a nearly unlimited energy resource , but existing solar energy harvesting technologies are prohibitively expensive and cannot compete with fossil fuels , ” Korgel was quoted by LiveScience as saying .
Also called photovoltaic cells , solar cells convert sunlight directly into electricity and are typically made from silicon , although other materials that are flexible are gaining steam .
Solar panels used to power homes and businesses each consist of 40 or so of these cells , according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory .
Rather than silicon , the inks developed by Korgel ’s team are made up of copper indium gallium selenide ( CIGS ) — sunlight - absorbing nanoparticles that are 10,000 times thinner than a strand of hair .
“ We make a solution of these nanocrystals , and we spray paint them onto a substrate , ” said Matthew Panthani , a doctoral student and graduate research assistant in Korgel ’s lab .
The team envisions printing such inks in a newspaper - like process .
“ We ’d have some sort of flexible substrate , maybe plastic or metal foil , and it would be on a spool and be unrolled .
And the nanocrystals would be sprayed on , ” Panthani told LiveScience .
So far , they have developed solar - cell prototypes that can convert 1 % of the sunlight that hits the cell into electricity .
“ If we get to 10 % , then there ’s real potential for commercialization , ” said Korgel .
The prospect of painting these inks onto a rooftop or building is not far - fetched .
In addition , the inks are semi- transparent , and so could be used to develop windows that double as solar cells .

Fiancee : Killing by officer ' senseless '
Fiancee calls killing by officer ‘ senseless '
She says her boyfriend was leaning on truck as shots were fired
The fiancee of a Kingwood man killed by a Houston police officer disputed his version of events that led to the deadly shooting , saying the officer used unnecessary and excessive force .
“ The shooting was totally senseless , ” said Karen Bennett .
Officer R. Gardiner has said he shot John Barnes in self - defense .
Gardiner , who has worked on the Houston force for seven years , was wearing his security uniform and patrolling the grounds at the Woodland Hills Village Apartments after locking up the pool when the shooting occurred about 10 p.m. Saturday .
The apartment office 's staff declined to say Monday whether Gardiner continues to serve as security officer at the complex .
The Houston Police Department , meanwhile , has given Gardiner three days off , department policy while any police shooting is under review .
According to Houston police investigators , Gardiner happened onto the couple arguing outside their apartment .
Barnes , 39 , a tow truck driver , had lived there about a year with Bennett and her three children , she said .
She said the couple raised their voices , but that he never touched her physically and she never asked for help .
The couple was outside on the front porch as Barnes was preparing to leave in his car parked a few feet away , she said .
“ The officer only asked , ‘ Who lives here ? ' and I said , ‘ I do ' and then he ordered my fiance to lie on the ground , ” she said Monday .
Barnes asked why and refused to do it .
“ I do n't understand why the officer never asked us any more questions about what was going on .
This shooting should not have happened , ” she said .
In the officer 's statement , he reported seeing Barnes ' hands come near the woman 's face when he gave a verbal command , which Barnes ignored .
Bennett said after Barnes refused to lie on the ground , Gardiner tried to pull him down with a neck hold and got into a wrestling match .
Barnes pushed the smaller officer off , she said , and then the officer pulled his Taser and pointed it at Barnes .
Being Tasered would have been dangerous for Barnes , she said , because he has a metal plate embedded in his skull , the result of an accident several years ago .
“ So ( Barnes ) slapped the Taser from the officer 's hand , and it flew about 5 feet under the back of his car , ” she said .
The two men then backed about 10 feet away from each other .
Barnes was leaning against his vehicle with his arms folded , she said , when Gardiner drew his handgun .
“ John said , ‘ What are you going to do , shoot me ? '
The officer did n't say anything , just started firing , ” she said .
5 fatal bullet wounds
She said she was stunned that the officer did n't give any warning or call for backup , and that she was afraid to check on Barnes because the officer seemed shaky and was still waving his pistol .
“ I asked the officer to check ( Barnes ) , and he finally did feel for a pulse , ” she said .
An autopsy ruled Barnes died from five bullet wounds .
In his statement , Gardiner said Barnes grabbed his Taser , threatened to shoot him with it and said , “ You 're dead now , ” before Gardiner fired .
Bennett said she thinks Gardiner fired because he was mad at being unable to take Barnes down .
Gardiner 's attorney , Cindy Ring , has advised him against further comments .
“ But I can assure you that we will have issues with her statements , ” Ring said .
Records show Barnes had a previous conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon against a police officer in Harris County in 1998 .
He paid a fine and received five years of probation and deferred adjudication .
Bennett 's next door neighbor , who did not want his name used , said he has given a statement to detectives .
The neighbor said he saw part of the shooting through the peephole of his front door .
He said his account concurs with Bennett's .
“ There was a struggle , but when the shots were fired , Barnes was standing by his vehicle and not making any aggressive moves .
He was not holding a Taser when the five shots were fired in rapid succession , ” the neighbor said .
He did not see how the Taser got under Barnes ' car .
“ I could see him maybe firing once , but not five times , ” he added .
Houston police 's internal affairs and the district attorney 's office are investigating the shooting .
“ All the facts will come out , ” said Houston Police investigator J.R. Johnston .
“ But right now we cannot comment . ”

Hugo is a regular visitor to Mr Williams ' home A pet cat is being hailed a hero after saving a man from his burning home .
Engineer Andrew Williams was asleep when the fire broke out at his bungalow in Bracknell in Berkshire .
As black smoke filled the property , his neighbour 's cat Hugo came through a cat - flap and raised the alarm by clawing at the father - of - two 's face .
Rescuers said that the fire could have killed Mr Williams if he had not been awoken by Hugo .
A smoke detector had been moved during work on the bungalow .
The fire , which broke out at the family home in Birch Hill at about 0200 BST on 1 August , was caused by an electrical fault .
The fire chief said that I had better buy the cat a big piece of fish because he saved my life
Andrew Williams
Mr Williams had removed a smoke detector from his ceiling while decorating and moved it to a different place .
It only activated after he had been woken up .
He said he then went into " autopilot " , calling the fire service and trying to put out the blaze himself .
Mr Williams , whose wife Sarah was visiting her sister at the time , was treated at the scene after breathing in smoke .
Hugo and his brother Harvey are regular visitors to the cat lover 's home .
Mrs Williams was visiting her sister during the fire Mr Williams said : " I was woken up with Hugo sitting on top of me clawing at my face .
He was trying to wake me up .
" The fire chief said that I had better buy the cat a big piece of fish because he saved my life .
" I 'm just so thankful to that little fella . "
A spokesman for Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue said : " We are delighted that this very fire - aware cat was able to alert the family on this occasion .
" This just highlights the importance of having working smoke detectors inside your home . "

If you are a network professional or an enthusiast prepairing for CCNA / CCNP / CCIE exams , probabaly you understand the true value of the Lab equiment .
It ’s not cheap to get allt eh routers just to pass the exam or play around with networks .
Network Emulation / virtaulization has helped us to achieve this at almost no cost .
The main revolution was brought by Dynamips , which exposes a flexible platform for emulation of wide range of Cisco devices .
The second step was GNS3 .
GNS3 brought the features of dynamipps into the GUI world , making it more easier , faster to virtualize the topologies on the fly with click of a mouse .
The next step that has now made life of of a networking engineer is the portability of virtualized networks .
Thanks to innovators like In2dwok , it ’s now possible to have LIVE CDs for GNS3 which will enable you virtualize your network , just on any PC that exists on the planet .
It ’s based on a small 30 mb linux ( Slitaz ) which is low on resources and heavy on the work , perfect in accordance with virtualization needs .
He has also developed slax based implementation of the Live CD .
Now Live CDs were not enough to save your network configuration and move on to other boxes .
You have to save your dynamips . net files on Local hard disk or use another USB .
So LIVE USB were were also created to extend the portability .
By having a Live USB , you have the freedom to boot from USB directly into a light weighht linux with GNS3 rpre-installed , pre-configured and customized with your topologies .
I use this USB with my vmware and virtualbox and its pretty fast .
The CPU limiter patch actually make life of working with GNS3 even more slick , no longer you have to worry about 100 % CPU utilization .
In Virtualbox , I was able to run four routers with less than 25 % CPU utilization on my dual core notebook .
If you are new to GNS , you can check GNS3 Labs for extensive help .

Continuing my series describing my new combinatorial species library , today we ’ll take a look at the operation of differentiation .
You may remember that the Species type class has an Algebra .
Differential constraint , which , as I previously explained , transitively implies an Algebra .
Ring constraint .
But we have n’t yet talked about the Differential contraint itself , which requires a method differentiate :: Species s => s -> s ( which I will abbreviate using the standard “ prime ” notation ) , which should satisfy
( up to isomorphism ) .
Okay , this is just the normal product rule for differentiation , from calculus — but what on earth could such a thing mean combinatorially ?
There is actually a nice , simple answer : an - structure on the underlying set consists of an - structure on , where is a distinguished element distinct from all the elements of .
To make the connection to data type differentiation , we can also think of as a “ hole ” .
The above diagram illustrates the situation : an - structure on is an - structure on .
And how about the law ?
Does this make combinatorial sense ?
( You may want to stop and think about it before reading on ! )
By definition , an - structure on is an - structure on , which is a pair of an - structure and a - structure on a splitting ( a two - partition ) of .
The distinguished label must end up on one side or the other , so an - structure can arise in one of two ways : it is either an - structure paired with a - structure , or an - structure paired with a - structure , depending on where the ends up .
But this is precisely saying that !
Where does species differentiation show up ?
The most well - known place is in defining the species of lists ( linear orderings ) .
In fact ,
,
that is , the species is the derivative of the species of cycles .
A cycle defines an ordering , but there is no distinguished beginning or end ; by making a cycle out of some elements with a distinguished extra element , we uniquely identify a beginning / end of the ordering on the original elements : a list !
> take 10 . labelled $ lists
[ 1,1,2,6,24,120,720,5040,40320,362880 ]
> take 10 . labelled $ oneHole cycles
[ 1,1,2,6,24,120,720,5040,40320,362880 ]
> generate lists ( [ 1..3 ] :: [ Int ] )
[ [ 1,2,3 ] , [ 1,3,2 ] , [ 2,1,3 ] , [ 2,3,1 ] , [ 3,1,2 ] , [ 3,2,1 ] ]
> generate ( oneHole cycles ) ( [ 1..3 ] :: [ Int ] )
[<* , 1,2,3>,<*,1,3,2>,<*,2,1,3>,<*,2,3,1>,<*,3,1,2>,<*,3,2,1 >]
Here ’s an example of differentiation in action .
In the species library , the function oneHole is provided as a synonym for differentiate .
The session above shows that there are the same number of labelled lists as labelled one - hole cycles : this is n’t surprising given the discussion above , and in fact , list is actually implemented as oneHole cycle .
Actually , this is a tiny lie , as the rest of the session shows : since lists are such a common combinatorial structure , there is a special case for them in the generation code .
But we can explicitly generate one - hole cycles as above ; it ’s easy to see that they are in one - to - one correspondence with the lists .
To finish off this post , a few exercises for you ( you can check your answers with the species library ) :
Describe the species .
Describe the species .
Describe the species .
Does differentiation distribute over addition ?
That is , is it true that for any species and ?
Give a combinatorial interpretation of this identity , or say why it does not hold .
Describe the species .
Describe the species ( i.e. the nth derivative of the species of cycles ) .

Many people seem genuinely baffled that western governments are hyping the arrival of a swine flu pandemic as if it ’s the greatest threat to humanity since the bubonic plague , despite the relatively low number of deaths from the virus , unaware that the pharmaceutical industry has been intimately joined at the hip with the state for decades .
Another illustration of that fact is the revelation that one of the UK government ’s top advisors on swine flu also happens to be a sitting board member of GlaxoSmithKline , the company selling dangerous and untested swine flu vaccines , as well as anti-viral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza , to the NHS .
“ Professor Sir Roy Anderson sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies ( Sage ) , a 20 - strong task force drawing up the action plan for the virus .
Yet he also holds a £ 116,000 - a- year post on the board of GlaxoSmithKline , ” reports the Daily Mail .
We also learn that Anderson was “ one of the first UK experts to call the outbreak a pandemic , ” and has been busy on radio and TV pushing the effectiveness of anti-virals to fight swine flu , without telling listeners that he was on the GSK payroll .
Anderson was also a key government advisor during the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak in Britain which led to the slaughter of over 6 million animals and the complete decimation of the farming industry .
Batches of swine flu vaccine destined for Europe are being fast - tracked through safety procedures and there will be no testing on humans whatsoever before millions of people , starting with children and pregnant women , are inoculated as part of mass vaccination programs .
[ efoods ]
Despite warnings from World Health Organization flu chief Dr Keiji Fukuda about the dangers of untested vaccines , GlaxoSmithKline and other pharmaceutical companies like Baxter , will begin shipping the vaccine to governments in Europe within two months .
Officials claim that the swine flu vaccine has similar ingredients to the avian flu vaccine and is therefore safe .
In that case , we better hope that the vaccine does not have the same ingredients as batches of Baxter ’s bird flu vaccine , which were actually contaminated with the live avian flu virus and shipped out to numerous European countries .
In addition , the swine flu vaccine will contain an ingredient known to cause debilitating diseases .
As we reported last week , the shots will include the ingredient squalene , which has been directly linked with cases of Gulf War Syndrome .
According to award - winning investigative journalist Gary Matsumoto , there ’s a “ close match between the squalene - induced diseases in animals and those observed in humans injected with this oil : rheumatoid arthritis , multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus . ”
“ There are now data in more than two dozen peer - reviewed scientific papers , from ten different laboratories in the US , Europe , Asia and Australia , documenting that squalene - based adjuvants can induce autoimmune diseases in animals … observed in mice , rats , guinea pigs and rabbits .
Sweden ’s Karolinska Institute has demonstrated that squalene alone can induce the animal version of rheumatoid arthritis .
The Polish Academy of Sciences has shown that in animals , squalene alone can produce catastrophic injury to the nervous system and the brain .
The University of Florida Medical School has shown that in animals , squalene alone can induce production of antibodies specifically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus , ” writes Matsumoto .
Micropaleontologist Dr. Viera Scheibner , who conducted research into the adverse effects of adjuvants in vaccines , wrote the following about squalene .
Squalene “ contributed to the cascade of reactions called “ Gulf War syndrome .
( GIs developed ) arthritis , fibromyalgia , lymphadenopathy , rashes , photosensitive rashes , malar rashes , chronic fatigue , chronic headaches , abnormal body hair loss , non-healing skin lesions , aphthous ulcers , dizziness , weakness , memory loss , seizures , mood changes , neuropsychiatric problems , anti-thyroid effects , anaemia , elevated ESR ( erythrocyte sedimentation rate ) , systemic lupus erythematosus , multiple sclerosis , ALS , Raynaud ’s phenomenon , Sjorgren ’s syndrome , chronic diarrhea , night sweats and low - grade fever . ”

ARCHIVES | SEARCH Silence Cyxymu Posted by Mikko @ 13:21 GMT
Last night we saw a massive attack on a Georgian blogger who goes by the name " Cyxymu " .
The attack included at least these components :
• DDoS attack against Cyxymu's Twitter account ( http://twitter.com/cyxymu)
• DDoS attack against Cyxymu's Youtube account ( http://www.youtube.com/cyxymu)
• DDoS attack against Cyxymu's Facebook account ( http://www.facebook.com/cyxymu)
• DDoS attack against Cyxymu's Livejournal account ( http://www.livejournal.com/cyxymu and http://cyxymu1.livejournal.com)
• DDoS attack against Cyxymu's Fotki account ( http://public.fotki.com/cyxymu/)
• An e-mail " Joe Job " campaign against Cyxymu
The effects of some of these attacks are still visible .
For example , Livejournal and Facebook are still not accepting connections to Cyxymu 's pages .
Here 's an example of what the Joe Job e-mails looked like .
They were not sent by Cyxymu although they look like it .
Launching DDoS attacks against services like Facebook is the equivalent of bombing a TV station because you do n't like one of the newscasters .
The amount of collateral damage is huge .
Million of users of Twitter , Livejournal , and Facebook have been experiencing problems because of this attack .
Whoever is behind this attack , they had significant bandwidth available .
Our best guess is that these attacks were done by nationalistic Russian hackers who wanted to silence a visible online opponent .
While doing that , they 've only managed to attract more attention to Cyxymu and his message .
Then again , Cyxymu himself simply comments in his Tweets that the attack was done by the Russian KGB .
We 're unlikely to ever know the truth .
Updated to add : Added info that Cyxymu's Fotki account was under attack as well .
Updated to add : See the comments section for commentary from a person who worked at a radio station that was bombed …
Building Rome in a Day
The Colosseum , 2,106 images , 819,242 points , Full resolution video
Entering the search term Rome on Flickr returns more than two million photographs .
This collection represents an increasingly complete photographic record of the city , capturing every popular site , facade , interior , fountain , sculpture , painting , cafe , and so forth .
It also offers us an unprecedented opportunity to richly capture , explore and study the three dimensional shape of the city .
In this project , we consider the problem of reconstructing entire cities from images harvested from the web .
Our aim is to build a parallel distributed system that downloads all the images associated with a city , say Rome , from Flickr.com .
After downloading , it matches these images to find common points and uses this information to compute the three dimensional structure of the city and the pose of the cameras that captured these images .
All this to be done in a day .
This poses new challenges for every stage of the 3D reconstruction pipeline , from image matching to large scale optimization .
The key contributions of our work is a new , parallel distributed matching system that can match massive collections of images very quickly and a new bundle adjust software that can solve extremely large non-linear least squares problems that are encountered in three dimensional reconstruction problems .
The project is a work in progress and over the next few months , we hope to have full scale results on data sets consisting of 1 million images and more .
Shown below are some preliminary results of running our system on three city data sets downloaded from Flickr : Dubrovnik , Croatia ; Rome and Venice , Italy .
The static images were rendered from viewpoints chosen using the Canonical Views algorithm .
Our current results are sparse point clouds , in collaboration with Yasutaka Furukawa we are also working on producing dense mesh models .
This research is part of Community Photo Collections project at the University of Washington GRAIL Lab .
which explores the use of large scale internet image collections for furthering research in computer vision and graphics .
Our work uses and builds upon a number of previous works , in particular , Photo Tourism and Skeletal Sets .

Rome
The data set consists of 150,000 images from Flickr.com associated with the tags " Rome " or " Roma " .
Matching and reconstruction took a total of 21 hours on a cluster with 496 compute cores .
Upon matching , the images organized themselves into a number of groups corresponding to the major landmarks in the city of Rome .
Amongst these clusters can be found the Colosseum , St. Peter 's Basilica , Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon .
One of the advantages of using community photo collections is the rich variety of view points that these photographs are taken from .
A striking example of this is the reconstruction of the interior of St. Peter 's Basilica shown below .

Venice
The Venice data set is the largest image collection that have experimented with up till now .
Matching on this data set took 27 hours , and the 3D reconstruction took 27 hours on 496 compute cores .
The matching process gave rise to three major components : the Grand Canal and San Marco square and Doge 's Palace .
The first two are illustrated with video fly throughs below .
The San Marco square is also our largest reconstruction till date with almost 14,000 images and over 4.5 million 3D points .

Dubrovnik
At the time of our experiments , there were only 58,000 images of Dubrovnik on Flickr .
For this city we were able to experiment with the entire collection .
Matching took only 5 hours on 352 compute cores .
The largest and most interesting component corresonds to the old city .
It is interesting that the reconstruction time for Dubrovnik is so much more than that for Rome .
The reason lies in how the data sets are structured .
The Rome data set is essentially a collection of landmarks which at large scale have a simple geometry and visibility structure .
The largest connected component in Dubrovnik on the other hand captures the entire old city .
With its narrow alley ways , complex visibility and widely varying view points , it is a much more complicated reconstruction problem , and this is reflected in the time it took to solve it .
Also worth noting is the fact that the reconstruction is not restricted to the city itself , as can be seen in the video below , it also contains the hills surrounding the city and part of Lokrum island which is south east of the city .

For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving with the 3d Battalion , 7th Marines , 1st Marine Division , in action against enemy Japanese forces on the island of Peleliu in the Palau group , 18 September 1944 .
Boldly taking the initiative when his platoon 's left flank advance was held up by the fire of Japanese troops concealed in strongly fortified positions , Pfc. Jackson unhesitatingly proceeded forward of our lines and , courageously defying the heavy barrages , charged a large pillbox housing approximately 35 enemy soldiers .
Pouring his automatic fire into the opening of the fixed installation to trap the occupying troops , he hurled white phosphorus grenades and explosive charges brought up by a fellow marine , demolishing the pillbox and killing all of the enemy .
Advancing alone under the continuous fire from other hostile emplacements , he employed similar means to smash two smaller positions in the immediate vicinity .
Determined to crush the entire pocket of resistance although harassed on all sides by the shattering blasts of Japanese weapons and covered only by small rifle parties , he stormed one gun position after another , dealing death and destruction to the savagely fighting enemy in his inexorable drive against the remaining defenses , and succeeded in wiping out a total of 12 pillboxes and 50 Japanese soldiers .
Stouthearted and indomitable despite the terrific odds , Pfc. Jackson resolutely maintained control of the platoon 's left flank movement throughout his valiant one - man assault and , by his cool decision and relentless fighting spirit during a critical situation , contributed essentially to the complete annihilation of the enemy in the southern sector of the island .
His gallant initiative and heroic conduct in the face of extreme peril reflect the highest credit upon Pfc. Jackson and the U.S. Naval Service .

Senator Ted Kennedy ’s death Tuesday night has deprived the nation of one of the most insightful and committed progressive politicians the country had .
Kennedy all along had opposed Bush ’s Iraq War , and saw clearly before most of the country the various scams used to get it up .
It is worth remembering that the narrative most of us now share on the catastrophes of Bush - Cheney foreign policy derives in important part from Kennedy ’s speeches .
Note , too , that Kennedy got virtually no time on network or cable television for his critiques of Bush while the Democrats were in the minority .
But CNN devoted half the day to covering John McCain ’s criticisms of Obama today .
A millionaire senator from Boston was too far left for the corporate media .
RIP .
He has left a heavy burden on the rest of us , to see that the US does get out of Iraq and also that 47 million uninsured are finally covered and not just left to die when they fall ill .
Kennedy is in some sense a martyr to the latter cause , and those who care deeply about the issue should carry on in his memory .
Here is a speech , delivered less than 9 months after the invasion of Iraq , in which Kennedy correctly lays out the ways in which Bush conned the country into it :
Senator Ted Kennedy , Speech on Iraq Policy , C - Span : Broadcast 01/14/04
“. . .
In these uncertain times , it is imperative that our leaders hold true to those founding ideals and protect the fundamental trust between the government and the people .
Nowhere is this trust more important than between the people and the President of the United States .
As the leader of our country and the voice of America to the world , our President has the obligation to lead and speak with truth and integrity if this nation is to continue to reap the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity .
The citizens of our democracy have a fundamental right to debate and even doubt the wisdom of a president ’s policies .
And the citizens of our democracy have a sacred obligation to sound the alarm and shed light on the policies of an Administration that is leading this country to a perilous place .
I believe that this Administration is indeed leading this country to a perilous place .
It has broken faith with the American people , aided and abetted by a Congressional majority willing to pursue ideology at any price , even the price of distorting the truth .
On issue after issue , they have moved brazenly to impose their agenda on America and on the world .
They have pursued their goals at the expense of urgent national and human needs and at the expense of the truth .
America deserves better .
The Administration and the majority in Congress have put the state of our union at risk , and they do not deserve another term in the White House or in control of Congress .
I do not make these statements lightly .
I make them as an American deeply concerned about the future of the Republic if the extremist policies of this Administration continue .
By far the most extreme and most dire example of this Administration ’s reckless pursuit of its single - minded ideology is in foreign policy .
In its arrogant disrespect for the United Nations and for other peoples in other lands , this Administration and this Congress have squandered the immense goodwill that other nations extended to our country after the terrorist attacks of September 11th .
And in the process , they made America a lesser and a less respected land .
Nowhere is the danger to our country and to our founding ideals more evident than in the decision to go to war in Iraq .
Former Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill has now revealed what many of us have long suspected .
Despite protestations to the contrary , the President and his senior aides began the march to war in Iraq in the earliest days of the Administration , long before the terrorists struck this nation on 9/11 .
The examination of the public record and of the statements of President Bush and his aides reveals that the debate about overthrowing Saddam began long before the beginning of this Administration .
Its roots began thirteen years ago , during the first Gulf War , when the first President Bush decided not to push on to Baghdad and oust Saddam .
President Bush and his National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft explained the reason for that decision in their 1997 book , A World Transformed .
They wrote the following : “ Trying to eliminate Saddam , extending the ground war into an occupation of Iraq , would have violated our guideline about not changing objectives in midstream .
. . and would have incurred incalculable human and political costs .
. .
We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and , in effect , rule Iraq .
The coalition would instantly have collapsed , the Arabs deserting it in anger and other allies pulling out as well .
Under those circumstances , there was no viable exit strategy we could see , violating another of our principles .
. .
Had we gone the invasion route , the United States could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land . ”
Those words are eerily descriptive of our current situation in Iraq .
During the first Gulf War , Paul Wolfowitz was a top advisor to then Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney , and he disagreed strongly with the decision by the first President Bush to stop the war after driving Saddam out of Kuwait .
After that war ended , Wolfowitz convened a Pentagon working group to make the case that regime change in Iraq could easily be achieved by military force .
The Wolfowitz group concluded that “ U.S. forces could win unilaterally or with the aid of a small group of a coalition of forces within 54 days of mid to very high intensity combat . ”
Saddam ’s attempted assassination of President Bush during a visit to Kuwait in 1993 added fuel to the debate .
After his tenure at the Pentagon , Wolfowitz became Dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and continued to criticize the decision not to end the reign of Saddam .
In 1994 he wrote : “ With hindsight , it does seem like a mistake to have announced , even before the war was over , that we would not go to Baghdad … ”
Wolfowitz ’s resolve to oust Saddam was unwavering .
In 1997 , he wrote , “ We will have to confront him sooner or later - and sooner would be better …Unfortunately , at this point , only the substantial use of military force could prove that the U.S. is serious and reverse the slow collapse of the international coalition . ”
The following year , Wolfowitz , Donald Rumsfeld and 16 others - 10 of whom are now serving in or officially advising the current Bush Administration - wrote President Clinton , urging him to use military force to remove Saddam .
They said , “ The only acceptable strategy is one that eliminates the possibility that Iraq will be able to use or threaten to use weapons of mass destruction .
In the near term , this means a willingness to undertake military action , as diplomacy is clearly failing .
In the long term , it means removing Saddam Hussein and his regime from power .
That now needs to become the aim of American foreign policy . ”
That was 1998 .
President Clinton was in office , and regime change in Iraq did become the policy of the Clinton Administration - but not by war .
As soon as the current President Bush took office in 2001 , he brought a group of conservatives with him , including Wolfowitz , Rumsfeld , and others , who had been outspoken advocates for most of the previous decade for the forcible removal of Saddam Hussein .
At first , President Bush was publicly silent on the issue .
But as Paul O’Neill has told us , the debate was alive and well .
I happen to know Paul O’Neill , and I have great respect for him .
I worked with him on key issues of job safety and health care when he was at ALCOA in the 1990’s .
He ’s a person of great integrity , intelligence , and vision , and he had impressive ideas for improving the quality of health care in the Pittsburgh area .
It is easy to understand why he was so concerned by what he heard about Iraq in the Bush Administration .
In his “ 60 Minutes ” interview last Sunday , O’Neill said that overthrowing Saddam was on the agenda from Day 1 of the new Administration .
O’Neill said , “ From the very beginning there was a conviction that Saddam Hussein was a bad person and that he needed to go …
It was all about finding a way to do it .
That was the tone of it .
The President was saying , “ Go find me a way to do this . ”
The agenda was clear : find a rationale to end Saddam ’s regime .
But there was resistance to military intervention by those who felt that the existing sanctions on Iraq should be strengthened .
Saddam had been contained and his military capabilities had been degraded by the Gulf War and years of U.N. sanctions and inspections .
At a press conference a month after the inauguration , Secretary of State Colin Powell said : “ We have kept him contained , kept him in his box . ”
The next day , Secretary Powell very clearly stated that Saddam “ has not developed any significant capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction … ”
Then , on September 11th , 2001 , terrorists attacked us and everything changed .
Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld immediately began to link Saddam Hussein to Al Qaeda and the attacks .
According to notes taken by an aide to Rumsfeld on September 11th , the very day of the attacks , the Secretary ordered the military to prepare a response to the attacks .
The notes quote Rumsfeld as saying that he wanted the best information fast , to judge whether the information was good enough to hit Saddam and not just Osama bin Laden .
“ Go massive , ” the notes quote him as saying .
“ Sweep it all up .
Things related and not . ”
The advocates of war in Iraq desperately sought to make the case that Saddam was linked to 9/11 and Al Qaeda , and that he was on the verge of acquiring a nuclear capability .
They created an Office of Special Projects in the Pentagon to analyze the intelligence for war .
They bypassed the traditional screening process and put pressure on intelligence officers to produce the desired intelligence and analysis .
As the world now knows , Saddam ’s connection to 9/11 was false .
Saddam was an evil dictator .
But he was never close to having a nuclear capability .
The Administration has found no arsenals of chemical or biological weapons .
It has found no persuasive connection to al - Qaeda .
All this should have been clear .
The Administration should not have looked at the facts with ideological blinders and with a mindless dedication to the results they wanted .
A recent report by the Carnegie Endowment concluded that Administration officials systematically misrepresented the threat from Iraq ’s nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons programs .
They also concluded that the intelligence community was unduly influenced by the policymakers ’ views and intimidating actions , such as Vice President Cheney ’s repeated visits to CIA headquarters and demands by officials for access to the raw intelligence from which the analysts were working .
The report also noted the unusual speed with which the National Intelligence Estimate was written and the high number of dissents in what is designed to be a consensus document .
In the immediate aftermath of 9/11 , President Bush himself made clear that his highest priority was finding Osama bin Laden .
At a press conference on September 17th , 2001 , he said that he wanted bin Laden “ dead or alive . ”
Three days later , in an address to a Joint Session of Congress , President Bush demanded of the Taliban : “ Deliver to the United States authorities all the leaders of al - Qaeda who hide in your land . ”
And Congress cheered .
On November 8th , the President told the country , “ I have called our military into action to hunt down the members of the al - Qaeda organization who murdered innocent Americans . ”
In doing that , he had the full support of Congress and the nation - and rightly so .
Soon after the war began in Afghanistan , however , the President started laying the groundwork in public to shift attention to Iraq .
In the Rose Garden on November 26th , he said : “ Afghanistan is still just the beginning . ”
Three days later , even before Hamid Karzai had been approved as interim Afghan President , Vice President Cheney publicly began to send signals about attacking Iraq .
On November 29th , he said “ I do n’t think it takes a genius to figure out that this guy [ Saddam Hussein ] is clearly … a significant potential problem for the region , for the United States , for everybody with interests in the area . ”
On December 12th , the Vice President elaborated further : “ If I were Saddam Hussein , I ’d be thinking very carefully about the future , and I ’d be looking very closely to see what happened to the Taliban in Afghanistan . ”
Prior to the terrorist attacks on September 11th , President Bush ’s approval rating was only 50 % .
But with his necessary and swift action in Afghanistan against the Taliban for harboring bin Laden and al - Qaeda , his approval soared to 86 % .
Soon , Karl Rove joined the public debate , and war with Iraq became all but certain .
At a meeting of the Republican National Committee in Los Angeles on January 19th , 2002 , Rove made clear that the war on terrorism could be used politically , and that Republicans , as he put it , could “ go to the country on this issue . ”
Ten days later , the deal was all but sealed .
In his State of the Union Address , President Bush broadened his policy on Afghanistan to other terrorist regimes .
He unveiled the “ Axis of Evil ” - Iraq , Iran , and North Korea .
Those three words forged the lock - step linkage between the Bush Administration ’s top political advisers and the Big Three of Cheney , Rumsfeld , and Wolfowitz .
We lost our previous clear focus on the most imminent threat to our national security - Osama bin Laden and the al - Qaeda terrorist network .
What did President Bush say about bin Laden in the State of the Union Address that day ?
Nothing .
What did he say about the Taliban ?
Nothing .
Nothing about bin Laden .
One fleeting reference about Al Qaeda .
Nothing about the Taliban in that State of the Union Address .
Barely four months had passed since the worst terrorist atrocity in American history .
Five bin Laden videotapes had been broadcast since September 11th , including one that was aired after bin Laden escaped at the battle of Tora Bora .
President Bush devoted 12 paragraphs in his State of the Union Address to Afghanistan , and 29 paragraphs to the global war on terrorism .
But he had nothing to say about Bin Laden or al - Qaeda .
Why not ?
Because of an extraordinary policy coup .
Cheney , Rumsfeld , and Wolfowitz - the Axis of War - had prevailed .
The President was changing the subject to Iraq .
In the months that followed , Administration officials began to draw up the war plan and develop a plausible rationale for the war .
Richard Haass , Director of Policy Planning at the Department State during this period , said recently that “ the agenda was not whether Iraq , but how . ”
Haass said the actual decision to go to war had been made in July 2002 .
He had questioned the wisdom of war with Iraq at that time , but National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice told him , “ Essentially … that decision ’s been made .
Do n’t waste your breath . ”
It was Vice President Cheney who outlined to the country the case against Iraq that he had undoubtedly been making to President Bush all along .
On August 26 , 2002 , in an address to the Veterans of Foreign Wars , the Vice President argued against UN inspections in Iraq and announced that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction , meaning chemical and biological weapons .
He also said : “ We now know that Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire nuclear weapons .
Among other sources , we ’ve gotten this from the firsthand testimony of defectors , including Saddam ’s own son- in - law , who was subsequently murdered at Saddam ’s direction .
Many of us are convinced that Saddam will acquire nuclear weapons fairly soon . ”
Those were Cheney ’s words .
It is now plain what was happening :
The drumbeat for war was sounding , and it drowned out those who believed that Iraq posed no imminent threat .
On August 29th , just two days after Cheney ’s speech , President Bush signed off on the war plan .
On September 12th , the President addressed the United Nations and said : “ Iraq likely maintains stockpiles of VX , mustard , and other chemical agents and has made several attempts to buy high - strength aluminum tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon . ”
He told the United Nations that Iraq would be able to build a nuclear weapon “ within a year , ” if Saddam acquired nuclear material .
President Bush was focusing on Iraq and Saddam , even though one year after the attack on our country , bin Laden was still nowhere to be found .
A sixth bin Laden tape had been aired , and news reports of the time revealed new military threats in Afghanistan .
U.S. and Afghan military and intelligence officials were quoted as saying that al - Qaeda had established two main bases inside Pakistan .
An Afghan military intelligence chief said : “ al - Qaeda has regrouped , together with the Taliban , Kashmiri militants , and other radical Islamic parties , and they are just waiting for the command to start operations . ”
Despite the obvious al - Qaeda threat in Afghanistan , the White House had now made Iraq our highest national security priority .
The steamroller of war was moving into high gear .
The politics of the timing is obvious .
September 2002 .
The hotly contested 2002 election campaigns were entering the home stretch .
Control of Congress was clearly at stake .
Republicans were still furious over the conversion of Senator Jim Jeffords that had cost them control of the Senate in 2001 .
Election politics prevailed , but they should not have prevailed over foreign policy and national security .
The decision on Iraq could have been announced earlier .
Why time it for September ?
As White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card explained on September 7th , “ From a marketing point of view , you do n’t introduce new products in August . ”
That was the bottom line .
War in Iraq was a war of choice , not a war of necessity .
It was a product they were methodically rolling out .
There was no imminent threat , no immediate national security imperative , and no compelling reason for war .
In public , the Administration continued to deny that the President had made the decision to actually go to war .
But the election timetable was clearly driving the marketing of the product .
The Administration insisted that Congress vote to authorize the war before it adjourned for the November elections .
Why ?
Because the debate in Congress would distract attention from the troubled economy and the troubled effort to capture bin Laden .
The strategy was to focus on Iraq , and do so in a way that would divide the Congress .
And it worked .
To keep the pressure on , President Bush spoke in Cincinnati on Iraq ’s nuclear weapons program , just three days before the Congressional vote .
He emphasized the ties between Iraq and al - Qaeda .
He emphasized Saddam ’s access to weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons .
He said , “ If the Iraqi regime is able to produce or steal an amount of highly enriched uranium a little larger than a single softball , it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year .
And if we allow that to happen , a terrible line would be crossed … Saddam Hussein would be in a position to pass nuclear technology to terrorists . ”
The scare tactics worked .
Congress voted to authorize the use of force in October 2002 .
Republicans voted almost unanimously for war , and kept control of the House in the election in November .
Democrats were deeply divided and lost their majority in the Senate .
The Iraq card had been played successfully .
The White House now had control of both houses of Congress as well .
As 2003 began , many in the military and foreign policy communities urged against a rush to war .
United Nations weapons inspectors were in Iraq , searching for weapons of mass destruction .
Saddam appeared to be contained .
There was no evidence that Iraq had been involved in the attacks on September 11th .
Many insisted that bin Laden and Al Qaeda and North Korea were greater threats , but their concerns were dismissed out of hand .
Cheney , Rumsfeld , and Wolfowitz insisted that Iraq was the issue and that war against Iraq was the only option , with or without international support .
They convinced the President that the war would be brief , that American forces would be welcomed as liberators , not occupiers , and that ample intelligence was available to justify going to war .
The gross abuse of intelligence was on full display in the President ’s State of Union address last January , when he spoke the now infamous 16 words - “ The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa . ”
The President did not say that U.S. intelligence agencies agreed with this assessment .
He simply and deviously said , “ the British government has learned . ”
As we all now know , that allegation was false .
It had already been debunked a year earlier by the U.S. intelligence community .
Yet it was included in the President ’s State of the Union Address .
Has any other State of the Union Address ever been so disgraced by such blatant falsehood ?
In March 2003 , on the basis , of a grossly exaggerated threat and grossly inadequate post - war planning , and with little international support , the United States invaded Iraq when we clearly should not have done so .
. . ”

But secondly , a 60 percent reversal rate is actually below average based on the Washington Times ' criteria .
According to MediaMatters.org , the Supreme Court typically reverses about 75 percent of circuit court decisions that it chooses to rule upon .
The reason that the reversal rate is so high , of course , is that the Supreme Court has a lot of discretion about which cases it chooses to review and rule upon , and is generally not going to be inclined to overturn law dictated by a lower court unless the legal reasoning is substantially questionable and has a strong chance of reversal .
The better metric would probably be the number of decisions that the Supreme Court overturned out of all of Sotomayor 's majority opinions — whether the Court elected to review them in detail or not .
Many of those annoying prerecorded telemarketing calls will be history starting Sept.

The Federal Trade Commission said Thursday that it is banning these " robocalls " to consumers , unless the telemarketer has written permission from a customer that he or she wants to receive these calls .
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz says American consumers have made it " crystal clear that few things annoy them more than the billions of commercial telemarketing robocalls they receive every year . "
Violaters will face penalties of up to $ 16,000 per call .
Exceptions include calls that deliver information such as flight cancellations and those from debt collectors , politicians , charities , banks , phone companies and others .

Mr Murdoch has warned of possible job losses News Corp is set to start charging online customers for news content across all its websites .
The media giant is looking for additional revenue streams after announcing big losses .
The company lost $ 3.4bn ( £ 2 bn ) in the year to the end of June , which chief executive Rupert Murdoch said had been " the most difficult in recent history " .
News Corp owns the Times and Sun newspapers in the UK and the New York Post and Wall Street Journal in the US .
' Revolution '
We intend to charge for all our news websites .
I believe that if we are successful , we will be followed by other media
Rupert Murdoch , chief executive , News Corp Mr Murdoch said he was " satisfied " that the company could produce " significant revenues from the sale of digital delivery of newspaper content " .
" The digital revolution has opened many new and inexpensive methods of distribution , " he added .
" But it has not made content free .
Accordingly , we intend to charge for all our news websites .
I believe that if we are successful , we will be followed by other media .
" Quality journalism is not cheap , and an industry that gives away its content is simply cannibalising its ability to produce good reporting , " he said .
In order to stop readers from moving to the huge number of free news websites , Mr Murdoch said News Corp would simply make its content " better and differentiate it from other people " .
HAVE YOUR SAY
What a ridiculous idea .
Why would anyone pay for news from the web ?
Paul , Lichfield Charging options
Newspapers across the world are considering the best way to make money from the internet , particularly in a time of falling advertising revenues .
The risk is that charges may alienate readers who have become used to free content and deter advertisers .
When the New York Times abandoned its subscription model - visits to its website jumped from about 12 million per day to almost 20 million per day , said the former general manager of NYTimes.com , Vivian Schiller .
Ms Schiller , now chief executive at National Public Radio ( NPR ) in the US , told the BBC's PM programme that the higher audience had " more value than the limited number of people who were prepared to pay for content " .
However last month the paper said it was studying different ways to charge for access to its website .
The Financial Times and Wall Street Journal already charge readers .
Different news organisations have tried alternative charging structures - either pay - per-article or a monthly subscription fee .
In its recent earnings report , the Financial Times said it was seeking to rely less on advertising revenue and more on subscriptions
Will readers pay for news ?
The FT allows users to access a certain number of stories for nothing each month ; if they want to access more than that , they need to subscribe .
' Well - differentiated content '
Some analysts say that financial newspapers are better placed to charge readers for online content , because of the specialist nature of the information they provide .
Alfonso Marone , analyst and partner at Value Partners Group , told the BBC that the model could work " for well - known publications - for must - read , must - know content .
The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times are already charging for content , for example , " he said .
He believes that a micro-charging structure , where readers pay just 5 p or 10 p to access an article , might work .
" This is less than the price of an SMS [ text message ] , " he argued .
" This is definitely the way the [ newspaper ] industry is going , " he concluded .
Sly Bailey , the chief executive of Trinity Mirror , said that while a " paid online model already exists for unique , high value and well - differentiated content " , she doubted " that it is possible for publishers to charge for general news content when the same content is given away for free by the BBC , Google News and others " .
" I do n't think this is about what Rupert Murdoch wants .
It 's about what the consumer is prepared to pay for .
And why would you pay when you can get the same thing somewhere else for free ? " she said .
Recovery News Corp has suffered from falling advertising revenues .
" Our financial performance clearly reflects the weak economic environment that we confronted throughout the year , " Mr Murdoch said .
He did , however , say that there were signs of life in the advertising market .
" I think the worst may be behind us , but there are no clear signs yet of a fast economic recovery . "
He added that News Corp was " particularly well - placed for the coming recovery " .
New Corp 's $ 3.4bn loss was due to $ 8.9bn in write - downs already announced , compared with a $ 5.4bn profit a year earlier .
Revenues at the media giant , which owns BSkyB and 20th Century Fox , fell 7.8 % .
In the fourth quarter of its financial year , News Corp lost $ 203 m compared with a net profit of $ 1.1 bn in the same period a year ago .

In a deal scheduled to be finalized tomorrow during Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s visit to London , Israel will accept a resumption of peace talks with the Palestinian Authority .
The deal came as a result of President Obama caving to virtually every demand made by Israel .
In essence , the Israeli government will freeze new construction in the West Bank , potentially for as much as a year , while continuing ongoing construction projects .
East Jerusalem will reportedly not be part of this freeze .
In return , the United States will reportedly back massive new sanctions against the Iranian government and will stop criticizing the growth of the settlements .
The State Department had confirmed yesterday that they were “ close ” to reaching a deal with Israel , but said that “ the Arabs are more difficult to pin down . ”
Since all the Palestinians have really asked for is a permanent halt to settlement constructions and the US has apparently abandoned that request , its going to be a difficult road to a deal .
The ability to get those sanctions , which would in essence cut Iran entirely out of the international oil and gas market and cripple their economy , passed in the United Nations is likewise in serious doubt .
Both Russia and China have previously objected to the most harsh sanctions , and this push is likely to be no different .

Even billionaires need to budget .
That 's the message delivered to Oracle Corp. founder Larry Ellison , one of the world 's richest men , by his personal financial adviser in a series of e-mails obtained by The Chronicle .
In the e-mails , which stem from a recent shareholder lawsuit against the technology titan , Ellison 's accountant , Philip Simon , warns the billionaire about his habitual runaway spending .
Like a concerned parent , Simon chides Ellison for overextending himself on a new yacht , on his America 's Cup team and on his new houses in Woodside and Malibu .
" I 'm worried , Larry ... " Simon wrote to Ellison in a 2002 e-mail .
" I think it 's imperative that we start to budget and plan . "
According to documents unsealed by a judge in the shareholder lawsuit , Ellison habitually pushes his credit limit of more than a billion dollars to its maximum to finance his yachts and homes .
And that 's not even counting some $ 20 million a year he burns through in miscellaneous lifestyle expenses .
Of course , there 's no question that Ellison , 62 , is good for the loans .
Forbes ' famous list of wealthy people says the maverick entrepreneur is the nation 's fifth richest individual , worth $ 17 billion , mostly in Oracle stock .
Still , Ellison 's spending and his reluctance to part with Oracle shares have caused his financial adviser fits of anxiety , the documents show .
Simon expressed concern that Ellison would follow in the footsteps of wealthy entrepreneurs who ran into hard times in their personal or business finances , people like Carl 's Jr. founder Carl Karcher and Computer Associates founder Charles Wang .
Simon went so far as to write , " I do n't want you to end up like ... Bernie Ebbers , and the countless others . "
Ebbers , the former WorldCom CEO , famously borrowed heavily against his own stock holdings , ultimately resigning in disgrace before being charged with and convicted of securities fraud .
Ebbers is serving 25 years in federal prison .
The lawsuit that revealed these communications was a shareholder action that accused Ellison of acting on insider information when he sold more than 29 million Oracles shares in January 2001 , just weeks before Oracle issued a disappointing earnings statement and the stock plummeted .
Ellison generated nearly $ 900 million with that sale , making his 2001 income more than any other executive had ever taken in during a single year , the Washington , D.C. , think tank Institute for Policy Studies disclosed .
The suit was settled in November in San Mateo Superior Court -- Ellison agreed to donate $ 100 million to charity and pay $ 22 million to lawyers out of his own pocket -- but the settlement is being appealed by a shareholder .
In court depositions , Ellison argued that he had sold the shares not because he thought Oracle 's stock would soon decline in price but because Simon had been pressuring him to unload some of his vast company holdings .
For instance , in a 2000 e-mail , Simon urged Ellison to " take some money off the table " because the adviser said he had grown increasingly concerned .
Simon did not return an e-mail from The Chronicle regarding this story .
An Oracle spokesman offered no comment .
The personal e-mails and other documents originally were filed under seal as confidential , but San Mateo County Superior Court Judge John Schwartz unsealed them in November .
A holding pattern
So how could someone with $ 17 billion cause his accountant to worry about running low on cash ?
Ellison , who identifies strongly with the company he founded in 1977 , has been famously unwilling to sell Oracle shares over the years .
Instead of selling them , he has financed his lavish lifestyle -- the 23 - acre Japanese - style estate in Woodside , the yachts , the airplanes , the Armani suits -- by borrowing against his stock .
" I know this e-mail may / will depress you , " Simon wrote in a 2002 note about diversification .
" However , I believe it 's my job to address issues you 'd prefer not to confront .
You told me years ago that it 's OK to raise the ' diversification issue ' with you quarterly .
...
Well , I 'm doing so .
View this as a call to arms . "
This was n't the first time Simon had sounded the alarm .
In 2001 , Ellison 's spending was on an upswing , and his debt level was increasing rapidly , Simon said in a 2004 deposition .
Simon tried to explain to Ellison the seriousness of his debt , saying , " We have a freight train going down a track , hitting a debt wall , " he said in the deposition .
Ellison apparently did n't view his way of operating as risky .
Court documents quote him as pointing out that his net worth was always at least 10 times his debt .
But financial experts agree that borrowing against stock holdings is n't generally accepted as a good way to operate .
" If you were to look in the textbook for how a financial plan should work , this would be in chapter one under , ' Never do this , ' " said Cynthia Harrington , a former money manager who now writes about finance for journals and magazines .
The danger is that if Oracle 's stock value drops steeply , the banks could call in their loans , forcing Ellison to sell masses of stock at bargain - basement prices to cover them .
Ellison has already found himself facing a situation like that .
In 1990 , Oracle ran into hard times , and its stock fell to $ 5 a share , causing big cash flow problems , recalls Nicola Miner , the daughter of Oracle co-founder Bob Miner , in the biography , " The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison , " by Mike Wilson .
( The famous subtitle to the book is : " God does n't think he 's Larry Ellison . " )
At that time , Ellison managed to avoid having to sell his Oracle shares cheaply by selling nearly $ 3 million worth of shares he owned in another company , Cadence Design Systems , and by arranging a line of credit with securities firm Morgan Stanley .
Then again , Ellison owns so much stock that the value would have to decline pretty severely before banks would ever consider calling in his loans , Harrington said .
Simon 's comparison to WorldCom founder Ebbers is apt , though certainly not in a criminal sense .
Ebbers , too , financed lavish spending by borrowing against his WorldCom shares .
When they declined in price and his loans were called in , he turned to borrowing heavily from the company itself , and when he resigned in 2002 , shortly before Simon wrote the e-mail mentioning him , he owed WorldCom $ 408 million .
Ellison , by contrast , has not borrowed from Oracle but from a number of banks .
As risky as it can be , Santa Clara University finance Professor Meir Statman said it is not uncommon for senior executives to borrow against their stock to avoid parting with it .
Statman studies behavioral finance , which examines how people often make financial moves based on emotional perceptions instead of rationally following the path that maximizes income .
" It is really a sense of , ' I know this company better than others do , ' and , second , ' The entire world is not appreciating my company as it should be appreciated , ' " Statman said .
Indeed , even when Simon persuaded Ellison to sell shares of Oracle in 2001 , Ellison set a price floor of $ 30 , below which he felt the stock would be undervalued .
Oracle shares fell to $ 16.88 in March of that year after Oracle warned that its third - quarter profit would not meet market expectations .
Big risk , bigger spending
Oracle and other tech companies were headed for further declines .
This is something Simon , if not Ellison , saw coming .
As the stock market ran to a fever pitch in 2000 , Ellison 's undiversified portfolio increasingly worried Simon .
" Query -- have you seen the reviews on Robert Shiller 's new book ' Irrational Exuberance ? ' " Simon wrote in a March 29 , 2000 , e-mail urging Ellison to start a sales program that would divest him of 0.5 percent of his Oracle stock each quarter .
As usual , that did n't result in a big change in Ellison 's behavior .
The CEO finally did start a regular diversification program , but not until 2004 .
In his most recent sale through this plan , Ellison sold more than a quarter of a billion dollars worth of stock earlier this month .
Getting back to the scary days of 2000 , when the tech stock market was imploding , a list of Ellison 's debts as of July 13 , 2000 , showed that he owed $ 1.022 billion to five banks : JP Morgan , Bankers Trust , CMB , Merrill Lynch and UBS .
At that time , those loans came from credit lines that had a combined limit of $ 1.35 billion , putting Ellison a mere $ 328 million from maxing out .
By 2001 , when Ellison made the stock sales that triggered the lawsuit , that debt was up to $ 1.22 billion .
At the bottom of a document that detailed Ellison 's 2000 debt load , Simon had scrawled a rough accounting of Ellison 's lavish spending , according to deposition testimony :
"1) Life Style -- annual $ 20 m
2 ) Interest Accrual -- annual $ 75 m
3 ) Villa in Japan -- $ 25 m
4 ) New Yacht -- $ 194 m -- over 3 yrs
5 ) America's Cup -- $ 80 m -- over 3 yrs
6 ) UAD -- 12 m over 3 yrs . "
It 's not clear what UAD refers to .
Since this rough budget , Ellison has reportedly spent $ 200 million building a Japanese - style estate in Woodside , which includes a reproduction of a 17th - century Kyoto teahouse .
He has also bought multiple properties in Malibu -- $ 180 million worth , by one report .
Where does it all go ?
Ellison 's charitable giving also caught his accountant 's eye .
Although Ellison 's generosity to charity does not rival that of richest American Bill Gates , Ellison 's giving seemed to give Simon ulcers , as well .
In the 2002 e-mail , Simon frets that the Ellison Medical Foundation 's leaders believed Ellison would support increasing its budget to $ 100 million a year from $ 35 million annually .
" $ 100 million is a lot of money ... " Simon wrote .
" There 's nothing wrong with keeping the ( foundation ) budget at $ 35 M / year ... or even reducing it in a sensible manner . "
And when Oracle executive Safra Catz mentioned in a 2000 e-mail that Ellison might want to donate $ 1 billion worth of expiring stock options to charity , Simon seemed shaken .
" I had no idea that Larry was even considering donating $ 1.0 bn to charity .
Such a large amount . "
When asked in a deposition about considering a $ 1 billion gift , Ellison said he vaguely remembered discussing this with Catz , but nothing came of it .
The documents obtained by The Chronicle certainly show that Ellison did not break any laws , but some experts say they are a symptom of an economy with larger and larger gaps between haves and have - nots .
Sarah Anderson , director of the global economy project at the Institute for Policy Studies , said the details of Ellison 's spending shows " how different these peoples ' realities are .
You have to wonder how much they can connect with the people who work for them and the people they 're serving with their business . "
Early warning
Larry Ellison 's financial adviser , Philip Simon , encouraged the Oracle founder to sell his company 's shares when the stock market got soft in March of 2000 .
Simon wrote March 29 , 2000 :
" Dear Larry . ... "
" I 'm getting increasingly concerned about stock market valuations ( query -- have you seen the reviews on Robert Shiller 's new book " Irrational Exuberance ? " ) -- and believe this would be a good time to take some money off the table .
... I 'd just like to start cashing out . "
High anxiety
In an e-mail to Ellison dated May 3 , 2002 , Simon expresses grave concerns about the Oracle founder 's spending .
" I 'm worried , Larry .
... I know you view me as a pessimist .
Maybe you 're right , though I would disagree .
Nonetheless , I think it 's imperative that we start to budget and plan .
New purchases should be kept to a minimum .
We need to establish and execute on a diversification game plan , to eliminate ( yes , eliminate ) all debt and build up a significant , conservatively structured , liquid investment portfolio .
If this means sacrificing 30 % of your current holdings in Oracle , so be it .
With stock options and Oracle 's share repurchases , your ownership percentage has been increasing somewhat over the last year or two . "
" I do not want you to end up like Carl Karcher , Wang , Bernie Ebbers , and the countless others .
Yes , Oracle 's a different company ; no debt , real cash earnings , clean accounting .
But , when the pendulum swings the other way , it can overshoot .
PE multiples are driven by market ( or should I say , mob ) psychology .
There 's no science or logic in the short or medium term . "
" I know you do n't like to discuss this .
I know this e-mail may / will depress you .
However , I believe it's my job to address issues you 'd prefer not to confront .
You told me years ago that it 's OK to raise the ' diversification issue ' with you quarterly .
Well , I 'm doing so .
View this as a call to arms . "
